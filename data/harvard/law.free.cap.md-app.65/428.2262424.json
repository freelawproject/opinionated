Howard, a Christmas tree salesman, who is white, was shot four times during a robbery. He identified Derrik O\u2019Brien Holmes, appellant, a black professional boxer and his former assistant, as his assailant. Appellant was arrested and charged in a seven count indictment with, among other offenses, assault with intent to murder (Count 1), attempted murder (Count 2), robbery with a deadly weapon (Count 4) and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (Count 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Trial proceeded before a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. After all evidence had been presented, the State nolle prossed Count 1, assault with intent to murder. Thus, that count was not submitted to the jury for decision. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of attempted first degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and use of a handgun. Having been sentenced to life imprisonment with all but thirty-five years suspended, for attempted first degree murder and to concurrent sentences for the remaining convicted counts, appellant appeals, directing our attention to two assignments of alleged error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">1. The Court\u2019s exclusion of jury <em>voir dire </em>questions requested by him deprived him of a fair trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">2. The sentence that was imposed for the conviction of attempted murder was illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Appellant submitted 54 questions which he requested the trial judge to propound to the jury panel on its <em>voir dire. </em>Two of these questions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> related to the existence of racial prejudice and seven<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> related to the existence of prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>arising because of appellant\u2019s occupation as a boxer. No questions were propounded as to possible racial prejudice. Notwithstanding his failure to object or except to this omission, appellant asserts on appeal that the court\u2019s \u201cfailure to make at least some inquiry directly as to the existence of ethnic/racial prejudice\u201d constitutes reversible error. Although the trial judge propounded a question regarding possible prejudice because of occupation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant, being concerned that it was not \u201celaborated upon,\u201d sought unsuccessfully to have the trial judge ask the question in more detail. He urges here that the trial judge\u2019s failure to do so was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It is well settled in Maryland that interrogation of venireman with respect to racial prejudice is required on request,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(1) where racial prejudice may be a factor because of the facts of the case, but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>(2) no specific question or procedure is compelled so long as the \u201cessence\u201d of the information sought as to prejudice is inquired into.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Thornton v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 205, 214, 355 A.2d 767 (1976). <em>See also Brown v. State, </em>220 Md. 29, 150 A.2d 895 (1959); <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 165 A.2d 889 (1960); <em>Humphreys v. State, </em>227 Md. 115, 175 A.2d 777 (1961); <em>Smith &amp; Nelson v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 130, 277 A.2d 622 (1971); <em>Tunstall &amp; Alton v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 723, 280 A.2d 275 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Illustrative of the latter point is <em>Contee. </em>There, all of the defendant\u2019s submitted <em>voir dire </em>questions were improper \u201cin that none was reasonably calculated to elicit or ascertain such bias or prejudice as would disqualify a prospective juror from rendering a fair and impartial verdict on the law and the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[223 Md.] at 580, 165 A.2d 889. Noting that the court \u201cwas fully apprised of the essence of what the defendant was seeking, [yet] failed to ask on its own motion, as it should have done, a proper question designed to ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification on account of racial bias or prejudice,\u201d the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201c... where, as here, a defendant is denied the opportunity of submitting or requesting proper questions relating to racial bias or prejudice to be propounded by the court to prospective jurors on <em>voir dire, </em>such denial constitutes reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\"><em>Id. </em>223 Md. at 581, 165 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Concerning the requirement that racial prejudice be a factor in the case, we acknowledge that simply because the victim of the crime is white and the defendant is black does not <em>constitutionally </em>mandate that veniremen be questioned specifically about racial prejudice. <em>Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1973). There, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>state criminal trial for various crimes perpetrated against a white security guard, Ross, a black, sought to have the court propound to the veniremen a question directed at racial prejudice. The court refused, finding that no purpose would be served by asking such a question. The Supreme Court agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">The Constitution does not always entitle a defendant to have questions posed during <em>voir dire </em>specifically directed to matters that conceivably might prejudice veniremen against him. <em>Ham [v. South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524, 527-528, 93 S.Ct. 848, 850-851, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973)]. <em>Voir dire </em>\u201cis conducted under the supervision of the court, and a great deal must, of necessity, be left to its sound discretion.\u201d <em>Connors v. United States, </em>158 U.S. 408, 413, [15 S.Ct. 951, 953, 39 L.Ed. 1033] (1895); <em>see Ham, supra, </em>[409 U.S.] at 527-528, 93 S.Ct. at 850-851]; <em>Aldridge v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 308, 310 [51 S.Ct. 470, 471, 75 L.Ed. 1054] (1931). This is so because the \u201cdetermination of impartiality, in which demeanor plays such an important part, is particularly within the province of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 733 [83 S.Ct. 1417, 1423, 10 L.Ed.2d 723] (1963) (Clark, J., dissenting). Thus, the State\u2019s obligation to the defendant to impanel an impartial jury generally can be satisfied by less than an inquiry into a specific prejudice feared by the defendant. <em>Ham, supra. </em>[409 U.S.] 527-528 [93 S.Ct. 850-851],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 594-95, 96 S.Ct. at 1020-21. (footnote omitted). The Court went on to recognize, as it had in <em>Ham, supra </em>\u201cthat some cases may present circumstances in which an impermissible threat to a fair trial guaranteed by due process is posed by a trial court\u2019s refusal to question prospective jurors specifically about racial prejudice during <em>voir dire\u201d. Id. </em>at 595, 96 S.Ct. at 1021. Such factors in <em>Ham </em>were: (1) the defendant was a well-known civil rights activist and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>his defense was that he had been framed for his civil rights activities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Thus it is that Maryland\u2019s requirements relating to <em>voir dire </em>on racial prejudice appear to be consistent with the constitutional mandate explicated by <em>Ristaino. </em>Both hold \u201cthat whatever the ethnic background of the accused, he or she is not entitled to promiscuously probe for racial prejudice absent circumstances in the case warranting such inquiry.\u201d <em>Thornton, </em>31 Md.App. at 216, 355 A.2d 767. But the circumstances which warrant the inquiry need not be identical. The Supreme Court recognized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Although we hold that <em>voir dire </em>questioning directed to racial prejudice was not constitutionally required the wiser course generally is to propound appropriate questions designed to identify racial prejudice if requested by the defendant,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avc\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cThe States ... are free to allow or require questions not demanded by the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"><em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 597, n. 9, 96 S.Ct. at 1022, n. 9. The Court of Appeals recognized that this is so in <em>Brown, supra. See Thornton, </em>31 Md.App. at 214, 355 A.2d 767, where we said, \u201c... had the Court of Appeals considered <em>Aldridge binding </em>under the Fourteenth Amendment, there would have been little need to cite authority from the State of Connecticut to bolster its holding in <em>Brown.\u201d </em>(emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">We turn now to a consideration of the circumstances which have been found to require <em>voir dire </em>questions on racial bias in Maryland. In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant, who was black, shot and killed a white police officer. Without discussing any specific factors for doing so, but relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>State v. Higgs, </em>143 Conn. 138, 120 A.2d 152 (1956), the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he refusal to ask any questions as to the bias or prejudice which jurors might have as to a Negro, and as to whether the jury could give the defendant as fair and impartial a trial as they could a white man, falls into a different category [than questions regarding pre-trial publicity and jury connection with counsel] requiring more consideration.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>220 Md. at 34, 150 A.2d 895. One of the portions of the <em>Higgs </em>decision quoted by the Court was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cWe cannot be blind to the fact that there may still be some who are biased against the Negro race and would be more easily convinced of a Negro\u2019s guilt ... than they would of a white man\u2019s guilt. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cSo long as race prejudice exists, even in a relatively few persons, there is a substantial chance that one of those few will appear in court as a venireman. Consequently, the fact that most people in the state are not prejudiced against Negroes is not of controlling importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Higgs, </em>120 A.2d at 154-55. In <em>Contee, </em>the black defendant was accused of raping a white woman. Again, the Court did not focus upon any specific factors as rendering this case one in which the veniremen should be <em>voir dired </em>as to racial bias. It did suggest, however, that the rape of a white woman by a black man was likely to cause \u201csome racial feelings in the community where it is to be tried.\u201d 223 Md. at 580, 165 A.2d 889. Similarly, aside from the race of the victim and the defendant and the nature of the charge, again the rape of a white woman by a black man, <em>Humphreys, supra, </em>provides no additional insight.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The cases from this Court have provided assistance, albeit limited, in determining what special circumstances would warrant <em>voir dire </em>inquiry into racial bias. In <em>Smith and Nelson, </em>an armed robbery case, in which we found reversible error because the court refused to ask the jury panel, \u201c[w]ould the fact that the accused is a Negro or black, affect the ability to pass fairly on the innocence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>accused?\u201d, we specifically declined to accept geographical location in the State as a factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><em>Tunstall and Alton </em>was also an armed robbery case. Kelying on <em>Smith and Nelson, </em>we found that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to cover in the <em>voir dire </em>the subject of racial prejudice. Where, however, the defendant, the victim, and the witnesses in the case were of the same race, we found that \u201cthere was no possibility that racial bias would influence the outcome____\u201d <em>Thornton, </em>31 Md.App. at 217, 355 A.2d 767. Although recognizing in <em>Thornton </em>that special circumstances warranting <em>voir dire </em>as to racial bias must exist before such examination is mandated, we never clearly defined of what these circumstances consist.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Even when the circumstances warrant inquiry into the racial bias of the veniremen, not all questions submitted by a defendant on the subject need be asked, <em>Humphreys, </em>227 Md. at 118-121, 175 A.2d 777; nor must a specific question be asked if a general one fairly covers the subject. <em>Glaros v. State, </em>223 Md. 272, 276, 164 A.2d 461 (1960) (\u201cWe think the general question as to bias against any race, creed or nationality eliminated the need to ask the specific question as to possible prejudice against a Greek\u201d). All that is required is, when the issue is properly presented, \u201cthe essence of the information sought by the appellant\u201d must be elicited from the jury panel. <em>Brown, </em>220 Md. at 36, 150 A.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> Our review of the cases causes us to conclude that, in a criminal case, prejudice may be a factor because of the facts of the case when the complainant and the witnesses for the State<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are of a different race than the defendant, and the crime involves victimization of another person and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the use of violence. Therefore, the issue of racial prejudice was fairly generated in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court have recognized the necessity of <em>voir diring </em>a jury panel as to racial bias. <em>Brown, </em>220 Md. at 36, 150 A.2d 895. (\u201cUnless bias is inquired into beforehand, its existence ordinarily will not become known since the verdict cannot be impeached.\u201d), <em>Aldridge v. U.S., </em>283 U.S. 308, 314, 51 S.Ct. 470, 473, 75 L.Ed. 1054 (1931) (\u201c[W]e do not think that it can be said that the possibility of [racial] prejudice is so remote as to justify the risk in forbidding the inquiry. And this risk becomes most grave when the issue is of life or death.\u201d) <em>See also Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 597-98, nn. 9 &amp; 10, 96 S.Ct. at 1022 nn. 9 &amp; 10, in which the Supreme Court, discussing its holding that the Constitution did not require the inquiry, observed that \u201cunder our supervisory power we would have required [an inquiry into racial bias] ... of a federal court faced with the circumstances here,\u201d and that \u201c... the actual result in <em>Aldridge </em>should be recognized as an exercise of our supervisory power over federal courts.\u201d Consequently, questions pertinent thereto when properly presented should have been asked on <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The State appears not to dispute that inquiry into racial prejudice should have been made; rather, it contends, relying on <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 468 A.2d 45 (1983) and <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 481 A.2d 201 (1984) that appellant waived the error when, not having objected or excepted to the court\u2019s failure to so inquire, he expressed satisfaction with the jury impaneled. <em>Calhoun </em>and <em>White </em>involved allegations by defendants that their rights to exercise preemptory challenges were impaired by the court\u2019s denial of their motions to strike potential jurors for cause. In each, the Court of Appeals found waiver when the defendant expressed satisfaction with the jury impaneled prior to its being sworn. The State says that appellant\u2019s failure to object, coupled with his expressing satisfaction with the jury impaneled, is a comparable situation which mandates the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Notwithstanding, our belief that the trial judge\u2019s failure to <em>voir dire </em>the jury panel as to racial bias was error, we are constrained, in light of <em>Calhoun </em>and <em>White, </em>to agree with the State that appellant waived that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">As to appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in refusing to elaborate upon its question pertaining to appellant\u2019s occupation, not only was this issue also waived, but the question propounded by the court was sufficient to elicit the \u201cessence of the information sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Appellant next contends that his sentence for attempted murder in the first degree is illegal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He reasons that assault with intent to murder, the \u201cflagship crime\u201d of the indictment pursuant to which he was tried, carries a maximum penalty of only thirty years;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> thus, that maximum penalty constitutes a cap on the sentence he could receive for attempted murder,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an offense carrying a greater maximum penalty than, but, one which, nevertheless, is a lesser included offense of, assault with intent to murder. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\"><em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 482 A.2d 474 (1984), the case on which the State relies to support its argument that the maximum penalty for an attempted murder charge is not determined by the maximum penalty for assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>intent to murder, involved the issue whether, for the purposes of adult jurisdiction over a juvenile, the two crimes are the same. It was in this context that the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC\">\u201cIn this case, Hardy was charged only with attempted murder, and thus no question of merger arises. Consequently, upon conviction he would be subject to the maximum penalty for that offense,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 134, 482 A.2d 474, and then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c... that the maximum punishment for attempted murder is not determined by the maximum punishment for assault with intent to murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 135, 482 A.2d 474. The Court did acknowledge, however, that assault with intent to murder is the same as attempted murder except that assault with intent to murder requires a greater degree of proximity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 130, 482 A.2d 474, quoting R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>578 (2nd ed. 1969). Thus, attempted murder is a lesser included offense of assault with intent to murder. <em>Id. See Gerald v. State, </em>299 Md. 138, 472 A.2d 977 (1984), <em>Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. 196, 388 A.2d 926 (1978), <em>Slye v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 520, 401 A.2d 195 (1979). <em>Cf. Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">In <em>Simms v. State, </em>288 Md. 712, 724, 421 A.2d 957 (1980), the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">... [W]hen a defendant is charged with a greater offense and a lesser included offense based on the same conduct, with jeopardy attaching to both charges at trial, and when the defendant is convicted only of the lesser included charge, he may not receive a sentence for that conviction which exceeds the maximum sentence which could have been imposed had he been convicted of the greater charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Therefore, twelve year sentences imposed for assault convictions after jury acquittals as to 10 year maximum assault with intent to rob charges were vacated. <em>See Also Gerald v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>after all the evidence had been presented and just prior to submission of the case to the jury, the State nolle prossed the assault with intent to murder charge. At that time, jeopardy had attached and the nolle pros operated as an acquittal. <em>Bynum v. State, </em>277 Md. 703, 705, 357 A.2d 339 (1976). Under <em>Simms, </em>the flagship crime being assault with intent to murder, although attempted murder in the first degree was being charged, the maximum penalty that could be imposed was thirty years. A sentence of life imprisonment with all but thirty-five years suspended is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Our conclusion is not affected by <em>Walker v. State, supra. </em>There, appellant alleged, \u201cthat the very appearance of the aggravated assault charge in the case served, ..., to establish an upper limit upon the penalty available for the attempted rape[.]\u201d This Court, noting that \u201cthe more specific crime ... determines the upper limit on punishment when there is a merger and even in a non-merger situation as in <em>Simms, </em>where jeopardy attaches on both the general and specific crimes,\u201d 53 Md.App. at 191, 452 A.2d 1234, held that assault with intent to rape \u201chad no limiting effect upon the penalty for attempted first-degree rape.\u201d 53 Md.App. 192, 452 A.2d 1234. We obeserved along the way: \u201cIf what were before us was attempted rape generally, we would be hard-pressed not to agree with the appellant.\u201d 53 Md.App. at 191, 452 A.2d 1234. First, unlike the <em>Walker </em>Court, we do not find significant the fact that appellant in this case was charged with attempted murder in the first degree, rather than attempted murder generally. Second, <em>Walker </em>is distinguishable in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In the instant case attempted murder was charged pursuant to the statutory formula in Md.Code Ann. art. 27 \u00a7 616 for charging murder. Under that formula, \u201ceven though it spells out murder in the first degree, the accused may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>convicted of murder in the first degree, of murder in the second degree, or of manslaughter.\u201d <em>State v. Ward, </em>284 Md. 189, 200 (1978). <em>See Hardy, </em>301 Md. at 138. \u201cThe crime of attempt by definition expands and contracts and is redefined commensurate with the substantive offense.\u201d <em>Hardy, </em>301 Md. at 139-40. Thus, in this case, because appellant could have been convicted under the attempted murder count of the indictment of attempted murder in the first degree or attempted murder in the second degree, the indictment, in effect, charged both attempted murder in the first degree <em>and </em>attempted murder in the second degree. <em>See Gerald v.
