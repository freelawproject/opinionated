He was shot in the face on January 22, 1982, by an assailant on a public street. Williams was blinded in his left eye. He filed a claim with the State Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (Board). The Board ultimately found that because Williams returned to his employment with no diminution in salary, he did not suffer a compensable injury within the meaning of the law. No award for permanent partial disability was made. Nevertheless, Williams was reimbursed $2,538.20 for medical expenses and loss of earnings. Dissatisfied with the declination of the Board to award him compensation for permanent partial disability, Williams appealed to the Circuit Court for Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>more City. That tribunal agreed with the Board. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Williams asserts that the Board and the circuit court (Byrnes, J.) misinterpreted the applicable statute, Md.Ann. Code art. 26A, \u00a7 12. The nub of Wiliams\u2019 contention is that inasmuch as he was found to have sustained a \u201cserious financial hardship\u201d as a result of medical bills and temporary loss of earnings, the Board should have made an award to him based on his permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Phrased another way, Williams maintains that a finding of serious \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d begets an award for disability.</p>\n<p id=\"AyN\">Md.Ann.Code art. 26A, \u00a7 12 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akt\">\u201c(a)(1) No award shall[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] be made unless the Board ... finds that (1) a crime was committed, (2) such crime directly resulted in personal physical injury to, or death of the victim, and (3) police records show that such crime was promptly reported to the proper authorities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">(f)(1) If the Board ... finds that the claimant will not suffer serious financial hardship, as a result of the loss of earnings or support and the out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the injury, if not granted financial assistance pursuant to this article to meet the loss of earnings, support, or out-of-pocket expenses, the Board ... shall deny an award. In determining the serious financial hardship, the Board ... shall consider all of the financial resources of the claimant. Unless total dependency is established, a family is considered to be partially dependent on a mother with whom they reside without regard to actual earnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Williams asseverates that, under \u00a7 12(f)(1), once a crime victim has established \u201cserious financial hardship\u201d as a result of either lost earnings, lost support, or out-of-pocket expenses, he or she is entitled to full recovery for his or her injury. Proceeding from that starting point, Williams asserts that since he established serious financial hardship resulting from his lost earnings, as well as his out-of-pocket expenses, he is entitled to compensation for the permanent partial disability he has sustained. Williams claims that he is so entitled to an award despite the fact that he has incurred no economic hardship as a result of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The State, on the other hand, posits that, under \u00a7 12(f)(1), no award for physical disability can be made unless the disability results in \u201cserious financial hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Succinctly, the State\u2019s position is that if there is no economic loss from the disability, there can be no compensable disability award. The State thinks the statute was enacted to afford comfort to those who need it and not to furnish redress to every victim, irrespective of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 335, 449 A.2d 1158, 1160 (1982). \u201cThe primary source from which we glean this intention is the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Mazor v. Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360, 369 A.2d 82, 86 (1977). In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting Md.Ann.Code art. 26A \u2014 the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act \u2014 is clear. The statute contains a \u201cDeclaration of policy and legislative intent.\u201d Md.Ann. Code art. 26A, \u00a7 1. The legislature said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201c[We recognize] that many innocent persons suffer personal physical injury or death as a result of criminal acts or in their efforts to prevent crime or apprehend persons committing or attempting to commit crimes. Such persons or their dependents may thereby suffer disability, incur financial hardships or become dependent upon public assistance. The legislature finds and deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>mines that there is a need for government financial assistance for such victims of crime. Accordingly, it is the legislature\u2019s intent that aid, care and support be provided by the State, as a matter of moral responsibility, for such victims of crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">However noble the cause, the legislature did not \u201crush in where angels fear to tread,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but assumed \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d with some trepidation. Because the funds to be disbursed were public, the legislature was wary of allowing recompense without restraint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Criminal Injuries Compensation Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 498, 331 A.2d 55, 62-63 (1975). As a result, certain provisions were incorporated into the Act so as to limit its availability strictly to those in need of assistance. Section 12(f)(1), as above quoted, is one of those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The focal point in \u00a7 12(f)(1) is the incurring of \u201cserious financial hardship.\u201d <em>See Gould, </em>273 Md. at 496, 331 A.2d at 62. When \u00a7 1 of art. 26A is read in conjunction with \u00a7 12(f)(1), it becomes apparent that the legislature\u2019s intent was not to make the victim whole, but to ameliorate serious financial losses sustained as a result of the victim\u2019s injuries. <em>See Holmes v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Bd., </em>278 Md. 60, 65, 359 A.2d 84 (1976) (\u201c[Section] 12(f)(1) requires a mandatory denial of an award to claimants who do not suffer serious financial hardship as a result of criminal activity\u201d). The Criminal Injuries Compensation Act permits \u201cthe unreimbursed victims of crime to be compensated by funds appropriated by the state for their personal injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and loss of earnings, <em>if </em>the victim would otherwise suffer serious financial hardship.\u201d <em>Gould, </em>273 Md. at 495-96, 331 A.2d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Williams\u2019 position that the Act was intended as a panacea for damages or injuries arising from crime cannot be reconciled with its legislative purpose. Although the Act is based on a \u201c \u2018welfare-theory\u2019 of compensation,\u201d <em>Gould, </em>273 Md. at 498, 331 A.2d at 63, it is not a \u201cwelfare program\u201d in the sense that it compensates only the indigent. The purpose of the Act is to provide recompense to crime victims who otherwise will suffer serious financial hardship. \u201c[I]n view of the exemptions applicable on determining financial hardship, a victim of more substantial means might also fall within the criterion of suffering \u2018serious financial hardship\u2019 if his injury results in present inability to earn income.\u201d To illustrate: a professional person who owns a well-appointed mansion, a private plane, and has savings of less than his annual net income may qualify as suffering serious financial hardship if being victimized results in the termination of his income from his profession. Comment, <em>Criminal Victim Compensation in Maryland, </em>30 Md.L.Rev. 266, 282 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The purpose of the Act is to create a governmental benefit not otherwise available to victims of crime. That benefit extends to victims who have suffered serious financial hardship as a result of the criminal activity, but it does not necessarily embrace those who suffer serious disability. Williams\u2019 disability is most unfortunate, but fortunately it has not resulted in an enormous economic loss to him. No diminution in salary has been sustained by Williams, nor is it likely that his income will be reduced as a result of the injury. He does not, therefore, fall within the ambit of \u201cserious financial hardship.\u201d The Board and the circuit court properly rejected Williams\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">.
