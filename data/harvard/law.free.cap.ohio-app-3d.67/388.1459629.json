We have <em>sua sponte </em>removed this case from the accelerated calendar, and therefore, the order striking the reply brief is set aside and held for naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">On March 9, 1979, defendant-appellant Mark A. Hagstrom assaulted his girlfriend, Mary Firth, in the village of Fairfax, located in Hamilton County. Hagstrom then travelled to the city of Norwood and telephoned Firth from a public telephone booth. Police officers, who by then had been summoned to Firth\u2019s residence, were present when Hagstrom placed the call and were able to trace Hagstrom\u2019s whereabouts. Norwood police officers were dispatched to the pay phone, and a struggle ensued when they attempted to arrest Hagstrom. Hagstrom was ultimately charged with assault and resisting arrest for his conduct toward the arresting officers, and he was also charged with aggravated assault for the incident involving Firth. Hagstrom pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>guilty to the aggravated-assault charge in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, and the same plea was accepted for the charges of assault and resisting arrest in the Norwood Mayor\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In April 1988, Hagstrom filed an application to expunge the record of his aggravated-assault conviction pursuant to R.C. 2953.32. The application was denied on the basis that Hagstrom was not a \u201cfirst offender.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hagstrom\u2019s sole assignment of error attacks the trial court\u2019s denial of his expungement application.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">R.C. 2953.31(A) defines \u201cfirst offender\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u201c \u2018First offender\u2019 means anyone who has been convicted of an offense in this state or any other jurisdiction, and who has not been previously or subsequently convicted of the same or a different offense in this state or any other jurisdiction. <em>When two or more convictions result from or are connected with the same act, or result from offenses committed at the same time, they shall be counted as one conviction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The acts committed by Hagstrom were, beyond argument, separate in time and place. The assault on Firth occurred in Fairfax, while the offenses committed against the Norwood police officers took place approximately forty-five minutes later in Norwood. Accordingly, the convictions did not \u201cresult from offenses committed at the same time\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 2953.-31(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Hagstrom essentially asserts that since the Norwood convictions \u201ccame about entirely as the result of the [aggravated assault on Firth],\u201d he qualifies as a first offender under the \u201cresult from or are connected with the same act\u201d language in R.C. 2953.31(A). Hagstrom\u2019s position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The convictions at issue do not fit within the purview of the \u201cfirst offender\u201d definition set forth in R.C. 2953.31(A). The offenses were committed against different individuals at different places and times, and the convictions neither resulted from nor were connected with the same act. The Norwood Mayor\u2019s Court convictions resulted from Hagstrom\u2019s encounter with Norwood police officers who were attempting to arrest him for the assault on Firth. Hagstrom both resisted the arrest and assaulted the officers during the course of the arrest. Clearly, these offenses were not connected, in the manner required by the expungement statute, to Hagstrom\u2019s commission of the aggravated assault on Firth, during which Hagstrom forcibly cut Firth\u2019s hair, threw her down a flight of stairs and then proceeded to beat her.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined that Hagstrom was not a first offender and was not entitled to expungement of his record pursuant to R.C. 2953.31 and 2953.32. To the extent that this decision may be inconsistent with our holding in <em>State v. Penn </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App.2d 315, 6 O.O.3d 357, 369 N.E.2d 1229, we conclude that the import of the <em>Penn </em>holding must be confined solely to the facts as they existed in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-7\">Shannon, P.J., Klusmeier and Hildebrandt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\">. At the hearing on Hagstrom\u2019s expungement motion, the parties stipulated that Hagstrom had not been convicted of any offenses either before or after the March 9, 1979 incident(s).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
