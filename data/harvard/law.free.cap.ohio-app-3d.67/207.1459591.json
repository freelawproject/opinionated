Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">Plaintiff-appellant, Woodbran Realty Corporation, filed a complaint against appellee, Orange Village, Ohio (\u201cvillage\u201d), seeking a declaration of appellant\u2019s rights under R.C. 4933.01 to extend its sewer lines in certain streets of the village, a declaration of its rights under the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>October 24,1988. Appellant now timely appeals, raising three assignments of error for our review. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The facts material to appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion were not in dispute in the trial court. Appellant is a licensed private-public utility. It provides services to the villages of Orange, Woodmere, Pepper Pike and the city of Beachwood pursuant to a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (\u201ccertificate\u201d) issued by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (\u201cPUCO\u201d). Appellant is the only public utility currently providing sewer services in Orange Village. Since 1985, appellant has received requests for sanitary sewer service from residents and property owners in areas within the village\u2019s municipal limits where appellant\u2019s sewer lines do not currently extend. Thereafter, on July 11, 1986, appellant sent a letter to the village asking that it begin the necessary approval process for appellant to extend its sewer lines throughout the municipality to serve those residents. Appellee\u2019s law director prepared an ordinance reflecting this request for submission to the municipal legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">This ordinance (known as the \u201cWoodbran Ordinance\u201d) was introduced to the village\u2019s council in August 1986 and was promptly referred to the village planning and zoning commission pursuant to requirements of the village\u2019s charter, Section 12, Article 3. On June 9, 1987, the planning and zoning commission unanimously recommended disapproval of the Woodbran Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The ordinance was set for consideration by council at its regular meeting in August 1987. At that meeting, the Woodbran Ordinance was removed from the council agenda and, instead, Ordinance No. 1987-52 (\u201cSinger Ordinance\u201d) was introduced for consideration. The Singer Ordinance authorized a study of alternatives for the installation of sanitary sewers for a portion of the municipality. Council adopted the Singer Ordinance on August 18, 1987. To date, council has not formally acted on the proposed Woodbran Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Based on the foregoing, the trial court entered final judgment for appellee on the complaint. For the following reasons, we affirm the lower court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u201cAssignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment of defendant village of Orange on plaintiff Woodbran Realty Corporation\u2019s complaint, Counts One through Seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201cAssignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u201cThe trial court erred in misconstruing and misapplying Section 4933.01 of the Revised Code and Art. XVIII, Sec. 4 of the Ohio Constitution to the facts in support of the causes of action of plaintiff Woodbran Realty Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Appellant argues the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment based on the court\u2019s misinterpretation of R.C. 4933.01 and Section 4, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. In support of Assignments of Error I and II, appellant advances several arguments, which we shall consider in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201cAs a matter of law, neither Sec. 4933.01, Revised Code, nor Art. XVIII, Sec. 4, Ohio Constitution, gives a village the absolute right to reject a sewer company\u2019s request to install sanitary sewers in the village when the sewer company has complied with every requirement necessary to install the sewers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">First, appellant argues that Section 4, Article XVIII and R.C. 4933.01 do not authorize the village to deny the introduction of sanitary sewers to parts of the village where the zoning codes require sanitary sewers for development and where the sewer company has complied with all of the village\u2019s regulations. Second, appellant argues that R.C. 4933.01 evidences a state policy that sanitary sewers should be installed in municipalities, which limits the municipalities\u2019 ability to exercise their rights under Section 4, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. Third, appellant contends the village may only exclude appellant if, and only if, the village operates its own sewer service company. These arguments are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Section 4, Article XVIII provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">\u201cAny municipality may acquire, construct, own, lease and operate within or without its corporate limits, any public utility the product or service of which is or is to be supplied to the municipality or its inhabitants, and may contract with others for any such product or service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201ccontracting for public utility services is exclusively a municipal function under Section 4, Art. XVIII, of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Lucas v. Lucas Local School Dist. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 13, 2 OBR 501, 442 N.E.2d 449. The court further held that \u201cthis exclusive power necessarily presumes that while being able to grant public utility franchises, a municipality may likewise exclude a public utility from serving its inhabitants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 2 OBR at 504, 442 N.E.2d at 452. This power to contract or decline to contract for public utility services is \u201cplenary.\u201d <em>Dravo-Doyle v. Orrville </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 236, 112 N.E. 508, syllabus. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>authority conferred by Section 4, Article XVIII \u201cis beyond the pale of the General Assembly to limit, restrict, or otherwise control.\u201d <em>Bd. of Delaware Cty. Commrs. v. Columbus </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 179, 184, 26 OBR 154, 158, 497 N.E.2d 1112, 1116. Consistent with this constitutional grant of authority to home-rule municipalities, R.C. 4933.01 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u201c[A] company organized for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants of a municipal corporation or township with sewage disposal services may supply said services <em>as required by such municipal corporation </em>or township for such or other purposes. Such [company] <em>may </em>lay conductors for conducting * * * sewage * * * through the streets, lands, alleys, and squares in such municipal corporation <em>with the consent of the municipal authorities </em>or the board of township trustees under such reasonable regulations as such authorities or board prescribes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The wording of this statute clearly requires municipal consent before sewage lines can be extended or installed in a municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Addressing appellant\u2019s first argument, the fact that the village\u2019s zoning ordinances require access to sewers for further development of some areas does not give appellant the right to install the sewers without the village\u2019s consent. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s compliance with the village\u2019s regulations imposes no obligation upon the municipality to grant its consent. We interpret the words \u201cwith the consent of the municipal authorit[y]\u201d in R.C. 4933.01 as granting the municipality the right to refuse consent to lay sewer pipes in village streets. Any other holding would violate appellee\u2019s home-rule power to contract or decline to contract for public utility services. Section 4, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. <em>Lucas v. Lucas Local School Dist., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Likewise, we can find no authority to support appellant\u2019s contention that R.C. 4933.01 espouses a state policy that municipalities should install sanitary sewers. R.C. 4933.01 is a regulation of private utility activity and nothing more. The wording of the statute reveals that companies \u201cmay\u201d provide services with the municipalities\u2019 consent. Nowhere does it contain language which we can construe as compelling the municipalities to install sewers.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Finally, appellant argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lucas, </em>that a municipality has the \u201cexclusive power to exclude a public utility from serving its inhabitants,\u201d applies only when a municipality operates its own utility. We find nothing in the holding in the <em>Lucas </em>case or in the language of Section 4, Article XVIII that suggests appellant\u2019s assertion. Thus, these arguments are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u201cWoodbran has standing to represent the interests of property owners in Orange Village who have made application to it for sanitary sewage disposal services to develop and improve their property under municipal zoning regulations which require sanitary sewers for development of their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that it has standing in a representative capacity to advance an argument based on the village\u2019s zoning code is without merit. Appellant is not an association with standing to bring a legal action on behalf of its members. See <em>F.O.P. v. Columbus </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 1, 2, 10 OBR 6, 7, 460 N.E.2d 639, 640. Furthermore, we agree with the trial court that appellant has no individual property interest affected by the village\u2019s zoning ordinances since appellant \u201cdoes not allege that it owns or leases property in areas of appellee\u2019s municipality that are required by ordinance to have sanitary sewers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u201cSection 4933.01 does not permit a village to preclude a sanitary sewer company from extending its lines in streets through the village where the extension of such lines is necessary to provide sewage disposal and treatment services to residents of other municipalities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Appellant argues that the village\u2019s refusal to permit appellant to install additional lines within the village\u2019s boundaries jeopardizes appellant\u2019s ability to provide utility services to customers outside appellant\u2019s jurisdiction. Appellant contends the village\u2019s actions violate the state interest protected by R.C. 4933.01 in favor of the installation of sanitary sewers throughout the state. As we previously stated, we cannot find that R.C. 4933.01 espouses a state policy that municipalities install sanitary sewers. Furthermore, appellant has failed to demonstrate any evidence that the village\u2019s refusal to consent to appellant will affect the quality of sewage disposal in other communities. Thus, this argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Accordingly, Assignments of Error I and II are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that Woodbran Realty Corporation did not have property interests that are protected by the Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Appellant contends it has a property interest in its Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and has property rights derived from well-established patterns of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Appellant\u2019s PUCO certificate gives appellant the legal capacity to contract with the village. <em>Local Tel. Co. v. Cranberry Mut. Tel. Co. </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 524, 133 N.E. 527. The village still has the power to choose to contract or decline to contract with appellant. <em>Lucas v. Lucas Local School Dist., supra. </em>Therefore, appellant cannot claim the certificate is a property interest entitling appellant to install sewers in the municipality without the consent of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Appellant also has no \u201cproperty interest\u201d as a result of any \u201cwell-established pattern\u201d of conduct. Appellant argues that since the village consented to extensions of appellant\u2019s sewer lines in various streets in the past, it has somehow consented to all other streets in the village.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Well-established patterns or mutual understandings in the nature of an implied contract may be the basis of a property interest. <em>Bara v. Aurora Civil Service Comm. </em>(N.D.Ill.1983), 580 F.Supp. 212. If property or liberty interests were implied whenever a governmental entity had established certain procedures, these procedures could never be changed without running afoul of due process considerations. <em>Id. </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In the instant case, R.C. 4933.01 expressly requires municipal consent before sewage lines can be extended in the municipality. Thus, appellant is not being deprived of some right previously held under state law. See <em>Leis v. Flynt </em>(1979), 439 U.S. 438, 445, 99 S.Ct. 698, 702, 58 L.Ed.2d 717, 723. Under R.C. 4933.01, the municipality is free to grant or deny appellant\u2019s requests. The fact that the municipality granted past requests does not now prevent it from denying a request to install sewers in other areas of the village. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s claim that a \u201cproperty interest\u201d was created from R.C. 4933.01 and the village\u2019s pattern of consenting to requests. Appellant has failed to demonstrate any \u201cproperty interest\u201d based on federal law, and we find no federal challenge that applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In conclusion, the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s summary judgment on appellant\u2019s complaint because, as a matter of law, Section 4, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution and R.C. 4933.01 provide that appellant\u2019s right to install and expand its sanitary sewer system within the village\u2019s municipal limits is subject to appellee\u2019s express consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Assignment of Error III is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-11\">Dyke, P.J., and Ann McManamon, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
