Defendant was indicted for the instant offense as a result of shoplifting a cordless telephone at a Defiance County department store and her two prior convictions of theft offenses. Defendant assigns one error to the judgment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u201cThe trial court abused his discretion and thus committed prejudicial error in sustaining the state\u2019s motion in limine and holding the defendant\u2019s evidence inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">During the discovery phase of this case, the trial court, pursuant to the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>made an initial ruling that evidence of defendant\u2019s diabetic condition would not be admitted at trial. Upon defendant\u2019s proffer of the evidence, the trial court reaffirmed its conclusion that evidence of defendant\u2019s diabetic condition was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Evid.R. 401 defines relevant evidence as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">\u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">We have reviewed the proffer of evidence made by defendant regarding her diabetic condition. The proffer showed that the testimony of a medical witness, Dr. Peter Leonardson, would have confirmed the existence of defendant\u2019s diabetic condition. Dr. Leonardson\u2019s testimony would also have estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>lished that on prior occasions, during diabetic related hypoglycemic reactions, defendant has exhibited symptoms of confusion and disorientation and that it was conceivable that defendant would commit a theft during a hypoglycemic reaction. However, Dr. Leonardson did not treat defendant at or near the time of the offense and therefore could not offer any testimony regarding defendant\u2019s medical condition at the time of the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">There was also a proffer that several lay witnesses familiar with defendant\u2019s condition would testify as to her confused and disoriented state during hypoglycemic reactions. However, only one of these witnesses, Jeanine Kitchenmaster, observed defendant at or near the time of the instant offense. Kitchenmaster\u2019s testimony would have been that, on the occasion of the instant offense, defendant did not exhibit the symptoms of hypoglycemia as had been previously observed by Kitchenmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">There was also a proffer of the emergency room records of Defiance Hospital which established that defendant had previously been treated for hypoglycemia and was in fact treated for the condition approximately twelve hours after the commission of the instant offense. However, defendant conceded that it would be nothing more than speculation to medically connect defendant\u2019s blood sugar level at midnight to her blood sugar level at the time of the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Finally, there was a proffer of the arrest report which indicated that the defendant appeared \u201cdrunk\u201d at the time of her arrest. Defendant argues that each item of proffered evidence tended to make her defense of \u201clack of intent to steal\u201d more probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">However, upon consideration of the proffered evidence, we find that, in the absence of a foundation to establish that defendant\u2019s diabetic condition contributed to the commission of the offense, the trial court could properly find that the proffered evidence was not relevant. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion <em>in limine. </em>The judgment of conviction and sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-10\">Thomas F.
