Held, that by P.\u2019s indorsement of the draft, T. became the legal owner of it, with authority to compromise it as he pleased; that he was liable to P. only for a reasonable accounting; that P., after consenting that T. might give up the draft for a certain sum, could not hold T. to account for a larger sum; and that T. was entitled to judgment for the balance due on the note, after deducting the sum which T. had indorsed thereon.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-9\">Assumpsit on this note: \u201c Boston, November 19, 1830.

A statement of facts was then prepared, containing the evidence herein before set forth, for the ruling of the judge thereon; and he entered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount of the note declared on and interest, deducting the sums indorsed. From that judgment the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-7\"><em>B. Sumner, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHm\">The court should allow to the defendant the full amount of Braman and Benedict\u2019s draft, instead of the indorsement of five hundred dollars therefor, which the plaintiff made, though he gave it up on receiving four hundred dollars. He had no authority to give up the draft, without receiving five hundred dollars. If he had returned it to the defendant, the defendant might have recovered its full amount. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>9 Pick. 542. A principal is not bound by the acts of an agent who exceeds the authority intrusted to him. Story on Agency, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 126.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-8\">(S'. <em>E. Guild, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agr\">The agreed facts show that the plaintiff was the legal owner of the draft, and that he was to apply it towards payment of the defendant\u2019s note. He was not the special agent of the defendant, and was merely liable to render to him a proper account. The defendant cannot call upon him to account for more than five hundred dollars; because he consented that the plaintiff might compromise with Braman and Benedict for that sum. See <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>5 Pick. 54.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEr\">It was. admitted in the argument, and perhaps it sufficiently appeared in the statement of facts, that the draft of Braman and Benedict was a negotiable security, indorsed to the plaintiff; and his receipt shows the purpose for which it was indorsed, to wit, to sell or collect it, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the note in suit. The legal property was in the plaintiff as indorsee, he being liable only to a reasonable account. He was not a mere agent. He did not derive his authority to compromise from the paper subsequently given to him by the defendant, giving the plaintiff a right to compromise, and take five hundred dollars for the draft. He had that authority by the indorsement. But this paper was a declaration, by the defendant, that so far as he was concerned, he was content that the plaintiff should relinquish it for five hundred dollars, and that the plaintiff\u2019s accounting to him for that sum, on his note, would be deemed a reasonable account. If the plaintiff accounted for that sum, towards payment of the note, it was all he was bound to do; and his giving credit for four hundred dollars only, in the first instance, can make no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The case of <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>9 Pick. 542, cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, was that of a strictly limited authority, and is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
