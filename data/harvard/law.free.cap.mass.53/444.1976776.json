Sts. <em>c. </em>143, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>$ 5, with selling spiritous liquor, without license, in the open air, &lt;fcc. The complaint contained six counts, and the defendant was found guilty, on all of them, by the justice, and was sentenced to four months\u2019 imprisonment. He appealed to the court of common pleas, and a trial was there had, at the February term, in 1846, before <em>Colby, </em>J. who signed a bill of exceptions, of which the following is a part: 11 The jury returned their verdict into court, that the defendant was guilty of the charge contained in the third count, and that they h\u00e1d not agreed as to the other counts. The defendant objected, that no judgment could be rendered on this verdict, and moved the court to set aside the verdict, and grant a new trial. The attorney for the Commonwealth moved for leave to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to all the counts except the third, and for sentence and judgment on that count; and thereupon he did file a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to all the counts except the third, and it was ordered that judgment be rendered thereon, and the defendant sentenced.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">This case was argued and decided at the last September term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-6\"><em>Byington, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdH\">The court had no power to take the case from the jury, in the manner in which it was done. The defendant had a right to a verdict on all the counts. The district attorney cannot enter a <em>nol. pros, </em>in a case like this. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuck, </em>20 Pick. 356. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 520. A verdict on part of the complaint, leaving the rest unsettled, cannot be received without the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-7\"><em>Porter, </em>(District Attorney,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amr\">The court might well have received the verdict on one count without a <em>nol. pros, </em>although the jury did not agree as to the others. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>12 Mass. 313. <em>Inhabitants of Sutton </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Dana, </em>1 Met. 383. <em>French </em>v. <em>Hanchett, </em>12 Pick. 15. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>2 Day, 504. But the <em>nol. pros, </em>was rightly entered; and as it was for the defendant\u2019s benefit, he has no cause of complaint, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>7 Pick. 177. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Tuck, </em>20 Pick. 356. See also 2 Hawk. c. 47, \u00a7 9, <em>note. </em>1 Chit. Crim. Law, 249, 640. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>8 Shepley, 341.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The only case, perhaps, 'in which a <em>nol. pros, </em>cannot be entered, without the defendant\u2019s consent, is where the cause has been committed to the jury, and the government fail to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt, or he makes out a clear defence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>17 Pick. 395. <em>The State </em>v. <em>I. S. S. </em>1 Tyler, 178. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>12 Verm. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The court overruled the exceptions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
