The attorney, who wrote the bond and mortgage, testified that when he wrote them, he had said notes in his office for collection, and had previously called upon Phinehas Foster, Jr. one of the defendants, to pay them; that said Phinehas came to his office and examined the notes, and was there told that the plaintiff would look to him for payment, as his father had divested himself of all his property; and that said Phinehas \u201c made little or no answer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-9\">The defendants relied upon the cancellation of said bond, by an indorsement thereon, made since the commencement of this action, by their father. They also gave in evidence a release from their father to them, dated March 15th 1845, and a new bond, bearing the same date with the other, and with a similar condition, but executed after this suit was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The judge instructed the jury that the foregoing evidence entitled the plaintiff to recover, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff.

The cases cited for the plaintiff are therefore inapplicable. The bond raises no implied agreement in favor of the plaintiff, on which he can maintain an action. No consideration moved from the plaintiff for any agreement of the defendants to pay him. <em>Rolls </em>v. <em>Yate, </em>Yelv. 177 &amp; <em>note.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">It appears that the defendants gave their father a bond with a penalty, conditioned to pay his debts, and also a mortgage, as collateral security for the performance of that obligation to him. The plaintiff sues as indorsee of a note made by the father, and outstanding when the bond was given. On these facts, the court are of opinion that the action cannot be maintained. It is not distinguishable in principle from <em>Sanders </em>v. Filley, 12 Pick. 554, and other cases cited for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The verdict is set aside ; and a new trial is granted which is to be had in this court, unless the plaintiff becomes nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
