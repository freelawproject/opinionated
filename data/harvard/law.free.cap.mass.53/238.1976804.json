Underwood pleaded guilty, and Smith pleaded not guilty. At the trial of Smith, in the municipal court, before <em>Wells, </em>C. J. the prosecuting attorney, after the evidence for the defence was closed, offered Underwood, who had not been sentenced nor discharged, as a witness for the Commonwealth. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>counsel of Smith objected to the admission of Underwood\u2019s testimony, on the ground that he was still a party to the record, and therefore incompetent to testify. This objection was overruled, and Underwood\u2019s testimony was admitted. The jury found Smith guilty, and he alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-5\"><em>H. C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUa\">The question in the present case is, whether a co-defendant, who has pleaded guilty, but has not been sentenced, can be called as a witness for the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">It has been held, that a co-defendant, who has not been tried, cannot be called as a witness for one put on trial separately. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>10 Pick. 57. So it has been held, in New York, that a party in the same indictment cannot be a witness for his co-defendant, upon his trial, until he has been acquitted or convicted. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>10 Johns. 95. But the reason does not apply to one who, by conviction on his own confession, has ceased to be a party to the issue to be tried. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>1 Stra. 633. And in a late case, where a co-defendant had pleaded guilty to a charge of house breaking, and was called as a witness, before sentence, he was admitted. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>George, </em>Car. &amp; Marshm. 111.
