Sumner, to secure a note for $1953-17, payable to him or order, in one year, with interest; and that said Pierce, on the 29th of April 1836, conveyed all his interest in said, estate (his right to redeem) to said Robinson : That on the 11th of August 1837, said Robinson paid to said Sumner the amount due on said mortgage, and that said Sumner, at said Robinson\u2019s request, assigned said mortgage to the defendant, who had lent to said Robinson $2300 for two years, with interest at nine per cent, per annum, and had agreed to hold said mortgage as collateral security therefor: That when said mortgage was so assigned to the defendant, it was done wholly for the benefit of said Robinson, who then gave his own promissory note to the defendant for said $2330, payable in two years, without interest, and also gave him four other promissory notes, for $103 50 each, payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>in six, twelve, eighteen and twenty four months, without interest, for two years\u2019 interest, at nine per cent, per annum, on said $2300, and for no other consideration: all which four notes were paid by said Robinson, and also divers other sums were paid by him and by his administratrix (the plaintiff) on said note for $2300: That the defendant, when the. mortgage last mentioned was assigned to him, gave a writing, under seal, to said Robinson, acknowledging that he held said mortgage as collateral security for the aforesaid five notes, and obligating himself, upon payment of said notes, to assign said mortgage to said Robinson, or his assigns, on demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">The plaintiff furthermore alleged, in her bill, that said Robinson, who was her husband, died intestate, on the 23d of December 1842, and that she was duly appointed administratrix of his estate: That said Robinson, after his intermarriage with her, was seized of the above mentioned parcels of real estate, and that she, as his widow, was \u201c entitled to a right of dower therein, and also to a right of redemption of those estates, respectively, upon paying to said Guild the balance justly and lawfully due on each: \u201d Also that she, as administratrix of her said husband\u2019s estate, was entitled to redeem the said real estates, and was bound so to do, inasmuch as said estates were, respectively, of far greater value than the incumbrances thereon; but that she could not, in the capacity of administratrix, lawfully pay more than the sum due thereon, out of her intestate\u2019s assets: That the personal property of her said intestate was insufficient to pay his debts; but that his real estate was ample for that purpose: That she was ready and willing to pay to the defendant the amount justly and lawfully due on each or either of said mortgages, or on the notes for which they are held as collateral security, and to redeem either or both of said mortgages; and that she had offered so to do: That she had repeatedly demanded of the defendant an account or statement of the balance due on each of said mortgaged estates, and of his claims thereon, and that no proper answer had been given to her by the defendant: That she had been advised that, in respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>each of said mortgages, the amount lawfully due to the defendant was just the amount which he, in a suit at law in each case, could recover judgment for, against said Robinson\u2019s administratrix, on the respective notes given by said Robinson for the several aforesaid loans made to him by the <em>defendant; </em>and that, in any such suit, threefold the whole amount of interest reserved or taken, as herein before specified, would be deducted from such notes, and' the balance only, in each case, be allowed against her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">The prayer of the bill was, that the defendant might make full answer, and might account; and that the plaintiff might be allowed to redeem, and the defendant be compelled to perform his agreements, specified in the bill, upon his receiving the just and true amount due to him in each case. There was also a prayer for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">The defendant demurred to the bill, 1st, because the plaintiff exhibits her bill in the double capacity of widow and <em>administratrix; </em>2d, because she seeks to redeem two different and distinct' mortgages, of different dates, and held by different titles3d, because she seeks to recover the usurious interest alleged to have been paid on distinct and separate matters of contract; 4th, because she prays for the specific performance of distinct contracts relating to different parcels of real estate; and 5th, because the bill is multifarious.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-7\">S. <em>D. </em>Parker, in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avs\">The plaintiff cannot sue as administratrix and as widow. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>and <em>Vose </em>v. <em>Philbrook, </em>3 Story R. 51, 344. <em>Shackell </em>v. <em>Macaulay, 2 </em>Sim. &amp; Stu. 79. <em>Binney\u2019s case, 2 </em>Bland, 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\">Usurious interest cannot be recovered back, unless a bill or action, for - that purpose only, is brought within two years.Rev.

'</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\">As the plaintiff shows a case for relief, a demurrer to the whole bill will not be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b335-6\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHT\">This is a bill in equity, to which the defendant demurs for several causes. The first is, that the plaintiff is the widow of Thomas Robinson, mentioned in the bill, and the administratrix on his estate, and claims the right to maintain the suit in both capacities. And this, it is argued, renders the bill multifarious. The opinion of Story, J. in the case of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>3 Story R. 51, is cited in support of this objection. \u201c The bill,\u201d Judge Story says, \u201c is open to the objection of multifariousness in mixing up an independent claim of Carter,\u201d (the plaintiff,) \u201cin his own right, with the transactions of Adams with the defendant, with which he had nothing to do, except in his capacity as administrator.\u201d Such, however, are not the facts in the present case. The plaintiff claims, in both capacities, under the said Thomas Robinson. Both claims are homogeneous in their character, and it is immaterial to the defendant, in which capacity the plaintiff claims. This case comes within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the rale of pleading laid down by Daniell, and which is supported by the cases cited by him: Where the plaintiff claims the same thing under different titles, the statement of them in the same bill will not render it multifarious. 1 Daniell Ch. Praet. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In the second place, it has been argued' that the bill is multifarious, because it seeks to redeem two different and distinct mortgages of different dates, and held by different titles; or it prays for the specific performance of distinct contracts relating to different parcels of real estate. There seems to be, upon the authorities, no inflexible rule established as to what constitutes multifariousness. The general principle is, that the court will not, on the one hand, encourage an unnecessary multiplicity of actions, and, on the other hand, will not allow the plaintiff to join in his bill a multiplicity of different and distinct matters, so as to embarrass the defendant in his defence, or to produce confusion, or to render the case complicated and difficult to be understood. And certainly this bill is not liable to any such objection. If two bills were filed, the defence would be the same; and there seems to be no more reason why the plaintiff\u2019s two claims should not be joined in one bill, than why two notes of hand should not be joined in one declaration in an action at common law. Cooper Eq. PL 182. I Daniell Ch. Pract. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The remaining objection to the bill is, that it seeks to deduct penalties from the amount due on the mortgages, under the statute of usury. This may be a valid objection, in a court of equity, to this part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim ,\u2022 but it will not sustain a demurrer to the whole bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
