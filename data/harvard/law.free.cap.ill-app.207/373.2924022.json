Limitation of actions, \u00a7 74<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when declaration in action by employee for personal injuries states new cause of action. Where the original declaration in an action by an employee against his employer for personal injuries is based upon defendant\u2019s alleged common-law liability as an employer, and also upon section 101 of the Factory Act (J. &amp; A. If 5398), making it the employer\u2019s duty to keep his place of employment in a clean and wholesome condition, a breach of which was averred, and more than four years after the happening of the accident an amended declaration is filed, predicated upon section 89 of such Act (J. &amp; A. If 5386), alleging the wilful failure on the part of defendant to comply with such act, an allegation not contained in the original declaration, the amended declaration states a new cause of action, since the alleged breaches of statutory duty under the respective sections are entirely different, and there is an allegation that the negligence was wilful in the amended declaration, an allegation not contained in the original declaration.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\" pgmap=\"399\">Error to the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.
