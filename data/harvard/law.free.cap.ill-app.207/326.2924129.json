Corporations, \u00a7 149<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when evidence shows promise by stockholder to personally purchase stock. Evidence held sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant, the owner of nearly all the stock in a corporation, orally promised' to employees purchasing stock to personally purchase the shares of the stock if such employees left the service of the corporation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-6\" pgmap=\"353\">2. Corporations, \u00a7 142* \u2014 when promise by stockholder to repurchase stock is based upon consideration. A promise by a stockholder, who transfers his stock to a corporation, to employees purchasing stock that he will personally repurchase their shares upon their leaving the service of the corporation is based upon a consideration where the stock is in fact the property of such stockholder, and he derives direct personal benefit from the contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-7\" pgmap=\"353\">3. Frauds, Statute of, \u00a7 25* \u2014 when contract for repurchase of stock is not within. A contract for the repurchase of stock by a stockholder of a corporation from employees purchasing stock upon the latter leaving the employ of the corporation is not within the Statute of Frauds, because it is not to be performed within a year, where it is completely executed upon the part of the employees and the latter could at any time within a year have terminated their employment with the corporation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-8\" pgmap=\"353\">4. Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 13a* \u2014 what does not constitute material variance in fourth-class case. In a fourth-class case in the Municipal Court of Chicago, a variance between the pleading and proof as to the date of the execution of an oral contract sued on held not so material as to warrant a reversal where defendant was fully apprised of the nature of the claim against him.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-9\" pgmap=\"353\">5. Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 28* \u2014 when claim of variance is too late. The claim of variance between a statement of claim and the proof is too late where the objection is first raised on appeal.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b353-10\" pgmap=\"353\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
