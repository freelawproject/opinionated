Action, \u00a7 68<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when action of replevin is prematurely brought. An action of replevin -by a manufacturer to recover a stock of rubber tires left with distributing agents under a contract whereby the agents were to keep such tires in stock in their store, and the manufacturer had the option of terminating the contract on thirty days\u2019 notice, is prematurely brought where brought before the service of such notice, as the right to possession would not accrue until the expiration of the thirty-day period.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-8\" pgmap=\"182\">2. Action, \u00a7 71* \u2014 when judgment should be rendered for plaintiff although action prematurely brought. It is error for the trial court to refuse to render a judgment for the plaintiff in an action of replevin, where it appears that, although the action was prematurely brought, the contract under which the goods were held had been terminated by the expiration1 of the thirty-day period limited by the contract for the termination thereof at the time of trial and entry of judgment, and the title was at all times in the plaintiff.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-4\" pgmap=\"182\">Charles P.
