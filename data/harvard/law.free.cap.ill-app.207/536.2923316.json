Brown, deceased, wherein the executrix, Sina D. Pagle, filed, in the County Court a report marked final, showing no receipts or expenditures but certain unpaid claims, which upon objections by Anna Brown and others, objectors, was not approved by that court, and on appeal to the Circuit Court a decree was rendered finding the amount she should charge herself as executrix and specifying the amount she should take credit for in her report and directing that her report be not approved and that she make a new report, in accordance with such findings, to the County Court within sixty days, from which decree she appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-11\" pgmap=\"562(93) 563(167)\">The inventory of the estate filed by the executrix showed a large number of articles of personal property, farming implements, household goods, horses, etc., valued at $1,813, and notes and accounts valued at $46.70, aggregating $1,859.70. The decedent bequeathed, after payment of debts, all his personal property and devised all his land, except twenty acres, to the executrix and her two sisters. The twenty acres was treated by all parties as intestate property. Later, after filing the inventory, an appraisement bill of a portion of the personal property, valued at $570, was filed, and, on petition by the executrix, the appraised property was ordered sold, but she reported two years later that a sale at a sufficient price had not been made and most of the property had been bought in by a sister at the appraised value, also, that she and her sisters had advanced $1,219.67 of their own money to pay debts of the estate. A later report showed she had received $750 from the property inventoried and said sum of $1,219.67, that there was $1,350.44, of unpaid claims, and that the balance of unpaid indebtedness of the estate after deducting the $750 was $1,820.11. She thereafter filed her final report and asked payment of $2,152.58 from certain moneys in the hands of the master in chancery from the sale of real estate to liquidate the indebtedness, to which .objections were filed by one of her sisters and certain other heirs of the decedent, interested only in the sale of said twenty acres, which brought $600.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b563-8\" pgmap=\"563\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b563-9\" pgmap=\"563\">1.

Where the devisees of the personal estate of a testator voluntarily advanced certain of their own money to the executrix to pay the testator\u2019s debts in order to protect their own interests in the property, held that they were not in a position to raise the question that proceeds from the sale of the testator\u2019s real estate, descended and sold as intestate property, should first be applied to his indebtedness before such advanced moneys were applied thereto.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">5.
