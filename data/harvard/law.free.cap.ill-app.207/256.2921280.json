If 5449 et seq.), the defenses of assumed risk, negligence of a fellow-servant and contributory negligence are unavailable.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-8\" pgmap=\"283\">2. Death, \u00a7 46* \u2014 what evidence is admissible in action for death of employee in absence of eyewitnesses. In an action for the death of a gateman of a railroad company, alleged to have been caused by his being struck, while at his post between two tracks, by one of defendant\u2019s westbound trains and thrown so as to be run over by an eastbound train, held, in the absence of eyewitnesses to the accident, that evidence that deceased was a good workman, in good health, and a man of careful and cautious habits was admissible.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-9\" pgmap=\"283\">3. Trial, \u00a7 153* \u2014 when case should be submitted to jury. Where there is in the record any evidence from which, if it stood alone, the jury, without acting unreasonably in the eye of the law, could find that all the averments of the declaration have been proved, the case should be submitted to the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-10\" pgmap=\"283\">4. Death, \u00a7 71* \u2014 when manner of occurrence of accident is question for jury. In an action for the death of a railroad gate-man by being run over by one of defendant\u2019s trains where it appeared that the platform on which deceased worked was unguarded; that the center of the lever that operated the gates was 4 feet 5% inches from the south rail of the north or eastbound track and 2 feet 8y2 inches from the north rail of the south or westbound track; that a car overhung the rail 1 foot 10% inches; that deceased was a man 68 years of age, in good health, and was careful in his habits, and that deceased was run over by an eastbound train, and there were no eyewitnesses to the accident, evidence held to tend to show that deceased was first struck by a westbound train while at his work and thrown so as to be run over by the eastbound train, and warrant the submission of the question to the jury.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b283-22\" pgmap=\"283\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
