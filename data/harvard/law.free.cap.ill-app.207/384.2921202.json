Witnesses, \u00a7 284<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when textbook may be used to impeach expert medical witness. A textbook may be used to impeach an expert medical witness who bases his testimony thereon, but it is not permissible to introduce textbooks, for the purpose of contradicting a witness who makes no mention thereof as a basis for his opinion, and there is no substantial difference between contradicting a witness by reading from textbooks and asking him if he is aware that \u201cthe authorities\u201d disagree with his view.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-6\" pgmap=\"411\">2. Witnesses, \u00a7 220* \u2014 what is proper cross-examination of medical witness. Where the plaintiff in a personal injury action seeks to prove that \u00e1s a direct result of the injury sustained her eyesight has become impaired to such an extent as to cause her to become cross-eyed, and a medical witness for plaintiff testifies on direct examination that one of the objective symptoms is a twitching of the muscles of the right side of the face, it is proper to cross-examine such witness by asking him whether it was not possible to produce a voluntary twitch.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-7\" pgmap=\"411\">3. Tbial, \u00a7 45* \u2014 what remarks of court upon cross-examination of medical witness are improper. Where the plaintiff in a personal injury action seeks to prove that as a direct result of the injury sustained her eyesight has become impaired so as to cause her to become cross-eyed, and a medical witness testifying on plaintiff\u2019s behalf states that he noticed a twitch in the facial muscles as an objective symptom while examining plaintiff, and such witness is properly cross-examined as to whether it was not possible to produce a voluntary twitch, held that it was improper for the court to express his opinion as to whether such muscles could be voluntarily twitched.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-8\" pgmap=\"411(123) 412(94)\">4. Carriers, \u00a7 482* \u2014 when instruction in action by passenger for personal injuries is erroneous as being inapplicable to evidence. In an action against two street railroad companies and a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries sustained due to a collision between a car belonging to one of defendant street railroads with a train of the railroad company, held that an instruction setting forth the duties of the street railroad as a common carrier, stating that the failure to exercise a degree of care required constitutes negligence, and that if, under the evidence and instructions, the jury found defendants guilty of negligence as charged in the declaration, or some count thereof, and that plaintiff had sustained damages alleged in the declaration or any count thereof, they should find for plaintiff, was erroneous, where two counts averred respectively the violation of the provision of a city ordinance requiring a street railroad to bring its car to a full stop at a point one hundred feet from a railroad crossing, and a provision requiring a speed not to exceed two miles per hour upon approaching railroad crossings, and the alleged violation of the ordinance had nothing to do with the accident and the ordinance involved was not introduced in evidence.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b411-9\" pgmap=\"411\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
