From a judgment for plaintiff for $1,676.65, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-7\" pgmap=\"351\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-8\" pgmap=\"351\">1. Evidence, \u00a7 138<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when notice to produce document before introducing copy is unnecessary. Where an action against a bank collecting money and wrongfully crediting it to an agent of plaintiff is based upon a power of attorney to collect given defendant and defendant admits the execution of the power of attorney and delivery of same to it, defendant has knowledge of the fact that such instrument is necessary to establish plaintiff\u2019s case, dispensing with service of notice to produce before trial, and, upon its failure to produce such document, a copy thereof is admissible in evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-9\" pgmap=\"351\">2. Customs and usages', $ 11* \u2014 what constitutes usage. A usage must be generally known and established, and so well settled and so uniformly acted upon, as to raise a fair presumption that it was known to both parties, and that they contracted with reference to and in conformity with it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-10\" pgmap=\"351\">3. Customs and usages, \u00a7 27* \u2014 when evidence does not show known general usage. Evidence held insufficient to establish a general usage among bankers collecting money from foreign banks for agents of persons residing in the United States through powers of attorney given by depositors, of crediting the agents with the amount of deposit so as to warrant a finding that the depositors knew of such usage.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-11\" pgmap=\"351(60) 352(28)\">4. Banks and banking, \u00a7 160* \u2014 when bank collecting money in foreign bank liable for payment of money to agent of depositor. Where a bank is given a power of attorney to collect money in a foreign bank by the agent of the depositor, the fact that there is a limited usage unknown to the depositor whereby the collecting bank credits the agent with the deposit, cannot operate to relieve the collecting bank from liability where the money is converted by the agent to his own use.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-4\" pgmap=\"351\">Adams, Crews, Bobb &amp; Westcqtt, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-5\" pgmap=\"351\">Edmund J.
