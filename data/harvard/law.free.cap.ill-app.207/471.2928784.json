Defendant\u2019s affidavit of merits held to set up a defense which was an afterthought and mere subterfuge interposed for delay, where it was filed just before trial commenced and after several prior affidavits of merits in which no mention of such defense was made had been filed and abandoned or stricken from the files.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-9\" pgmap=\"498\">2. Pleading, \u00a7 155* \u2014 when refusal to permit filing of affidavits of merits is proper. Where repeated affidavits of merits, all substantially to the same effect, had been filed and either abandoned or stricken from the files before trial, held that the same were apparently offered not in good faith but for delay, and there was no abuse of discretion in the refusal of the court at the trial to permit further similar affidavits of merits to be filed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-10\" pgmap=\"498\">3.
