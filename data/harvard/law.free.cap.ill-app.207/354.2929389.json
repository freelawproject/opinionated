Execution, \u00a7 312* \u2014 when execution creditor responsible for trespass by sheriff making wrongful levy of execution. To render an execution creditor responsible for a sheriff\u2019s alleged trespass in making a wrongful levy of execution, it is necessary to prove that the execution creditor through some authorized agent advised, directed or encouraged the abuse of the process complained of, of, knowing of its abuse and for its own benefit, ratified it, and this must be proved by legitimate evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b381-5\" pgmap=\"381\">4. Execution, \u00a7 309* \u2014 what essential to show ratification by creditor of abuse of process. The receipt by attorneys for an execution creditor of money paid, which is obtained under a wrongful execution levied by a sheriff, does not constitute ratification by the execution creditor as principal, unless it is shown that such execution creditor had knowledge of the material facts and circumstances of the tort of which the proceeds were the fruits.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b381-6\" pgmap=\"381\">5.
