From a judgment for plaintiff for $200, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-13\" pgmap=\"154(8) 155(171)\">It appeared that plaintiff, then between two and three years of age, suffered from hernia; that defendant was consulted by plaintiff\u2019s father; that hernia was not easily located in a child of that age and there was some doubt as to which side it was on. It further appeared that the father decided that it was on the left side and directed an operation, which was successfully performed, a hernia being found. Two weeks later the defendant was called again to see the child, who, he was informed, manifested pain, but failed to discover anything. He told the parents to inform him if there was any evidence of hernia on the right side, as he thought that might be the trouble. Three weeks later the father called on defendant and demanded a return of the money paid for the operation on the ground that it had been performed on the wrong side and informed defendant that a lump had appeared on the right side. Defendant offered to operate again without charge, but the father would not agree.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b155-7\" pgmap=\"155\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b155-8\" pgmap=\"155\">Physicians and surgeons, \u00a7 22<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when evidence insufficient to sustain verdict for plaintiff in action for negligence.
