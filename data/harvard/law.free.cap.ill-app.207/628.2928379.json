Hughes, master in chancery of Coles county Circuit Court, who sues for the use of John Hood, plaintiff, against the Chicago Bonding &amp; Surety Company, defendant. The bond was given by Edward Hood to plaintiff Hughes in accordance with the terms of the order distributing the estate of John Hood on the presumption of the latter\u2019s death and intestacy and defendant was surety on such bond. One claiming to be John Hood subsequently appeared and demanded of Edward Hood the amount given him under the order of distribution, to secure the refunding of which the bond in suit had been given, and notice of these facts were given defendant. Payment not having been received, action was brought on the bond. Defendant\u2019s demurrer to the declaration was overruled and it filed an unverified plea of non est factum and gave notice of special matters of defense. The case was tried by the court without a -jury, the issues were for plaintiff and judgment was for plaintiff for the amount of the bond, to be satisfied upon the payment of $1,238.79 and costs, from which judgment defendant appeals. The proceeding is similar to that of Beggs v. Chicago Bonding &amp; Surety Co., ante, p. 621.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b655-6\" pgmap=\"655\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b655-7\" pgmap=\"655\">1. Executors and administrators \u2014 what not essential to recovery by person whose estate was distributed on supposition of death. The vacating and setting aside of the order for the distribution of an estate on a presumption of death and intestacy is not essential to a recovery against the surety on a bond given by a distributee for the refund of his share in case the supposed deceased be alive. \u2022 Following Beggs v. Chicago Bonding &amp; Surety Co., ante, p. 621.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b655-9\" pgmap=\"655\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1712<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when error of trial court in overruling motion will not be reversed.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 1488* \u2014 when error in overruling motion to suppress deposition is harmless.
