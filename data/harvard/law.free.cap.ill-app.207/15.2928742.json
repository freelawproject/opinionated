Evidence, \u00a7 475<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 what constitutes preponderance. The preponderance of evidence held to be in defendant\u2019s favor, in an action for personal injuries alleged to be due to the sudden starting of a street car before plaintiff had time to get safely on board, where plaintiff testified in his own behalf and also another witness, who was not in position to see what occurred, and the conductor and two credible witnesses for defendant supported defendant\u2019s contention.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-13\" pgmap=\"41(20) 42(130)\">2. Instructions, \u00a7 88* \u2014 when instruction on determination of weight of evidence is erroneous. An instruction that the greater weight of evidence is not alone determined by the greater number of witnesses testifying to any fact or set of facts, but, in determining where the greater weight of evidence is, the jury should take into consideration the opportunities of the witnesses for seeing or knowing what they testified to or about, the probabilities or improbabilities of the truth of such testimony, and also take into consideration the connection, if any, between the witnesses and the parties and their interest in the result of the case, Held erroneous because the element of numbers, as well as of candor, fairness and intelligence, did not appear, and it had no reference to the consideration by the jury of all of the evidence in the case in arriving at their verdict.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\" pgmap=\"41\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.
