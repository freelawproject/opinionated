Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 327<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses are allowable under lease. Under a lease in which the lessor agrees to pay, in addition to rent and other matters, \u201call reasonable costs, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses that shall be made and incurred by the lessor in enforcing the covenants and agreements of this lease,\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred fn collecting rent for prior months are allowable as part of the judgment for rent.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b186-10\" pgmap=\"186\">2. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 327* \u2014 when lease containing provision for attorneys\u2019 fees is not unilateral. In an action on a lease to recover rent and attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in collecting rent for prior months, held that a lease by which the tenant agreed to pay, in addition to rent and other matters, all reasonable costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by the landlord in enforcing the covenants and agreements of the lease, was not unilateral for want of mutuality.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b186-11\" pgmap=\"186\">3. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 327* \u2014 when provision in lease for payment of attorneys\u2019 fees is valid. A provision in a lease for the payment by a tenant of'attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by the landlord in enforcing the covenants and agreements of the lease is valid as constituting an indemnity to the landlord against actual loss resulting from a failure of the tenant to keep his agreement.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b186-12\" pgmap=\"186\">4. Action, \u00a7 68* \u2014 when action for rent is not prematurely brought. The contention that an action to recover rent and attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in collecting previous instalments of rent was prematurely brought, held to be without merit where the.rent was payable in advance on the first day of each month and the rent for the months for which the action was brought was long past due.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-5\" pgmap=\"186\">Thompson, Moore &amp; Clark, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\" pgmap=\"186\">Mather &amp; Hutson, for. defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b186-13\" pgmap=\"186\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vole.
