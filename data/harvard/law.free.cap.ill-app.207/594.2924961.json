Trial, \u00a7 191<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when direction of verdict is improper. In a personal injury action, it is proper to direct a verdict for defendant where there is no evidence from which, taken by itself, with all fair inference to be drawn from it, the jury could, without acting unreasonably, find that all the material allegations in the declaration had been proven, but if there is such quantum of proof the giving of such instruction is reversible error.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b621-9\" pgmap=\"621\">2. Mines and minerals, \u00a7 84* \u2014 what constitutes wilful violation of Mine Employment Act. To constitute a wilful violation of the Mine Employment Act (J. &amp; A. j[ 7475 et seq.), it is necessary that there should be a reckless disregard of its provisions, and the employer is liable not only when the dangerous conditions are known to him but also when, by the exercise of reasonable care, he could have discovered them.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b621-10\" pgmap=\"621\">3.
