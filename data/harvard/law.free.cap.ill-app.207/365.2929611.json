Civil service, $ 26* \u2014 how jurisdiction of commission should he shown. The jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission should be shown in the return to a writ of certiorari to review its action in ordering the discharge of a clerk in the State grain inspection office, on the ground that he was seeking an office in violation of a rule of the commission.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\">4. Civil service, \u00a7 26* \u2014 when return of commission to writ of certiorari is insufficient to show jurisdiction. A return of the State Civil Service Commission to a writ of certiorari sued out to review the commission\u2019s action in ordering the discharge from service of a-clerk in the State grain inspection office, which merely recites the filing of a charge \u201cthat in violation of Rule No. 4, Section No. 10, of the State Civil Service Commission, he is seeking the office of assessor in the Town of Berwyn, in the County of Cook, State of Illinois, at the election to be held April 7, 1914,\u201d without setting forth such rule, or what it prescribes, and also recites the serving of relator with notice of the hearing, the holding of the same, the commission\u2019s finding that the charge was proved, its order for petitioner\u2019s discharge, and its certification to the appointing officer with directions to enforce the order, is insufficient to show jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the commission\u2019s proceedings, and the quashing of the record of such proceedings is warranted.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
