Henderson, judgment creditors of William Barber, complainants, against William Barber, Anna Margaret Barber, his wife, Pearl Frost, James E. Barber, G-r\u00e1ce W. Barber, Lizzie Heminghaus and Clara Heminghaus, defendants, to set aside a conveyanee of certain lands formerly owned by William Barber to one Pearl Frost, and by the grantee to Anna Margaret Barber, the consideration for which was the assumption of certain indebtedness of William Barber to defendants Heminghaus, and to require defendants James E. Barber and Grace W. Barber to turn over to complainants the sum of $1,000, secured by mortgage on premises, conveyed by defendant Anna Margaret Barber to James E. Barber, to satisfy an alleged indebtedness of William Barber to James E. Barber, the payment of such indebtedness constituting a part consideration for the deed from William Barber to Anna Margaret Barber. The case was later dismissed as to said James E. Barber, Grace W. Barber, and defendants Heminghaus, and defendant Frost filed a disclaimer. Later the bill was amended naming James E. Barber and Grace W. Barber as parties defendant. Prom a decree that the property conveyed to James E. and Grace W. Barber be subjected to the debts of William Barber and that James E. and Grace W. Barber pay to complainants such sum of $1,000, to be credited pro rata on the respective judgments, defendants bring error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b617-8\" pgmap=\"617\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b617-9\" pgmap=\"617\">1.
