Master and servant, \u00a7 302a* \u2014 when common-law doctrine of assumed risk is applicable under Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act.

Master and servant, \u00a7 822* \u2014 when instruction on damages under Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act is erroneous. In an action under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, an instruction on the assessment of damages which ignores the provision of the act that, while contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, the damages should be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the employee, is erroneous.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b619-11\" pgmap=\"619(26) 620(62)\">7.
