Laws, Act 3796). The board\u2019s hearing, conducted by a hearing officer, resulted in a finding that \u201cever since May 22, 1947 the respondent has not conducted, and is not now conducting, the premises herein concerned as a bona fide public eating place ...\u201d The board suspended appellant\u2019s on-sale liquor license indefinitely. Appellant then sought in the superior court an annulment of the board\u2019s order by a writ of review. After a hearing judgment went in favor of the board and this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>The issue tried in the superior court was tendered by appellant in its petition by the allegation \u201cThat plaintiff is and at all times herein mentioned has been operating as a restaurant at 22nd Street and Broadway . . . Oakland ...\u201d This was found to be \u201cuntrue and without support of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">The issue on this appeal is thus stated by appellant: \u201cDid appellant sell liquor in a bona fide restaurant, or in a public bar ? \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">\u201cIn determining whether or not a particular establishment qualifies under the Constitution it is the province of the board to ascertain the facts, for example, the physical aspects, equipment and supplies, the amount of food and liquor sold, and the manner in which the business is conducted . . . The existence of bona tides is not to be determined merely from the expressed intention of the licensee, but, like the determination of whether a place is a \u2018saloon\u2019 or a \u2018restaurant,\u2019 it must be ascertained objectively on the basis of all the physical characteristics and the actual mode of operation of the business ...\u201d <em>(Covert </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>29 Cal.2d 125,133 [173 P.2d 545].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The uncontradicted evidence at the board hearing shows that appellant has a lease on the ground floor of the building at the southwest corner of 22d Street and Broadway in Oakland. Within the leased area there are four rooms. In three of them liquor is sold across the bar, but in none of the three rooms are there any facilities for the preparation or service of food. In the other room there is a large restaurant but no bar. The kitchen connected with the restaurant is thoroughly equipped for the cooking and preparation of food but none of the kitchen or restaurant equipment is owned by appellant. On March 1, 1947, appellant, the lessee of the whole place, made a sublease to E. S. Ferrante and his wife of part of the ground floor, for the term of three years. The Ferrantes bought from a former sublessee all the kitchen and restaurant equipment for $27,500. Since then they have operated the large room under the name \u201cThe Cigar Box Restaurant,\u201d which room is connected by a doorway with the rooms where the bars are situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The lease is 22 typewritten pages in length and contains 35 articles embracing about as many subjects. Its preamble recites that the second party (Ferrante) \u201cdesires to operate a restaurant concession at the above described premises upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\u201d By article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>2 appellant grants to Ferrante \u201cthe exclusive right, privilege and commission to maintain and operate a restaurant\u201d on the premises. Article 3 calls for the deposit of $1,000 as a guarantee of performance by Ferrante. Article 4 provides for a \u201ctotal guaranteed payment\u201d by Ferrante of at least $13,500 (which is $375 a month for three years) \u201cfor the concession heretofore described\u201d payable in monthly installments. In addition it calls for certain percentages of Ferrante\u2019s gross monthly sales, with provisions for the cheeking and auditing of such sales by appellant. The agreement speaks of \u2018 \u2018 Second Party\u2019s business\u201d and of \u201cmoneys collected by Second Party in the operation of his business;\u201d it provides that \u201cSecond Party shall conduct all of his business in the premises on a strictly cash basis.\u201d In article 8(h) \u201cSecond Party agrees to conduct his business in the premises under the name of \u2018The Cigar Box Restaurant\u2019 ...\u201d Article 11 speaks of \u201cacceptance of possession of the premises\u201d by second party. By Article 14 appellant reserves the right to enter the premises at any and all times, during business hours to inspect the same also \u201cto post notices of nonresponsibility\u201d therein. Article 18 provides for reentry and repossession by appellant in case of a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\">While the document speaks in several places of a \u201crestaurant concession\u201d it is, after all, a lease pure and simple. It contains the provisions frequently found in leases of business property, some of which have been mentioned. There is nothing in it showing any connection or identity of the restaurant with the bars operated by appellant or suggesting any unity of operation, management or control. The only provision which mentions potable is the following condition found in section 7: \u201c Second Party agrees that he will not use or permit the premises to be used for any other purpose than for the sale of food and non-alcoholic beverages, with the exception of wine and beer ...\u201d a limitation contrary to actualities for Ferrante when asked \u201cIs any liquor of any kind sold in the restaurant?\u201d answered \u201cBeer and wine, and the liquor that is brought in from the bar and served on the tables with the food. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The percentages of the gross monthly sales of the restaurant are nothing but rental under the language of the lease, which provides, as we have seen, for a \u201ctotal guaranteed payment\u201d of at least $13,500 payable in monthly installments of $375. Such percentages are \u201cIn addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>minimum guaranteed payment. \u2019 \u2019 Hence they do not make the appellant a co-owner or partner. The testimony is undisputed that appellant has no share in the restaurant profits and could not be held for losses, if any. Ferrante testified \u201cI just operate the restaurant end of it\u2014that is what my profits are derived from.\u201d He hires the restaurant help and buys the food and supplies. When asked what was done whenever the restaurant got calls from the bars for food he answered \u201cWe serve it, or the cocktail girls from the bar come and pick it up. . . . Q. They pay for it? A. Yes . . . Q. And when the people in your restaurant want drinks, they are brought from the bar into the restaurant? A. Yes. Q. Ind vice versa? A. Yes.\u201d It appears that when food is ordered in the bars it is paid for by the waitress before it leaves the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The only decision which we are called upon to make is whether there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the court that appellant\u2019s allegation that it operated the premises as a restaurant was untrue. The evidence shows without conflict that the restaurant was operated not by appellant but by Ferrante and that the three bars were operated by appellant. It shows that the restaurant was operated: under a three-year lease which granted Ferrante \u201cthe exclusive right, privilege and commission [concession?] to maintain and operate a restaurant.\u201d It shows, further, that Ferrante owns all the restaurant and kitchen equipment and that he operates the restaurant business without any control or supervision by appellant, and whatever profit is made is Ferrante\u2019s own; that appellant has no interest in the restaurant business and Ferrante has no interest in the business done at appellant\u2019s three bars. Under this evidence the court could not have made any other finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Section 22 of article XX of the Constitution, adopted in 1934, reads: \u201c. . . Intoxicating liquors, other than beers, shall not be consumed, bought, sold, or otherwise disposed of for consumption on the premises, in any public saloon, public bar or public barroom within the State; provided, however, that subject to the aforesaid restriction, all intoxicating liquors may be kept and may be bought, sold, served, consumed, and otherwise disposed of in any bona fide hotel, restaurant, caf\u00e9, cafeteria, railroad dining or club car, passenger ship, or other public eating place, or in any bona fide club after such club has been lawfully operated for not less than one year . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>It is not within onr province to say that the restaurant operated by Ferrante is not a bona fide restaurant, caf\u00e9 or eating place, but simply to say, under the issue presented by appellant\u2019s petition for review, that <em>appellant does not operate it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\">It must be admitted that if a patron of the restaurant, seated at one of the tables, ordered a drink it would be obtained from the bar and brought to him at the table where he was eating, and, on the other hand, if a patron of one of the bars ordered food it would be obtained from the restaurant and brought to him in th\u00e9 bar, without his going into the restaurant, but it does not follow from such situation that the holder of the liquor license sells liquor in a bona fide restaurant, caf\u00e9 or other public eating place.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">As said in the Covert case, 29 Cal.2d 134 [173 P.2d 545], \u201cthe Constitution plainly contemplated the coexistence of two businesses\u2014sale of food and sale of liquors\u201d and \u201cthe existence of one business was made a prerequisite to the operation of the other. \u201d The record in this case presents an instance where one of these businesses, the sale of liquors, is operated by appellant, the other, the sale of food, by Ferrante.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Nourse, P. J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 12, 1948, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 9, 1948. Carter, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
