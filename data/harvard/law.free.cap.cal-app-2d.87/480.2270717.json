The complaint alleges that in November, 1945, plaintiff \u201cexecuted and delivered\u201d to one Hansberger a certain note and trust deed; that thereafter a second note and trust deed covering the same property were \u201cexecuted and delivered\u201d to Hansberger by plaintiff; \u201cThat plaintiff has defaulted in the payment of said notes, and said lots are about to be sold under the power of said deeds of trust. \u2019 \u2019 \u201cThat plaintiff gave said notes and deeds of trust to secure that payment of the purchase price of certain used oil well drilling equipment. \u201d \u201c That on or about the month of March, 1947, said Hansberger, was compelled by circumstances to assign said notes and deeds of trust to R. D. Clinard.\u201d It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>also alleged that at the time the trust deeds were delivered to Hansberger plaintiff was litigating the validity of certain oil leases \u201crecorded against said lots\u201d and, \u201cthat it was agreed at said time that plaintiff should have until the conclusion of said litigation to make payment of said notes.\u201d It is also alleged that \u201cHansberger told said Clinard of his acts and intentions concerning said deferment of payment of said notes, and said Clinard agreed to be bound thereby.\u201d It is then alleged that plaintiff received notice in August, 1947, \u201cof the impending sale of said lots on August 26th, 1947. \u2019 \u2019 The complaint sets forth alleged conversations between plaintiff and Clinard concluding with the allegation in substance that Clinard orally agreed to enter into a written agreement to postpone the sale and on the following day refused so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A summary of the complaint reveals that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is based on respondent\u2019s alleged violation of an oral agreement to enter into a written agreement concerning another written agreement, to wit, the trust deed. It is argued, however, by appellant that, \u201cthis oral agreement by Mr. Clinard in no wise altered the deeds of trust, but that he orally agreed to forbear and postpone the sale of the property for a time, and that he, thereby, waived his rights to continue with the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Appellant\u2019s contentions cannot be upheld. An agreement to postpone a valid sale of property beyond the date when said property may be sold under and according to the terms of a trust deed obviously is an agreement to alter the terms of the instrument. And as pointed out by respondent, \u201c [a] contract in writing may be altered by a contract in writing, or by an executed oral agreement, and not otherwise.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1698.) Therefore the oral agreement relied on by appellant is unenforceable. To hold otherwise would reduce a trust deed in any case to an unsubstantial if not worthless security.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The judgment and orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 28, 1948, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 8,1948.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
