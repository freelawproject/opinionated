J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9j\">Defendants were enjoined from using or occupying a designated parcel of real property in Alameda County, on the ground that the parcel in question was subject to certain restrictions, one of which reads as follows: \u201cNo person or persons of the Mexican race, or other than the Caucasian race shall use or occupy any buildings or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupying by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner, tenant, or occupant thereof.\u201d It was found that defendants are of the \u201cMexican race\u201d as those terms are used in the restrictive covenant, and that they own and have been using and occupying a building within the restricted district, and the injunction issued. Defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">The attempted enforcement by court action of such privately imposed restrictions is violative of the federal Constitution.. <em>(Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer, McGhee </em>v. <em>Sipes </em>(May 3,1948), 334 U.S. 1 [68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed.-]; <em>Cumings </em>v. <em>Hokr, </em>31 Cal.2d 844 [193 P.2d 742]; <em>Cassell </em>v. <em>Hickerson, </em>31 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>869 [193 P.2d 743]; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>31 Cal.2d 870 [193 P.2d 744]; <em>In re Laws, </em>31 Cal.2d 846 [193 P.2d 744].)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The judgment appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Ward, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
