Thereafter the trial proceeded with a jury, to no member whereof either party to this action objected. Under the circumstances narrated above, no error is predicable of the trial court\u2019s rulings upon the defendant\u2019s challenges for cause. It was wholly optional with the defendant to avail himself of his right of peremptory challenge, and having, by its exercise, succeeded in excluding the alleged incompetent persons from service as jurors, the error, if such there was, of overruling the challenges for cause, was effectually cured. 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 366; Friery v. People, 2 Abb. Dec. 215; People v. Court of Oyer &amp; Terminer, 83 N. Y. 436, 456. The case referred to by the defendant\u2019s counsel (Hildreth v. City of Troy, 101 N. Y. 234, 4 N. E. 559) is not to the contrary. There it appeared that a competent person was excluded as a juror upon the plaintiff\u2019s challenge for cause, against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>fendant\u2019s objection and exception, and it was held that such exclusion was error to the defendant\u2019s prejudice. Had the defendant, in the case at bar, refrained from his peremptory challenges, or exhausted them, and an incompetent person been permitted, against the former\u2019s objection and exception, to serve as a juror, the reversal of the judgment would have been imperative. People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 281, 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The trial court properly refused to charge, at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that there was no evidence tending to show that the acquaintance of the parties to this action had \u201cripened into mutual love and affection,\u201d that the plaintiff had failed to testify that \u201cthere was any love between her and the defendant,\u201d and that there was no evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had \u201csuffered any anguish of mind or humiliation\u201d in consequence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to marry her. The damages to which the plaintiff was entitled for the defendant\u2019s breach of his contract to intermarry with her were for the injury to her sensibilities, not to those of the defendant. Hence it was wholly immaterial that the defendant may not have entertained an amatory regard for the plaintiff. Her \u201canguish of mind\u201d was sensibly apparent from her disappointment because of the defendant\u2019s refusal to marry her at the appointed time after her repeated insistance that the contract to marry should be fulfilled, of which there was abundant evidence. It appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the contract to intermarry was to become determinate upon her deposit with the defendant of the sum of $500, and the plaintiff was permitted to prove, against the defendant\u2019s objection that the special damages were not alleged in the complaint, that such deposit was in fact made. The evidence was clearly admissible as a part of the res gestas,\u2014the facts of the contract to marry, and that the defendant\u2019s promise to marry the plaintiff became absolute; and that the recovery did not include the sum deposited is manifest from the trial court\u2019s charge, at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that in computing the damages to be awarded to the plaintiff the jury were not to allow her anything for the money alluded to. Chesebrough v. Conover, 140 N. Y. 382, 389, 35 N. E. 633; Holmes v. Moffat, 120 N. Y. 159, 162, 24 N. E. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Other exceptions appear in the record, but were not urged upon this appeal, and upon examination such exceptions prove to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The judgments of the general and trial terms of the court below should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
