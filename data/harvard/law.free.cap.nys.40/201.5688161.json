Proc. \u00a7 544, provides that \u201cupon the application of either party the court may, and, in a proper case, must, upon such terms as are just, permit him to make a supplemental complaint, answer or reply, alleging material facts which occurred after his former pleading, or of which he was ignorant when it was made.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b217-10\">2.

Bennett, 79 N. Y. 579), and they will be refused whenever it appears that an injustice would be worked by allowing a supplemental answer to be served (Holyoke v. Adams, 59 N. Y. 237). It is quite clear in this case, we think, that it would be unjust so far to decide the question of the admissibility of this evidence as might even inferentially be done by permitting the supplemental answer to be served. No injustice can be done to the defendant by denying this motion, because, if the adjudication in the former action is admissible in this case, it will have the same effect,' when proved as evidence, as it would if pleaded and proved after the pleading had been served.
