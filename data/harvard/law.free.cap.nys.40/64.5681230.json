J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO7\">The rule with respect to questions put to expert witnesses on the subject of value is, as stated by Judge Gray in Link v. Sheldon, 136 N. Y. 1, 32 N. E. 696: \u201cAn expert witness should be confined to questions which contain in themselves the facts assumed to be proven upon which his opinion is desired.\u201d There is an exception to the rule, and that is where the testimony of a single witness is called to the attention of the expert, and he is asked a question based upon the testimony of that witness. It is there the same as if the testimony had been read over to him and embodied in the question. That was the case of McCollum v. Seward, 62 N. Y. 316, where the expert was asked, \u201cWhat were his services as he, the plaintiff, described them worth?\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>case of Seymour v. Fellows, 77 N. Y. 178, when the query was, \u201cWhat, in your opinion, was the value of the services which Mr. Seymour stated he rendered?\u201d and the case of Miller v. Richardson, 88 Hun, 49, 34 N. Y. Supp. 506, where the court said: \u201cThere was no error in the reception of the evidence offered to prove the value of services performed by plaintiff, as described by the testimony. of another- witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">This case is not within the exception to the rule. The plaintiff having given testimony which covers a large number of folios, an expert is called and asked this question: \u201cQ. Have you heard all the testimony in this suit? A. Most of it.\u201d And is then asked: \u201cQ. Can you answer my question now, and give, as an estimate, from what you have heard of the testimony, what these services were reasonably worth?\u201d The jury could not possibly know what was in the witness\u2019 mind. He did not say: \u201cI have heard the testimony of the plaintiff, and, from what he stated, his services w\u00e9re worth so much.\u201d He only professed to speak from what he had heard of the testimony, and we do not know whether that excluded the more important parts of it or not. It is impossible to sustain that question withdut extending the exception to the rule further than the court of appeals or the supreme court has been willing to go, and perhaps without destroying the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant of aopeal in this court and the court below, and of the former trial to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
