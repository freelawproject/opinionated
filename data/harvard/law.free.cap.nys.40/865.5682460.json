The relief demanded in the complaint is that the defendant be compelled to give the infant such sums of money as to the court shall seem just and sufficient for his support and maintenance, and for such other relief as the court shall deem just.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">It appears from the evidence that the alleged agreement was oral. It is further disclosed by the record that the infant\u2019s father died in 1880, and his mother in 1882. He then lived with his aunt Mrs. Hall three months, when he was placed in an orphan asylum by her husband, and remained there two months. He was then taken therefrom by Mrs. Chasmer, a relative of his father, and remained with her until he was taken into defendant\u2019s family. The nearest relatives of the plaintiff at the time of the alleged agreement of adoption were his brother, three sisters, and a paternal grandmother. There were three other aunts besides Mrs. Hall. No guardian of the infant had ever been appointed. It is conceded that the defendant faithfully fulfilled his promise or agreement to support, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>maintain, and educate the plaintiff, and to treat him as his own son, up to the time he had attained his nineteenth year. Plaintiff's .counsel says that plaintiff \u201ccontinued in defendant\u2019s family under this agreement, brought up in idleness and luxury, with no idea of self-support.\u201d Plaintiff testified that $1,000 or $1,200 a year would be a reasonable amount for his support in the manner he had been supported by defendant. We have not been cited to, nor are we able to find, any authority for the maintaining of an action of this character, nor can we conceive of any principle of law upon which it may be upheld. It is a matter of no consequence to determine whether the agreement should be limited to the time of the plaintiff\u2019s majority, or to the time when he became of sufficient capacity to, or ability to, support himself. Assuming, however, that the defendant\u2019s obligation continued during the plaintiff\u2019s infancy, the facts are nevertheless wholly insufficient to establish a cause of action. There is no proof of any breach of the agreement as alleged in the complaint. The breach of the agreement is that the defendant did not, after plaintiff attained his nineteenth year, support and maintain him as he would his own son. Non constat but that defendant, under the same state of circumstances, would have compelled his own son to support himself. Surely the plaintiff can claim no other or greater privilege, benefit, or advantage than might be lawfully or rightfully refused by defendant to his own son. It would be a novelty in the law for a son to maintain an action against his father to compel him to furnish supplies of food and clothing, or to advance him the requisite funds for that purpose. A parent is bound to support his minor child, and is entitled to his services and to receive earnings. But here the defendant is not entitled to the plaintiff\u2019s services or Ms earnings, and yet it is contended that defendant is under a legal obligation to support the plaintiff in idleness and luxury. There is no reciprocity here, nor any consideration whatever. The evidence shows that defendant has faithfully fulfilled all the obligations or duties that could be reasonably expected or required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The respondent insists that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the appellant cannot prosecute the appeal \u00e1s a poor person. It is provided by section 1294 that any party aggrieved may appeal from a judgment or order. The appellant had a right to appeal from the judgment herein, but he cannot avail Mmself of the privilege of prosecuting the appeal as a poor person, so as to be absolved from the liability for costs of the appeal. Morse v. City of Troy, 38 Hun, 301. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
