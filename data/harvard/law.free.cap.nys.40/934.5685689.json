By consent, an interlocutory judgment was entered, dissolving the partnership,, and directing an accounting before a referee as to the partnership transactions. Defendant appealed from this judgment, and gave the following undertaking:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b951-8\">An accounting was liad, and the referee\u2019s report was confirmed, and judgment tvas entered thereon that plaintiff recover of defendant $4,815.57, and that \u201ceither party hereto may apply, at the foot of this decree for a distribution of any moneys or other assets of said copartnership not heretofore distributed.\u201d Plaintiff moved for an order directing payment to him of a portion of moneys of the firm whicli had been collected. The motion was denied, and plaintiff moved for a reargument, which was also denied. From the order denying the original motion and the motion for a reargument, plain-1iff appeals.

That judgment, although appealed from, is presumed to he correct; and, unless proceedings are stayed in the action pending the appeal, the plaintiff is entitled to his share of the money awarded him by that judgment. The undertaking which was given in this action is not sufficient to stay the proceedings of the plaintiff for the purpose of obtaining the payment of that money. Steinback v. Diepenbrock, 5 App. Div. 208, 39 N. Y. Supp. 137. Until those proceedings were stayed, the plaintiff was entitled to have the money paid over to him, within the rule laid down in that case. The order made in this case, therefore, was erroneous, and must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
