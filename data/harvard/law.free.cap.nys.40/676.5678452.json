The judgment of the court below, which was in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, was predicated on the fact that he had procured one Francesco Pennaehio to sign the following instrument with the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">\u201cNew York, Dec. 2nd, 1895.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">\u201cReceived from Mr. Francesco Pennaehio fifty 00/oo dollars, on account of the deposit of $400 to be paid on the signing of the lease for No. 100 Mott street, from Jan\u2019y 1st, 1896. Lease to be signed on Wednesday, at 12 o\u2019clock, Dec. 4th, 1895. Lease to be for ten years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">Pennaehio had subsequently refused to execute the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">That the instrument above set forth effected nothing more than an option on Pennachio\u2019s part to enter into a future lease, the terms of which remained to be agreed upon, is apparent from mere inspection. It does not even specify what rent the lessee was to pay, or how he was to pay it. The minds of the parties had not met. It was therefore not a lease, nor an agreement for a lease, and was equally unenforceable against Pennaehio at law and in equity. Levy v. Kottman, 11 Misc. Rep. 372, 32 N. Y. Supp. 241. The statute of frauds (Rev. St., Banks\u2019 Bros. 7th Ed., c. 7, tit. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 6. 8, 3) required the lease, exceeding one year, to be in writing; and the duty of the plaintiff, the performance of which was a condition precedent to his right of recovery, to procure a person to enter into a valid and enforceable lease, or agreement for a lease (Condict v. Cowdrey, 139 N. Y. 273, 34 N. E. 781; Levy v. Kottman, supra), was not fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to appellant to abide the event. AH concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
