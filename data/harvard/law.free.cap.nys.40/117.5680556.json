There was therefore a specific charge made against the relator, and upon it he was accorded a hearing, witnesses were examined, and the respondents found him guilty. There was conflicting-evidence; and, while we think that the commissioners might well have regarded the offense as one not to be visited with the extreme penalty they have inflicted upon the relator, still we cannot, in view of the condition of the record before us, and the fact that there was testimony to sustain the charges, inquire into the merits of the case, or interfere with the punishment they have imposed upon him. People v. Fire Com\u2019rs, 82 N. Y. 358; People v. Fire Com\u2019rs, 96 N. Y. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">It is urged by the relator, as a ground for reversing the proceedings of the respondents, that the witnesses who were called to substantiate the charge against him were not sworn. It is shown that there is a regulation or rule of \"the police department to the effect that, except in trivial cases, evidence on the trial or hearing of charges against policemen before the commissioners of police must b\u00e9 taken on oath. It is true that, in the record before us of the minutes of the hearing or trial of the relator before the police commissioners, there is no distinct statement that the witnesses called on either side were sworn; but the return of the commissioners states \u201cthat the said charges were duly brought to a hearing, and duly tried and heard, and publicly examined into, and investigated in the manner required by law and the rules and regulations of the board of police.\u201d This return is unchallenged, and, as has been frequently held, must be accepted as stating the truth, namely, that the rules and regulations of the board of police applying to investigations of this character were fully complied with, which included the swearing of witnesses. If the relator desired to raise the question respecting the administration of an oath to the witnesses, he should not have acquiesced in the return, but should have moved the court for a further return, calling the attention of the respondents to the exact matter the subject of his objection.

E. 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>As this return is conclusive upon us in its present form, we can do nothing but affirm the proceedings of the commissioners; and the writ of certiorari must be dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
