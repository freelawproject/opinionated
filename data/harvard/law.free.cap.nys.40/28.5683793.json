It is conceded that the hydrants which were purchased by the defendants and attached to the plaintiff\u2019s line of water pipes have been removed by the defendants, and, it not being clearly, established that the defendants have threatened or now threaten to do any of the things restrained by the original injunction order, it should not be restored. Besides, all of the equities of the complaint are denied in the answer, and in such a case an injunction pendente lite will not be continued where the plaintiff\u2019s right to the ultimate relief sought is not clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The order is affirmed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements. All concur, except WARD, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
