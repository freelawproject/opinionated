Day against Filippo Cappadonia and the E. L. Goodsell Company, Limited. From an order continuing an injunction restraining defendants from disposing of \u2022certain boxes of lemons consigned to defendant Cappadonia in any other manner than by selling the same at auction, and from paying over either to defendant Cappadonia or to the owner of the lemons so much of the proceeds of the sale as will be sufficient to satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 claim of $250, defendants appeal.

The shippers of the lemons have no claim against these plaintiffs, and have no right to offset as against them the claim against the defendant Cappadonia so as to destroy the plaintiffs\u2019 lien. The shippers of the goods make no claim here to the proceeds of the sale, and it would be unjust to allow the proceeds of the sale to be paid to the defendant Cappadonia to enable him to defraud the plaintiffs by repudiation of, his agreement with them that the goods themselves should be disposed of, and the amount that plaintiffs advanced repaid out of the sale of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">The order should therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
