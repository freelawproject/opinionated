Plaintiff jumped from the wagon, and sprained her ankle. The accident occurred September 7, 1892, and the action was tried June 13, 1895. Plaintiff testified as to the injuries sustained by her, as follows: \u201cI was terribly frightened and nervous, and I knew that, and I injured my ankle. I feel the effects of the injury to my ankle yet. I consulted a physician. He put me in the .wagon, and wanted to drive the horse. I was frightened, and did not want to go into the wagon. * * I must have been prevented from business for five or six weeks. I remember perfectly in October, the week beginning the 12th, I was trying to walk; got out at the time to stand on it: That was about the first time. That was the week beginning October 12th. That was the first I began to walk on my- foot with any degree of comfort. I have been lame since Sunday. I have to go to the druggist\u2019s quite frequently. Easter week I was in the house a week with that same ankle. I was never troubled with it before this accident. I have felt, besides my ankle, nervousness,\u2014extreme nervousness,\u2014particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>while riding. * * * I paid out for medicines and liniment to apply on the leg between five and ten dollars, I would suppose. I feel the effects yet. I have been real lame since Sunday, because I am not accustomed to walking. When I walk any distance I feel it. I cannot walk with the same degree of freeness as I did before this thing occurred.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1133-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>Appeal from circuit court, Ulster county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1133-12\">Action by Annie L.

We are not, however, satisfied that the evidence shows any such injury to the plaintiff as warranted the jury in awarding her the sum of $1,000 as compensation therefor. We do not feel disposed to enter upon the discussion of the evidence in relation to her injuries, ' and the loss occasioned to her thereby. It would, perhaps, be hardly fair to the plaintiff to do so in the event of there being a new trial. We think the verdict should be set aside as excessive, and a new trial granted, unless the plaintiff, within 30 days after service of a copy of the order embodying this decision, stipulates to reduce the amount of the damages to the sum of $500, in which event the judgment, as so modified, should be affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
