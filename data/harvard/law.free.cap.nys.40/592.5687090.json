The interior of the car was arranged with berths on each side, leaving an aisle extending from end to end; and, to insure the comfort of the occupants during occasional inclement weather, the defendant had provided an oil stove, which was about three feet in height, and supplied with iron props attached to and under the base in quadrangular position. When in use, the stove stood in the center of the aisle. At the time of the fire, the stove had been in use for a month or more, and was then in use. The fire was caused by contact with the interior of the. car of the ignited oil which had escaped by the overturning of the stove. The litigants, both conceding that its presence was known to all the occupants, and that the stove was plainly visible, varied in their explanations as to how it came to be overturned; the plaintiff\u2019s version being that it was done by one McDermott, then also in the defendant\u2019s employ, as a watchman at the gates of the show grounds, in walking backward up to and against the stove, while conversing with others in the car; the defendant\u2019s, that the stove was upset in a scuffle between McDermott and some others of the employ\u00e9s and occupants. It nowise appeared upon the trial that the stove was in- anything but good order, that the place of its use was not ordinarily safe and free from the risk of fire, or that the defendant had been remiss in the selection of any of its employ\u00e9s. That the defendant did provide a means of enforcing order and discipline among its employ\u00e9s was apparent from the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s employment for such purpose. From the record, therefore, we are forced to conclude that the defendant\u2019s negligence was predicated of the fact alone that it had omitted to securely fasten the stove to the floor of the car, such omission having been repeatedly alluded to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">We do not approve the conclusion of the court below. The plaintiff and the person or persons who were directly responsible for the accident were engaged in the same general service, worked under the same master or control, and severally derived their authority and compensation from the same source. True, the plaintiff\u2019s services differed in kind from McDermott\u2019s, and both differed from the services of the other employ\u00e9s. But the plaintiff, McDermott, and each of such other employ\u00e9s co-operated to the same end,\u2014the conduct and maintenance of the defendant\u2019s business in and about which they were particularly employed. They were therefore fellow servants, each having assumed the risk oi loss from the others\u2019 careless conduct, as an incident of the employment, and no liability whatever attached to the defendant because of such conduct. Cooley, Torts (2d Ed.) 639; Thomp. Neg. 1026; 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">That the fire was wholly caused by the carelessness of one or more of the plaintiff\u2019s fellow servants was conclusive from the facts in evidence, whether the plaintiff\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s version of the happening of the accident be accepted as the correct one. It may be that, if the stove had been fastened to the floor of the car, the actual violence of McDermott\u2019s impact therewith would not have been suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>dent to overturn it; but the fact remains that the accident did result from such impact, under circumstances which admitted of no inference that it was owing to anything but the disregard of ordinary care upon the part of one or more of the defendant\u2019s servants and the plaintiff\u2019s fellow servants. . The master is held to the same degree of care to which his servants are held,\u2014reasonable care, that degree of care which an ordinarily prudent person may be expected to exercise under the like circumstances. The defendant was not, therefore, required to exercise extraordinary caution, and to resort to unusual means to avoid an accident. It had the right to assume that each of its servants would be ordinarily vigilant to avoid inflicting damage upon himself or upon his fellow servants. Hence negligence upon the defendant\u2019s part was not predicable of the fact merely that the accident might not have happened as it did if something that was omitted had been done. The test of negligence is not that the person charged therewith might have avoided the accident by a particular measure to that end, but that he either did what an ordinarily prudent person would not have done, or did not do what an ordinarily prudent person would have done, under the like circumstances. Leonard v. Collins, 70 N. Y. 90. That the defendant was censurable in such a regard did not appear from the evidence in the record. Our conclusion to reverse the judgment for insufficiency of the evidence makes the discussion of other grounds urged for the appellant unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
