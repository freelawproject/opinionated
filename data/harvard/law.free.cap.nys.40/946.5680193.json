They entered into an agreement whereby the defendant was to publish the plaintiff\u2019s works, and to pay the plaintiff a specified royalty upon the books sold. The plaintiff, in his complaint, asks for an account of all the books sold by the defendant under this contract. In such an action, upon proper papers, the right to an examination before trial is almost a matter of course. The plaintiff here states that the defendant\u2019s testimony is material and necessary for the prosecution of the action; that he expects to prove by the examination \u201cthe number of books printed; the number of books sold, to whom sold, and the amounts received therefor; the number of books on hand, and the number of damaged books returned; and the amount of all charges and claims against the plaintiff, and the nature of the same.\u201d He also avers that the facts which he thus expects to proA'e are \u201cwithin the knowledge of the defendant, but are not within the knowledge of the plaintiff, and the testimony of the said defendant is taken for the purpose of being read by and on the part of the plaintiff on the trial of this action.\u201d This was amply sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to an order for the examination of the defendant before trial. As to the subpoena duces tecum, it is sufficient to say that, while the plaintiff cannot, in this proceeding, have a discovery of books and papers, he may, upon the examination of the defendant, prove any entry or paper tending to substantiate his claim. To effectuate this, a subpoena duces tecum is appropriate. The use which may be made of such books and papers upon the examination is stated in Horst v. D. G. Yuengling Brewing Co., 1 App. Div. 629, 37 N. Y. Supp. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for the examination of the defendant, and the subpoena duces tecum, denied, with $10 costs; and a day will be fixed in the order for the examination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
