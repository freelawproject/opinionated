Whether it would he proper, in such case, under any circumstances, \u2022to grant the relief which was given by this order, before final judgment in the action, it is not necessary to determine. Certainly, such relief cannot be granted by order, unless the parties interested in the mortgage are made parties to the action, so that the rights of everybody can be determined, and the lien of every party to the action lie transferred to the money which is substituted for the property upon which the mortgage was given. That was not the case here. Mrs. Bullard, whose right to a certain portion of this property is alleged in the complaint, is not made a party to this action; and for that reason, without discussing any other reasons, the mortgage should not have been canceled, and it was erroneous to grant the order, which must he reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
