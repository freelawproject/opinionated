The instrument further provided, \u201cBut, if the said Martha A. Cronin shall not survive me, then this agreement shall be of no effect;\u201d that is to say, tha,t she should not, in such case, be entitled to both payment and the land. The instrument is evidence of the loan, and therefore of his indebtedness to her. She did not sign the instrument. She did not agree that in case he survived her the loan should be forgiven, and the right to payment renounced. If that was her intention, it would have been easy to express it in the writing. We cannot imply any such agreement upon her part. Its omission from the writing may have been because its insertion was not requested, or, if requested, was refused. The writing is the husband\u2019s, binding him to payment, and something more, if she survived, but binding neither if he survived. It contains no waiver by the wife of her right to payment. By her prior decease the written agreement is made of \u201cno effect,\u201d and the parties are remitted to such obligations and duties as the loan and its nonpayment imply. We do not think the agreement usurious. There is no certain agreement to pay excessive interest. Insurance Co. v.
