The granting of such motions would be a matter of course, in ordinary cases. But in these c\u00e1ses it appears that each of the judgments after modification as to damages, \"was unanimously affirmed by the appellate division; and, inasmuch as the new constitution (article 0, \u00a7 9) provides that no unanimous decision of the appellate division of the supreme court that there is evidence supporting or tending to sustain the finding of fact on a verdict not directed by the court shall be reviewed by the court of appeals, there is no necessity for a stay, because, upon the face of the papers, the appeal must be fruitless.
