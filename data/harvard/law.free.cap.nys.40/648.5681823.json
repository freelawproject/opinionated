The sale was consummated by the delivery of a bill of sale and the transfer of the possession of the saloon to the defendant, and at the time the latter deducted from the purchase money\u2014Firstly, $6,478, believed by both parties to be the amount of the mortgage debt alluded to; and, secondly, $250, retained under a special agreement then and there entered into, whereby the defendant was to apply so much of such sum as was required to discharge certain arrears of water rents, the amount of which had not been ascertained, and to pay the overplus, if any, to Jackson. The residue of the purchase money was paid in cash and notes since transferred to third persons, and also paid. The water rents subsequently proved to .be but $110, and the actual amount of the mortgage debt $6,782.56, which last-mentioned sum the defendant paid by his own promissory notes to the Budweiser Brewing Company, secured by a new mortgage of the same fixtures, executed by him. In this action by Jackson\u2019s assignee to recover the overplus of the sum retained by the defendant to satisfy the arrears of water rents, the latter sought to avail himself of the sum paid by him in excess of the sum agreed, to be paid upon the sale and purchase of the saloon, owing to the mistake with regard to the amount of the mortgage deist.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The facts narrated above appear from uncontroverted evidence at the trial, and are not challenged upon this appeal. Indeed, the only grounds upon which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asks us to uphold the judgment in his client\u2019s favor are that there was no proof of am assignment of the mortgage debt to the defendant, that the latter\u2019s payment of such debt did, not inure to Jackson\u2019s benefit, and-that non constat Jackson is not under a continuing liability to tlie Budweiser Brewing Company therefor. Obviously, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the court below totally misapprehended the defendant\u2019s claim. It was not that, by subrogation or assignment, he was entitled to demand and receive from the plaintiff's assignor, Jackson, any part of the latter\u2019s indebtedness to the Budweiser Brewing Company, but that owing to the mutual mistake of fact with regard to the amount of the mortgage debt, which at the time of the sale of the saloon was a lien upon the fixtures thereof, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor had received from the defendant $304.50, which, ex aequo et bono, he was bound to return at the time of his assignment of the overplus of the sum retained by the defendant to satisfy the arrears of water rents. 18 Am. &amp; Eng.

The sum paid by the defendant in excess of the agreed purchase money upon the sale of the saloon was recoverable by him in an action ex contractu, as for money had and received by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to his use.

Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 501, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial had, tvith costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
