The discretion referred to in Hart v. Kohn (City Ct. N. Y.) 33 N. Y. Supp. 272, was a determination as to whether the party had an interest. Here that question has been determined in favor of the applicant, and section 452 of the Code of Civil Procedure is mandatory that, where the applicant has an interest, the court must direct him to be brought in, Rosenberg v. Salomon, 144 N. Y. 92, 38 N. E. 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">That part of the order appealed from is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
