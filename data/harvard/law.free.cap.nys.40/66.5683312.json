After the motion was noticed, an amended complaint was served, to which it does not appear that any answer has been interposed. As the service of an amended complaint destroys the issues raised by the original pleadings, and as the defendant has not joined issue upon the amended complaint by serving an answer, the motion should have been denied; it having been many times held that, until the cause is at issue, the application for discovery of books and papers for use upon the trial is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, but with leave to plaintiff after issue joined to renew the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
