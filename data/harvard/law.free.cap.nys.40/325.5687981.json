The effect of the covenant was practically to widen a 50-foot street into an 80-foot street. This may be as advantageous where the property fronting on the street is used for business purposes as where it is used for residences. Whether this be so or not, the parties covenanted for an 80-foot street, and persons claiming under that covenant are entitled to its benefits, unless a common course of action by the parties in interest shows that they have abandoned the maintenance of its conditions. This question should be left to the trial of the action, and not determined on affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, to abide the event of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
