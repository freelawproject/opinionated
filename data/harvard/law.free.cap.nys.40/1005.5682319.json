The complaint also set out the alleged libelous article, which, after stating resolutions of the penitentiary commissioners directing a transfer to the credit of the county of $70,000 from the earnings of the penitentiary, was as follows:</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1021-12\">Appeal from special term, Rensselaer county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1021-13\">Action by James McIntyre against the Journal Company for libel.

This explains why they fought so desperately to retain James McIntyre in office. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>for the removal of their creature from the superintendency of the institution means that they will be deprived of the means which caused them to buy so many, elections. They are so desperate over this prospect that the public would not be surprised if they should resort to other measures to prolong their hold on the penitentiary. Before this, they have used the power of the court for iniquitous purposes, and it would not be strange if they should do it again. The figures contained in the above resolution are highly significant, and the question naturally arises, how does it come to pass tliat the penitentiary commissioners are able, in the spring of 1895, to turn over $70,000, when, in 1894, only a surplus of $27,000 was reported? Has the surplus ever before exceeded $30,000? In view of existing conditions, these inquiries are pertinent, and may lead to an examination which will show conclusively why the desperate ringsters are so unwilling to give up their hold on this building. The Journal has contended time and again that there was juggling with the accounts of the prison. This seems to be indicated in the reports of the years 1875 and 1894. In these two years the number of prisoners in the penitentiary was the same. Yet in 1875, when high prices were the rule, it cost only $75,000 to maintain the prisoners, and $28,000 was turned in to the county. In 1894, with prices down to bed rock, it cost $100,000 to maintain the same number of prisoners, and only a surplus of $27,000 was reported. These figures indicate that- somebody was making a good thing out of the penitentiary, and it was not the taxpayers of Albany county either. It is generally believed that Superintendent McIntyre is,a rich man, though, when he went into office, he was not burdened with an over-suppfy of this world\u2019s goods. Did he make this money out of his salary? If he made it out of the proceeds of the work of prisoners, he has done an illegal thing. The fact is, the whole prison system is rotten to the core, and to prevent shameful revelations, and at the same time retain hold of the means that has provided a great corruption fund, there is reason to believe that the ringsters will make a further fight.\u201d</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1022-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Recorder Co., 144 N. Y. 144, 38 N. E. 1009), we have no doubt that it is libelous. It charges the plaintiff, in substance and effect, with maladministering his office in the past for unlawful purposes, and with being such a corrupt character that he is ready and willing to repeat and continue the like maladministration, and so facile an instrument in the hands of certain \u201cringsters\u201d that he is willing to prostitute his office to sub-serve their unlawful purposes. We consider-the article as a whole. It is so written as to leave the impression upon the mind of the reader that the plaintiff has been, and still is, an officer who has' criminally abused, and is willing to continue to abuse criminally, his very responsible office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">The interlocutory judgment is affirmed, with costs, with the usual leave to the defendant to answer upon payment of costs in this court and below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
