The complaint contained no general averment of negligence on the part of the defendant, or any of its servants, but particularized the omission of the defendant\u2019s servant in charge of the car to give timely warning of the latter\u2019s approach as the only cause of the accident. On the trial it appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s admission that he was aware of the approach of the car when it was at Fourteenth street, more than 100 feet distant from the place at which he sought to cross the tracks. The evidence adduced in support of the cause of action was to the effect that, while no warning of the car\u2019s approach was in fact given, its violent impact with the plaintiff\u2019s cart was the result wholly of the omission to stop the car or slacken its speed, whereby the accident would have been avoided, in the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the defendant\u2019s servant. Ho amendment of the complaint was asked for or had, and, when the introduction of the plaintiff\u2019s direct evidence was concluded, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit on the grounds that there was \u201cno proof of any negligence on the part of the defendant as claimed in the complaint,\u201d and that \u201cno negligence whatever\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>was shown. The motion was renewed at the close of the whole case, and again denied. These denials were erroneous. The plaintiff knew of the approach of the car when he attempted to cross' the track. Obviously, therefore, the omission to warn him of the car\u2019s approach was not a proximate cause of the accident, not actionable negligence (16 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 428); and while, under a general averment of negligence, a recovery may be had upon proof of any state of facts from which it appears that the injuries complained of were caused wholly by the omission of reasonable care on the part of the defendant (Oldfield v. Railroad Co., 14 N. Y. 310, 314; Edgerton v. Railroad Co., 39 N. Y. 227, 230), it does not follow that, without an amendment of the complaint which charges negligence in the omission to perform particular acts, or without the litigation by consent of the parties of a cause of action not alleged, a recovery is permissible upon proof that the accident resulted from the defendant\u2019s omission of reasonable care in some other respect (Boehm v. Mace, 28 Abb. N. C.138, 18 N. Y. Supp. 106; Woolsey v. Trustees, 69 Hun, 489, 23 N. Y. Supp. 410.; Zboynski v. Railroad Co., 10 Misc. Rep. 7, 30 N. Y. Supp. 540; Parker v. Railroad Co., 16 Barb. 315). The recovery in every case must be \u201csecundum allegata et probata\u201d (Romeyn v. Sickles [N. Y. App.] 15 N. E. 698), and the rule forbids, though the action may not be deprived of its character as one for negligence, recovery upon proof of a cause of action other than the one alleged (Pom. Rem. &amp; Rem. Rights, p. 610, \u00a7 553, etc.; 28 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law,-59, note 5). The evidence urged in support of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery was relevant to the cause of action alleged (Plainer v. Plainer, 78 N. Y. 90), and admissible as a part of the res gestee. Hence there is no room for inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of the evidence in some instances that it intended to consent to the substitution and litigation of a cause of action other than the one alleged. Frear v. Sweet, 118 N. Y. 454, 23 N. E. 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">The judgment of the court below at general and trial terms must be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
