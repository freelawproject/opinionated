On the 3d day of January, 1888, the plaintiff procured a transcript, and caused the same to be filed in Wyoming county clerk\u2019s office, where the judgment was dul)' docketed on that day. On the 23d of February, 1888, the transcript of said judgment was filed, and the judgment was docketed in the clerk\u2019s office of Brie county. On the Sth day of April, 1888, the plaintiff, at the town of Warsaw, Wyoming county, died, and on the 30th of April, 1888, Mary Agar and Thomas B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6c\">It was the duty of the justice of the peace to furnish a transcript of the judgment. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3017. It was the duty of the county clerk of Wyoming county to file the same, and docket the judgment \u201cas of the time of the receipt of the transcript, in the book kept by him for that purpose.\u201d He performed that duty in pursuance of section 3017 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it existed January 3, 1888. That section then provided, viz.: \u201cThenceforth the judgment is deemed a judgment of the county court of that county and must be enforced accordingly.\u201d In 1894, section 3017 of the Code of Civil Procedure was amended so that the county clerk was authorized to file- the transcript and docket the judgment \u201cif within six years after the rendition thereof.\u201d It is to be observed that that limitation was not in the section at the time the transcript was filed and the judgment docketed, to wit, January 3, ,1888. It is further provided in section 3017 of the Code that after filing and docketing, viz.: \u201cThenceforth the judgment is deemed a judgment of the county court of that county and must be enforced accordingly. * *\u201d Notwithstanding the</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">provision we have just quoted, it was held in Dieffenbaeh v. Boch, 112 N. Y. 621, 20 N. E. 560, th\u00e1t an action may not be brought upon such a judgment after six years from the time of its rendition. It has been held in several cases that under the law as it was prior to the amendment of 1894 an application for leave to issue execution might be granted. See sections 1251, 2435, Code Civ. Proc.; In re Halloclc\u2019s Estate (Sup.) 29 N. Y. Supp. 555; Waltermire v. Westover, 14 N. Y. 16; Johnson v. Railroad Co., 54 N. Y. 416; Kincaid v. Richardson, 25 Hun, 237; Herder v. Collyer (Com. Pl.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 513; Green v. Hauser (Super. Buff.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 660; Bolt v. Hauser (Co. Ct.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 397, affirmed 57 Hun, 567, 11 N. Y. Supp. 366, 368; Brown v. Hyman (Co. Ct.) 27 N. Y. Supp. 436; Townsend v. Tolhurst, 57 Hun, 40, 10 N. Y. Supp. 378; Bank v. Quackenbush (N. Y.) 38 N. E. 728. Davidson v. Horn, 47 Hun, 51, differs from the case in. hand, as the transcript was filed and the judgment docketed in the county court more than six years after the renditon of the judgment, and in the course of the opinion it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">\u201cThe right o\u00ed the judgment debtor to avail himseli of the statute of limitations as a bar became perfect before the transcript was filed with the clerk. And that right was a vested one, which could not be defeated even by subsequent legislation. * * .* And it is difficult to see how the defendant could be divested of such right by the act of filing the transcript and docketing the judgment at the instance of the judgment creditor, inasmuch as the statute does not declare that it may be done after the time such right has accrued to the-.-judgment debtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Following the cases cited they lead to an affirmance of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
