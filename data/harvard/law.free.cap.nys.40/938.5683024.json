Sebley v. Nichols, 32 How. Prac. 182; Cutter v. Morris, 7 N. Y. St. Rep. Stevens v. Railroad Co. (Super. N. Y.) 9 N: Y. Supp. 707. The cases contra deal mainly with minutes obtained for use upon the trial. It is said, however, in Pfaudler Co. v. Sargent, 43 Hun, 154, that the stenographer\u2019s fees are not taxable, even when procured for the purpose of enabling a party to prepare amendments to a case. This was not necessary to the decision of that case, and it seems to overlook rule 32 of the general rules of practice, which provides that, \u201cif the party proposing the amendments claims that the case should be made to conform to the minutes of the stenographer, he must refer at the end of each amendment to the proper page of such minutes.\u201d The respondent is thus practically compelled to procure the- stenographer\u2019s minutes if he desires a fair .and truthful record. He can only obtain this by complying with the rule. Thus the rule, in substance, makes the disbursement \u201cnecessary, according to the course and practice of the court,\u201d as provided in section 3256 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellant here presented an affidavit tq the clerk to the effect that \u201cthe copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes was actually and necessarily obtained and used for the purpose of preparing the amendments of plaintiff to the defendants\u2019 proposed case on appeal.\u201d Under the circumstances, we think the item should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a retaxation granted, with $10 costs, and the item allowed.
