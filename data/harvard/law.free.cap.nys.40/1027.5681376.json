On the application by the executor for a final judicial settlement of his accounts while a proceeding for the foreclosure of the mutual Company\u2019s mortgage was pending, the Washington Company filed objections to the account filed, setting up the indebtedness of testator to it, and asking that the court direct the executor to hold the assets of the estate until the mortgage held \"by said company should become due, and it should be ascertained whether the security covered by said mortgages would be adequate to the full payment thereof. The mortgages held by the Mutual Company wore foreclosed, and the sale resulted in a deficiency judgment of ?)4,9\u00fc8.5\u00d3. The mortgage held by the Washington Company became due on June 1, 1890.. The application by the Mutual Company to compel payment of the deficiency judgment was made on March 27, 1890.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1043-9\">Appeal from surrogate\u2019s court, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1043-10\">Motion by the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to compel Henry W.

The due date of the mortgage of the Washington Life Insurance Company was June 1, 1896. In view of that fact, we think it would have been proper, where the question of the value of the security was involved, and it could be rendered certain by the proceedings to foreclose, which the attorneys for the Washington Life Insurance Company were instructed to institute, to awrait the result, when it could be definitely determined whether the property was' sufficient or not to satisfy the debt; and that it was improper, in that state of the record, to decide the motion, and direct the payment of the deficiency judgment of the Mutual Life Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>We think, therefore, the order should be reversed, and the motion remitted to the surrogate to take further proof, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
