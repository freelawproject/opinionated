The order of the general term and special term are reversed. It appears from the record that this application was disposed of by the general term, and by the special term of the city court, on the theory that it was an application for interpleader; whereas, it was a motion under chapter 689 of the Laws of 1892, providing (section 115) that in all actions against any savings bank to recover for moneys on deposit therewith, if there be any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>or persons, not parties to the action, who claim the same fund, the court m which the action is pending may, on the petition of such savings bank, make an order amending the proceedings in the action by making such claimants parties defendant thereto. It appears that the person named in the petition of the bank claimed the fund in suit, and the motion should be granted, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Order reversed, and motion granted, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
