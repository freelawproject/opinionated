From so much of an order as denies defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars of the names of the persons in whose presence respondent alleges and intends to prove that the alleged false and defamatory utterances mentioned in the complaint were made, or that the complaint be made more definite and certain by so specifying, defendant appeals.

Woodruff v. Austin (Sup.) 38 N. Y. Supp. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">The defendant also asked, in the same motion, for the particulars, in order to prevent surprise, and be prepared for trial of the cause; but on that branch, the motion being made before issue joined, it was premature. Paper Co. v. West (Sup.) 38 N. Y. Supp. 229; Pots v. Herman, 7 Misc. Rep. 5, 27 N. Y. Supp. 330. The names of the person or persons in whose presence and hearing the words were spoken seem to us to be of grave importance, as otherwise the defendant, upon the trial, may be taken wholly by surprise, by the production of testimony he is wholly unprepared to explain or contradict otherwise than by his own denial; and we think it would be a proper exercise of discretion to direct a bill of particulars specifying the names of the person- or persons in whose presence the words are claimed to have been spoken. Stiebeling v. Lockhaus, 21 Hun, 457. For this relief the defendant is granted leave to apply at special term.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">The appeal must be dismissed, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
