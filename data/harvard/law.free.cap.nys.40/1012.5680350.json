He died in 1887, leaving the defendant, who had been his life companion for nearly 50 years, and no descendants. He made his will, which was admitted to probate; and the plaintiff, who was a neighbor of testator, and the defendant, were named as executors. The plaintiff assumed he had a right to the immediate occupancy of this little farm, and promptly took possession of it, exercising control over it, to the exclusion of defendant. That continued for the period of six years, when defendant succeeded in acquiring control of the farm, and plaintiff brought this action to construe the will, and in assertion of his right to the possession and control of the real estate of which decedent died seised. The will does not vest in him any title to the farm during the lifetime of the widow. The devise to him is explicitly limited to such part as may remain after her death. No authority whatever is vested in the executors, so that plaintiff cannot maintain his action on the assumption of the creation of a trust. While no specific words, as contended for by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, are essential to cr\u00e9ate a trust, yet the intention of the testator to vest a farm must clearly appear in the instrument, and there is no language in this will from which such a construction can be spelled out. It was the obvious intention of the testator to make suitable provision for his widow so far as his small estate would permit, and he did this first by the bequest of his few dollars of personal estate, and then by permitting her \u201cto draw from the real estate,\u201d if necessary for her comfort. She is the one to determine that necessity. In re Grant (Sup.) 16 N. Y. Supp. 716; Smith v. Van Ostrand, 64 N. -Y. 278. That the necessity exists in this case is quite apparent. She has no other property, is in the decline of life, and certainly should have whatever property a fair construction of her husband\u2019s will accords to her.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1028-13\">The complaint must be dismissed, with cost against the executor personally, as the small patrimony should not be depleted further to aid the plaintiff in his attempt to wrest it from the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1028-9\">Appeal from special term, Chautauqua county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1028-10\">Action by Alfred M.
