The claim of plaintiff in this action, and the action itself, could be settled by agreement between the parties, by payment of a less sum than that claimed by plaintiff, it not being a liquidated debt. <em>(Cumber </em>v. <em>Wane, </em>1 Smith Lea. Cases, p. 439*, and cases there cited by editor in the notes to sixth American edition; <em>Harper </em>v. Graham, 20 Ohio, 105; Stats. 1887-8, p. 31.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-10\">The settlement pleaded by the defendant in this action is shown by the judgment roll offered in evidence to have been adjudicated between the same parties in another action, so that it was <em>res 'judicata </em>at the time of the trial in this action. The judgment being pleaded as an estoppel, the judgment roll should have been admitted, and the jury instructed, that by the judgment the plaintiff was estopped to deny the settlement alleged in the answer. <em>(Duchess of Kingston\u2019s Case, </em>20 How. St. Tr. 538; <em>Gahan </em>v. <em>Maingly, </em>1 Irish T. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>54; <em>Outram </em>v. Morewood, 3 East, 345; <em>Baxter v. N. E. M. Ins. Co., </em>6 Mass. 277.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">\u00b0 The evidence in said action is insufficient to sustain the verdict, in that it fails to show that plaintiff ever became entitled to the commissions for which he sues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">The defendant did not give to plaintiff the exclusive right to sell the land. Hot having done so, defendant had the right to sell the land at any time before the plaintiff should bring to him a purchaser able and willing then and there to buy the land on the terms proposed. <em>(Chilton </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>1 E. D. Smith, 150; <em>Glentworth </em>v. <em>Luther, </em>21 Barb. S. C. 145; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>5 Bosworth, 73; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Bierling, </em>31 N. Y. 462.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">When plaintiff brought Gusheon to defendant, as a purchaser, nothing further was done than for defendant to give Gusheon, without consideration, a promise that he should have fifteen days to complete his search and purchase at a price certain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">The defendant had the right, at any time before the bargain was closed, to recall his offer and sell to another.

Brooks, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-11\">The plea of a former adjudication could not be an answer to this demand. The matter set up is no defense. The question whether the cause of action in this suit was released could not by any possibility be at issue in that suit, nor was that Court competent to determine the question. The rule is well settled in this Court: 1. It must be the judgment of a competent Court. 2. It applies only to matters put in issue on the record, and not to matters which come in question incidentally\u2014that is, it applies to facts in issue as distinguished from facts in controversy. 3. The point must be directly determined by the former judgment. The issue here is whether Phelan\u2019s claim for brokerage was paid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>settled. That question could not possibly be at issue on the record, or tried, or determined by the County Court in the action of forcible entry, though it might become incidentally a fact in controversy; but it did not become even that. <em>(Fulton </em>v. Hanlon, 20 Cal. 450; <em>Hardenbergh </em>v. Bacon, 33 Cal. 356; <em>Garwood </em>v. <em>Garwood, </em>29 Cal. 514; <em>Love </em>v. <em>Waltz, </em>7 Cal. 250; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>9 Cal. 130; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>25 Cal. 266; <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>33 Cal. 31; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sups. of S. F., </em>27 Cal. 655; <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Duff, </em>23 Cal. 596; <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>30 Cal. 309; <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>15 Cal. 421; <em>Pico v. Webster, </em>12 Cal. 140; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>19 Cal. 11.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">Upon these undisputed facts the defendant owed the plaintiff the precise liquidated sum of one thousand five hundred dollars according to the authorities cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel in his brief, and the case in this Court of <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Findla, </em>25 Cal. 76, and <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>29 Cal. 359.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">There was no error in excluding the judgment roll in the County Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AHH\">Niles, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">1. The defendant employed the plaintiff as his broker, to sell for him certain land at an agreed commission of five per cent on the amount of the sale. The plaintiff procured and brought to the defendant one Cush eon, who agreed with the defendant, verbally, to purchase the land for the sum of thirty thousand dollars. The defendant gave Cush eon a memorandum in writing, by which he promised to sell to him for the price named, and to give him fifteen days to complete the search and purchase of the land. Before the expiration of the fifteen days, Cusheon tendered to the defendant a performance in accordance with the agreement, and was informed that the land had been sold to another party. The plaintiff brings suit to recover the amount of his commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>It is not contended upon either part that there was a valid and binding contract of sale between Cusheon and the defendant. The defendant claims that for this reason the plaintiff\u2019s commission was not earned. This theory is untenable. The plaintiff could do no more than procure a purchaser who was acceptable to the defendant, and willing and able to purchase the land upon terms satisfactory to him. He could not control the will of the defendant or force him to make a binding contract with the purchaser, or prevent him from selling to another. In the absence of an agreement to that effect, the principal cannot refuse to pay the broker\u2019s commissions upon the ground that he did not choose to make the sale. He cannot avoid the contract by his voluntary act disabling himself from performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">2. The judgment roll in the action of forcible entry and detainer was properly excluded. The issue in that case was whether a certain sum of money had been paid by the defendant and received by plaintiff in satisfaction, discharge, and settlement of the cause of action involved in that suit. It was alleged in the answer in that case, and found by the Court, that the money was paid and received in discharge and settlement of this present action as well as of the one then pending. But this was a finding without the issues made, and unnecessary in the decision of that case. It was not necessary that the Court should find that the payment to plaintiff was made and received in \u201c satisfaction, discharge, and settlement of every claim, debt, or cause of action,\u201d but only of the cause of action then under consideration. At most, the fact of the settlement of this case could be only incidentally in controversy in the County Court. It is even difficult to see how it could be in controversy at all. A judgment is only conclusive upon questions involved in the suit, and upon which it depends, or upon matters which might have been litigated and decided in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">3. It was competent for plaintiff to rebut defendant\u2019s evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>deuce of the settlement and receipt by proof that at the time of the transaction the plaintiff was incapable of contracting intelligently by reason of intoxication. The proof, upon this point was conflicting. There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was intoxicated when he signed the receipt, and other evidence to the effect that he was then sober, but that the completion of the business was followed by a protracted carouse. The Court permitted the plaintiff\u2019s wife to testify that he was brought to his home by the defendant and another person several hours after the time when the receipt was shown to have been signed, and in a state of thorough intoxication. The fact to be arrived at was the mental condition of the plaintiff at the time the business was transacted. We cannot say that under the circumstances of the case the Court erred in holding that his condition a few hours later in the same evening would throw some light upon the question under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
