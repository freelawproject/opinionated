N. B. HICKS, A. S. HICKS, AND R. HICKS.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b517-9\">Contract within the Statute of Frauds.\u2014A verbal contract, by which the plaintiff agrees to cut and deliver to the defendant, at the defendant\u2019s mill, saw-logs sufficient to keep the defendant\u2019s mill running to its full capacity for two years from its date, is not to be performed within one year, and is therefore void under the Statute of Frauds.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b517-10\">Recovery on Void Contract.\u2014For labor and services performed under a contract, which is void under the Statute of Frauds, a recovery may be had by declaring a <em>quantum meruit, </em>but not by declaring on the contract itself. (</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b517-11\">Appeal from the Bistrict Court of the Third Judicial Bistrict, Santa Cruz County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-12\">The complaint averred, that on the 10th' day of May, 1869, the plaintiff and defendants made an agreement, by which the plaintiff was to cut saw-logs on the defendants\u2019 land and deliver at the defendants\u2019 sawmill sufficient to keep the defendants\u2019 mill running to its full capacity for the period of two years from the date of the contract, and that the defendants were to pay the plaintiff five dollars and fifty cents per thousand feet for all lumber timber so cut and delivered, to be ascertained and measured at the tail of defendants\u2019 mill, and to be so paid to plaintiff' as fast as so ascertained for said two years; that under said contract the plaintiff had cut and delivered saw-logs and lumber timber to the amount of seven hundred and ninety thousand five hundred and twenty-three feet, which, at five dollars and fifty cents per thousand, amounted to four thousand three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>hundred and forty-seven dollars and eighty-seven cents. The answer denied the contract as alleged, and set up that it was only a contract for the milling season, from April forward seven or nine months, at five dollars per thousand feet, and set up a counterclaim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">It appeared by the testimony that the contract was a verbal one, and no note or memorandum of it was made in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">The plaintiff recovered judgment in the Court below and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-8\"><em>Moore, Laine &amp; </em>Leib, for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-9\">The contract was void under the twelfth section of the Act concerning fraudulent conveyances and contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-10\">The contract was denied, and the statute was, therefore, well pleaded. (Brown on Frauds, Sec. 511; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>38 Cal. 99.) Moreover, it was alleged in the answer that the only agreement ever made between the parties was verbal. And, although the question cannot arise in this case, yet we cannot refrain from adding that the rule under the common law, that the statute must be pleaded in order jlto be taken advantage of, cannot apply under our statute, |for by our statute the contract is void, and a void contract cannot be made good by any waiver in pleading or otherwise; nor can it be even made good by an express ratification. By the common law the contract was not void, but it was insufficient to sustain an action\u2014a difference recognized by many able opinions. (See <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Emerson, 25 </em>Cal. 294, and <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>38 Cal. 111.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-11\"><em>Albert Hagan </em>and <em>W.
