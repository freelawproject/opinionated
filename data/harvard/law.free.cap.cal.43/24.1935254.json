It is certified that a statement on <em>appeal </em>was filed, that amendments were filed, but that the statement has not been settled. It is certified that the appeal is taken from an order granting a new trial. Whether a statement on an appeal from an order granting or refusing a new trial would in any case be necessary or proper, it is unnecessary at this time to decide; but it has repeatedly been announced by this Court, that in cases where a statement on appeal had properly been filed, the certificate <em>must show that the statement had been </em>settled, otherwise the certificate would <em>not </em>comply with Rule Four, and the resjiondent would <em>not </em>be entitled to have the appeal dismissed on his <em>ex parte motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
