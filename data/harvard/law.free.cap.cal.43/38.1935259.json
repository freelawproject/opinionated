Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>appropriated a portion of it for a special purpose, and by their labor and industry rendered it useful. We fail to see why the maxim, <em>Qui prior est in </em>tempore, <em>portior est in </em>jure, does not apply to the particular right they claimed. The claim is not to the exclusive use of Campbell\u2019s Ravine, but to the exclusive use of their own cut and flume. The next miner who came along could exercise the same privilege that plaintiffs did, <em>i. e., </em>make a cut and flume down the same ravine; and the testimony shows that from the defendants\u2019 claims to Sawmill Ravine a cut and flume similar to plaintiffs could be constructed cheaper than plaintiffs\u2019 was, and without any int\u00e9rference whatever with plaintiffs\u2019 improvements.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-6\"><em>George </em>Cadwalader, for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\">The facts show: First\u2014That an artificial mouth for</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-8\">Anderson\u2019s Ravine was constructed and used before plaintiffs\u2019 rights accrued in Campbell\u2019s Ravine. Second\u2014That it had been used eight, and perhaps ten, years before the commencement of this suit; that the defendants bought the use of this outlet for ten years, and the plaintiffs afterwards purchased the remaining interest\u2014that is, subject to the defendants\u2019 ten years right\u2014which had not expired at the beginning of this suit. Third\u2014That the running into Campbell\u2019s Ravine was invited, and attended with profit, and not loss, to the plaintiffs and their grantors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-9\">It must follow from these facts that the Court below was not wrong in refusing the plaintiffs an injunction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"Az\">Wallace, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The mining grounds of the plaintiffs are near \u201c Campbell\u2019s Ravine \u2019\u2019\u2014those of the defendants lying southerly, and near \u201cAnderson\u2019s Ravine.\" The general course of Campbell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Ravine is rather westerly, and that of Anderson\u2019s Ravine southwesterly, until the latter empties into the former, after which both run into \u201cSawmill Ravine,\u201d still further in a westerly or southwesterly direction. The controversy arises out of the conflicting claims of the litigants, respectively, to the use of these ravines, \u201c-Anderson\u2019s\u201d and \u201cCampbell\u2019s,\u201d so called, as means of carrying off the tailings from their respective mining grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The plaintiffs had constructed a cut, flume, and tailrace, which, running along the general course of, and near to, Campbell\u2019s Ravine, crossed it twice\u2014the defendants after-wards dug a cut some eight feet in depth, which, starting from a tunnfel of theirs, and not running along the general course of Anderson\u2019s Ravine to, or near to, its mouth, but turning rather sharply to the southward, struck the tailrace of the plaintiffs at a point some three hundred yards above, where Anderson\u2019s Ravine naturally debouches into Campbell\u2019s Ravine; and through a flume laid in this cut the defendants pour their tailings into the race of the plaintiffs. These facts, by their mere statement, dispose of the principal defense upon which the defendants rely to justify their appropriation of the plaintiffs\u2019 flume and tailrace. The defendants say, in substance, that their mining claims are situate on Anderson\u2019s Ravine; that the <em>\u201cnatural outlet\u201d </em>for their tailings is through that ravine into Campbell\u2019s Ravine, which they, therefore, have the right to follow over and through any flume or other structure erected by the plaintiffs, upon the line of this \u201cnatural outlet;\u201d but the answer is, that even if this claim to follow the \u201cnatural outlet \u201d be conceded, and the consequent right to use the race of the plaintiffs, at the mouth of Anderson\u2019s Ravine, be thereby established, it clearly does not clothe them with the general right to break in upon the tailrace of the plaintiffs at any point the defendants may select along its entire line\u2014even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>as here, at a distance of three hundred yards above the \u201cnatural outlet,\u201d which they claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Mr. Justice Rhodes dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
