The petitioner further states that there was no stipulation dr consent of the parties that the cause should be heard at chambers, or that the decree should be entered as of the June Term, and he asks the Supreme Court to set aside the decree on the ground that the District Judge exceeded his jurisdiction. It does not appear that any attempt was made to take an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-7\"><em>A.

Act, Sec. 456.)

This view is answered by the case of <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Huber, </em>21 Cal. 166. The statute was intended to supply a remedy where none existed in the first instance, and not to supplement one lost through the laches of the party himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Writ dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
