HESSENAUER, HERMAN PFENNINGER, FERDINAND BUCK, and JOSEPH LANG.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-10\">Writ oe Assistance in Case oe Partnership Property.\u2014A party who forecloses a mortgage, given by one partner, on, and obtains a Sheriff\u2019s deed for, an undivided interest in partnership property, without making the other partner a party to the action, is not entitled to a writ of assistance to be placed in possession, as against a receiver who has been appointed by the Court, at the instance of such other partner, in an action commenced by him to dissolve the partnership, and have the partnership property sold to pay the debts.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Appeal from the District Court of the Hinth Judicial District, County of Siskiyou.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">Autenreith, in the foreclosure suit, made Pfenninger, Buck, and Lang defendants, because they had caused attachments to be levied on the property, claiming that the liens they had acquired by the attachments were subsequent to the lien of his mortgage. Junker, in his complaint against Hessenauer, claimed that the partnership was indebted to him. Autenreith obtained the Sheriff\u2019s deed under his foreclosure sale on the 3d day of May, 1870, and on the ninth of May demanded of Junker, the receiver, possession of the property. His demand not being complied with, on the 21st of May, 1870, he moved the Court for a writ of assistance, and the motion was denied. From the order denying the motion he appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-7\"><em>E.

Both actions were pending at the same time and were tried independently, one resulting in a decree that the undivided half of the Pacific Brewery be sold to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s-mortgage, and the other adjudging that the whole property was partnership property, and directing it to be sold to' satisfy partnership liabilities. Whether the property was in fact partnership property, and, if it was, whether it became so before the execution of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, and whether there were partnership liabilities, are questions which, as against the plaintiff*, had not been tried when this application was heard, -and could not be without some appropriate proceedings instituted for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Until such proceedings were taken, and the respective fights of the parties determined thereunder, the Court did not err in refusing to surrender to the plaintiff a possession which it ha,d taken and was holding by its receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
