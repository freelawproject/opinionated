The only difference in that particular between the rule under our code and the rule of the common law, is that under the former all of the counts, taken either separately or together, must appear to embrace but one transaction, and there must be an allegation to that effect <em>(The People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Conor, </em>supra; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>28 id. 216,) in the indictment, while under the latter, the common law rule, each count must profess to charge a distinct and independent crime. (1 Bish. Crim. Pro. Secs. 181, 182, 201, 202, 208.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-9\">Wm. <em>Ross, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"Axe\">Rhodes, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The first count in the indictment charges the defendant with the commission of the crime of burglary, as defined by Section 58 of the Act concerning crimes and punishments, as amended in 1858. The second count charges him with the commission of the crime of breaking and entering a dwelling house, etc., in the day-time, with the intent to steal, as defined in the Act of February 27th, 1864 (Stats. 1868-4, p. 104). Those are, and are intended by the law to be, distinct offenses, and they cannot be made to constitute one and the same offense by means of an averment in the indictment to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The defendant demurred to the indictment on the- ground that it charges two offenses, and the demurrer was sustained. The defendant is permitted, by Section 289 of the Criminal Practice Act, to demur to the indictment on that ground, and there being two offenses charged, the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
