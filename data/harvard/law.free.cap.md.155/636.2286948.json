The jury being about to be impaneled, the state\u2019s attorney stated to the court that the State was unable to prove the charge against the defendant and further stated that he desired to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the case. The defendant objected to this entry being made, and moved the court to require the state\u2019s attorney either to enter \u201cnot guilty confessed,\u201d or to proceed then and there to impanel a jury to try the charge upon which the defendant had been indicted. The court ruled that the state\u2019s attorney had the absolute right against the protest, and therefore overruled the motion of the defendant and directed the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to be made as asked by the state\u2019s attorney. This appeal is from that action of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">There is a motion by appellee to dismiss the appeal on the ground that there was no sentence, judgment, or final determination of the case. The motion is overruled. There was a final disposition of the case when the court ordered the entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>at the instance of the state\u2019s attorney. The question raised by the motion of the defendant was, not the <em>proper exercise of discretion, </em>but the <em>right </em>to make the entry over the objection of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">If we agreed that there had not been \u201ca final determination of the case,\u201d it would be difficult to sustain the action \u2022of the trial court. For it would be intolerable, and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>versive of the constitutional rights of the accused to a speedy trial, if the state\u2019s attorney had the power, with or without the concurrence of the co.urt, to discontinue the trial by the entry of such an order, and at some future time again put the accused on trial under the same indictment. By the great weight of authority the case was terminated when the order was entered, and there can be no further prosecution under that indictment. 16 <em>O. </em>p. 432, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In <em>State v. </em>Morgan, 33 Md. 44, 46, it was said, \u201cIt is well settled by the authorities that a <em>nolle prosequi </em>ordinarily does not operate as a pardon; but that the accused remains subject to be proceeded against by another indictment for the same offense.\u201d That case distinguishes between a <em>stet </em>and a <em>nolle </em>prosequi, in that where there is a <em>stet </em>the accused may be proceeded against under the same indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Appellant very earnestly and with much force contends that it is unfair that one aecusied. should, in such a case, be left under the imputation of having committed a crime and denied the opportunity to prove his innocence. If this were a case of first impression that view would have great weight with us. But to hold that the state\u2019s attorney cannot discontinue a criminal proceeding by such an entry without confessing a plea of not guilty would be to ignore the overwhelming weight, if not the entire concurrence, of authority. Our attention has not been called to a single case to the contrary. 16 <em>O. </em>pp. 432 and 433, secs. 160,181, and notes. In justification of the practice which seems to have prevailed for so long everywhere, it can properly be said that the accused does not, in law, remain under the imputation of guilt after a <em>nolle prosequi </em>has been entered. The abandonment of the prosecution cancels that indictment and restores him to his original position.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\"><em>Ruling of the court </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
