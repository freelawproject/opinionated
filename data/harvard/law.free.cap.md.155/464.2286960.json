Lang, the appellee, filed his bill in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, in which he alleged that his wife Katherine Elizabeth Lang, the appellant, had committed the offense of adultery with Peter Pohl, and asked therein for an absolute divorce from her. The wife answered the bill, denying the charge alleged against her, and thereafter, upon evidence taken before the court on the issue so joined, a decree was passed granting the relief sought by the bill. The sole question presented by this appeal is whether the charge of adultery made against the wife was established by the evidence produced in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The pai'ties had been married for more than twenty years at the time of the institution of the suit, and as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>that marriage they had one son, George, who was, at that time, nineteen years of age. The corespondent, Peter Pohl, first became known to the husband and wife five or six years before the divorce proceedings were instituted, through his employment by the appellee to paint his house. Thereafter, it seems, Pohl and Lang became intimate friends and Pohl frequently visited Lang\u2019s home, where he was often thrown in company with Lang\u2019s wife. As time went on, Pohl went frequently to Lang\u2019s house when the latter was not at home. The frequency of these visits led Lang to suspect his wife of improper relations with Pohl and, as a result thereof, he watched her movements in respect thereto. He stated that on one occasion, on leaving his home in the morning, he saw Pohl approaching and, to avoid him, Pohl ducked around the comer. Later Lang returned to- his home and there found Pohl, and, as an excuse for being there, Pohl said he was looking for a coal oil can. On another occasion, upon returning to his home a little earlier than usual, he found his wife- and Pohl in the cellar. On that occasion Pohl said he was there looking for a piece of wire. In March, 1921, he saw Pohl and his wife enter an automobile at Clinton and Pratt' Streets, about eight-thirty o\u2019clock in the evening. As they entered the car, he ran across'the street and called to them, but they did not stop1. Lang then went to his home, and later, about ten-thirty o\u2019clock, his wife returned. The next day he said something to her about what he had seen the night before, and she called him a \u201cliar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Lang further testified that, on a Monday evening in May,, 1921, ho and Gustav Walters, his wife\u2019s brother, were in the vicinity of Calvert and Pleasant Streets, and saw his wife enter Pohl\u2019s car -and drive off with him; that he, with Walters, in the latter\u2019s car, drove to Pohl\u2019s home and was there told' by Mrs. Pohl that her husband had gone to the lodge and\u2019 the building and loan association and was not at home. From there they drove to Pohl\u2019s shore place at Middleboro, which he said was about eight miles from the city. Upon arriving there he found the place dark, and, as said by him, \u201cI walked around the house and I did not see any one, and I stayed; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>there at least an hour and three quarters, and Mr. Pohl then came out of the house and. walked around the house and came down to his machine and went hack in the house. They had a light lit then * * *. About twenty minutes time they came out * Airs. Lang wrapping up a little package of some kind, and she comes down and gets into the machine, and Mr. Pohl comes down and no more than he has started the car, I had a log of wood and I run in the back of the machine and jumped on the running board and hit him and the log broke, and Air. Pohl hollered \u2018Oh!\u2019, and he had his car in reverse, and then I run across the field and pulled out a stake, these lot stakes, and he seen me doing that, and he turned his machine and goes over a field. From there I went home and I stopped in front of his house and he was just about ready to put his car away when we walked over, and my brother-in-law said, \u2018Air. Pohl, what kind of a man are you?\u2019 He said, \u2018You shut up, have nothing to do with this,\u2019 and my brother-in-law walked around the ears towards him, and he runs in the garage and gets a shovel and I said \u2018.Lay it down, you dirty dog, you are not worth hitting.\u2019 \u201d Thereafter he and his brother-in-law went to his home about twelve o\u2019clock and there saw his wife, and he expressed to her his surprise at her conduct above referred to, and she replied \u201cYes, I will go out with him again.\u201d He then said \u201cGood night\u201d and left that same week, and has never lived or cohabited with her since.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On cross-examination he was asked where his wife was when he returned to his home on the Monday evening or night mentioned, and his reply was, \u201cDownstairs; still had her coat on. Q. What was she doing ? A. She had a bottle \u25a0of beer in her hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In corroboration of Lang\u2019s testimony, Walters, his brother-in-law, when called to the stand by the plaintiff, was asked, \u201cWere you with Lang one night in Alay at the corner of Calvert and Pleasant streets? A. Well, your honor, I would like to ask a question before the attorney asks me that: Do I have to stand up for all statements that I made prior to \u2014 \u25a0\u2014\u2022 (The Court) : You don\u2019t have to stand up for anything. (The AATtness) : Then I wish to state that I don\u2019t know anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>about the cas\u00a9 because I was drinking at the time. (The-Court) : You are sworn to tell the truth; you answer any questions that are asked you.\u201d He then proceeded with his-testimony and in part corroborated the statements made by Lang, but he was unable to say that the woman he saw with Pohl at his shore place was his sister. He was able to recognize Pohl but not his sister. The woman, he said, \u201clooked like my sister, built something like my sister.\u201d But when she came out of the house, which was not lighted, and \u201cbeing all muffled up\u201d he could not see her features. He was able-to recognize Pohl, for when he first came out of the house,, the house was lighted and he was enabled thereby to identify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Other witnesses testified as to the frequency of Pohl\u2019s visits-to Lang\u2019s house in the absence of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Mrs. Lillian Stickler, a witness called by the plaintiff, testified that she on several occasions, in the year 1926, was-asked by Mrs. Lang to go- with her and Mr. Pohl after cherries or blackberries. She went with them- four or five times,, carrying her baby with her. On these occasions, Mr. Pohl would carry with him both whiskey and beer, also ice. That after reaching the cherry or blackberry grounds he tvould' spread a blanket on the ground, put his beer and whiskey on. the ice, and, when cool, they would sit there and drink it. On one or more of these occasions- Mr. Pohl said to Mrs. Lang: \u201cThere are not many good cherries around here, let Lillian and the baby stay here and we go and get big cherries.\u201d This happened twice that she recalled. The witness was asked by the court: \u201cDid you see any evidence of affection between, them on any of these blackberry picking trips ?\u2019 A. Yes; kissed her and loved her. (The \u2019Court) : What do you mean? A. Hugged her and kissed her? (The Court-) :\u25a0 In your presence ? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Pohl, when upon the stand, admitted that he frequently went to Lang\u2019s home and at times Lang would not be at home; on some occasions to carry to them eggs and other things, which he brought from the farm, and on others to do \u25a0 work for them. He also admitted that twice he went with' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Mrs. Lang and Mrs. Stickler to the country after cherries or blackberries, but both times bo was asked by Mr. Lang to go with them. He admitted carrying \u201cliquors\u201d on those occasions, but he denied that he then, or at any other time, hugged or kissed Mrs. Lang, or that he then, or on any other occasion, had adulterous intercourse with Mrs. Lang.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Pohl further testified that on the evening or night when he was said to bo at his shore with Mrs. Lang', he was at the Bohemian Building and Loan Association, of which he is a member, located on Chester Street and Ashland Avenue. Thereafter he went to Southwest Baltimore to fill a, business engagement and from there returned to his home. After reaching his garage, which is opposite his home, he said: \u201cI put my car in front of the door and opened the door and Mr. Lang and Ms brother-in-law pulled in front of my house and came after me, Lang with his hands in his pocket, and his brother-in-law wTas so drunk he could hardly stand on his feet and lie started to mumble something to me * * * I told them to go home and sleep their drunks off. It was then exactly ten o\u2019clock. I heard the chimes strike\u201d and at ten fifteen o\u2019clock he went to bed. He further testified that he was not at the shore with Mrs. Lang that evening or night, nor did he on that evening or night see Mrs. Lang, and that he was never at the shore place with Mrs. Lang alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In support of Pohl\u2019s statement that he was at the building and loan association on the night mentioned, Joseph F. Yicktor, an employee of the association, whose duty it was to receive the dues paid by its members, testified that Pohl on that evening, somewhere between eight and nine o\u2019clock, was at the office of the association and paid to him his dues, as shown by the association\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Mrs. Lang, when asked about these blackberry trips, stated: \u201cWo were making wine and of a Sunday Mr. Lang would go places, but during the week Mr. Liang said it would he all right for me to go and it was he who suggested that I take these trips,\u201d which were made a year prior to the institution of these proceedings. Mrs. Lang further testified that she, oil the evening in May spoken of by the plaintiff, left her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>home at twenty minutes after seven and went to the Mercy Hospital to see a lady whose clothes she got every Monday to launder. She stayed there until about eight o\u2019clock and then went to the Spiritualist\u2019s and there she found Miss Margaret Auer, who boarded with her, and later she returned with Miss Auer to her home, but before entering her house she talked a while with a lady on the corner. About a quarter of eleven Mr. Lang came home: He was at the time drunk and so was her brother, who came to the house with him. She testified that she had not on that night, or on any Monday night during the months of March, April, or May, seen Mr. Pohl. She denied that she was with him that night. Mrs. Lang, in her statement that she was at the Spiritualist\u2019s on the night in-question, was supported by the evidence of Miss Margaret Auer, who testified that she was at the Spiritualist\u2019s on the evening mentioned, when Mrs. Lang came in, and remained there for some time, when she with Mrs. Lang returned to the Lang home about twenty minutes of ten. She went immediately into the house while Mrs. Lang remained on the outside. When Mrs. Lang came in she did not know, but it was not long thereafter. She said Mr. Lang came in later and he accused Mrs. Lang of being down on the shore with Mr. Pohl that evening or night.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">As was said by this court in <em>Kremelberg v. Kremelberg, </em>52 Md. 553:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cThe burden of proof is upon the complainant, and the evidence must establish affirmatively that actual adultery was committed, since nothing less than the carnal act itself can lay the foundation of a divorce for adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201cDirect proof, that is, the evidence of eyewitnesses, is not required, for such is the nature of the offense and the secret and clandestine manner in which it is committed, that proof of this kind is in most cases unattainable; yet where it is sought to be -inferred from circumstances, the latter must lead to the conclusion of guilt by fair inference, as a necessary conclusion. <em>Loveden v. Loveden, </em>4 Eng. Ecc. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201cAs to what facts shall, and what shall not, constitute proof of adultery, no general rule can be laid down, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>same presumptions do not always follow the same facts, the weight of presumptions depending upon the character, habits and situation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u201cThe only general rule to be laid down on the subject, says Lord Stowell, \u2018Is that the circumstances must be such as would lead the guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion; for it is not to lead a harsh and intemperate judgment, moving upon appearances that are equally capable of two interpretations; neither is it to be a matter of artificial reasoning, judging upon such things differently from what would strike the careful and cautious consideration of a discreet man. The rational and legal inferences from such facts must be the same.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">See also <em>Loveden v. Loveden, supra; Thiess v. Thiess, </em>124 Md. 292; <em>Pattison v. Pattison, </em>132 Md. 367; <em>Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, </em>vol. 2, sec. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u201cIt has been repeatedly decided in this state that in eases of this kind courts will not grant a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>except upon clear, unequivocal and convincing proof and upon a state of facts that satisfactorily established the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>Thiess v. Thiess, supra; Pattison v. Pattison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Applying the principles stated in the above authorities and the standard fixed by them in determining the effect of the evidence, we are unable to find in the record proof sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the defendant was guilty of the offense alleged against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The evidence does not show, and the brief of counsel does not suggest, when and where the alleged adultery is claimed to have been committed; that is, whether at the time or times of Pohl\u2019s visits to plaintiff\u2019s home, when plaintiff was not there; upon the cherry and berry picking trips to the country; on the ride in Pohl\u2019s automobile on the occasion she is said by her husband to have entered the corespondent\u2019s car at the comer of Clinton and Pratt Streets, in March, 1927; or when at Pohl\u2019s shore resort in May of that year; or upon each and all of these occasions,</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>It is provided by article 34, section 4, of the Code, that \u201cin suits, actions, bills or other proceedings, instituted in consequence of adultery or for the purpose of obtaining a divorce, * * * no verdict shall be permitted to be recovered, nor shall any judgment or decree be entered upon the testimony of the plaintiff alone; but in all such cases, testimony in corroboration of that of the plaintiff shall be necessary.\u201d The testimony of the plaintiff relative to the occasion when he saw his wife enter the automobile with Pohl, at the corner of Clinton and Pratt Streets, was wholly uncorroborated, and under the above statutory provision, it may be eliminated from further consideration. The same may be said of his testimony in relation to the visit of Pohl and the defendant to Pohl\u2019s shore place. Walters, who was called to the stand by the plaintiff, to corroborate the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to that visit, before testifying told the court that he knew nothing about the case, as he was drinking at the time. And that he had been drinking, and was greatly intoxicated, was testified to by other witnesses. He was, however, directed to proceed with his testimony, and while he in part corroborated the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, he was unable to say that the woman at the shore or the one who was seen to enter Pohl\u2019s car on Calvert and Pleasant Streets was his sister. He first said that it was his sister who got in the car of Pohl at the place named, but later on, when asked by the court, \u201cAre you sure that woman was your sister, Mrs. Lang?\u201d he answered, \u201cI would not take an oath on that.\u201d Because of Walters\u2019 condition of intoxication and his inability to testify, that the woman with Pohl on that occasion was his sister, his testimony is without force or effect in the attempted corroboration of plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As to the occasion when the defendant accompanied Pohl, Mrs. Stickler, and her baby to the country for cherries and berries, Mrs. Stickler testified that Pohl said to Mrs. Lang that the cherries where they then were, were not good cherries, and suggested that they leave Mrs. Stickler and the baby and go after larger ones. It is not shown where they went or how far it was from the place where they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>left Mrs. Stickler, or whether the place to which they went was secluded or concealed from public view. It may have been in a much exposed place, where the alleged offense could not have been committed without detection. If so, it certainly could not be inferred therefrom that their object in leaving Mrs. Stickler was for adulterous purposes, or that from such facts we are forced to the conclusion that she had committed adultery. If the evidence offered is capable of two interpretations, one of which is consistent with her innocence, that interpretation should be adopted and the decree not granted. 14 <em>Gyc., </em>p. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The other remaining occasion or occasions upon which it might be claimed the offense was committed was at the time or times when Pohl was at the home of Mrs. Lang in the absence of her husband. There is evidence to the effect that lie frequently went to the home of the Langs and on some of these occasions Lang would not be at home, but upon this general statement, that Pohl visited the home in the absence of Lang, with no attending facts or circumstances, we are not warranted in holding that at such time or times the defendant was guilty of adultery with Pohl.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The conduct of the defendant with Pohl was extremely unbecoming and indiscreet, and was calculated to arouse the suspicion of the husband, but a divorce should not be granted upon that suspicion, unaccompanied by facts, which, by fair inference, must lead us to the necessary conclusion that the defendant had committed adultery. 9 <em>B. G. L. </em>In this case, in our opinion, such facts are not found, and we will reverse the decree appealed from divorcing the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
