It is from that judgment that this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The sole question raised by the appellant\u2019s prayer was whether the county rate in the city, as it is called by the appellant, or the county rate outside of the city, should have been considered and used in apportioning the tax between the city and county.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The court, by its refusal of appellant\u2019s prayer, held that it was the county rate outside of the city that should have been considered and used in apportioning the tax, and in that conclusion we agree with the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The so-called county rate in the city is less than the county rate in other parts of the county, owing to the fact that it does not contain any charge or tax for the maintenance or upkeep of the roads and highways. This is true because the city, by its charter provision, is excused from contributing to the expense of maintaining the public roads and highways in the county outside of its limits, in lien of its assuming the whole expense of maintaining the public roads and streets within the city, and for such purposes it is allowed to expend the amount it would have contributed under the county levy for the maintenance of pub-lie roads, streets, and highways of the county, had the charter provisions not been passed. It was no doubt thought by the county and city authorities that, in the passage of this charter provision, the amount to be. expended by the city on its streets and highways, unaided by the county, would be at least equal to the amount that it would have contributed to the maintenance of the public roads throughout the county, including the city, had this provision not been passed; and while it does not appear that the county rate within the city includes any provision for road maintenance in the city, nevertheless, it is, in a sense, contributing thereto under said provision of the charter, and this fact should be considered in determining the county rate of taxa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tion in Harford County to be used in the apportionment of the bank tax between it and the City of Havre de Grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The statute provides that the tax shall be apportioned and distributed \u201cin the proportion which the rate of each jurisdiction bears to the aggregate of the rates of such jurisdictions.\u201d A fair interpretation of this language, we think, requires us to hold that thq county rate of Harford County, outside of the city, is the rate to be used in apportioning the bank tax between the city and the county. It would, we think, be going very far to hold that for such purpose the county rate within the City of Havre de Grace, a single division of the county, containing no charge or tax for public road purposes, is. the county rate of Harford county, to be used in the apportionment of the bank tax between the city and county.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Being of this opinion, we will affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Sloax, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
