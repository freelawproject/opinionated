Sagner, one of the appellants, as receiver of the corporation. On August 6th a motion was filed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>appellee, Isaac Frenkil, to vacate the order appointing the receiver and an order passed thereon on the same day vacating the order unless cause to the contrary he shown on or before the 16th day of August, 1927. To this petition the appellants filed their -answer. On November 8th the appellee, Isaac Frenkil, filed his answer, reserving all of his rights under the motion theretofore filed to vacate the order for a receiver, and demurring to the whole; bill of complaint and to each and every paragraph thereof, and reserving all rights under his demurrer. \u25a0 The answer purported to give a history of the organization of the company and of the sales and distribution of stock, in effect confirming the general charge of discord and quarrels among the stockholders, which is apparently the only ground upon which the appellants ask the intervention of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Circuit Court of Baltimore heard the case on the demurrer, and, on the 6th day of December, 1927, sustained the same and dismissed the bill without leave to amend, from which the appellants appealed, and, on January 3rd, 1928, the appellants filed their petition, wherein they set forth certain amendments which they desired to make to their bill of complaint, and on the same day the Circuit Court denied the petition for amendment, and from this order an appeal was taken. The petition for amendment still showed that the whole proceeding, including the proposed amendment, was based on quarrels between the appellants, as stockholders and directors, and Isaac Frenkil, appellee, also a stockholder and director, and that the sole purpose of this proceeding was to defeat the efforts of Frenkil to control the action or inaction of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The appellants\u2019 first contention at the argument was that the appellee, Frenkil, could not both demur and answer, and that therefore the demurrer ought not to have been entertained by the chancellor. General Equity Rule No. 20 is: \u201cThe defendant shall be entitled in all cases by answer to insist upon all matters of defense in law or equity to the merits of the bill of which he may be entitled to avail him,self by demurrer,\u201d and the practice has been upheld in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Ruhl v. Wagner, </em>146 Md. 601, and <em>Hendler Creamery Co. v. Lillich, </em>152 Md. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It has long been clearly held in this state that quarrels and dissensions among the stockholders of foreign corporations doing business in Maryland cannot be determined by the courts of this state and that they can only be determined by the courts of the state which created the corporation. We can say here, as did this court in the opinion of Judge Miller in <em>Wilkins v. Thorne, </em>60 Md. 253, 258: \u201cWe have thus stated at greater length than usual the material allegations of this bill in order that its scope and purpose may be clearly seen. As far as our comprehension goes, it makes a case of a contest between the complainant and other <em>bona fide </em>stockholders of the corporation on the one side and those claiming to be stockholders and president and directors on the other. This is clearly a controversy relating to the internal management of the corporation, and the validity of the acts of those who claim to be, and indeed are admitted to be <em>de facto, </em>its president, directors and stockholders. How if this were a Maryland corporation there could be no question as to the jurisdiction of a Maryland court over the subject, but such is not the case. This corporation was created under the laws of another state, and it seems to us that all such controversies must be determined by the courts of the state by which the corporation was created. Our researches have enabled us to find no case in which the courts of another state have ever assumed jurisdiction over a controversy like this, and we think none can be found. Indeed it would be a strange anomaly in our system of jurisprudence if the courts of one state could be vusted with the power to dissolve a corporation created by another and assume control over its property for the purpose of distributing it among those claiming to be its stockholders.\u201d In that case Judge Miller added further, \u201cBut, assuming that a Maryland court has jurisdiction in this case for any of the purposes sought in this bill, we think it clear that the corporation itself is an essential party to' the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Taking the cue from the latter quotation, a similar proceeding was brought by way of petition for mandamus against the Horth State Copper &amp; Gold Mining Company, by a stockholder named Field, of which Wilkins, (appellant in 60 Md. 253,) was president, and this court, in an opinion by Judge Stone, said: \u201cIt was not the intention of our statute (Act of 1868, ch. 471, sec. 209) to give our courts jurisdiction over the internal affairs of a foreign corporation,\u201d and the order for the writ of mandamus granted in that case was reversed. See also <em>Condon v. Mutual Reserve Fund, Life </em>As<em>sociation, </em>89 Md. 99; <em>Stockley v. Thomas, </em>89 Md. 663, 668; 8 <em>Fletcher\u2019s Cyclopedia of Corporations, </em>9759; <em>Dupuy v. Terminal Company, </em>89 Md. 409, 426, the last named case applying the same rule with regard to dissensions among stockholders of a domestic corporation unless there be a charge of fraud, illegality, or an act <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Concerning the appeal from the order of the court refusing the amendments proposed to the bill of complaint, it is only necessary to refer to <em>Snook v. Munday, </em>96 Md. 514, wherein this couii; said: \u201cAn application to amend is addressed to the discretion of the court before whom it is made and is not the subject of an -appeal to- this court.\u201d See <em>Continental Trust Co. v. Baltimore Refrigerator Co., </em>120 Md. 450; <em>Kernan v. Carter, </em>132 Md. 577, 594; <em>Miller's Equity Proc., </em>251.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Inasmuch as we are of the opinion that the courts of this state are without jurisdiction to- hear the complaints of one set of stockholders against another stockholder of a foreign corporation concerning its internal affairs, the order of the lower court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\"><em>Order in No. </em>57 <em>affirmed, appeal in No. </em>58 <em>dismissed, with costs to the appellees in both cases.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
