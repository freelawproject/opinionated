E. Whiddon and J. P. Champion, who then and there prevented the execution and delivery of said check by the said Johnson and the receiving of the same by the said defendants. Said Gus Johnson at the time maintained an account with the said bank, and defendants could and would have obtained said $50.00 in money of the value of $50.00 had the said defendants received a check executed by the said Johnson as aforesaid, and, should said defendants have received said check signed by the said Johnson on the said bank, said check so signed and delivered would have been of the value of $50.00, and to the loss and damage of the said Gus Johnson in the sum of $50.00, had not said defendants been intercepted and prevented from executing said fraudulent scheme as hereinbefore set out.\u201d The defendants demurred to the accusation, alleging in substance that it did not show an attempt to commit a crime, but showed nothing more than mere preparation to commit one.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In considering the demurrer we must treat the allegations of the accusation as true. These allegations show more than \u201cmere preparatory acts for the commission of the crime.\u201d They set out the overt acts proximately leading to its commission; they show that the defendants sought out-their intended victim; that they knowingly and designedly made to him false representations with intent to deceive and defraud; that these representations referred to a past fact (the finding by them of the pocketbook), and that Gus Johnson, relying on the truth of these false statements, would have been defrauded and would have lost $50 had not said defendants been intercepted and prevented from executing said fraudulent scheme. They show all the essential elements necessary to constitute the crime of cheating and swindling <em>(Goddard </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 <em>Ga. App. </em>154, 58 S. E. 304), except that they do not show that the intended victim was actually defrauded and cheated. Johnson was the party who was expected to sign and deliver the cheek. The defendants did all that was necessary for them to do to make the attempt complete; and all that it would, have been necessary for them to do had the check been signed and delivered was to present and collect it. Who doubts that if the check had been signed and delivered to them, and they had not been in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tercepted and prevented, they would have presented the check and collected the money thereon, and the crime of cheating and swindling would have been completely consummated? In the brief of counsel for the plaintiff in error it is insisted that if the check had actually been written and the defendants had decided not to cash it, there would have been no crime. This presents an issue not raised by the demurrer. If the case had proceeded to trial, and the accused had contended that after all that is alleged in the indictment had been done 'they reached the locus penitentire, heard \u201c the still small voice,\u201d and turned away from the consummation of the crime, this would have made an issue of fact for the jury. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>State, </em>116 <em>Ga. </em>550 (2), 554 (2) (42 S. E. 745).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The demurrer was properly overruled; and, this being the only issue before this court, the ruling thereon and the final judgment must be <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"APNs\">\n<em>Broyles, C.
