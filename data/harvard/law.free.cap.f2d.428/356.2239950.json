He contends that error of constitutional dimensions occurred when the prosecutor improperly used an FBI report while attempting to impeach an alibi witness, and when the prosecutor commented on appellant\u2019s five prior felony convictions during closing argument. We find no authority to support these contentions; accordingly, the decision of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-28\"> The first contention relates to the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in attempting to impeach appellant\u2019s brother, an alibi witness. He argues that the prosecutor improperly displayed an FBI \u201crap\u201d sheet in front of the jury. It appears from the record that the prosecutor did read from the report when examining the witness. However, as the state points out, the source of the report was not revealed in the presence of the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>In addition, Martin\u2019s brother admitted to one prior felony conviction and to juvenile convictions \u2014 all or some of which were apparently listed in the FBI report. The authorities presented convince us that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct could possibly be considered as improper under state law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in appropriate circumstances. However, we do not sit as a \u201csuper\u201d state supreme court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have been presented with no authority for the proposition that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct amounts to a denial of due process. It has been stated, repeatedly and correctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">The due process of law clause in the Fourteenth Amendment does not take up the statutes of the several states and make them the test of what it requires; nor does it enable this court to revise the decisions of the state courts on questions of state law. What it does require is that state action, whether through one agency or another, shall be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions and not infrequently are designated as \u2018law of the land\u2019. Those principles are applicable alike in all the states and do not depend upon, or vary with local legislation. [Citations omitted]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Martin\u2019s second contention relates to the prosecutor\u2019s comments during final argument. He insists that he was denied due process of law when the prosecutor stated that he had five prior felony convictions. The state points out that this fact had been brought out during the cross-examination of Martin and that the prosecutor\u2019s remark was made in response to defense counsel\u2019s statement that Martin might be a \u201cbad boy\u201d but was not a robber. We seriously doubt that such conduct on the part of the prosecutor was error under state law as contended by Martin; again, we find no authority for the proposition that it is a violation of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-19\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing.
