Dudley was convicted by a jury and sentenced to three years imprisonment. He appeals, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-21\">Dudley submits a triumvirate of reasons for reversal, all of which relate to alleged omissions in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. At trial Dudley did not make these objections to the charge or request instructions concerning these issues as required by Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.P. We have nevertheless carefully reviewed each allegation of error raised by Dudley and find that in each case either a proper instruction was in fact given or its omission was, under the circumstances, entirely proper. Certainly, we have found nothing which could be considered \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1028-23\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this ease is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
