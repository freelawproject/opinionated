The district court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of defendant Greenville Shipbuilding Corporation and plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-25\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel recognizes that the facts in the case at hand are identical to those presented by Atkins v. Greenville Shipbuilding Corporation, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 279, cert. den. 396 U.S. 846, 90 S.Ct. 105, 24 L.Ed.2d 96, but suggests by this appeal that the court overrule <em>Atkins. </em>This we are not disposed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-26\">The granting of the motion for summary judgment by the district court was correct and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A-v\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1226-16\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
