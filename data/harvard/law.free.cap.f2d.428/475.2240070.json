The appellant, Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, issued a garage liability policy to Plaza Lincoln-Mercury, which policy was held to provide primary coverage for any liability which Sampson may incur as a result of the collision with the motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">The critical exclusionary language of the State Farm policy was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-16\">\u201c(b) This insuring agreement does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-17\">(2) to any <em>accident arising out of the operation of an automobile sales agency, </em>service station, storage garage or public parking place.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">We affirm<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the decision of the court below, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Sampson et al., M.D. Fla.1969, 305 F.Supp. 50.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-11\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this case is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\">. This decision is not in conflict with Rosen v. Godson, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 1082. The obvious dissimilarity in the exclusionary language of the two insurance contracts clearly distinguishes this case from Rosen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
