Richard L. Ravin, Esq. and Paul A. Grote, Esq. appeared on plaintiffs' behalf. John D. Reddall, Esq., Justin Taylor Quinn, Esq. and Keith John Miller, Esq. appeared on defendants' behalf. John Doe LadyFree28 is self-represented and did not appear at hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   John Doe duskyjewel is self-represented and did not appear at the hearing. The Court, being duly advised in the premises, upon all of the files, records and proceedings herein, and for the reasons described in the Memorandum below now makes and enters the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Discovery of the Identities of John Does [Docket No. 167] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part as\n   <strong>\n    MOOT\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. ATP's request that it be allowed to conduct further discovery pertaining to the identities of the John Does based on information obtained from ATP's current and future discovery requests without requiring further orders of the Court is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3. LadyFree28's Motion for Protective Order [Docket No. 189] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   4. Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Serve a Third Amended Complaint [Docket No. 230] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff shall immediately serve and file its Third Amended Complaint consistent with this Order. Defendants shall respond in the time described by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   5.

(\"Allnurses\"). Recently, ATP has learned the identity of three of the five John Does (LadyFree28, duskyjewel and Pixie.RN), but still does not know the identity of the remaining two posters (JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq). Allnurses knows the identity of JustBeachyNurse, but does not know the identity of monkeyhq.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Richard Ravin filed on December 21, 2016, Ex. A-1 (Defendants' Amended First Set of Answers to Plaintiffs' First Set of Interrogatories) at pp. 3-4 (Answer to Interrogatory No. 1(ii) ) [Docket No. 254-1]. ATP believes that Allnurses possesses the Internet Protocol (\"IP\") addresses for each session when a John Doe posted comments on the Allnurses' website. Additionally, Allnurses has stated that it has information on one or more of its database files containing personal identifying information for each John Doe. Id., pp. 5-6 (Answer to Interrogatory No. 1(iii) ). ATP now seeks an order from this Court requiring Allnurses to reveal the identifying information, including the IP addresses, it possesses for JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq. ATP intends to use this information to identify the third-party Internet Service Providers (\"ISPs\") and the Online Service Providers (\"OSPs\") used by these John Does when they made their postings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Armed with that information, ATP will then serve subpoenas on these ISPs and OSPs to learn the identities of JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Allnurses has objected to revealing any identifying information in its possession, including IP addresses, which could ultimately lead to the discovery of the identity of the John Doe posters, claiming that each such poster has a right under the First Amendment to speak anonymously and Allnurses should not be required to\n   divulge this protected information in contravention of their rights. Two posters, LadyFree28 and duskyjewel, have also objected to ATP's efforts to obtain identity information from Allnurses. Today, this Court decides that ATP has not met its burden to obtain the identifying information regarding JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq in the possession of Allnurses. Further, the Court concludes that ATP's motion to compel this identifying information from Allnurses as to LadyFree28, duskyjewel and Pixie.RN is moot as ATP already knows their identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The facts upon which ATP relied to support its motion to compel and that are relevant to the instant motions are set forth in the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") and the declarations submitted on behalf of ATP by Richard Ravin, counsel for ATP, Mark Olynyk, plaintiff and owner of ATP, and James Roberts, Ph.D., an expert retained by ATP to opine on damages suffered by ATP as consequence of the alleged defamatory statements made by the John Does.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 97, 159-161. These facts are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ATP provides test preparation services for individuals seeking entry into various careers, including nursing. SAC, \u00b6 19; Declaration of Mark Olynyk (\"Olynyk Decl.\"), \u00b6 5 [Docket No. 159]. Allnurses is a Minnesota corporation founded by Brian Short.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5 (collectively, \"Allnurses\"). ATP is not a college and does not issue degrees or give college credit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27; Olynyk Decl., \u00b6 8. Instead, ATP's services are designed to prepare nursing students for standardized exams that enable them to get full credit for college courses without taking the courses, a process known as credit-by-examination. SAC, \u00b6 28. The standardized exams are given by an independent college or an independent testing center, and enable the student to earn credit towards a nursing degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Nursing or Associates of Science in Nursing from such college.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29; Olynyk Decl., \u00b6 9. This credit-by-examination method allows a student to \"test-out\" of certain required courses for a particular college to satisfy the credit requirements of the schools, and thus, save the student time and money by not having to pay for and take the required courses at the college. SAC, \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Excelsior College is one of the colleges for which ATP provides test preparation classes, as well as many other accredited colleges throughout the country. SAC, \u00b6 62. Generally, students seeking a degree from colleges such as Excelsior College choose to either (i) enroll in a college, register for courses and attend classes for those courses with the goal of passing those courses and earning credit towards their degrees, or (ii) enroll in a test preparation program such as ATP and then challenge and pass the college equivalency exam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 71. By enrolling in a college and taking courses, the students pay tuition, the amount of which is often determined by the number of course credits being taken by the student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Excelsior College offers its students the option to earn credit-by-exam, and it also offers test preparation programs. SAC, \u00b6 65 (citing SAC, Ex. A, pp. 37-40 (Screen Shot Set 10) ). ATP also provides test preparation programs for these test-out exams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 70. By enrolling in a test preparation program such as that offered by ATP, students can save time and money because the test preparation programs usually cost less, and require less time, than enrolling in a course and completing all the course work that goes along with a\n   regular college course.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 73. Excelsior College is a competitor of ATP because each competes for education dollars to be spent by students in pursuit of degrees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Excelsior College announced on its website at URL http://www.excelsior.edu/nursing-theory-examination-changes that beginning in July 2015, it would offer registrations for its test-out exam preparation for its nursing degrees to start in Fall 2015. SAC, \u00b6 75 (citing SAC, Ex. A, pp. 37-40 (Screen Shot Set 10) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Allnurses runs a website at \"allnurses.com\" which describes itself as \"the collective voice of the nursing community, supporting the profession by providing a place where nurses can network, share and learn from their peers.\" (http://allnurses.com/aboutus-info.html, accessed on March 2, 2015).

ATP alleged that there were material differences between ATP and Excelsior College test preparation instruction rendering ATP's test preparation not be redundant to Excelsior College's services or obsolete.

For example, ATP offers live instruction for its test preparation, while Excelsior College does not, and ATP students are provided with ATP's \"911 support,\" where a student can request extra help in preparing to pass an exam, such as free course retakes, free refresher courses, and free one-on-one customized tutoring from an instructor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 125.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, as of the date of the posts by JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq, on August 22, 2014, and as of the date when ATP filed its First Amended Complaint (on May 7, 2015), the test preparation requirements for Excelsior College general education courses remained unchanged, and therefore, ATP's general education test preparation was not obsolete or redundant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 126, 127;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Olynyk Reply Decl., \u00b6 4(k) (\"At the time that the 'redundant' comment (on August 22, 2014 by JustBeachyNurse) and 'obsolete' and 'total waste of investment' comments (on August 22, 2014 by monkeyhq) were posted on the allnurses.com thread, those statements were false because it was not true that ATP's services would be obsolete, redundant or a total waste of investment as a result of any then-existing or changed policies, rules or criteria of Excelsior College.\"); \u00b6 4(o) (\"ATP had planned to continue to offer test prep services for nursing and general education classes at Excelsior College for all time relevant to the Second Amended Complaint, because Excelsior College did not announce any policy, rule or criteria that would have made any of ATP's test prep services obsolete, redundant or a total waste of investment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Additionally, by \"liking\" monkeyhq's post (which referenced JustBeachyNurse's post), Pixie.RN endorsed, approved, ratified, restated and republished the false and misleading statements posted by poster monkeyhq and JustBeachyNurse on August 22, 2014.

Ultimately, after input and argument of the parties, the Court issued two Orders addressing the content and modality of the notice to the John Does, along with the timing of the briefing and hearing on ATP's renewed motion to compel. Order dated August 22, 2016 [Docket No. 153]; Amended Order dated August 31, 2016 [Docket No. 156].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In order to notify the John Does of the upcoming motion to compel, the Court required a \"Banner\" and \"Legal Notice Page,\" (Exhibits A and B attached to the Order), to be placed on the Allnurses' website setting forth information regarding ATP's renewed motion and attaching copies of relevant pleadings. Order dated August 22, 2016, p. 6. The Legal Notice described the nature of ATP's suit and the substance of its motion to compel, notified the John Does of the time and date of the hearing on the motion, and informed the John Does how to object to plaintiffs' motion (\"Any John Doe Defendant objecting to ATP's Motion to Compel Discovery must file with the Clerk of Court for the District Court of Minnesota a written response to the motion and serve a copy on all counsel of record by [date].\"). Amended Order dated August 31, 2016, Ex. B. The Legal Notice then informed the John Does how to protect their identities in responding to ATP's' motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   If you are not represented by a lawyer, you must include with your written response, your name, address and phone number. However, if you do not want to reveal your identity (name, address and phone number) to the parties, you may do this by (a) filing with the Clerk of Court and serving on counsel of record for the parties a written response that redacts (hides or removes) your name, address and phone number, and (b) by sending an unredacted version of the same written response to Magistrate Judge Mayeron at the address below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Magistrate Judge Mayeron will not disclose your name, address and phone number to Plaintiffs, Allnurses or counsel of record for these parties.

[Docket Nos. 180]. LadyFree28 also responded to the motion by filing a Motion to Dismiss [Docket Nos. 181, 188]; Motion for Protective Order, which was essentially an objection to ATP's renewed Motion to Compel [Docket Nos. 182, 189]; Counterclaim [Docket Nos. 184]; and a Letter directed to this Court [Docket Nos. 183, 187]. Both duskyjewel and LadyFree28 filed redacted objections with the Clerk of Court (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   hiding the name, address and phone number of the John Doe), and sent unredacted objections to the Court, revealing this identifying information to the Court only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Shortly before the hearing on ATP's renewed Motion to Compel, ATP discovered through further investigation the identities of duskyjewel, LadyFree28, and Pixie.RN. As a consequence, on November 23, 2016, Allnurses sought permission to file a Motion for Reconsideration of this Court's August 22, 2016 Order. Letter to Court dated November 23, 2016 [Docket No. 237]. Allnurses claimed that the Court had \"disregarded\" its request that the John Does direct all correspondence to the Court and as a result, ATP had learned information from \"court personnel and the John Does\" sufficient to identify duskyjewel and LadyFree28.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 1-2. Allnurses also claimed that the Court's process for notifying the John Does of the motion created an untenable choice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 2 (\"If this process is allowed to stand and Plaintiffs are permitted to take unjustified advantage of the Court's process, John Doe defendants in the District of Minnesota (and elsewhere throughout the nation) will effectively have to choose between (1) not responding to a motion seeking their identity, and thereby not fully addressing the merits, not filling out the record for the court, or, in the case of a party where there is no third party opposing disclosure, complete abandonment of any attempt to prevent disclosure and comply with the First Amendment; or (2) responding and knowing that such a response will allow the plaintiff to discover their identity without any showing that the claimed harm outweighs the substantial First Amendment interests in protecting anonymous speech. This is not a choice that any anonymous Doe should ever have to face.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Following receipt of ATP's response to the request [Docket No. 242], the Court denied Allnurses request to file a motion for reconsideration, finding that there were \"neither compelling or extraordinary circumstances, manifest errors of law nor newly discovered evidence that warrant granting this request.\" Letter by Court dated November 29, 2016 denying request for reconsideration (\"Court Letter Denying Reconsideration Request\"), p. 1 [Docket No. 244].

Further, the ordinary meaning of the term \"obsolete\" is that something is \"no longer in use or no longer useful,\" leading a reader to conclude this was the case based on monkeyhq's further statement \"so unless you plan to finish EVERYTHING by that time,\n   <strong>\n    it is a total waste of your investment\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 15-16 (emphasis in original) (quoting Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, 10th ed.

To the extent that Allnurses suggested in its opposition to ATP's motion to amend the Second Amended Complaint that the procedures employed by the Court to notify and permit responses by the John Does to the motion to compel \"resulted in the unforeseen violation of the First Amendment [and] required protections of the Does,\" this \"suggestion\" is rejected. Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint, p. 2 [Docket No. 235]. First, the Court has already determined that the process employed to notify the John Does of the motion to compel was sufficient to protect their anonymity. Court Letter Denying Reconsideration Request. Second, the First Amendment issues raised by ATP's motion to compel bear only on anonymous speakers and not on those whose identities are known to the moving party. Therefore, the Court overrules Allnurses' argument that Pixie.RN, LadyFree28 and duskyjewel continued to enjoy First Amendment protection even though they were no longer anonymous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Accordingly, for the balance of this Order, the Court considers the issues raised by ATP's motion to compel as they bear on the two remaining anonymous posters-JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

ATP did not set out the full text of thread in the Second Amended Complaint. However, as discussed in the next section, the law of defamation requires the Court to consider the context of and circumstances surrounding any alleged defamatory statements. Therefore, to understand the context of the alleged defamatory statements by JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq at issue in this case, it is necessary to read the entire thread found at http://allnurses.com/excelsior-college-online/achieve-test-prep-815067.html.

I've been a LPN for 2 years and work full-time in long-term care, plus have two young children. I really want to get my RN, but going to a traditional \"brick and mortar\" program is not going to be possible for me. I enrolled in Excelsior back in 2011, right after I got my LPN license. However, I lost motivation, got bored with it, and felt lost in the huge amount of reading I had to do with no guidance. So I dropped out of the program. Now, I'm thinking about doing it again. I am also considering Indiana State's online LPN-BSN program, but I still need two pre-reqs plus the TEAS, challenge exams, etc. And I know they've had some problems with their program lately (just in California from what I understand but who knows how it will affect their entire program in the future).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Long story short, I'm considering trying Achieve Test Prep to help me finish Excelsior's program. I do NOT want to even try College Network or any of those other places. I'd love to hear input from anyone who's tried Achieve's program. Do you feel prepared? How much is the total cost, monthly payment amounts, etc.? How long will it take you to finish? I've had most of the general education courses, but with Excelsior's new rule about A &amp; P and Microbiology being completed in the last 5 years, I will most likely need to retake those along with all the nursing courses, FCCA, and CPNE. Thanks to anyone who can help!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   There were several posts that same day, which generally discussed the pros and cons of third party test prep companies (including ATP) and Excelsior College, including the posts by JustBeachyNurse and Pixie.RN,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In this regard, JustBeachyNurse responded to Heavenly4505 stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Achieve Test Prep is a test prep company, just like The College Network BUT they offer classroom review sessions. Their costs are on top of the registration, enrollment, exam (and practice exam) fees and any other charges levied by Excelsior. In my limited experience, it's akin to taking a review class for the NCLEX (you still have to pay for your nursing education, NCLEX fees and BoN fees) for some it works for others it does not. If you need an in person tutor in a group environment and can afford the extra costs on top of the Excelsior costs, then it may be beneficial to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Excelsior College is NOT for everyone. You must be internally motivated to be successful in the program. Have you looked to see if any of your local community colleges offer an onsite-online LPN to RN bridge program? These programs\n   are gaining in popularity (online classes and in person clinicals once a week or so) to cater to the working professional who wishes to advance their education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Good luck with whatever you choose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Edited to add: It is NOT cheap, but you cannot get an exact cost and time plan without meeting with an enrollment counselor from Achieve Test Prep either online or in person. I understand that it isn't a hard sell and if it is out of your price range they often recommend that you not pursue their program. Unlike TCN who pushes enrolles to sign up right away with a credit card or for one of their affiliated high interest private loans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Heavenly4505 wrote back to JustBeachyNurse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Thank you JustBeachyNurse. I actually have an appointment \"online\" at 1PM today to talk with an admissions counselor from Achieve. I am not even going to consider College Network. They are way too pushy. I filled out an online information request form on Indiana State's website for their LPN-BSN program, and since then, College Network calls me daily-sometimes 2 or more times a day! I never requested any information at all from College Network-the form I filled out was on Indiana State's site (I made sure of that before I filled it out). I've told them I'm not interested and that need to stop calling, but they continue to call frequently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   I am not aware of any hybrid programs in my area. I live in Cincinnati, OH. If anyone knows of a program with online coursework and onsite clinicals once or twice a week, please let me know. It would have to work with my schedule, though. I work full-time nightshift in a nursing home, and cutting down to part-time or quitting my job is NOT an option at all. Thank you!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   JustBeachyNurse responded to Heavenly4505:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Check with your state Board of Nursing or just look into some of your local community college\n   <em>\n    nursing programs\n   </em>\n   directly (sometimes the information does not show up on Google).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Prepare a list of questions before you appointment this afternoon: such as hidden costs, financing options (if any), scheduling of prep-classes vs. exam scheduling, recommended timeline, etc. Most states you must apply &amp; enroll directly with Excelsior, and pay EC directly for the exams.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   As far as TCN/ISU there is a relationship there. If you did not agree to the contact, look at the \"Do Not Call\" regulations as you do not have a business relationship with them. You can always file a complaint or check with your phone service provider about blocking what amounts to harassing calls. (hence why I don't give my phone number out on online forms, but I have call blocking capabilities on my home phone number. You could always do what I did when my child was younger, if they didn't get the message of \"DO NOT CALL ME ANYMORE\" they got an invitation to speak with my yippy dog who like to shriek at the phone or my then toddler. usually solved the problem quickly.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Heavenly4505 responded to JustBeachyNurse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   LOL @ the yippy dog!

They have a \"hybrid\" program, but the clinicals run late into the evenings, and I have to be at work at 7 PM. If Achieve's program is too expensive, I will most likely just try Excelsior again on my own.

EC's program is set up to provide an outline/syllabus for each class in the form of a free exam content guide that you can download. There are plenty of people out there looking for study buddies, both in person and through other media like Skype, if you need some external motivator to keep you on track. I'd advise you to think twice before you add a lot of money to the bottom line of your education bill! Good luck, whatever you decide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Heavenly4505 wrote back to Pixie.RN:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   I know Achieve is not affiliated with EC. I was just trying to get some motivation to stay on track, and I thought having an instructor and classmates might do that for me. In the end, I decided against Achieve. It's going to cost me over $7000 total for the program, which she said would be a $222 payment per month. And that's on TOP of Excelsior's payment plan for the enrollment fee/tests. It would end up being around $500 per month total, and I don't have that kind of money. I graduated from LPN school with a 4.0 GPA, so it's not a question of whether I can do it or not. I know I can do it; I just need some direction and motivation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The next post was July 11, 2013, which generally discussed Excelsior College, ATP and the limited seats available for in-person nursing education at a community college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   There were no posts until October 2-8, 2013.

Mystudygroup101 can certainly be a great resource but they just provide you with more materials that you need to go through on your own. ATP's classes provide the structure and visual learning that so many people need to be successful. The classes are taught by RN's whose personal knowledge and experience can be a great support system during this journey. I find that the best investment is always whatever is going\n   to help you be most successful in reaching your goals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   On the same day, JustBeachyNurse responded to hardworkinggrn2's post stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   If you need in person classes and support it would be more economical (plus the potential for financial aid &amp; scholarships) to attend a local brick &amp; mortar school rather than the challenge exams of ATP and doubling your costs with a tutoring service.

There is a reason for that. Quite often, test prep companies charge you far more than taking the course through the issuing college or at a local brick and mortar, and give you far less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   My personal belief is that you need to study what the SCHOOL requires you to study (and Excelsior is VERY helpful in this!), not some so-called equivalency program. There isn't a real short-cut to becoming a nurse ... you need to know the entire contents of a course, not the Cliff Notes. It will make you a better nurse (in most cases).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Best of luck!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The next posts took place on September 4, 2014, by GRN77, an employee of ATP (SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 86), and JustBeachyNurse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   GRN77: Test prep will no longer be available for Nursing classes but will continue to still be available for all Gen eds. I would wait until Excelsior releases more details about this change before jumping to conclusions. It is also important to note that Achieve has live instructors leading their test prep classes-this is not true for other programs. Excelsior will conduct their classes as learning modules that need to be completed at your own pace. No live instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   JustBeachyNurse: But if you require live fees or classroom instruction perhaps a potential student should reconsider Excelsior as this is (or at least was) a program intended for independent learners.

Do you work for EC? The notice I got says you have to do the conference the first 8 weeks and then anytime in the next 8 weeks you take the exam. That is the only information that has been put out that I can find. You still have to study for the exam and isn't that what the test prep companies do (supply study material for the exam)? Not that I recommend TCN, RUE or Achieve because I don't-but this still sounds like just an opinion and not a fact. Alot of people are already kicking themselves for signing up with some of these companies and it just seems cruel to stress them further by throwing opinions out there without facts to back it up. That's my 2 cents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Monkeyhq responded the same day to UlanaD as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   This is not my opinion, it is fact. Excelsior provides all the necessary resources for study for their exams, and no test prep company is authorized by Excelsior to work in conjunction with their exams. Effective July 2015, the 16 week participation requirement will provide enhanced learning for the exams, and there will be an increased charge for each subject (that cost has not yet been published).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   Achieve is not enrolling new students for the nursing components for Excelsior because they understand the changes make their services in this regard unnecessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   Some companies are still actively selling a bill of goods for Excelsior nursing exams under the premise that the student can 'challenge exam' those nursing courses upon enrollment and on demand. Unless those students enroll in Excelsior and complete all 8 exams prior to July 2015, along with nearly all of their general education credits, those students are NOT going to be able to 'challenge exam' on demand. They will be forced to pay Excelsior for and participate in the 16 week conferences/study session, at an added as-yet-to-be-determined expense. Some are not informing their students of the change, even though they are aware of the change. As if the many lawsuits, the class-action, the FTC investigations, etc., weren't enough, there will be a whole new group of people sold snake oil. Companies like this have built in their own obsolescence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   Imagine the shock when the student finds out they can't get out of their contract, even though Excelsior changed their requirements? Imagine paying for something you DON'T need, and then not being able to afford what you DO need? Imagine you participate in an online/in-person/printed test prep class only to find that the materials you have studied do not fully correspond to the material you are required to know (and learn) during the 16 week Excelsior system?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   Test-preps are not approved by Excelsior. Since the effective date of Excelsior's program change is July 2015, how can ANY test prep company sell you a bill of goods for a program that has not provided to them the specific material needed to prepare for the post-participation exam?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   The problems Excelsior has had to deal with because of test prep companies is well documented in various resources. Just over a few weeks ago, they added a NEW disclaimer to the front page of their ADN program page on their website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   As for additionally stressing students who have already signed up, I can't help their stress. I wish I could because I feel for them in the deepest possible way, and have four close friends who are dealing with those same stresses. Withholding pertinent information to save those already kicking themselves any additional stress-to the detriment of new persons seeking answers about test prep companies as related to core nursing courses-is preposterous. I CAN help other students who are considering enrolling in one of these test-preps by informing them of the significant changes to the Excelsior program, the lack of need for any test-prep service as related to the nursing components (per Excelsior's own statements), and the associated financial risks that they may encounter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   I am sure those that have already been affected appreciate the attempts of others to bring forth information that may prevent new students from getting themselves into a similar self-kicking situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   On September 11-12, 2014, a number of persons posted on the thread, including users learning-is-good (who is Mark Olynyk, the plaintiff and owner of ATP (SAC, \u00b6 21) ), and John Does duskyjewel and LadyFree28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   As it bears on the allegations in this suit, on September 11, 2014, learning-is-good (Mark Olynyk) wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   I agree with 'UlanaD's' point that 'monkeyhq' is just stating his/her opinion and not fact about whether or not test prep companies are needed or not.

There is no reason to make them feel bad about their decision because this is nothing wrong with the decision they made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   Here is a fact-I can't see anything on Achieve Test Prep's website that states they are no longer offering Excelsior nursing exam test prep classes or that they will stop offering them. Another fact-some people do better in a structured live classroom environment rather than a learn-at-your-own-pace online learning modules like the one Excelsior is running. And Achieve Test Prep does state on its website that they offer live teacher led classes and I believe so do some other test prep centers. Some people need the help provided by the test prep companies and let's face it, being successful with the Excelsior exams is very important because if you fail an exam too many times Excelsior will kick you out of the nursing program permanently. So spending some money for extra help to make sure you pass sounds like a very worthwhile investment to me!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   On the same day, duskyjewel responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   monkeyhq, I think you're doing the Lord's work here, but some people are just never going to listen.

That's silly. I don't think\n   the Lord cares to take a position on whether people utilize the test prep services of one company over another. My guess is the Lord supports freedom of choice. No one solution works for everyone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   monkeyhq makes all these sweeping statements implying all test prep centers are bad and unneeded. Simple common sense would tell you that cant be true. While I do agree the college network does have a bad reputation on the internet, its not fair to punish all test prep centers as a result. I often see blogs from students that state the other test prep companies have made all the difference in the world to their progress. And I have also seen posts from students that tried the Excelsior program directly on their own and failed. It's my opinion that if you need help, you go out and get help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Later that day, learning-is-good (Mark Olynyk) also wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   Excelsior students have until June 30, 2015 to register to take the nursing exams under the current pricing. They just need to register for it, not take it. So long as they register by June 30, 2015 they will have 6 more months to take the exams. So that gives them to December 31, 2015 to complete the exams. That is plenty of time for just about anyone to complete the Excelsior nursing exams before this new program forces them to use Excelsior's test prep program. Again, some people do fine with a learn-it-on-your-own online modules while others prefer a live teacher led test prep module like Achieve's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   I get that you are pro-'do it yourself with Excelsior', but that doesn't work for everyone. Achieve Test Prep is still offering nursing test prep courses for the Excelsior nursing courses and will continue to offer nursing test prep courses regardless of the stance that you take. And yes, if someone wishes to know the true scoop on any company or school, they should just call the place themselves and not trust that all information posted in blogs is accurate. Its not unusual for people to have biased opinions about things and then make up facts to support their own cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   You state that test prep centers over-charge. First, I am unsure how you are able to comment on all test prep centers. Really it seems you are just anti-test prep centers and I might guess there is no information in the world that would change your mind. But what you feel is overcharging, I am sure someone else would fee is fair price for a quality test prep course that helped them pass.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   User monkeyhq also responded to learning-is-good's post that day by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   There are major caveats to your statements.

First, learning-is-good (Mark Olynyk) responded to duskyjewel's post from the previous day, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   My interest in posting my input on this blog is simple-to correct information posted that is incorrect and to provide alternative points of views to obviously one-sided points of view. This helps give the readers a better chance of understanding what their true options are. Isn't that what blogs are largely about? I would hope that even those that don't agree with my actual positions on test prep vs no test prep can still appreciate the common sense behind what I have just said here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   I am not saying learning requires a live classroom environment. I am saying many people do better in the live classroom environment. And many people prefer the live classroom. And of course some don't. Mostly I am saying-let people choose what works best for them. Some people seem intent on forcing their opinions on others. My message will always be to just let people choose for themselves. Don't say things are black and white, and this is good and that is bad. Instead its better to say different things work for different people. There is no one right point of view in this world but rather many points of views. Anyone that truly has the best interest of the readers at heart, certainly can appreciate those points.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   User duskyjewel then responded to learning-is-good's post on September 12, 2014:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   Your point of view is just as one-sided. Just saying. The difference here is that monkeyhq has backed hers up over and over again with factual statements from the organizations being discussed, while you keep resorting to emotional appeal. Do you think people should be left to \"choose for themselves\" disastrously by someone who has information that can help them? Some of these test prep companies are under federal investigation for fraudulent practices! Wouldn't it be immoral for a person who knows that not to point that out to someone thinking of paying them a ton of money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   Are you sure that some of your passion doesn't come from having sunk thousands of dollars into one of these companies yourself, and having a hard time being told that you might be getting defrauded?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Learning-is-good (Mark Olynyk) responded on the same day to duskyjewel's post:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Duskyjewel, You going to scare people by saying some test prep centers are under federal investigation, but my guess is it's just one. And there are colleges losing their accreditation for nursing programs all the time and if you check with Excelsior's accrediting body you will see they had their nursing program on probation not that long ago. And you will see that some nursing boards in 15 states either restrict or totally reject the Excelsior ASN degree and won't allow graduates to sit for the NCLEX. Does that mean the program is no good? Of course not. Some states are ok with Excelsior's program and others are not. There is that difference of opinion thing again. And does what one college do mean the next college is also guilty of the same? Of course not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   Bottom line is test prep centers work well and help a lot of people. Maybe some people feel threatened by that because they didn't get the benefit of the test prep centers when they attended a regular 4 year degree program and spend a ton of money on it, and therefor don't want others to benefit from the help the test prep centers provide? Other than some bad stories relating to always the same test prep center, I have never heard anyone with a story of being defrauded by the other test prep centers. Don't group all test prep centers\n   into the same category because of one bad apple. It just not fair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   LadyFree28 then responded on the same day to the posts by learning-is-good and duskyjewel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   But the discussion is about THIS particular test-prep program that IS being investigated by the federal government and is under a current lawsuit; there are too many forums that have stated the Achieve \"deceived\" them with their practices; that is the MAIN focus of this discussion, NOT \"other test prep companies.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   User duskyjewel also responded to learning-is-good's comment to duskyjewel (\"You going to scare people by saying some test prep centers are under federal investigation, but my guess is it's just one\") by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   Sounds like you should be scared.

This statement is quintessential opinion because it simply reflects JustBeachyNurse's state of mind and her view as to whether ATP's services will provide any use or value. Whether something is redundant depends on a whole host of factors and could be different for each person. For example, in reading the entire thread, there were many comments about the various ways to gain entrance into nursing programs, pass nursing exams, and how to pass Excelsior College exams specifically. Posters opined as to the relative value of third party test preparation companies. What might be \"redundant\" for one test-taker might not be redundant for another as, for example, with bar examination preparation courses. While one law student, who might be gravely concerned about the examination, may opt to take one or more preparation courses, another student may consider courses redundant and may take no course at all, preferring to rely on his or her law school education as preparation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Significantly, the statement that JustBeachyNurse offered to support her opinion of redundancy-\"as of July 1, 2014 when all challenge exam candidates will be mandated to take the Excelsior online exam prep classes prior to becoming eligible to sit the challenge exams\"-even if verifiable and false (thus, converting the redundancy comment to a mixed opinion), was not a statement about ATP and there is nothing about the statement that cast ATP in a negative light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Likewise, monkeyhq's statement that \"Test Prep companies for Excelsior Exams will be \"obsolete\" by July 1, 2015,\" is pure opinion, as it is not something that can be verified as true or false. Whether something will be obsolete at a future date is in the eye of the beholder and dependent on many factors. For instance, many people rely on technology that others characterize as \"obsolete,\" such as landline telephone service. \"Obsolete\" is used interchangeably with \"dated\" or \"old fashioned.\"\n   <em>\n    https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/obsolete\n   </em>\n   . As with the concept of \"redundancy,\" what is \"obsolete\" is dependent on one's point of view and state of mind. In fact, learning-is-good, who is Mark Olynyk and the owner of ATP, expressly acknowledged in his post on September 11, 2014, that monkeyhq's comments were opinion (\"I agree with 'UlanaD's' point that 'monkeyhq' is just stating his/her opinion and not fact about whether or not test prep companies are needed or not.\"). He then went on to clarify what ATP does and does not offer. Further, the \"factual support\" for monkeyhq's opinion about obsolescence was \"As Beachy said,\" and what \"JustBeachyNurse said\" is not actionable for the reasons stated above. In addition, like the redundancy comment by JustBeachyNurse, monkeyhq's statement is not a statement about ATP and there is nothing in it that casts ATP in a negative light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Additionally, when examining whether statements are defamatory, one must take into the account the context of these statements, and statements cannot be examined in isolation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"23921\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/161/152/#p164\">\n    735 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1137 ;\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10706521\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/545/699/#p706\">\n    545 N.W.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the redundancy and obsolescence statements are read in the context of the post that immediately followed in the thread on September 4, 2014, ATP's employee, GRN, agreed that ATP was not going to offer test preps for nursing classes, although it would offer them for Gen Eds. Further, GRN did not contradict JustBeachyNurse's statement about what challenge exam candidates would or would not be required to do. Instead, he suggested that the reader wait until Excelsior released more details about the changes they were making and explained the services offered\n   by ATP that are not offered by other programs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , ATP has live instructors leading their test prep classes, while Excelsior does not).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Moreover, when these statements are examined in the context of the entire thread, it is clear from the colloquy among all the posters, that they were engaged in a robust give-and-take discourse regarding the pros and cons of a variety of options for schooling to become a nurse, the advisability and value of taking test prep courses to obtain degrees, and what Excelsior College in particular would and would not require to obtain a degree from it. Some of the posters were quite positive about third-party test preparation courses, including ATP, others were not. There is nothing about the postings by JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq in the context of the thread as a whole (or even up to and including their posts) that suggests that they were making false statements about ATP, which were designed to cast it in a negative light or to harm ATP's reputation and to lower ATP in the estimation of the community of Allnurses' readers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Finally, even if the Court had concluded that ATP had made out a prima facie case of defamation as to JustBeachyNurse's and monkeyhq's statements, the Court finds that in balancing ATP's interests against their interests in remaining anonymous against ATP's interests, the scales tip in favor of denying discovery of the their identities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Highfields Capital Mgmt.

JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq, like the other posters, including Mark Olynyk, engaged in precisely the kind of speech that online communities and discussion threads exist to support-the sharing of opinions and personal experiences for the benefit of others in the online community. To permit discovery of their identities would unacceptably chill this type of speech and cause others in the online community to withhold their opinions for fear of litigation. ATP's interest in using the discovery process to unmask JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq for the opinions ATP disputes, does not outweigh the interests of JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq to remain anonymous, particularly where ATP has failed to make a concrete showing that these opinions have cast it in a negative light or have lowered its reputation in the estimation of Allnurses' readers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court denies ATP's motion as to JustBeachyNurse and monkeyhq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, as Allnurses pointed out, it has always been understood that Allnurses possessed some identifying information regarding the John Doe posters, including JustBeachyNurse. The critical factor is that as to the public, JustBeachyNurse is an anonymous poster-a choice she made when she adopted a pseudonym to use publically, without any identifying information. Second, whether JustBeachyNurse was a moderator a year before posting her alleged defamatory comments has no bearing on any issue pending before this Court with respect to the motion to compel. As ATP conceded, issues relating to the CDA are not relevant to the motion to compel, rendering\n   JustBeachyNurse's status vis-\u00e0-vis Allnurses immaterial to the Court's decision on ATP's motion.

For starters, Allnurses' arguments opposing the motion based on the pendency of its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and its request to file a motion for reconsideration are moot in light of Judge Tunheim's denial of the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and this Court's denial of the request to file a motion for reconsideration. Second, ATP brought its motion within the time allowed under the operative scheduling order, and there is no evidence of undue delay, bad faith, or prejudice to Allnurses. Third, the Court has determined that the proposed amendments are not futile. ATP has pled that the statements in the \"open letter\" were false, published to third parties and injurious to ATP's reputation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTAC, \u00b6\u00b6 351-372, 400. The additional facts reflected in these paragraphs were more than \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The new facts were based on the undisputed text of Allnurses' letter and the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that the statements are not actionable, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , because they are statements of pure opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Fourth, Allnurses' arguments that the known John Does are entitled to ongoing First Amendment protection is meritless. The Court considered and rejected this argument in connection with Allnurses' request seeking leave to file a motion for reconsideration and again in connection with ATP's motion to compel. ATP has discovered the identities of duskyjewel, Pixie.RN and LadyFree28 and may now amend the complaint to add these individuals as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   ATP is directed to file and serve the Third Amended Complaint as found at Docket No. 233-1.
