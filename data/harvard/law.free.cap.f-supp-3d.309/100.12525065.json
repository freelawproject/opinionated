(\"Patriot National\") and Steven M. Mariano. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hudson Bay's Mot. to Dismiss Defs.' Countercls. (\"Hudson Bay Mot.\"), 16-cv-2767, ECF No. 148; CVII's Mot. to Dismiss Countercls. (\"CVII Mot.\"), 16-cv-2787, ECF No. 81.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In April 2016, the Funds filed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   breach of contract claims against Defendants involving the purchase and delivery of company shares from Patriot National. (Hudson Bay Compl., ECF No. 1; CVII Compl., ECF No. 1.) On November 21, 2016, this Court struck Defendants' affirmative defenses including those based on fraudulent inducement and market manipulation for inadequate pleading and prejudice to the Funds by dramatically increasing the cost of discovery and trial. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Mem. Decision and Order (\"Order\"), 16-cv-2767, ECF No. 72, at 2.) This Court, however, did not strike Defendants' breach of contract affirmative defenses. Instead, those allegations moved forward as specific denials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the Funds filed amended complaints, Defendants amended their answers and included counterclaims similar to the affirmative defenses this Court struck for inadequate pleading. Specifically, Patriot National alleges that the Funds manipulated the market and made material misrepresentations and omissions in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (Patriot National's Countercls. against Hudson Bay (\"Patriot's Hudson Bay Countercls.\"), ECF No. 122, \u00b6\u00b6 48-68; Patriot National's Countercls. against CVII (\"Patriot's CVII Countercls.\"), ECF No. 65, \u00b6\u00b6 44-64.) Patriot National also brings common law fraudulent inducement and breach of contract counterclaims against the Funds. (Patriot's Hudson Bay Countercls. \u00b6\u00b6 69-84; Patriot's CVII Countercls. \u00b6\u00b6 65-80.) In addition to his market manipulation, fraudulent inducement, and breach of contract counterclaims, Defendant Mariano also brings a counterclaim for breach of the duty of\n   good faith and fair dealing against Hudson Bay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mariano's Countercls. against Hudson Bay (\"Mariano's Hudson Bay Countercls.\"), ECF No. 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Funds move to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims arguing that they are procedurally barred pursuant to the law of the case and for failure to seek leave to amend. (Hudson Bay Mot. at 7-9; CVII Mot. at 8-10.) The Funds also move to dismiss the counterclaims for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. (Hudson Bay Mot. at 11-25; CVII Mot. at 12-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motions to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patriot National's market manipulation, material misrepresentation and omissions, and fraudulent inducement counterclaims are DISMISSED. Mariano's market manipulation, fraudulent inducement and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing counterclaims are also DISMISSED. Defendants' breach of contract counterclaims remain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 13, 2015, Hudson Bay, CVII, and another investor, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") for a Private Investment in Public Equity (\"PIPE\") transaction with Defendants Patriot National and its Chief Executive Officer, Mariano. The transaction provided for \"the sale to the investors of: (a) $30 million in Patriot stock by Mariano for his own benefit, and (b) $20 million in shares newly issued by Patriot for general corporate purposes.\" (CVII Am. Compl., ECF No. 56, \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hudson Bay Am. Compl., ECF No. 102, \u00b6 19.) To account for the \"risks and attendant uncertainties in the price of Patriot shares,\" the Funds negotiated for the grant of a Series B Warrant, which entitled them to additional shares based on a price adjustment mechanism that increased the number of shares available if Patriot National's stock declined over a certain period of time. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6 19; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6 5.) Defendants also agreed to grant the Funds a Series A Warrant, which gave the Funds the right to purchase additional Patriot National shares at the lesser of a fixed price of $10 per share or a discount to the market price as of a certain exercise date. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6 18; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Funds allege that upon public disclosure of the transaction, on or about\n   December 14, 2015, Patriot National's stock price sharply declined. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6 15; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6 26.) As a result, the parties agreed to restructure the deal, which culminated in a Rescission and Exchange Agreement (\"REA\" together with the SPA the \"Transaction Documents\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   dated December 23, 2015. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6 16; Hudson Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.) Under the REA, Patriot National's sale of certain shares to the Funds were rescinded and other terms were renegotiated, but the overall structure of the agreement remained essentially the same and granted the Funds new Series A and B Warrants. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-33.) After the REA closed, the Funds allege that the price for Patriot National shares again dropped substantially and continued to decline. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6 42; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6 49.) The Funds attribute this decline in part to Patriot National's February 24, 2016 earnings announcement for the fourth quarter of 2015, which reported a \"worse-than-expected financial performance.\" (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6 42; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 5, 2016, the Funds sought to partially exercise the Series B Warrant and allege that although they had fully performed their obligations under the contract, Patriot National refused to deliver them the shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52, 55.) Patriot National informed the Funds that its refusal to transfer the requested shares was due to an ongoing investigation by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority's Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; Hudson Bay Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 13, 2016, Hudson Bay filed the instant action against Defendants Patriot National and Mariano for specific performance and breach of contract involving the purchase and delivery of Patriot National shares under the Series B Warrant. (Hudson Bay Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 73-85). Hudson Bay also claims tortious interference by Mariano, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-101), and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against both Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-92.) One day later, on April 14, 2016, CVII filed a related action naming Patriot National as the sole defendant and also alleging breach of contract for a similar failure to deliver shares and asking this Court to enforce specific performance of the contract. (CVII Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Patriot National answered Hudson Bay's Complaint on May 5, 2016 asserting a number of affirmative defenses, including: (i) that \"Plaintiff breached (and/or repudiated) the Transaction Documents and the [non-disclosure agreement]\"; (ii) fraudulent inducement, and (iii) that the Transaction Documents \"are void as against public policy, insofar as they purport to allow Plaintiff to engage in conduct that is prohibited under federal law, including but not limited to insider trading and market manipulation in violation of the federal securities laws.\" (Patriot National's Ans. to Hudson Bay Compl., ECF No. 26, at 20-22.) Mariano separately answered Hudson Bay's Complaint that same day asserting similar affirmative defenses. (Mariano Ans. to Hudson Bay Compl., ECF No. 19, at 14-17.) On May 6, 2016, Patriot National answered CVII's Complaint asserting substantially the same affirmative defenses as it did in its answer to Hudson Bay's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Patriot National's Ans. to CVII Compl., ECF No. 11, at 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Funds moved for partial judgment on the pleadings as to their respective breach of contract claims pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Hudson Bay's Mot. J. on the Pleadings (\"Hudson 12(c) Mot.\"), ECF No. 32, at 5-14; CVII's Mot. J. on the Pleadings (\"CVII 12(c) Mot.\"), ECF No. 16, at 15-21.) The Funds also moved to strike Defendants' affirmative defenses. (Hudson 12(c) Mot. at 15-24; CVII 12(c) Mot. at 5-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At oral argument and in their opposition papers, Defendants argued that the Funds had failed to perform under the Transaction Documents. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Patriot National Opp'n to Hudson 12(c) Mot. (\"Patriot 12(c) Opp'n\"), ECF No. 38, at 12.) Defendants argued that their obligations to transfer the stock to the Funds were expressly contingent on certain conditions that, upon information and belief, the Funds had failed to meet. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   July 21, 2016, Oral Arg. Tr., ECF No. 60, at 42:8-10.) One of those conditions related to the Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"NDA\") the Funds entered into prior to signing the SPA. Under the NDA, CVII agreed not to \"disclose to any third party or use or permit any third party to use any of the information provided except to evaluate the Proposed transaction.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Patriot 12(c) Opp'n at 3-4.) Hudson Bay agreed not to \"engage in transactions, or cause anyone else to engage in transactions, related to Patriot National's securities prior to the public announcement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon signing the SPA, the Funds also represented that they had not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   engaged in any transactions in the securities of [Patriot National] (including, without limitation, any Short Sales ... involving the [Patriot National's] securities) during the period commencing as of the time that such Buyer was first contacted by the Company ... regarding the specific investment in the Company contemplated by this Agreement and ending immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement by such Buyer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5 (citing SPA \u00a7 2(j) ).) Defendants argued that the Funds breached the Transaction Documents by borrowing shares before the December 13, 2015 execution of the SPA and by engaging in short sales during the pricing period for the Warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-8.) Defendants were concerned about the \"inexplicable timing of the massive borrowing and shorting that coincided with the NDA and the closing of the Transaction\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7), and argued that the Funds \"were one of the only few people who knew about the possibility of this transaction[.]\" (Oral Arg. Tr., 42:19-24.) Therefore, the Funds were the ones responsible for the transactions in violation of their express representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Relying on another portion of \u00a7 2(j) of the SPA, which specifically excludes \"the location and/or reservation of borrowable shares\" from the definition of \"Short Sales,\" the Funds disputed any breach on their part, arguing that \u00a7 2(j) expressly carves out as permissible the borrowing of shares before disclosure of the transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Fludson Bay's Reply in Supp. of 12(c) Mot. (\"Hudson 12(c) Reply\"), ECF No. 55, at 3.) The Funds further argued that under the SPA, they were allowed to short once the transaction became public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They argued that pursuant to \u00a7 3(a)(xxxii) of the SPA, Defendants acknowledged that \" '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Buyers may engage in hedging and/or trading activities\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ' during the pricing period for the Warrant and that such shorting and other hedging activities '\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      do not constitute a breach of this Agreement, the Warrants, or any other Transaction Document or any of the documents executed in connection herewith\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      or therewith\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing SPA \u00a7 3(a)(xxxii) ) (emphases in original).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In denying the Funds' motions for partial judgment on the pleadings, this Court found that \"[b]ecause the Transaction Documents only permitted Hudson Bay to participate in short selling after the execution of the Transaction, Patriot's allegations [of borrowing and shorting] raise factual issues inappropriate for resolution at the judgment on the pleadings stage.\" (Order at 10.) This Court also took issue with the timing of the alleged transactions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   While Patriot alleges that borrowing occurred on November 30, 2015, prior to the December 13, 2015 execution of the SPA, it is unclear whether those borrowed shares actually led to any prohibited short sales prior to December 13....Additionally, the Transaction Documents are unclear whether such prohibitions on borrowing or short selling expired on December 13, 2015 or on December 23, 2015, the execution date of the REA. 'Prior to the execution of this Agreement,' as provided in \u00a7 2(j) could mean prior to the signing of the SPA on December 13, 2015. But, because the parties reopened negotiations regarding the SPA shortly thereafter, 'prior to the execution of this Agreement' could also reasonably refer to any time prior to the signing and execution of the REA on December 23, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) The decision struck Defendants' affirmative defenses, including those of fraudulent inducement and market manipulation, as insufficient as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Defendants' request for leave to amend was denied \"since Defendants ... proffered no set of facts to demonstrate that such amendments would not be futile.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 31, 2017, Hudson Bay filed an amended complaint adding another claim for specific performance, alleging that in early August 2016, Patriot National refused to honor its exercise of the Series A Warrant. (Hudson Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.) Similarly, CVII filed an amended complaint on February 22, 2017 alleging a breach of contract claim for failure to deliver shares pursuant to the Series A Warrant. (CVII Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-87.) On March 24, 2017, Patriot National filed its answer to the amended complaints and counterclaims in both Hudson Bay and CVII actions. (Patriot's Hudson Bay Countercls., ECF No. 122; Patriot's CVII Countered., ECF No. 65.) Mariano filed an answer to Hudson Bay's amended complaint on March 31, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mariano's Hudson Bay Countercls., ECF No. 128.) Along with their opposition briefs, Defendants also filed proposed amended counterclaims for this Court's consideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Patriot's Hudson Bay Proposed Am. Countercls., ECF No. 162-01; Patriot's CVII Proposed Am. Countercls., ECF No. 93-1; Mariano's Hudson Bay Proposed Am. Countercls., ECF No 164-06.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Indeed, not only did Defendants expressly agree to permit the Funds to short once the deal was announced, Defendants acknowledged that any such \"hedging and/or trading activities\" could affect the value and number of shares owed under the Warrants and dilute shareholder equity, but would not constitute a breach of the agreement as a result.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Hudson Bay Mot. at 14 (arguing that \u00a7 2(j) of the SPA \"expressly authorized [the Funds] to reserve Patriot stock ahead of the deal going public, and to short it afterwards.\").)
