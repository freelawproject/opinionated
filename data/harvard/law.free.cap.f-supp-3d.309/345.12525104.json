Plaintiff in the case before me, Catlin Specialty Insurance Company (\"Catlin\"), seeks a judicial declaration that the insurance policy it issued to Defendant, J.J. White, Inc. (\"J.J. White\"), does not cover losses from this lawsuit, which was brought by the estate of a J.J. White employee. J.J. White-and purported additional insureds that have intervened in this action, Sunoco, Inc. and Sunoco, Inc. (R &amp; M) (collectively, \"Sunoco\")-have asserted counterclaims against Catlin, arguing that Catlin breached its duty to defend them in\n   the underlying lawsuit, and seek reimbursement for the amount that J.J. White and Sunoco paid to settle that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently before me are two cross-motions for summary judgment: (1) Catlin's \"Motion for Summary Judgment;\" and (2) J.J. White and Sunoco's \"Amended Motion for Summary Judgment or, Alternatively, Partial Summary Judgment.\" For the reasons that follow, Catlin's Motion will be denied and J.J. White and Sunoco's Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted: At all times relevant to this matter, J.J. White provided maintenance services for refineries, including maintaining and replacing pipes within such refineries. J.J. White's clients included Sunoco, which operated refineries in and around Philadelphia. J.J. White provided its services to Sunoco as a general contractor under a series of agreements referred to as the \"Field Services Contracts.\" Under the Field Services Contracts, J.J. White was required to maintain certain insurance policies and name Sunoco as an additional insured on those policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (J.J.

White first obtained the insurance policy at issue in this case from Catlin in 2009, which was entitled \"Contractor's Protective Professional and Pollution Legal Liability Insurance Policy\" (hereinafter the \"Pollution Policy\"). By the time the claim at issue in this case was made, in 2012, the Pollution Policy had been renewed twice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (J.J.

White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the Pollution Policy has three coverage parts-A, B, and C-only one, Coverage C (entitled \"Pollution Legal Liability\"), is at issue. Coverage C provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    Insurer\n   </strong>\n   shall pay on behalf of\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   for a\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Loss\n   </strong>\n   ... which the\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   has or will become legally obligated to pay as a result a [sic, read \"as a result of a\"]\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Claim\n   </strong>\n   first made against the Insured and reported to the Insurer, in writing, during the\n   <strong>\n    Policy Period\n   </strong>\n   ... from\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Conditions\n   </strong>\n   ..., provided that ... the\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Conditions\n   </strong>\n   first occurred on or after the\n   <strong>\n    Retroactive Date\n   </strong>\n   ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Pollution Policy defines the term \"Pollution Condition\" (singular) as: \"the discharge, dispersal, release, seepage, migration or escape of smoke, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, asbestos, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants ... into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water.\" (Decl. of Matthew J. Ford (hereinafter \"Ford Decl.\"), Ex. A (hereinafter \"Pollution Policy\") \u00a7\u00a7 I, IV.Q.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the language above indicates, the Pollution Policy is a \"claims-made\" policy, as opposed to an \"occurrence-based\" policy. That is, the Pollution Policy provides coverage for a certain claim based on the date that the claim was made against the insured, rather than the date on which the event that gave rise to the claim occurred. However, like many claims-made insurance policies, the Pollution Policy has an occurrence-based proviso to its coverage-a \"retroactive date.\" (This provision is referred to hereinafter as the \"Retroactive Date Provision.\") As set out above, the Retroactive Date Provision provides that even if a claim is \"made ... during the Policy Period,\" there is only coverage if \"the Pollution Conditions first occurred on or after the Retroactive Date.\" The Pollution Policy specifies a retroactive date of April 30, 2002. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25, 34; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25, 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the Pollution Policy names J.J. White as the \"Named Insured,\" it provides that Coverage C will also cover, as an additional insured, \"any client of [J.J. White] that [J.J. White] has agreed by written contract to name as an additional insured on this Policy, but solely as respects otherwise covered Pollution Losses caused by [J.J. White's] Contractor Activity.\" (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 19; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Underlying Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   George Gans was a longtime employee of J.J. White who worked as a contractor in Sunoco's refineries-beginning as early as 1986 and continuing through 2010. In 2010, Gans was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, and died of this condition shortly thereafter. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 40; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 40; Catlin SOF \u00b6 12; J.J. White/Sunoco's Resp. to Catlin's SOF \u00b6 12; Ford Decl., Ex. C \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2011, Gans' estate brought suit against Sunoco, alleging that his leukemia was caused by exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons (collectively, \"BTEX\") while working in Sunoco's refineries, and that Sunoco had failed to take adequate steps to protect Gans from this hazard. (The suit is referred to hereinafter as the \"Gans Suit.\") Importantly, the complaint in the Gans Suit did not allege on what dates, exactly, Gans was exposed to BTEX, but only that Gans was exposed before May 1, 2010. (Catlin's SOF \u00b6 7; J.J. White/Sunoco's Resp. to Catlin's SOF \u00b6 7; J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 37; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In March 2012, Sunoco informed J.J. White of the Gans Suit, requesting that J.J. White defend and indemnity it, pursuant to the Field Services Contracts. In turn, J.J. White informed Catlin of the Gans Suit, advising that Sunoco was seeking coverage as an additional insured under the Pollution Policy. Thereafter, in September 2012, Sunoco made J.J. White a party to the Gans Suit, filing a third-party complaint against it for indemnification. (Catlin's SOF \u00b6 9, J.J. White/Sunoco's Resp. to Catlin's SOF \u00b6 9; J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Catlin agreed to defend J.J. White subject to a reservation of rights, informing J.J. White that it would not be covered for the Gans Suit if \"there was chemical exposure to [Gans] that pre-dates the Retroactive Date,\" April 30, 2002. Catlin did not agree to defend Sunoco, which retained and paid for its own counsel. (Catlin's SOF \u00b6 10; J.J. White/Sunoco's Resp. to Catlin's SOF \u00b6 10; J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 67, 72; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 67, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Meanwhile, discovery proceeded in the Gans Suit. By October 2013, both Gans' estate and Sunoco had produced expert reports. These reports disagreed as to the cause of Gans' leukemia. While the estate's experts opined that Gans' years of exposure to BTEX had likely caused him to develop leukemia, defense experts disagreed, contending that Gans' leukemia was more likely \"idiopathic\" (i.e., of indeterminate cause) or the result of Gans' years of cigarette smoking and family history of cancer. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 75, 77-79, 81-85; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 75, 77-79, 81-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In early 2014, three of Gans' coworkers were deposed-John Keegan, Thomas Tyrrell, and Charles Burns. While J.J. White and Sunoco dispute the reliability of this deposition testimony, Keegan, Tyrell, and Burns testified generally that in the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s Gans was exposed to liquids and gasses that-they believed-contained BTEX. (Catlin's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 14-15; J.J. White/Sunoco's Resp. to Catlin's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thereafter, on February 27, 2014, Catlin filed this action seeking a declaration that the Pollution Policy does not provide coverage for the Gans Suit. The following day, Catlin sent a letter to J.J. White disclaiming coverage for, and withdrawing its defense of, the Gans Suit, explaining its position that Keegan's deposition testimony established that Gans had been exposed to BTEX before the Pollution Policy's April 30, 2002, retroactive date. (Catlin's SOF \u00b6 16; J.J. White/Sunoco's Resp. to Catlin's SOF \u00b6 16; J.J White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; Catlin's Resp. to J.J White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Less than a week after Catlin disclaimed coverage, J.J. White and Sunoco reached a settlement with Gans' estate. J.J. White and Sunoco agreed to settle for $3.5 million-of which $2.5 million was to be paid by Sunoco and $1 million was to be paid by J.J. White. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 105-106, 110; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 105-106, 110; Decl. of James J. Black, III, Esq. (\"Black Decl.\"), Ex. C, Doc. No. 108-23 at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After Catlin brought this declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that there is no coverage for the Gans Suit, J.J. White counterclaimed, alleging that Catlin breached its duty to defend. Sunoco intervened, alleging that it is an additional insured under the Pollution Policy and that it too was entitled to a defense from Catlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties have now cross-moved for summary judgment. Catlin contends that it is entitled to a declaration that there is no coverage for the Gans Suit, because the record in that suit established beyond genuine dispute that Gans was first exposed to BTEX before the Pollution Policy's Retroactive Date, April 30, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In their own Motion for Summary Judgment, J.J. White and Sunoco contend that, as a matter of law, Catlin breached its duty to defend by withdrawing its defense of the Gans Suit while the cause of Gans' leukemia was still in dispute. J.J. White and Sunoco further contend that, because Catlin breached its duty to defend, Catlin must indemnify them for the $3.5 million settlement they subsequently agreed to pay to settle the Gans Suit. Alternatively, J.J. White and Sunoco seek partial summary judgment on their position that the Retroactive Date Provision is an \"exclusion\" to coverage, the applicability of which Catlin, as the insurer, bears the burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   And finally, Sunoco contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on its claim that it is an additional insured on the\n   Pollution Policy-and therefore also entitled to defense and indemnity from Catlin-based on the provision of the Pollution Policy that provides coverage to any entity that J.J. White agrees, by written contract, to name as an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Catlin is not entitled to summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim that the Pollution Policy does not cover the Gans Suit. I further find, as a matter of law, that Catlin breached its duty to defend the Gans Suit by withdrawing its defense and disclaiming coverage. However, I conclude that this breach does not, in itself, establish that Catlin is required to indemnify J.J. White and Sunoco for the amount that they paid to settle the Gans Suit. I further conclude that the Pollution Policy's Retroactive Date Provision is not an \"exclusion\" to the Pollution Policy, but part of the initial grant of coverage, as to which J.J. White and Sunoco, as insureds, bear the burden of proof. And finally, I conclude that Sunoco is an additional insured under the Pollution Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In advancing this argument, J.J. White and Sunoco point to the choice of law clause's use of the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    subject [to] interpretation\n   </em>\n   under the law of the State of New York.\" J.J. White and Sunoco's position appears to be that if the parties to the Pollution Policy intended other aspects of New York's substantive law to apply, the parties would have phrased the choice of law clause differently-by, for example, providing that the Pollution Policy \"shall be\n   <em>\n    governed by\n   </em>\n   the law of the State of New York.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   One commentator has recently summarized this argument, and how courts have addressed it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The typical choice-of-law clause comes in one of two varieties. The first states that a contract shall be \"interpreted\" or \"construed\" in accordance with the law of a particular state. The second provides that an agreement shall be \"governed\" by the law of that state. In principle, this linguistic variation could be important. If the court were to conclude that the act of interpreting a contract was fundamentally different from the act of determining the rights and obligations of the parties under the contract, for example, then the parties' choice of words could matter a great deal. In practice, however, most courts have recognized the formulations set forth above are essentially interchangeable. This is the canon of linguistic equivalence. This canon posits that it is unlikely that the parties would want to choose the law of one state to interpret their agreement and the law of another state to determine the scope of their rights and obligations under that same agreement. Accordingly, the canon holds that each of the words \"interpreted\" and \"construed\" and \"governed\" is the functional equivalent of the other two in the context of a choice-of-law clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   John F.

Once again, the Pollution Policy's relevant coverage provision, Coverage C, reads, in relevant part, as follows (with defined terms in bold, and the Retroactive Date Provision in italics):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    Insurer\n   </strong>\n   shall pay on behalf of\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   for a\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Loss\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... which the\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   has or will become legally obligated to pay as a result [of] a\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Claim\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... from\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Conditions\n   </strong>\n   ...,\n   <em>\n    provided that ... the\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pollution Conditions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    first occurred on or after the\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Retroactive Date\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    ....\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   And again, the Pollution Policy defines the term \"Pollution Condition\" (singular) as (in relevant part): \"the discharge, dispersal, release, seepage, migration or escape of ... toxic chemicals [etc.] ... into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Catlin argues that the Retroactive Date Provision precludes coverage for the Gans Suit because there is no genuine dispute that Gans was first exposed\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to BTEX in Sunoco's refineries before the retroactive date, April 30, 2002. Thus, Catlin contends, the Retroactive Date Provision precludes coverage because the \"Pollution Conditions\" alleged in the Gans Suit-Gans' exposure to BTEX-\"first occurred\" before the retroactive date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   J.J. White and Sunoco assert that the mere fact that Gans was exposed to BTEX before the retroactive date is insufficient to preclude coverage. Rather, they argue, the Retroactive Date Provision only precludes coverage if Gans' pre-retroactive-date exposures to BTEX caused his leukemia. According to J.J. White and Sunoco, this is so because: (1) the Retroactive Date Provision's use of the term \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions\" refers to those Pollution Conditions (i.e., exposures to BTEX) described earlier in Coverage C; and (2) Coverage\n   C's use of the terms \"as a result [of]\" and \"from\" indicate that the Pollution Conditions described therein are those that\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   the \"Pollution Loss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the reasons that follow, I conclude that J.J.

First, the Retroactive Date Provision uses the word \"the\" to refer to specific Pollution Conditions-providing that there is only coverage if \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions first occurred on or after the retroactive date.\" Thus, the existence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions does not trigger the Retroactive Date Provision, only\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions described earlier in Coverage C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions\" described earlier in Coverage C are those Pollution Conditions that ultimately caused the loss-not any Pollution Conditions alleged in the underlying lawsuit regardless of whether those Pollution Conditions are ultimately determined by the factfinder to be the cause of the loss. This is clear because Coverage C provides coverage for a \"Pollution Loss ... which the insured has or will become obligated to pay\n   <em>\n    as a result [of]\n   </em>\n   a Pollution Claim ...\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions.\" The use of the terms \"as a result of\" and \"from\"-both of which denote causation-make clear that \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   Pollution Conditions\" are the Pollution Conditions that caused the loss.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burrage v.

White and Sunoco, it is worth noting that the interpretation set out above is consistent with J.J. White's reasonable expectations in choosing April 30, 2002, as the retroactive date.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v. Am. Int'l Grp, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508920\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/121/#p124\">\n    283 F.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 (2d Cir. 2002) (applying New York law and noting that \"ambiguous language should be construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured when [it] entered into the contract\"). J.J. White chose this date in order to avoid any gap or overlap in coverage between its final \"occurrence-based\" policy, which expired as of that date, and its first \"claims-made\" policy, which began on that date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 36; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 36.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, J.J. White reasonably expected that any loss caused by Pollution Conditions would be covered by one (and only one) of these two policies. Losses caused by pre-retroactive-date Pollution Conditions would be covered by the occurrence-based policy; and any other loss from Pollution Conditions would be covered by its Pollution Policy with Catlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   By contrast, the interpretation urged by Catlin would confound these reasonable expectations. As Catlin apparently concedes, under its interpretation of the Pollution Policy, the Retroactive Date Provision would preclude coverage even if Gans had been exposed to a miniscule, indisputably non-harmful amount of BTEX before the retroactive date, followed by a large, clearly harmful amount of BTEX after the retroactive date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Catlin's Br. in Opp'n to J.J. White/Sunoco's Mot. 4 (noting that \"the definition of Pollution Condition 'is very broad' and encompasses a scenario where 'prior to 2002, ... Gans, on a single occasion, had been exposed to even a few drops of or inhaled a couple of breaths that had minute amounts of benzene.' \") ) Thus, under Catlin's interpretation, even if Gans' leukemia was entirely caused by BTEX exposure occurring after the retroactive date-and therefore not covered by J.J. White's previous occurrence-based policy-the loss would still not be covered under the Pollution Policy, if Gans had been exposed to any amount of BTEX before the retroactive date. Such a scenario would result in no coverage under either J.J. White's previous occurrence-based policy or the Pollution Policy with Catlin. J.J. White could not reasonably have expected such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Catlin argues that its interpretation of the Retroactive Date Provision is consistent with two cases in which courts have applied a retroactive date provision to bar coverage for an insured's pollution-related loss.

Because, as discussed above, the Retroactive Date Provision precludes coverage for a loss only if the loss was caused by pre-retroactive-date Pollution Conditions, Catlin was obligated to defend the Gans Suit until it could establish as a matter of law that, to the extent Gans' leukemia was caused by exposure to BTEX, it was caused by BTEX exposures that occurred before the retroactive date, April 30, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I conclude, as a matter of law, that Catlin breached its duty to defend because it could not, and did not, establish this fact at the time it withdrew its defense and disclaimed coverage-February 27, 2014. Rather, at this point in the Gans Suit, discovery was still ongoing, and the record established a genuine dispute as to whether\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   exposure to BTEX-before or after the retroactive date-was the cause of Gans' leukemia. And as J.J. White and Sunoco point out, Catlin was aware that this point was disputed in the litigation. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 96; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Indeed, J.J. White and Sunoco's position in the Gans Suit was supported by expert reports that were produced in discovery. In those reports, defense experts opined that the cause of Gans' leukemia was likely idiopathic or based on his family history of cancer or years of cigarette smoking. For example, one of the defense experts, David Pyatt, opined that \"Gans' occupational exposure to benzene was not a causative factor in the development of his [leukemia ],\" and that \"the pathological characteristics of ... Gans' [leukemia ] are consistent with a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   or idiopathic etiology and do not provide support for the opinion that his disease was related to any occupational exposures he may have experienced.\" (Celestino Decl., Ex. K, Doc. No. 108-16 at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Dr. Pyatt further opined that \"the most important benzene exposures with regard to [leukemia ] risk are those that occur within 10-15 years prior to diagnosis (etiological window)\" and that \"[e]xposures more distant than 10-15 years have little or no influence on [leukemia ] risk.\" (Celestino Decl., Ex. K, Doc. No. 108-16 at 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Dr. Pyatt's opinion not only lends support to the defense's position in the Gans Suit-that\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of the alleged BTEX exposures caused Gans' leukemia-it illustrates how a factfinder could have concluded that Gans' leukemia was the result of BTEX exposures occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the retroactive date. If Dr. Pyatt's opinion that BTEX exposures occurring more than 10-15 years before a person develops leukemia cannot be the cause of the leukemia is accepted, a factfinder could conclude\n   that Gans' exposures to BTEX occurring before the retroactive date-eight years before Gans' diagnosis in 2010-did not cause Gans' leukemia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In addition to setting out their own opinions as to the cause of Gans' leukemia, the defense experts criticized the estate's experts for relying on the statements of Gans' coworkers, who later testified in depositions about Gans' exposure to BTEX as early as the 1980s. For example, Gans' coworkers testified generally to smelling benzene at certain times that they were with Gans. One of Sunoco's experts, John W. Spencer, opined that statements that a person smelled benzene at certain times cannot reliably establish a concentration of benzene that was inhaled. (Celestino Decl., Ex. J, Doc. No. 108-15 at 11). Gans' coworkers also testified generally that they saw Gans get splashed with liquids that they believed contained BTEX and saw Gans clean his tools and skin with such liquids. Sunoco's expert, Dr. Spencer, opined that there is no accepted methodology for measuring the harm of dermal exposure-as opposed to inhalation-of benzene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Sunoco was prepared, in the event the Gans Suit went to trial, to attack the coworkers' testimony in other ways as well. For example, Sunoco pointed to the fact that Gans did not file any incident reports relating to any spill or other exposure to BTEX. Sunoco also contends that it collected thousands of air samples in the years between 1987 through 2007, but none showed that Gans was present in the areas where such samples were taken. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 84; Catlin's Resp. to J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In sum, had the Gans Suit proceeded to trial, the finder of fact may well have found that Gans was exposed to BTEX in substantial amounts before the retroactive date, and that this exposure caused Gans' leukemia, precluding coverage under the Pollution Policy. Conversely, a factfinder could also have reasonably found that Gans was exposed to BTEX in substantial amounts\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the retroactive date, and that it was this later exposure that caused his leukemia -in which case there would be coverage under the Pollution Policy. But under either scenario, Catlin cannot establish here, as a matter of law, that at the time it withdrew its defense there was no possible factual or legal basis on which it might eventually be obligated to cover a loss in the Gans Suit. Thus, Catlin was not relieved of its duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Catlin finally argues, in a single paragraph of its Brief in Opposition to J.J. White and Sunoco's Motion for Summary Judgment, that it did not have a duty to defend the Gans Suit because neither J.J. White nor Sunoco had paid the $250,000 \"Self-Insurance Retention\" (\"SIR\") required by the Pollution Policy. The Pollution Policy's \"Self-Insurance Retention Amendatory Endorsement\" provides, in relevant part, that \"the [SIR] amount [$250,000] ... is applicable to each claim and applies to the payment of ... Pollution Claims, including Claim Expense,\" and that \"[t]he [SIR] amount shall be paid by the Named Insured and [the Named Insured] shall be uninsured and remain uninsured during the Policy Period\" until the SIR is paid. (Ford Decl., Ex. A., Doc. No. 71-1 at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But even if the SIR Provision in the Pollution Policy requires J.J. White to pay the first $250,000 in defense costs, and excuses Catlin from any duty to defend until such costs are paid, Catlin cannot raise this defense now, as it never refused to defend the Gans Suit on this ground. Rather, Catlin assumed the defense of the Gans Suit-subject only to its reservation of rights regarding coverage in light of the Retroactive Date Provision-notwithstanding\n   any failure by J.J. White or Sunoco to pay the SIR amount. Thus, even if the Pollution Policy excused Catlin from its obligation to defend until J.J. White paid $250,000 in defense costs, Catlin is equitably estopped from raising the SIR Provision here.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Utica, N.Y. v. Genesee Mgmt., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456177\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/934/510/#p523\">\n    934 F.Supp. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 523 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) (applying New York law and holding that an insurer was equitably estopped from asserting a defense under an insurance policy where the insurer had not timely notified its insured of the defense, prejudicing the insured). The prejudice to J.J. White and Sunoco caused by Catlin's failure to raise this defense earlier is obvious: if Catlin had raised the SIR Provision when J.J. White and Sunoco first sought a defense from Catlin, they could have paid the SIR amount; it cannot now, except as a deduction from any amount that they may recover from Catlin, which, as J.J. White concedes, may be required. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.J. White/Sunoco's Reply Br. 8 (\"At most, the unexhausted portion of the SIR should be deducted from any recovery allocated to JJ White.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, Catlin breached its duty to defend when it withdrew its defense of the Gans Suit, before it could establish as a matter of law that Gans' leukemia was caused by pre-retroactive-date exposures to BTEX. Accordingly, I will grant J.J. White and Sunoco's Motion for Summary Judgment as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Does Catlin's Breach of the Duty to Defend Preclude It From Now Disputing Coverage?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Having determined that Catlin breached its duty to defend when it abandoned the defense of the Gans Suit, I must determine whether Catlin may still contend that it does not have a duty to indemnify J.J. White and Sunoco for the settlement that they subsequently agreed to with Gans' estate. J.J. White and Sunoco argue that Catlin cannot do so, because an insurer that breaches the duty to defend loses the ability to dispute coverage for a subsequent settlement, so long as that settlement is reasonable. Catlin responds that a breach of the duty to defend does not automatically give rise to a duty to indemnify the insured for a reasonable settlement, because the insured must still show that there was coverage for the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Under New York law, Catlin is correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Servidone Construction Corp. v.

In the context of occurrence-based insurance policies, courts consistently hold that whether a claimed event occurred within the policy period is part of the initial grant of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    GCG Assocs.

Wash. Aug. 8, 2008) (holding that the insured had the burden of proving \"whether the loss or damage commenced during the policy period,\" because this was \"not the subject of an exclusion\"). Like a policy period in an occurrence-based policy, a retroactive date in a claims-made policy sets the period of time in which an event must occur to be covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Accordingly, I will deny J.J. White and Sunoco's alternative motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the burden of proof. As part of the scope of coverage, rather than a policy exclusion, J.J. White and Sunoco, as insureds, bear the burden of proving that the Retroactive Date Provision is inapplicable-i.e., that\n   Gans' leukemia was caused by exposures to BTEX occurring on or after the retroactive date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Is Sunoco an Additional Insured on the Pollution Policy?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, Sunoco moves for summary judgment on its claim that it is an additional insured under the Pollution Policy, pursuant to a provision of the Pollution Policy that provides coverage to \"any client of [J.J. White] that [J.J. White] has agreed by written contract to name as an additional insured on [the Pollution] Policy.\" Sunoco argues that the Field Services Contracts-in which J.J. White and Sunoco agreed that J.J. White would obtain certain insurance policies and name Sunoco as an additional insured on those policies-satisfy this provision of the Pollution Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The meaning of this provision of the Pollution Policy is unambiguous: if J.J. White enters into a written contract with an entity, and that contract requires J.J. White to name the entity as an additional insured in the Pollution Policy, that entity is an additional insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in order to determine whether Sunoco is an additional insured under the Pollution Policy, I must interpret the Field Services Contracts to determine whether J.J. White has agreed in those contracts to name Sunoco as an additional insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The insurance provisions of the two Field Services Contracts in the record (executed in 2003 and 2009) vary slightly, but both provide that J.J. White must maintain insurance \"for the respective items:\" (1) \"Statutory Worker's Compensation and Occupational Disease Insurance\"; (2) \"Commercial Liability Insurance\" and (3) \"Automobile Liability Insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Celestino Decl., Ex. F., Doc.

White and Sunoco's mutual understanding that such coverage was included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \"Where the parties [to a contract] have attached the same meaning to a promise or agreement or a term thereof, it is interpreted in accordance with that meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Finkle Distributors, Inc. v.

White and Sunoco have provided evidence-which remains undisputed by Catlin-that they understood, years before Gans' estate asserted a claim, that the Field Services Contracts required J.J. White to obtain pollution coverage and to name Sunoco as an additional insured on that coverage. Specifically, two undisputed facts support the existence of such an understanding: (1) the fact that J.J. White originally obtained its pollution coverage through its general commercial liability policy, and that general commercial liability insurance is one of the types of insurance specified in the Field Services Contracts; and (2) the fact that J.J. White communicated to Sunoco that it was passing along the costs of obtaining pollution coverage in the labor rates it charged Sunoco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As to Sunoco's first point, one of the types of insurance that the Field Services Contracts required J.J. White to obtain is \"Commercial Liability Insurance.\" As J.J. White and Sunoco note, in the early 2000s, insurers were beginning to exclude pollution coverage from general commercial liability policies, prompting J.J. White to secure a standalone pollution policy effective April 30, 2002. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 28-30; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This supports J.J. White and Sunoco's contention that they understood that the Field Services Contracts would continue to require pollution coverage as part of the \"Commercial Liability Insurance\" that was explicitly required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, J.J. White and Sunoco's understanding is supported by communications from J.J. White to Sunoco explaining how the labor rates J.J. White was charging Sunoco included the costs of obtaining pollution coverage. For example, in a July 5, 2002, fax from J.J. White's risk manager, Robert Celestino, to one of Sunoco's insurance coordinators, Regina Stover-Burns, Celestino provided a breakdown of the insurance coverages the costs of which J.J. White was passing on to Sunoco in its labor rates. Included in this breakdown was a category of coverage entitled \"Other,\" which Celestino noted in this fax was composed of several forms of coverage including \"Pollution (Occurrence &amp; Sudden or Accidental).\" This communication supports J.J. White and Sunoco's position that they understood pollution coverage to be one of the coverages that J.J. White was required to obtain, and name Sunoco as an additional insured on, under the Field Services Contracts. (J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 50-56; Catlin's Resp. to J.J. White/Sunoco's SOF \u00b6\u00b6 50-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Because the undisputed record establishes that J.J. White and Sunoco mutually understood the Field Services Contracts to require J.J. White to obtain pollution coverage and to include Sunoco as an additional insured in that coverage, Sunoco is an additional insured on the Pollution Policy. Accordingly, I will grant J.J. White and Sunoco's Motion for Summary Judgment as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For the reasons set out above, Catlin's Motion for Summary Judgment on its declaratory judgment claim will be denied. J.J. White and Sunoco's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted as to: (1) J.J. White and Sunoco's claim that Catlin\n   breached its duty to defend them; and (2) Sunoco's claim that it is an additional insured on the Pollution Policy. In all other respects, J.J.

White is not an individual insured with little bargaining power or knowledge of insurance policies and the laws that govern them, but rather a business with at least one executive dedicated to risk management.
