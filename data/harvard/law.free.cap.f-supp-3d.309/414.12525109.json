Plaintiff, a domestic manufacturer of competing products sold under the registered mark VAGISIL, filed an opposition to defendant's application. The TTAB ultimately ruled in favor of defendant, finding there was no likelihood of confusion between plaintiff's VAGISIL mark and defendant's proposed VAGISAN mark. Plaintiff now appeals this TTAB decision pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and, as that statute permits, asserts additional federal and state claims against defendant for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant now seeks dismissal of these additional claims, arguing that the complaint has not alleged facts to establish the statutorily-required \"use in commerce\" of the allegedly infringing mark.

Plaintiff opposes the motion, contending that the steps defendant has taken to enter the United States market, including seeking FDA registration, meeting with United States consultants, and developing a plan to enter the market, are sufficient to state claims for trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-92.2, -92.12. And the Fourth Circuit has made clear that \"Virginia common law trademark infringement and unfair competition claims require the same proof,...as the Lanham Act offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Swatch AG v.

Thus, if a plaintiff has not satisfied the use in commerce requirement for the Lanham Act, it follows\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiff has not satisfied the requirements for infringement or unfair competition under either Virginia common law or the VTSMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A threshold question is the meaning of \"use in commerce\" under the Lanham Act for the purposes of plaintiff's trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition\n   claims. Analysis of this question properly begins with the text of the Lanham Act. Notably, the Lanham Act defines \"use in commerce\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) on goods when-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (A) it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (B) the goods are sold or transported in commerce ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Act defines commerce as \"all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the plain text of the statute makes clear that to use a mark in commerce on goods, (i) the defendant must affix the mark to the good or its container and (ii) the defendant must sell or transport a good in commerce such that it can be regulated by Congress. Given this definition, it follows that neither the Lanham Act's use in commerce requirement, nor Virginia law's similar requirement, is satisfied where, as here, the complaint does not allege, nor does the record reflect, any facts suggesting that defendant has sold or transported VAGISAN marked products in United States commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To avoid this conclusion, plaintiff argues that this statutory definition does not apply in the infringement, unfair competition, and dilution contexts, and instead simply sets the standards and circumstances under which the owner of a mark can qualify to register the mark. In this respect, plaintiff correctly notes that the statute provides that its definitions are not applicable where \"the contrary is plainly apparent from the context.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff contends that in the context of infringement, dilution and unfair competition, the statutory definition cannot apply because it would then lead to absurd results. Specifically, the statutory definition recited above requires \"bona fide use of a mark\" to constitute \"use in commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This definition, if applied strictly in the infringement, dilution, and unfair competition contexts, would allow infringers to escape liability\n   <em>\n    precisely because\n   </em>\n   they used a mark in bad faith. Plainly, Congress did not intend to provide a cause of action against only those infringers who acted with good intentions while allowing nefarious\n   actors to evade liability. Accordingly, plaintiff argues that the entire statutory definition of \"use in commerce\" cannot apply in the infringement, dilution and unfair competition contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff's argument, although superficially plausible, ultimately fails; the argument goes off the tracks because it incorrectly assumes that if the first sentence of the definition does not apply in this context, the entire definition is inapplicable. But this conclusion is unpersuasive; it does not follow that if the first sentence of the provision does not apply in this context, then the entire definition is inapplicable. And indeed, courts adjudicating trademark infringement actions have persuasively reached this conclusion, namely that the second sentence of the \"use in commerce\" definition is nonetheless applicable in infringement cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897294\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/123/\">\n    562 F.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2009), a case relied on by plaintiff, does precisely this; there the Second Circuit assumed without deciding that \"the requirements of the second sentence of the definition of 'use in commerce' in \u00a7 1127 apply to infringing conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897294\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/123/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897294\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/123/\">\n    at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Appendix). More specifically, the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Rescuecom\n   </em>\n   concluded that the preferable solution given that circuit's precedent was to accord a different scope of application to the two sentences of \u00a7 1127's \"use in commerce\" definition, applying the first sentence exclusively to the registration context and applying the second sentence to the infringing context, as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897294\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/123/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897294\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/123/\">\n    at 140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Attempting to avoid this conclusion, plaintiff points to a sentence from a Senate report, stating that \"use of any type will continue to be considered in an infringement action.\" S.

But reliance on this sentence in the Senate report is hardly persuasive because as Justice Scalia sensibly teaches us, \"[t]he Constitution gives legal effect to the 'Laws' Congress enacts [ ] not the objectives its Members aimed to achieve in voting for them[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Graham Cty.

Instead, the plain language of \u00a7 1127 compels the conclusion that, for the purposes of a trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition action, \"use in commerce\" of a mark on a good requires that the good be \"sold or transported in commerce\" that can be regulated by Congress.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Given that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   defines \"use in commerce\" for trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition purposes, it is clear that defendant's activities here cannot satisfy this \"use in commerce\" requirement. Importantly, \u00a7 1127 requires that goods upon which a mark is used be \"sold or transported\" in commerce subject to regulation by Congress. Neither the complaint nor the record in this case contains any evidence that defendant actually sold or transported any goods in the United States or to a United States citizen. Put simply, there are no allegations in the complaint that any United States citizen has purchased a product with the mark VAGISAN or that a product bearing the VAGISAN mark has been transported to any state in the United States. Although defendant has sold its VAGISAN products in other countries, these sales are not sufficient to establish use in commerce because the Act defines commerce as \"all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Courts have noted that where, as here, a defendant simply expresses an intent to use a particular mark by filing an application with the PTO or by presenting an idea at a conference, these activities, without more, are not sufficient to constitute use in commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, to satisfy the use in commerce requirement, the defendant's acts must demonstrate that introduction of the product into the United States market is \"imminent and impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Maritz, Inc. v.

Instead, what the record discloses is that defendant, at one time, took preparatory steps to enter the United States market, but has now put its preparations on hold pending the resolution of the TTAB appeal. Specifically,\n   plaintiff held one unsuccessful meeting in Germany with a United States distributor six years ago. Plaintiff's communications with a United States based consultant also occurred more than five years ago and involved a presentation on regulatory information related to defendant's FDA application. And most importantly, Angela Thevessen, Expert Manager of defendant, testified under oath that defendant has put its plans to market VAGISAN products in the United States on hold because it will not know if it can legally use the VAGISAN mark in the United States until the conclusion of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thevessen TTAB Dep. 34:11-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   These facts stand in stark contrast to the facts of the cases on which plaintiff relies; the defendants in those cases were (i) widely disseminating information regarding their upcoming services,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) developing mailing lists of potential customers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iii) actively seeking licensees for their product,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iv) displaying allegedly infringing packaging at national trade shows,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (v) planning to bring their product to the market in a little over one month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant in this case has done none of these. In sum, because defendant's introduction of the product is not imminent and impending, the complaint has failed to allege facts sufficient to show that defendant has used the mark in United States commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff next contends that defendant's website is sufficient to constitute use in commerce for purposes of plaintiff's trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition claims. Although the use of a website may be sufficient to establish use in commerce in some instances, the cases plaintiff cites do not squarely address this issue. In\n   <em>\n    People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney\n   </em>\n   , cited by plaintiff, the Fourth Circuit did not address the Lanham Act's \"use in commerce\" requirement because the parties did not dispute that element of plaintiff's claim. 263 F.3d at 365. Instead, the Fourth Circuit in that case focused on whether the defendant there used the website \"in connection with goods or services\" and in a manner engendering a likelihood of confusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Lamparello v. Falwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936363\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/420/309/\">\n    420 F.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2005), the Fourth Circuit did not resolve any issues related to the \"use in commerce\" requirement, but instead reversed the district court's injunction because the record there presented no likelihood of confusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936363\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/420/309/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936363\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/420/309/\">\n    at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the end, it is unnecessary to resolve the question whether defendant's website alone is sufficient to constitute \"use in commerce\" because even if it were sufficient, an injunction with respect to the website would be inappropriate. The record reflects that defendant has no offices in the United States and no United States employees. Accordingly, an injunction regarding defendant's advertising efforts on its website would necessarily have to have an extraterritorial effect because it would restrain defendant's activities in Germany. This is important as Fourth Circuit precedent makes clear that courts may only issue such injunctions to prevent violations under the Lanham Act \"where the extraterritorial conduct would, if not enjoined, have a significant effect on United States commerce....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Nintendo of Am., Inc. v. Aeropower Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522726\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/246/#p250\">\n    34 F.3d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (4th Cir. 1994). Here, as previously noted, there are no allegations in the complaint or facts in the record showing that defendant's website, or indeed any of its conduct, would have a significant effect on United States commerce if not enjoined. Defendant has not authorized the sale of its products to citizens in the United States nor has it directly sold any products in the United States. And despite the fact that defendant's website, which contains links to third party pharmacies, has been available in the United States since 2011, there are no allegations and no record evidence establishing that these third-party pharmacies have sold a single product bearing the VAGISAN mark in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, for a plaintiff to state a claim of trademark infringement, dilution, or unfair competition, federal law-the Lanham Act-and Virginia law-the VTMSA-require that the defendant's goods be sold or transported in United States and Virginia commerce respectively. Because there are no allegations in the complaint and no record evidence suggesting that defendant has sold or transported a product bearing the VAGISAN mark in the United States or to a United States citizen, let alone in Virginia or to a Virginia citizen, plaintiff cannot satisfy the use in commerce requirement of the Lanham Act or Virginia law. This is so even through defendant has taken preparatory steps to enter the United States market because those preparations are not imminent and have been placed on hold pending resolution of the TTAB appeal. And this is so even through defendant operates a website because an injunction concerning defendant's extraterritorially-operated website would be inappropriate where the website has had no effect on United States commerce. Accordingly, Counts II-VI of plaintiff's complaint must be dismissed without prejudice. It is important to note, however, that this decision will not preclude plaintiff from filing a subsequent action should changed circumstances warrant. At this time, however, it is simply premature to adjudicate the infringement, dilution, and unfair competition claims on the basis of these allegations and the current record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   An appropriate Order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The facts pertinent to defendant's motion to dismiss are appropriately derived from the complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of public record of which a court may take judicial notice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tellabs, Inc. v.
