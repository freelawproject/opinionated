The Eighth Circuit has instructed the court to exercise its discretion to determine the extent of the mandatory conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although the magistrate stated that he would not have imposed those conditions absent the \u00a7 3142(c) mandate, those conditions are appropriate. At a minimum, defendants charged with aggravated sexual abuse of a child should be prohibited from having contact with the alleged victim and witnesses and with others under the age of 18 without permission from a pre-trial services officer. Such a conditions are not an unreasonable limitation on the defendant's liberty. Indeed, such conditions are usually applied in any case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Further, in light of my experience as a federal judge, prohibition from possession of firearms is not an unreasonable restriction on liberty and serves the interest in assuring the defendant's presence for trial. Defendant is facing a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years custody, up to life imprisonment. In more than one case assigned to me, a person charged with such an offense has taken his own life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It appears in this case that the magistrate applied the most restrictive curfew available, requiring home detention at any time defendant is not at work. If the magistrate did not think a curfew was necessary at all, he failed to fashion a curfew which was appropriate to the defendant's particular case. Although a district court reviews an appeal from the conditions of release\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , no transcript was prepared in this case and I therefore have no factual basis to alter the extent of the curfew condition imposed. Electronic monitoring to \"police\" the defendant's compliance with a curfew is not a substantive restriction on the defendant's movement but is merely a technological method of ensuring compliance. It is less intrusive than requiring the defendant to call in from a home telephone number several times a day to monitor compliance or to admit a pre-trial services officer into the home at unannounced times to monitor compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Adam Walsh amendments to the Bail Reform Act do not violate the separation of powers doctrine. If, as the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   . Congress can legislate a class of cases for which bail is not available, then surely Congress can legislate a class of cases for which certain conditions of release are mandated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    OTHER THOUGHTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The so-called Adam Walsh Act includes a plethora of mandatory minimum sentences. Harsh penalties are required and, as we know, there is no parole in the federal system. It was a major expansion of federal jurisdiction in Indian Country. It amended the Major Crimes Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), to include \"felony child abuse or neglect.\" Yet the Major Crimes Act itself makes certain crimes felonies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   deals with aggravated sexual abuse with a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years. This only applies in Indian Country or to an offense in which state lines were crossed or the offense occurred in a federal prison. I do not see the possibility of a minor being in a federal prison. There is no federal prison for minors, only contract facilities. In effect, only Native Americans are subjected to these very harsh penalties, regardless of other mitigating circumstances. South Dakotans in general are not subject to the Adam Walsh Act if they do not cross state lines. The entire matter is Congressional overreach. However, I do not make the laws. I attempt to follow them, as misguided as they may be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   It is apparent from the lack of authority from the Courts of Appeal that the issues presented here fall under the category of \"capable of repetition but evading review.\" Indeed, due to the time limits of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. 3161\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , most federal criminal cases will be concluded well before the case can be fully considered by the district court and the court of appeals. The courts that have concluded the Adam Walsh mandatory conditions of release are unconstitutional either facially or as-applied have struck those conditions from the defendant's release order. Those defendants thus ultimately do not suffer from any claimed\n   constitutional intrusion. The courts that have upheld the constitutionality of the conditions have done so after a detention hearing is held and after a review of the law. In this case, the defendant has been afforded a hearing and an appeal. Every effort has been made to protect his constitutional rights to be free from excessive bail and to receive due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The decision of U.S. Magistrate William D.
