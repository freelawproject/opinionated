INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Synoptek, LLC, filed this action on October 4, 2016, against Defendant Synaptek Corporation for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition, and trademark cancellation based on Synaptek's use of the '160 mark \"SYNAPTEK.\" (Dkt. 1 [hereinafter \"Compl.\"].) Synaptek filed a counterclaim against Synoptek on March 20, 2017, for non-infringement of trademark. (Dkt. 43.) Before the Court is Synoptek's motion for partial summary judgment for cancellation of Synaptek's '160 trademark. (Dkt. 52 [hereinafter, \"Mot.\"].) For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Synoptek is an IT services company that provides a host of computing services, such as IT operations, IT program management, application management, and cloud and hosting services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 59-3 [Complete Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts, hereinafter \"SUF\"] \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 10-14.) Synoptek serves clients in commercial sectors such as finance, healthcare, and retail, as well as in state, local, and federal government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Synoptek markets its services through internet presence, advertising, press releases, word-of-mouth, and print advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Synoptek owns U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C424%2C720\">\n    Registration No. 3,424,720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Synoptek\" or \"the '720 mark\"), which was registered as of May 6, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 7.) The term \"Synoptek\" is not a recognized word in the English language. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) The '720 mark is registered in International Class 42 for various computer services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Synaptek was incorporated in August 2008, (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 58), and is also an IT services company that provides computing services that include systems integration, operations support, program management, application development, and cloud integration, amongst other services,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20-21, 25-27). The co-founders of Synaptek were not aware of \"Synoptek\" at the time they chose their company name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Synaptek is a certified small disadvantaged business (\"SBD\") and provides IT services to the federal government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Synaptek maintains a website, but disputes that it sells its services through the site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Synaptek does not dispute that it markets its services through advertising, press releases, word-of-mouth, and print advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Synaptek bids on federal government small-business set-aside contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 10, 2013, Synaptek filed U.S. Trademark Application No. 80/088,536 (\"the '536 application\") with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") seeking a federal registration for the designation \"Synaptek.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; Dkt. 52-3 [Declaration of Salil Bali, hereinafter \"Bali Decl.\"] Ex. 7.) The '536 application claimed a date of first use of August 4, 2008, and sought registration in International Class 42 for various IT and computing services. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30.) On February 23, 2014, the PTO denied the '536 application pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) based on a likelihood of confusion with the marks \"Synoptek,\" \"Synetek Solutions\" (two marks), and \"Synaptyk\" (two marks). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31; Bali Decl. Ex. 8.) The PTO found that \"Synaptek\" is the \"phonetic equivalent\" to all five marks, that the mark owners' services are \"identical in part, and otherwise closely related,\" and noted the \"only difference\" between \"Synaptek\" and \"Synoptek\" was the use of \"A\" versus \"O.\" (SUF \u00b6 32; Bali Decl. Ex. 8.) Synaptek filed a response to the PTO's February 23 denial arguing against the PTO's finding of a likelihood of confusion. (SUF \u00b6 33; Bali Decl. Ex. 9.) On September 4, 2014, the PTO issued a final office action denying the '536 application based on a likelihood of confusion between \"Synaptek\" and the marks \"Synoptek\" and \"Synaptyk\" (two marks). (SUF \u00b6 34; Bali Decl. Ex. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Synaptyk marks, U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 4,015,160 (\"the '160 mark\") and 4,015,163, were registered to a company from Plano, Texas. (SUF \u00b6 37.) The '160 mark has been registered since 2011 in International Class 42 for various computer services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) On March 3, 2015, Synaptek filed a Request for Suspension of the prosecution of the '536 application as well as a Petition for Cancellation of the Synaptyk marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38; Bali Decl. Ex. 13; Dkt. 54 [Declaration of Edward Schewe, hereinafter \"Schewe Decl.\"] Ex. 36.) In July 2015, Synaptek acquired ownership of the Synaptyk marks. (SUF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 39.) Synaptek thereafter informed the PTO examiner in connection with the '536 application that it now owned the Synaptyk marks, and the '536 application was reinstated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) On July 15, 2015, Synaptek filed a Section 7 request to amend the '160 mark to \"reflect an updated spelling of its trademark from SYNAPTYK to SYNAPTEK.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41; Bali Decl. Ex. 15.) The PTO denied Synaptek's request that same day in light of the ongoing cancellation proceeding for the '160 mark that Synaptek previously had filed. (SUF \u00b6 42; Bali Decl. Ex. 16.) Synaptek thereafter filed a Petitioner's Motion to Dismiss as Moot the cancellation proceeding for the '160 mark as it had acquired the Synaptyk marks, (SUF \u00b6 98; Schewe Decl. Ex. 40), and filed a response to the PTO's denial of Synaptek's request to amend the '160 mark, (SUF \u00b6 99; Schewe Decl. Ex. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 27, 2015, the PTO issued another final office action on the '536 application, rejecting registration of the designation \"Synaptek\" due to a likelihood of confusion with \"Synoptek.\" (SUF \u00b6 43; Bali Decl. Ex. 17.) The PTO specifically held that the \"marks are essentially phonetic equivalents and thus sound similar,\" and while the marks have a different vowel, \"the vowels 'A' and 'O' often sound alike and can create words that are phonetically equivalent.\" (Bali Decl. Ex. 17.) The PTO also held that the two companies' services were \"identical in part, and otherwise closely related.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 12, 2015, the PTO denied Synaptek's July 15, 2015, request for a Section 7 Amendment of the '160 mark because the proposed amendment \"would materially alter the character of the mark.\" (SUF \u00b6 44; Bali Decl. Ex. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 20, 2016, Synaptek filed a petition with the PTO Director to accept the Section 7 Amendment of the '160 mark to change \"Synaptyk\" to \"Synaptek.\" (SUF \u00b6 47; Bali Decl. Ex. 20.) Synaptek indicated it had two pending applications for marks, including the '536 application, and attached the PTO's decisions from February 3 and September 4, 2014, on the '536 application. (Bali Decl. Ex. 20.) Synaptek did not attach or mention the PTO's October 27, 2015, final office action rejecting the designation \"Synaptek\" based on the likelihood of confusion with \"Synoptek.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 27, 2016, Synaptek filed a request for reconsideration of the PTO's October 27 final office action. (SUF \u00b6 45; Schewe Decl. Ex. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 10, 2016, the PTO again denied the '536 application based on the likelihood of confusion between \"Synaptek\" and \"Synoptek,\" and because the parties' services were \"identical in part, but otherwise closely related.\" (SUF \u00b6 45; Bali Decl. Ex. 19.) Synaptek did not inform the PTO, in relation to its Section 7 Amendment Petition, of this PTO Office Action. (SUF \u00b6 50.) On September 27, 2016, the PTO, through a paralegal trademark specialist rather than the Director, reversed its earlier denial and granted Synaptek's Section 7 Amendment of the '160 mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; Bali Decl. Exs. 21, 36, 49.) An updated certificate for the '160 mark, \"Synaptek,\" was issued on November 1, 2016. (SUF \u00b6 110; Schewe Decl. Ex. 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to the PTO's grant of Synaptek's Section 7 Amendment, Synoptek had filed U.S. Trademark Application No. 86/923,471 (\"the '471 application\") to register the designation \"Synoptek Edge\" with the PTO on February 29, 2016. (SUF \u00b6 54.) On June 21, 2016, the PTO sent Synoptek an Office Action regarding the '471 application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57; Bali Decl. Ex. 44.) The Office Action indicated that the '471 application may be refused because of the likelihood of confusion with the mark \"Synaptek\" and because Synoptek had not provided acceptable specimens of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Bali Decl. Ex. 44.) On January 25, 2017, the PTO issued a suspension notice stating that in light of the '536 application, the '471 application was suspended until the PTO either registered or abandoned the \"Synaptek\" mark and because Synoptek had not submitted an acceptable specimen of record. (SUF \u00b6 55; Bali Decl. 23.) The '471 mark still has not been registered. (SUF \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 4, 2016, Synoptek filed a Petition for Cancellation of the '160 mark with the PTO, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109; Schewe Decl. Ex. 53), as well as this action against Synaptek for cancellation of the '160 mark, amongst other causes of action, (Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(Dkt 53 [Synaptek's Opposition, hereinafter \"Opp.\"] at 1-2.) However, Synaptek's \"Synaptek\" mark has been on the Principal Register for less than five years. While the '160 mark was registered in 2011, from 2011 until 2016 the registration was for the mark \"Synaptyk.\" During this time, the PTO denied registration of the designation \"Synaptek\" multiple times. Although Synaptek was able to amend the '160 mark to protect the designation \"Synaptek\" in the face of the PTO's denial of registration of that same designation, it is simply not accurate to say that \"Synaptek\" was registered since 2011. Rather, \"Synaptek\" has been registered only since 2016 when Synaptek successfully amended the '160 mark. Because the \"Synaptek\" mark has not been registered for more than five years, the likelihood of confusion is a valid basis for cancelling the '160 mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, to permit Synaptek to grandfather \"Synaptek\" into an older registration through amendment, and thus escape an action for cancellation on the ground of likelihood of confusion, would not serve the purpose of the five-year limitation. As one PTO court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   This balancing of property rights and public interest seems to us to have resulted in a statutory scheme whereby, once a trademark owner has had a registration for five years, his property interests come to the fore, and his registration will thenceforth be safe from attack unless he makes the registration vulnerable through his own actions, or unless he was never entitled to the registration to begin with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Consorzio Del Prosciutto Di Parma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.P.Q.%202d%20%28BNA%29%201894\">\n    23 U.S.P.Q.2d 1894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (T.T.A.B.

The remaining factors do not \"displace the powerful case of likelihood of confusion,\" and on the whole strengthen the likelihood of confusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264843\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/426/#p431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264843\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/426/#p431\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court finds that there is a likelihood of confusion between the parties' marks as a matter of law.

Synoptek argues that such expert testimony is irrelevant to the Court's analysis of how a \"reasonably prudent consumer\" would view or hear the parties' marks. (Reply at 8-10.) In\n    <em>\n     Chesebrough-Pond's, Inc. v. Faberge, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468577\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/393/\">\n     666 F.2d 393\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (9th Cir. 1982), the Ninth Circuit held that there was no genuine issue of fact concerning \"matters of common knowledge and experience\" required to compare \"Match\" with \"Macho.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468577\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/393/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468577\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/393/\">\n     at 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court also held that it was \"clearly within the discretion of the trial court\" to exclude an expert opinion on the linguistic differences between the two words, and it would not be error \"to grant a summary judgment even though the expert's conclusion differed from that of the court.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Here, the similarity of appearance and sound between the parties' marks is obvious, and a reasonably prudent consumer would not apply linguistic expertise to arrive at that conclusion. Thus, Dr. Butter's testimony is not of any real assistance or relevance to the Court's inquiry, as \"[t]he similarity or dissimilarity of these two words is a matter easily evaluated by laymen within the realm of their common knowledge and experience.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468577\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/393/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Synoptek's argument that Synaptek \"presents no direct evidence of an absence of actual confusion\" is misplaced.

(Reply at 15-18.) Initial interest confusion involves \"the use of another's trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion, may be still an infringement.\"\n    <em>\n     Brookfield\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1047\">\n     174 F.3d at 1062\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation and citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit has applied the initial interest confusion theory to cases involving Internet metatags,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1047\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , search terms,\n    <em>\n     Network Automation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200180\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1137/#p1145\">\n     638 F.3d at 1149\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and the display of search results,\n    <em>\n     Multi Time Mach., Inc. v.

More recent cases, such as\n    <em>\n     Network Automation\n    </em>\n    , have treated \"initial interest confusion\" as a consideration under the\n    <em>\n     Sleekcraft\n    </em>\n    factor of degree of consumer care. In\n    <em>\n     Network Automation\n    </em>\n    , the Ninth Circuit considered how online consumers have become more sophisticated, \"are accustomed to [ ] exploration by trial and error,\" and \"fully expect to find some sites that aren't what they imagine based on a glance at the domain name or search engine summary.\"\n    <em>\n     Network Automation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200180\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1137/#p1145\">\n     638 F.3d at 1152-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted). In light of this reality, the Ninth Circuit concluded that it was improper for the district court to conclude that initial interest confusion weighed in favor of granting summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1053. Here, Synoptek only speculates that such diversion will occur, without any evidence regarding consumers actually being diverted. In light of the Ninth Circuit's treatment of initial interest confusion and the lack of evidence presented here, the Court gives little weight to Synoptek's hypothesis that its consumers will be diverted to Synaptek's website.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
