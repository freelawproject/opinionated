With regard to the motion for leave, the City filed a memorandum in opposition (doc. 23) and Plaintiffs filed a reply (doc. 31). With regard to the City's motion to terminate depositions and to permit the \"clawback\" of privileged communications, the parties have filed a number of memoranda related thereto, including Plaintiffs' response to the Court's Order to Show Cause (as to why sanctions should not issue as a result of Plaintiffs' apparent violation of Fed.

The City's attorneys were unaware of the disclosure of any privileged documents until October 28, 2016, when Plaintiffs' counsel presented an email (doc. 26-9) as an exhibit during the deposition of Tipp City's City Manager, Timothy Josh Eggleston. Upon questioning by Plaintiffs' counsel, the City's outside counsel objected and asserted a claim of attorney-client privilege as it relates to that email.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  doc. 23-2.

As set forth in the Rule, regardless whether or not the information is ultimately found to be privileged, parties in receipt of purportedly privileged material are required to, at the very least, \"sequester\" such \"specified information ... until the claim is resolved[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%205345311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, if such purportedly privileged information is presented to the Court before determination of such claim of privilege, Rule 26 contemplates the filing of purportedly privileged information \"under seal[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%205345311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs argue that the City: (1) failed to make a sufficient claim of privilege in advance of any disclosure; and (2) that Rule 26 does not apply here because the purportedly privileged material was produced in response to public records requests, not \"in discovery\" as required by the text of the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With regard to the sufficiency of the City's claim of privilege, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that, before October 31, 2016, the City made no claim as it relates to docs. 26-6, 26-7, and 26-8. Thus, prior to Ms. Tomb's October 31st email, the City made a specific claim of privilege only with regard to a single email at issue; namely, Eggleston's email to counsel. Doc. 26-9. The City's claim of privilege concerning that email was sufficiently clear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 23-2. Thus, at this time, the Court narrows the issues before it to include whether: (1) Ms. Tomb violated Rule 26(b)(5)(B) when she attached Eggleston's email to her October 31st email; and (2) counsel violated Rule 26(b)(5)(B) by attaching Eggleston's email to memoranda filed on the Court's public record on November 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 27-6 at PageID 651.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With regard to the applicability of Rule 26(b)(5)(B) to the circumstances here, the Court acknowledges that the Eggleston email was, at least initially, produced in response to public records requests, not as part of the discovery mechanisms set forth in the Civil Rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 26-10. Courts have concluded that Rule 26(b)(5)(B) does not apply to \"emails ... produced before [the] action was filed, in response to a request under the state Open Records Act.\"\n   <em>\n    McCraw v. City of Oklahoma City\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV-16-352-HE,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20486950\">\n    2017 WL 486950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.4 (W.D. Okla. Feb. 6, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the Court acknowledges that Eggleston's email was initially produced in response to public records requests, it was also subsequently produced in discovery, as acknowledged by Plaintiffs' admission that, \"[a]fter these documents were provided to Ms. Tomb, Plaintiffs provided the very same documents to Defendant in response to their written discovery requests (nearly two months before any depositions started in this matter).\" Doc. 26 at PageID 568. Thus, strictly reading the text of Rule 26(b)(5)(B), the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' own production of Eggleston's email in discovery makes Rule 26(b)(5)(B) applicable in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nevertheless, given the reasonable position set forth by Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Rule 26(b)(5)(B) does not apply to information produced in response to public records requests, the Court finds sanctions for such violations unwarranted. As a result, the Order to Show Cause (doc. 37) is\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The City also moves to terminate or limit Eggleston's deposition and all other\n   depositions Plaintiffs seek to take in this case because of Mr. Tomb's suggestion that Eggleston and the City's outside counsel \"might want to plead the Fifth.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 23-2 at PageID 516-17. During a conference call with the Court, Mr. Tomb represented that his comment about the Fifth Amendment was made \"jokingly.\" Doc. 23-2 at PageID 524.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 30, \"[a]t any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(d)(3)(A). At this juncture, the Court finds that Mr. Tomb's conduct-though certainly not condoned by the Court-is not sufficient to terminate Eggleston's deposition in its entirety. As a result, the City's motion to terminate or limit depositions (doc. 27) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and depositions should promptly recommence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Tomb's admission on the record, however, that his comment concerning the Fifth Amendment was made \"jokingly\" does lend credence to the suggestion that Mr. Tomb was acting to unreasonably \"annoy\" and \"embarrass\" both Eggleston and defense counsel. The suggestion that someone has engaged in criminal conduct while engaged in a court proceeding is no joking matter. The Court\n   <strong>\n    ADVISES\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Tomb that such further conduct may lead to the imposition of sanctions in this case and, therefore, he should conduct himself with the utmost civility and professionalism going forward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Introductory Statement on Civility contained in the S.D. Ohio Local Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff moves for leave to conduct more than the ten depositions permitted by Fed. R. Civ. P. 30. Under that Rule \"[a] party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2)\" where a party seeks to take \"more than 10 depositions\" and the parties have not so agreed and stipulated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Namely, Plaintiffs suggest that the four depositions taken by them to date have not been particularly fruitful in obtaining the information they seek.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 31 at PageID 679 (stating that \"the Tipp City officials who have been deposed to date have limited information about the overall Tipp City operation, and each only has a small portion of the information sought by the Plaintiffs in this case\"). However, Plaintiffs fail to state with any particularity who specifically must be deposed, other than suggesting the need to depose Tipp City's electrical superintendent and, perhaps, someone else in the electric department (assuming the Tipp City electrical superintendent himself or herself is insufficient). Having taken four depositions to date, and having only identified the need for, perhaps, two more depositions, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy their burden to demonstrate a particularized need for more than ten depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a result, Plaintiffs' motion for leave (doc. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO REFILING\n   </strong>\n   with a more particularized showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court: (1)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the City's motion to \"clawback\" privileged communications (doc. 27); (2)\n   <strong>\n    VACATES\n   </strong>\n   the Court's previous Order to Show Cause (doc. 37); (3)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the City's motion to terminate or limit depositions (doc. 27); and (4)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for leave to take more than ten depositions\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Court makes no finding at this time concerning the appropriateness of a party directly communicating with a represented adversary about the subject matter of the litigation between them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Thus, there are a total of four documents currently at issue.

The third document at issue contains two emails: (1) from the City's Law Director and outside counsel regarding clarification of case strategy; and (2) an email from outside counsel Edward Dowd to the City's Law Director complementing the Law Director on his civil discourse with Plaintiff's counsel and noting, in derogatory terms, that Mr. Dowd's response would not have been as civil and restrained in so responding.
