In it, the issuers of the Guidance detail their primary concerns with concentration of QS: market power inequities (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , monopoly with a single seller or monopsony with a single buyer) and changes to the fishing communities more broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-61. The Guidance explains that taking into account both market power (\"MP\") and the council's fishery management objectives (\"MO\") may \"assure that potential share accumulation is consistent with management objectives and [ ] protect consumers against manipulation of market prices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63. The Groundfish Management Team (\"GMT\") relied on this Guidance when analyzing aggregate limits in March 2009, proposing levels that would limit the accumulation of market power and distribute the benefits of QS ownership across more entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR Disk 1 H.497 at 2-3. This 2009 GMT report further noted that the \"one vessel, one owner\" approach to QS harmonized with the \"history of independent 'small entity' vessel owners in the [F]ishery,\" and would provide a useful reference point when setting control limits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6. The Council, in turn, relied on GMT's analysis while developing the IFQ Program.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   H.497 at 2-3, 7;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   H.500-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Similarly, the June 2010 Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"FEIS\") explains that the Council considered the \"ordinary meanings\" of the terms \"excessive\" and \"inequitable\" to determine levels of QS ownership and usage that were not \"unreasonable, unnecessary, or unfair considering the Council's overall management objectives for the [F]ishery.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR Disk 1 B.22 at 1064. The FEIS further explains that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   What constitutes 'excessive shares' may be socially determined or economically determined. On an economic basis, an excessive share would be one that would be expected to result in a sector with market power ... From a social policy perspective, concentration of ownership affects the social and community structure and the sense of equity that may, in part, be grounded in the history of fishery management, which has largely been based on common property concepts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 860;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 461 (placing limits to \"affect the distribution of economic performance\" in fishing communities);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 547 (noting that the proposed 2.7% aggregate limit \"could provide new avenues for community involvement in the fishing industry that could benefit communities both socially and economically ... Theoretically, if there were no control limits ... one community or company could buy up all the QS to the detriment of all other communities and businesses.\"). In short, the administrative record indicates that NMFS interpreted \"excessive share\" and \"inequitable concentration\" to mean \"unreasonable, unnecessary, or unfair,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1064, and grounded its determination of the aggregate limit in concerns regarding entities' market power, while considering the need to foster development of diverse fishing communities in the Fishery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs contend that NMFS' aggregate limit was nevertheless arbitrary and capricious because NMFS failed to follow its own Guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Plaintiffs artificially limit NMFS' determination\n   of the aggregate limit to a mathematical formula based on MP and MO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. However, the Guidance itself explains that \"the basic philosophy underlying the [Guidance] is that the Councils should have as much latitude as possible as they design fishery management plans.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR Disk 1 H.527 at 10. Although market power may be easily derived and informed by existing antitrust principles, the Guidance further explains that there are no established rules for setting the MO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-69. Rather, aggregate limits will be determined based on balancing different management objectives alongside market power limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   NMFS identified such management objectives, and, as discussed below, provided a reasoned explanation for setting the aggregate limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Reasoned Explanation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs next contend that NMFS adopted the Council's recommendation without any of its own analysis, and that even the Council's analysis is insufficient to support the 2.7% aggregate limit.

Plaintiffs state that this Rule was unlawful because it \"is an outgrowth of, gives effect to, and extends into the future\" the ownership and control definitions and the aggregate limit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Plaintiffs urge that NMFS should have delayed implementation of the divestiture rules until after the widow rockfish reallocation because it risked a second, and costly divestiture if the reallocation increased their QS above the aggregate limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As with Amendments 20 and 21, the Court finds that the administrative record supplies a reasoned explanation for the determination to move forward with the divestiture. Both NMFS and the Council were aware of the potential interaction between the widow rockfish reallocation and the divestiture timeline, and the Council explored options for moving forward or delaying divestiture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR Disk 4 PFD.788;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20660.140\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PFD.755-56;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20660.140\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PFD.822, 869-70.

Moreover, the Council analyzed the consequences of the Rule across a variety of categories.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20660.140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PFD.918-19. The Council raised concerns about \"fairness\" and \"equity\" because a further delay would \"extend[ ] the amount of time those with amounts in excess of limits benefit, and delay[ ] the time before which others will have access to that QS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20660.140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PFD.919.

It further explained that \"when widow QS is reallocated, if the reallocation puts anyone above that aggregate limit, they will have until the widow QS divestiture deadline [12 calendar months after the reallocation is completed] to bring themselves back within the aggregate QS control limit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20660.140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PFD.977;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2069%2C138\">\n    80 Fed.
