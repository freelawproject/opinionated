(Filing No. 1, Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she is a resident of Lincoln, Nebraska, and that she was enrolled in a Health Benefit Plan (\"Plan\") through her employer, Community First National Bank (\"Bank\"), which is a Kansas bank and a member of the Kansas Bankers Association (\"Association\"). (Filing No. 11, Amended Complaint \u00b6 2; Filing No. 14-1, Stones Decl. \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges she required certain health care services and treatment beginning in December 2015, and such services were provided in Lancaster and Saunders County, Nebraska. (Filing No. 11, Amended Complaint \u00b6 3.) Plaintiff contends Defendants paid for some of these medical treatments, but then later demanded that certain health care providers refund certain payments. Plaintiff further asserts that Defendants denied payment entirely to two other Lincoln, Nebraska, health care providers that treated Plaintiff. Plaintiff claims that Defendants' denial of payment \"breach[ed] their contract of insurance\" with Plaintiff, and Defendants are estopped from disputing their liability for the payments because they \"did previously authorize the treatments and previously made payments to the plaintiff's healthcare providers, and knew or should have known that the plaintiff would rely to her detriment upon the actions of the defendants in making said payments.\" (Filing No. 11, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan is an ERISA plan established by the Association for the exclusive purpose of providing certain welfare benefits to employees of Association-member employers, all of which are Kansas banks and trust companies and the Association itself. (Filing No. 14-1, Stones Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. A.) Defendant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas (\"BCBSKS\") and the Association entered into an Administrative Services Agreement under which the Association delegated authority to BCBSKS to administer claims made by enrollees under the Plan.

(Filing No. 14-3, Graves Decl. \u00b6 3.) BCBSKS administered claims filed under the Plan from its headquarters in Topeka, Kansas. Accordingly, any benefit claims at issue in this lawsuit were reviewed and administered by BCBSKS in Kansas. (Filing No. 14-3, Graves Decl. \u00b6 5.) Kansas is the sole situs of the Plan's administration, all of the Plan's assets are located in Kansas, and all decisions concerning the Plan's administration are made in Kansas. Moreover, all material records and witnesses related to the Plan, its policies and procedures, and the Plan's administration are located in Kansas.

(Filing No. 14-1, Stones Decl. \u00b6 5.) All claims made under the Plan are reviewed and administered by BCBSKS in Kansas, and the day-to-day management of the Plan is conducted in Kansas. (Filing No. 14-1, Stones Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8; Filing No. 14-3, Graves Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) All of Plaintiff's claims and requests for benefits, including those that were denied and which are at issue in this lawsuit, were reviewed and analyzed by BCBSKS's employees and representatives in Kansas. (Filing No. 14-3, Graves Decl. \u00b6 5.) Because it is undisputed that the Plan is administered in Kansas, venue in this court is not proper under the \"plan-administration\" portion of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     B.

This, according to Plaintiff, is \"[t]he issue\" in this case. (Filing No. 16, at CM/ECF p. 3.) The parties do not cite, nor has the court found, an Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that addresses the issue of where the alleged breach occurs in an ERISA action, and there is a split of authority on this issue among district courts. Some district courts hold that the breach occurs where the benefit payment was to be received,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and other courts hold that\n   the breach takes place where the decision was made to deny benefit payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still\n   other courts hold that the nature of the ERISA claim is dispositive-that is, \"[i]f the claim is for breach of contract, the breach occurs where the plaintiff was to receive the benefits due them under the contract. On the other hand, if the claim is for breach of a fiduciary duty, the breach occurs where the defendants acted or failed to act in accordance with their duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Garvey v.

(Filing No. 11 \u00b6 7.) The basis of this claim is that Defendants failed to perform their contractual duty to pay for Plaintiff's medical treatment. This failure of performance occurred when Plaintiff or her health-care providers-all located in Nebraska-did not receive such payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northwest Arkansas Masonry, Inc. v.
