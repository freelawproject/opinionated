Cox\n   This case is a death action that arises under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). This case, filed by Marilyn Johnson on behalf of the estate of Norman Johnson, generally alleges that Norman Johnson died at Cook County Jail on or about January 7, 2014, as a result of not receiving methadone treatment, and the related withdrawal symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In the course of discovery, Plaintiff requested any and all \"Mortality Review documents or other death investigation\" documents from the Cook County Defendants (\n   <em>\n    aka\n   </em>\n   \"The Medical Defendants\") (known as \"Defendants\" for purposes of the instant motion) [dkt. 115, p. 2]. Defendants acknowledge that there is a Mortality Review, but contend that they should not be compelled to produce it because it is privileged pursuant to the Illinois Medical Studies Act, 735 ILCS 8/8-2101. Defendants filed a Motion for a Protective Order to this effect [dkt. 115] as requested by the Court after the discovery hearing of February 21, 2018 [dkt. 108]. The Court ordered Plaintiff to file a response brief, specifically addressing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the particular factual circumstances that would demonstrate a \"particularized need\" or \"compelling necessity\" for the Mortality Review [dkt. 118]. The Court has also ordered an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection of the Mortality Report and has conducted the same\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [dkt. 122]. The Court is now ready to rule on Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order [dkt. 115].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Illinois Medical Studies Act provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   All information, interviews, reports, statements, memoranda or other data of... allied medical societies... used in the course of internal quality control or of medical study for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality, or for improving patient care, shall be privileged, strictly confidential and shall be used only for medical research, the evaluation and improvement of quality care, or granting, limiting or revoking staff privileges....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   735 ILCS \u00a7 5/8-2101.

Compared to a civilian mortality review, a mortality review of a deceased inmate is likely to contain far more \"nonmedical\" information such as whether and when jail officials notified medical officials of a particular problem, whether there was a reason for nonmedical officials to have monitored a situation more closely, and perhaps provide insight into jail customs or policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680134\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/242/652/#p660\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"In these circumstances, it is peculiarly important that the public have access to the assessment by peers of the care provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Agster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934850\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/836/\">\n    422 F.3d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In additional to the above considerations related to mortality reviews conducted after inmate deaths, with respect to Norman Johnson in particular, it does not appear Plaintiff can obtain the information she seeks regarding the medical care (or lack thereof) provided to Norman Johnson from other sources such as the medical records over which Defendants do not assert a claim of privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accreditation Ass'n for Ambulatory Health Care\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20783106\">\n    2004 WL 783106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

After an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the Mortality Report at issue in the instant matter, it appears that the Review offers what is likely the most cohesive timeline of events that Plaintiff could likely hope to receive in this matter. It also speaks directly to medications and interventions given, or not given, to Norman Johnson. The information in the Mortality Review is important, if not critical, to Plaintiff's case, which contains Counts for deliberate indifference of a serious medical need in violation of Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment Rights;\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the Sheriff and Cook County for failures to train, supervise, and discipline employees with respect to emergency medical situations; and a state claim for indemnification [Second Amended Complaint, dkt. 60].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The very existence of The Joint Commission quality assurance review committee, and its evaluations and recommendations contained in the Mortality Review, are important in deciding the ultimate issue in the case-whether the Defendants were providing adequate medical care to inmates, including Norman Johnson.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
