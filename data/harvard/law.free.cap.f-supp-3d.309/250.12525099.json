On April 3, 2018, we granted Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. (Doc. 22). Plaintiffs represent a class of all Pennsylvania youth under the age of 21 who, now or in the future, are adjudicated dependent and have diagnosed mental health disabilities. (\"Plaintiffs\") (Doc. 22). Plaintiffs bring three claims against Defendants Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (\"DHS\") and Teresa Miller, as Acting Secretary of the DHS (collectively, Defendants), alleging systemic failures in the Pennsylvania Child Welfare and Medical Assistance programs. (Doc. 1). Defendants filed the instant Motion on February 26, 2018. (Doc. 15). The Motion has been fully briefed and is therefore ripe for our review. (Docs. 16, 18, 25). For the reasons that follow, the Motion shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 18, 2017, Plaintiffs commenced this action, by and through their next friends, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. (Doc. 1). On April 3, 2018, we granted Named Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, certifying all three claims within the complaint as class claims on behalf of all Pennsylvania youth under the age of 21 who are adjudicated dependent and diagnosed with mental health disabilities. (Doc. 22). The complaint alleges that DHS has failed to provide the required appropriate services to dependent children with diagnosed mental health disabilities in Pennsylvania. In accordance with the legal standard applicable on a motion to dismiss, the following facts are derived from the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DHS, through the Child Welfare system and its Office of Medical Assistance Programs (\"Medical Assistance\"), is responsible for providing appropriate mental health care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). The complaint paints a picture of the sad reality for various dependent youths in Pennsylvania. Many dependent children with mental disabilities end up in large, congregate facilities for years while they wait for appropriate placement from DHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Others end up waiting for months or years in inappropriate settings, such as psychiatric hospitals, juvenile detention facilities, and residential treatment facilities (\"RTFs\") while they wait for placement from DHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Each of the named Plaintiffs in this action has been diagnosed with mental health disabilities and has been adjudicated dependent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). They are all eligible for medical assistance from DHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff S.R. is a ten year old dependent child with mental health disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). He has been in a RTF waiting for placement from DHS for over three years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). His psychiatrist notes \"lack of discharge options\" as a barrier to his treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Though the RTF feels that S.R. has maximized his treatment and plans to discharge him when he has been assigned placement, DHS has not provided an appropriate family or community-based placement for S.R. with adequate services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Teddy Smith is an eighteen year old with mental illnesses who spent several months unnecessarily in a juvenile detention center awaiting an appropriate placement from DHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). When Smith was moved to a secure state-operated youth development center, he was assaulted by staff within the first two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs S.H., a fifteen year old with mental illnesses, and M.T., a sixteen year old with mental illness, are in the same local juvenile detention center awaiting services from Medical Assistance and a place to live from Child Welfare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Both S.H. and M.T. have been in the juvenile detention center for more than\n   200 days waiting for appropriate placement and services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff N.C. is a fifteen year old boy diagnosed with mental illness and has bounced around foster care and institutions for years while waiting for appropriate placement from DHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). He was scheduled to be sent to an out-of-state placement on December 13, 2017 because DHS provided no services or placement in Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff Chrystal Steward, a nineteen year old diagnosed with mental illnesses, is waiting in a psychiatric hospital for placement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Although she has been ready for discharge for nearly one year, she has not been discharged because DHS has not given her an appropriate placement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs bring three counts against Defendants, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. Counts I and II are brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\" Section 1983\"). In Count I, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated Title XIX of the Social Security Act (\"Title XIX\" or the \"Medicaid Act\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A) and 1396a(a)(43)(C). Title XIX, Section 1396a(a)(10)(A) requires a state plan for medical assistance to \"provide for making medical assistance available\" to a list of enumerated eligible individuals. Section 1396a(a)(43) requires the state plan to \"provide for informing all persons in the State who are under the age of 21 and who have been determined to be eligible for medical assistance ... of the availability of early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services.\" Section 1396a(a)(43)(C) requires the plan to provide for arranging those Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (\"EPSDT\") services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Count II, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated Title XIX, Section 1396a(a)(8), which requires a state plan for medical assistance to \"provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have the opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\" In Count III, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\" Section 504\" or \"RA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and their respective implementing regulations. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' policies and practices fail to provide them with mental health services in the most integrated setting appropriate, and fail to afford equal access to other services to achieve stability and permanency based on their disabilities or the severity of their disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs request that the Court \"[i]ssue declaratory relief determining that Defendants' actions and omissions as described above violate Title XIX of the Social Security Act, the ADA, and the RA,\" \"[i]ssue injunctive relief requiring Defendants to develop a full array of appropriate Child Welfare and MA services and placements to meet the needs of children with mental illness and behavior health disabilities in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs,\" and \"[g]rant such other relief as may be appropriate, including awarding reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\" (Doc. 1, pp. 41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645156\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/224/#p231\">\n    515 F.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pinker v.

In resolving a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court generally should consider only the allegations in the complaint, as well as \"documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint, ... and any matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, matters of public record, orders, [and] items appearing in the record of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Buck v.

Privately Enforceable Rights\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 1983 provides a remedy for violations of federal rights, but not\n   merely for violations of any federal law.\n   <em>\n    Blessing v.

In fact, the EPSDT mandate is clearly defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(r), where the required screening and treatment services are described in detail. Finally, the language of the EPSDT provision is mandatory, rather than precatory, in conferring an unambiguous obligation on the states to provide necessary treatment and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Having found that all three aspects of the\n   <em>\n    Blessing\n   </em>\n   test have been satisfied, we now consider whether Congress unambiguously conferred a private right of action using \"rights-creating\" terms.\n   <em>\n    Gonzaga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    536 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants offer no argument that the three requirements of the\n   <em>\n    Blessing\n   </em>\n   framework are not satisfied. Rather, each of Defendants' arguments is focused on their contention that the EPSDT mandate does not unambiguously\n   confer individual rights. As we will explain in more detail when addressing Defendants' arguments, we hold that the EPSDT mandate contains specific language and an individualistic focus that demonstrates Congress' intent to confer private rights of action to individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants devote less than two pages to their argument that \"Plaintiffs have no privately enforceable right to EPSDT services under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(43)(C).\" (Doc. 16, p. 9). Defendants argue that the entire section, and specifically section (a)(43)(C), \"is devoid of any language that unambiguously confers individual rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Rather, the text of the statutory section has an aggregate focus and is directed toward the regulated entity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 9-10). Defendants then note that the types of EPSDT services that a state must provide are varied and specific to the individual, and reiterate that the Medicaid Act already has an administrative remedy for noncompliance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10). \"For these reasons,\" Defendants argue that 1396a(a)(43)(C) is analogous to Section 30(A) from\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   and is not privately enforceable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is noteworthy that Defendants do not offer any case law where a court has held that 1396a(a)(43)(C) does not create a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Each of Defendants' proffered reasons to support a finding that the EPSDT mandate does not confer privately enforceable rights applies with equal force to 1396a(a)(10), which, as we know, the Third Circuit has already found creates a private right of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246465\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/180/#p187\">\n    367 F.3d at 189-190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, rather than being \"devoid\" of any rights-creating language,1396a(a)(43) contains the same language that the\n   <em>\n    Sabree\n   </em>\n   court labeled as \"rights-creating\" in 1396a(a)(10).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246465\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/180/#p187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246465\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/180/#p187\">\n    at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both sections begin with, \"A State plan must provide\" and, importantly, are coupled with an individual-focus. Section 1396a(a)(10) is centered on the requirement that the plan make medical assistance available to individuals and 1396a(a)(43) requires a plan to inform a class of those individuals of the availability of medical assistance, with 1396a(a)(43)(C) specifically requiring the plan to arrange for that medical assistance to individuals. This individualistic focus is in contrast with Section 30(A), which concerns the \"methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan.\" 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A). Though this section also begins with the same language \"A State plan must provide,\" it does not contain an individualistic focus, but rather focuses on the methods and procedures for utilizing and paying for services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, Defendants point out that the EPSDT mandate \"has an aggregate focus and is directed toward the regulated entity,\" but again, this applies to 1396a(a)(10) as well. (Doc. 16, pp. 9-10). Indeed, the vast majority of the Medicaid Act is directed toward the regulated entity and \"plumbing for congressional intent by balancing the specific language of a few discrete provisions of Title XIX is a difficult task.\"\n   <em>\n    Sabree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246465\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/180/#p187\">\n    367 F.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each provision is pointed toward the regulated entity and describing what aspects the state plan must contain. Nonetheless, the Third Circuit held that the specific, individual-focused language of 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a)(15), and 1396a(a)(8) \"unambiguously confers rights which plaintiffs can enforce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246465\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/180/#p187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This individual focus, as aforementioned, is present in the EPSDT mandate and absent from Section 30(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, Defendants note that the EPSDT mandate requires that a state plan arrange for a wide range of services that \"will be as diverse as the individuals receiving EPSDT services.\" (Doc. 16, p. 10). To this\n   argument, we must simply point again to the entitlement mandate that requires the plan to \"provide for making medical assistance available.\" 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A). The type of medical assistance that the plan must make available to the widely varied groups of individuals enumerated will undoubtedly be extremely diverse-indeed, the medical services that the plan must make available under the entitlement mandate, which applies to all eligible individuals, will be far more varied than the EPSDT mandate, which is directed just towards those under the age of 21. Yet, this was not even a factor considered by the\n   <em>\n    Sabree\n   </em>\n   Court when it concluded that the entitlement mandate creates a private right of action. We therefore are not persuaded by Defendants' argument that this aspect of the EPSDT mandate counsels against a finding of a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Defendants point to the Medicaid Act's administrative remedy to support their argument that the EPSDT does not confer a private right of action. (Doc. 16, p. 10). The existence of a built-in administrative remedy for noncompliance is certainly an important factor to consider in assessing whether the EPSDT mandate confers individual rights.

Therefore, the Court concluded that regulations promulgated to apply \u00a7 602, including the disparate-impact regulations, are likewise not actionable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n    at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Contrary to Defendants' contentions, the analytical guidance offered by\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   actually supports a finding that the integration and reasonable modifications regulations are enforceable. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , we start by examining the statute under which the regulations arise. The Supreme Court has already done this in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   , noting that \"in findings applicable to the entire statute, Congress explicitly identified unjustified 'segregation' of persons with disabilities as a 'for[m] of discrimination.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    527 U.S. at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 12101(a)(2) and (a)(5) ). The integration regulation therefore finds its genesis in the statutory text itself. Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Court noted that the statutory text incorporates the reasonable modifications regulation by defining a \"qualified individual with a disability\" as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services ...\" meets certain eligibility requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Further, Congress included in its statement of findings applicable to the ADA as a whole that \"individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including ... failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). The Supreme Court has referred to this as \"Title II's affirmative obligation to accommodate persons with disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877309\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/509/#p533\">\n    541 U.S. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877309\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/509/#p533\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877309\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/509/#p533\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Again we see that the statutory text itself incorporates the right upon\n   which the reasonable modifications regulation is founded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants mischaracterize\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   by stating that \"[t]he Court noted that where the\n   <strong>\n    regulation\n   </strong>\n   is a directive to an agency, as opposed to focusing on the individuals protected, there is far less reason to infer a private remedy.\" (Doc. 16, p. 16) (emphasis added). This is not the case; the Court in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   looked to whether the\n   <strong>\n    statute\n   </strong>\n   focused on the individuals protected or the regulated agency to determine if the\n   <strong>\n    statute\n   </strong>\n   created a private right of action, not the regulation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n    532 U.S. at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the statute created a private right of action, and the regulation applied the statute, then the regulation could be brought within that right of action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   was much like the Medicaid Act in that it related to federally funded programs, and the Court performed the same inquiry we did in the previous sections to determine whether that statute conferred private rights, ultimately finding it did not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the regulations are promulgated under the ADA and the RA, and there can be no dispute that these statutes can be enforced through a private right of action.\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. Gorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254475\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/181/#p184\">\n    536 U.S. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254475\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/181/#p184\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254475\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/181/#p184\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We therefore conclude that the statutory text of the ADA and the RA creates the rights under which the integration and reasonable modifications regulations arise, and that the regulations do not exceed the scope of those rights. Accordingly, because the statutes are enforceable through private action, Plaintiffs' reliance on those regulations to state a claim of discrimination is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants' Motion is premised entirely on the contention that Plaintiffs' claims are not privately enforceable. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Plaintiffs' complaint is based upon enforceable provisions of Title XIX, the ADA, and the RA.
