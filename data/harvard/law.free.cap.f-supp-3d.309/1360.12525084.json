This account is therefore derived from the plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Georgia constitution provides that the apportionment of the Georgia House of Representatives \"shall be changed by the General Assembly as necessary after each United States decennial census.\" Ga. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 2. To comply with this provision, the Georgia General Assembly redrew the state House of Representative districts after the 2010 census. Compl. \u00b6 57. This new voting map, provided in Act No. 1EX, went into effect in late 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. The General Assembly then amended Act No. 1EX to adjust the lines of fifteen House districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. The new map, as modified by Act No. 277, went into effect in 2012, and it was this map upon which the 2012 and 2014 Georgia House elections were conducted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Then, in 2015, the Georgia General Assembly enacted H.B. 566, which modified the lines of seventeen Georgia House districts, including Districts 105 and 111.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 66, 69. H.B. 566 changed the map for Georgia House Districts from that used in the 2012 and 2014 elections even though no new census had been taken.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.

In both districts, the minority voting age population had significantly increased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. And in both districts, Democratic candidates narrowly lost Georgia House elections to white Republican candidates in 2012 and 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 90-91. The 2015 amendments to the borders of Districts 105 and 111 decreased the African-American population and increased the white population in both districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 92. The plaintiffs allege that voters were moved in and out of Districts 105 and 111 predominantly on the basis of race in an effort to secure seats for White Republican candidates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79, 94. In the 2016 election, Democratic candidates again narrowly lost in Districts 105 and 111.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-83, 95. The plaintiffs allege that if the 2016 elections had taken place using the pre-2015 map, African-American Democratic candidates would have won District 105 and would have likely won District 111.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84, 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, the plaintiffs allege that \"the African-American population in certain parts of the state, most notably in the Atlanta metropolitan area, has significantly increased since both the 2000 and 2010 Censuses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.

Among other things, they ask for a declaration that H.B. 566 violates the Constitution and Section 2, and that Districts 105 and 111 are racial gerrymanders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. They seek an order mandating that at least one additional majority-minority House district be created in the Atlanta metropolitan area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also seek injunctions prohibiting the use of the H.B. 566 districts in future elections and requiring Georgia to get preclearance before implementing any state-level redistricting or electoral changes for at least ten years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Secretary Kemp argues that the plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed in part under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of standing. More to the point, he argues that the plaintiffs who do not live in districts that were modified by H.B. 566 (Ms. McKenzie, Ms. Orange, Ms. Snow, Mr. Arrey-Mbi, Ms. Anderson, and Ms. Jackson) do not have standing to bring any claims. Doc. 47-1 at 7-8. Secretary Kemp also argues that Ms. Cunningham does not have standing to bring Counts\n   One and Three because she does not live in Districts 105 or 111.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. He does not challenge Ms. Cunningham's standing to bring Count Two.

Doc. 55 at 3 n.1; Doc. 58 at 2 n.1. We think they are right, as well, so we turn to the question of which plaintiffs have standing to bring Count Two. Secretary Kemp argues that the only parties who have standing to bring Count Two are those who live in districts modified in 2015 by H.B. 566. Doc. 58 at 3-4. If he is right, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Payton, and Ms. Cunningham have standing to bring Count Two, but Ms. McKenzie, Ms. Orange, Ms. Snow, Mr. Arrey-Mbi, Ms. Anderson, and Ms. Jackson do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The resolution of this dispute depends upon whether the plaintiffs have challenged the current House voting map as a whole (as the plaintiffs argue) or only the modifications made by H.B. 566 (as the defendant argues). While the complaint can be read to give some support to either argument, we think it most sensible to read Count Two as challenging the current House voting map as a whole. As we've said, H.B. 566 modified the boundaries of seventeen districts in the map that was first drawn in Act No. 1EX and then modified in Act No. 277. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, 66. Evaluation of the current House voting map therefore requires consideration of all three pieces of legislation. Notably, H.B. 566 itself references the earlier versions of the map it modified. As the most recent of the three versions, and with that being the case, the only one able to reference the other two, we view the plaintiffs' reference to H.B. 566 in Count Two to be a reference to the current map as a whole rather than just the boundaries modified in 2015. Indeed, that is how the plaintiffs frame Count Two: as a challenge to \"[t]he current district boundaries for the House of Representatives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We find support for this reading in the way the plaintiffs drafted their complaint. The complaint says H.B. 566 \"packs\" African-American voters into House Districts 61, 75, 88, and 92.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109. But those districts were not changed by the H.B. 566 amendments. Doc. 47-1 at 4-5. The complaint also refers to H.B. 566 as \"contain[ing] 31 districts in the Atlanta metropolitan area\" with a majority African-American voting-age population. Compl. \u00b6 67. And in just the preceding paragraph, the complaint recognizes that only seventeen House districts were modified by\n   H.B. 566.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. In light of the inconsistencies that would result if we read the plaintiffs' reference to H.B. 566 as only reaching the districts modified in 2015, we decline to do so. We will read the plaintiffs' reference to H.B. 566, at least for purposes of Count Two, as referring to the current state of the Georgia House of Representative map, encompassing H.B. 566, Act No. 277, and Act No. 1EX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Read this way, we find that all plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to support their standing to bring Count Two. There is case support for the plaintiffs' standing to bring a Section 2 claim seeking the drawing of additional majority-minority voting districts. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Whitford v. Nichol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5915784\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/151/918/\">\n    151 F.Supp.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

Jan. 28, 2014). While these opinions are not binding upon us here, we find their approach sensible at this stage. The plaintiffs have alleged injury in the form of dilution of their voting strength by the current Georgia House District map. Compl. \u00b6 131. And they have alleged they live in the Atlanta metropolitan area, where African-American voters are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to comprise a majority of voters in at least one additional House district.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 133-34.

In\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit adopted this rule without acknowledging that it was answering the question left open in\n   <em>\n    DeSoto I\n   </em>\n   , or even recognizing the difference between intent and effects claims under Section 2. Nevertheless, the\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   opinion leads with the idea that in order to \"satisfy Section 2's standard in a vote dilution case,\" plaintiffs must show all three: (1) a sufficiently large and geographically compact minority group, such that it could constitute a majority in a district; (2) the minority group is politically cohesive; and (3) the white majority votes as a bloc sufficiently to defeat the minority group's preferred candidates.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/\">\n    204 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   controls here, and the plaintiffs must show all three\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   preconditions to bring both intent and effects claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Applying this standard, the plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged the\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   preconditions. Instead they argue that the\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   preconditions should not be required. Doc. 55 at 7-12. But as we have explained, we believe the plaintiffs' view conflicts with Eleventh Circuit precedent. As Secretary Kemp correctly points out, the plaintiffs do not allege that minority voters could be a majority in either District 111 or 115. Doc. 47-1 at 12. This means that Count One does not satisfy the first\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition. While we acknowledge that the plaintiffs' allegations may be sufficient under effects standards applied in other parts of the country, they are not sufficient under the standard that controls here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We invited the plaintiffs to file a surreply addressing Secretary Kemp's argument that their constitutional claims should also be dismissed for failure to allege all three\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   factors. Doc. 82. They declined our invitation. In the order this panel issued in the\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   case, we quoted\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   as questioning whether \"vote dilution can be established under the Constitution when the pertinent record has not proved vote dilution under the more permissive section 2.\" Doc. 28 at 26 (quoting\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/\">\n    204 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1344-45 ). In\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit expressly reserved the question of whether a case that was insufficient under the Voting Rights Act would necessarily be insufficient under the Constitution as well.\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/\">\n    204 F.3d at 1344-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Court held that the plaintiffs' Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment claims fell because the plaintiffs were not able to show the first\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   factor as required to prove causation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/\">\n    at 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs have provided us no argument as to why\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   does not require the dismissal of their Voting Rights Act claim, and neither have they provided any alternative standard for viewing the sufficiency of their constitutional claims. Thus in light of\n   <em>\n    DeSoto II\n   </em>\n   , we dismiss Count One in its entirety for failure to state a claim. This dismissal is without prejudice to the plaintiffs' ability to replead this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. COUNT TWO: DISCRIMINATORY EFFECTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In their second count, the plaintiffs allege that H.B. 566 violates the results\n   prong of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Compl. \u00b6 130-31. In particular, the plaintiffs claim Section 2 requires the creation of at least one more majority-minority district in the metropolitan Atlanta area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132. Secretary Kemp responds with two arguments in his motion to dismiss this count. First, he says plaintiffs have failed to show how H.B. 566 caused them injury insofar as H.B. 566 did not itself modify many of the metropolitan Atlanta districts that are the basis for this claim. Doc. 47-1 at 13. Second, Secretary Kemp argues that plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to show that the voting strength of African-American voters in metropolitan Atlanta is actually diluted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We reject the Secretary's first argument for the same reason we rejected his standing argument above. As we've said, we find the most reasonable reading of Count Two to be a challenge to the current House District voting map, as most recently modified by H.B. 566. Under our reading, Count Two is not insufficient merely because the latest series of amendments did not modify every district on which the plaintiffs base their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to Secretary Kemp's second argument, he says that even if the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   preconditions, their claim can only survive a motion to dismiss if \"the circumstances in totality support a finding of vote dilution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.
