The covenants, conditions, and restrictions (\"CC &amp; R\") governing the property contained a mortgage protection clause. (ECF No. 36-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 22, 2010, MERS assigned the deed of trust to HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as trustee for Deutsche Alt-A Securities Mortgage Loan Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-AR6 (\"HSBC\") via a corporation assignment of deed of trust (recorded on January 28, 2010).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; (ECF No. 36-2). On November 18, 2014, HSBC assigned its interest in the deed of trust to Nationstar via a corporate assignment of deed of trust (recorded on December 1, 2014). (ECF No. 36-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Dacayanans stopped paying dues to the HOA. On April 20, 2011, Phil Frink &amp; Associates, Inc., acting on behalf of the HOA, recorded a notice of delinquent assessment lien, stating an amount due of $1,115.72. (ECF No. 36-4). On October 10, 2012, Kern &amp; Associates, Ltd. (\"Kern\"), acting on behalf of the HOA, recorded a notice of default and election to sell to satisfy the delinquent assessment lien, stating an amount due of $3,055.09. (ECF No. 1); (ECF No. 36-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 6, 2013, Kern recorded a notice of homeowners association sale, stating an amount due of $5,874.51 and an anticipated sale date of December 4, 2013.

(ECF No. 36-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 24, 2016, Nationstar filed the underlying complaint, alleging four causes of action: quiet title against all defendants; breach of NRS 116.1113 against the HOA; wrongful foreclosure against the HOA; and injunctive relief against SFR. (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 23, 2016, SFR filed its answer to the complaint. (ECF No. 15). The answer includes crossclaims against the Dacayanans, as well as counterclaims against Nationstar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the instant motions, plaintiff, defendant HOA, and defendant SFR all move for summary judgment in their favor.

Further, until this ruling no party was sure of the legal effect of the foreclosure sale. As such, no party adequately demonstrated in their filings that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff's claims for wrongful foreclosure and violation of NRS 116.1113.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In light of the foregoing, plaintiff has not shown that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claim for quiet title. Plaintiff's motion fails to demonstrate a legal or equitable basis to quiet title in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Conversely, defendants have demonstrated that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff's claim for quiet title and on SFR's claim for quiet title. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    SFR Investments\n   </em>\n   , NRS Chapter 116, and the trustee's deed upon sale, the foreclosure sale extinguished the deed of trust. Plaintiff has failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact to preclude summary judgment in defendants' favor. Therefore, the court will grant defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 36) be, and the same hereby is, DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the HOA's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 33) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, consistent with the foregoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SFR's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 37) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SFR's crossclaims against the Dacayanans be, and the same hereby are, DISMISSED as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that defendant HOA submitted a credit bid for $450.
