CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This diversity action is brought by Dr. Barbara Nylander against Unum Life Insurance Company of America (\"Unum\") and Paul Revere Life Insurance Company (\"Paul Revere\"). The case arises from the denial of Dr. Nylander's claims for disability insurance benefits under three policies issued by Unum and Paul Revere. Dr. Nylander brings claims under Tennessee law for breach of contract and bad faith denial of insurance benefits. Unum and Paul Revere have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. No. 35.) The motion is fully briefed and ready for decision. For the following reasons, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny the motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background and Facts\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dr. Nylander is a board-certified medical doctor who maintains a practice in gynecology and gynecological surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. Nos. 1 at \u00b6 6; 40-5 at 3.) Plaintiff maintains privileges at Centennial Hospital and Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. (Doc. No. 38-1 at 158.) Defendants are insurance companies that offer long-term disability insurance policies. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Dr. Nylander maintains three long-term disability insurance policies with Defendants, two issued by Unum (\"Unum-BOE\" and \"Unum-IDI\") and one issued by Paul Revere (\"PR-IDI\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. Nos. 40-2, 40-3, 40-4.) All three policies are administered by Unum. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 9; Doc. Nos. 40-2, 40-3, 40-4.) Dr. Nylander's application for PR-IDI, signed March 11, 1993, listed her \"occupation\" and \"exact duties\" as \"OB/GYN.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 40-2 at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under Unum-IDI and Unum-BOE, Unum \"must be given the information which we need to determine if a benefit is payable and how much the benefit should be.... We will not pay benefits until we have sufficient proof of loss. When we have\n   determined that the claim is payable, we will pay according to the [b]enefits provision.\" (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 12; 40-3 at 11.) Under PR-IDI, Paul Revere will pay claims \"only after [w]e receive satisfactory written proof of loss.\" (Doc. No. 40-4 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unum-IDI and Unum-BOE each define total and residual disability in terms of \"material and substantial duties.\" Total disability is defined in these policies as follows: \"Injury or sickness restricts the Insured's ability to perform the material and substantial duties of [her] regular occupation to an extent that prevents [her] from engaging in [her] regular occupation.\" (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 6; 40-3 at 7.) Residual disability is defined in these policies as follows: \"Injury or sickness does not prevent the Insured from engaging in [her] regular occupation, BUT does restrict [her] ability to perform the material and substantial duties of [her] regular occupation (a) for as long a time as [she] customarily performed them before the injury or sickness; or (b) as effectively as [she] customarily performed them before the injury or sickness.\" (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 6; 40-3 at 7.) Finally, these policies define \"regular occupation\" as \"the Insured's occupation at the time the Elimination Period begins. If the Insured engages primarily in a professionally recognized specialty at that time, [her] occupation is that specialty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 6; 40-3 at 6.) PR-IDI defines total and residual disability in terms of \"important duties.\" Specifically, the policy defines total disability as follows: \"Because of injury or sickness ... you are unable to perform the important duties of Your Occupation.\" (Doc. No. 40-4 at 7.) The policy defines residual disability, in relevant part: \"Due to injury or sickness which begins prior to age 65, (1) you are unable to perform one or more of the important duties of Your Occupation; or (2) you are unable to perform the important duties of Your Occupation for more than 80% of the time normally required to perform them and ... (c) you are not totally disabled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Finally, the policy defines \"Your Occupation\" as \"the occupation or occupations in which [y]ou are regularly engaged at the time [d]isability begins.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Both Unum-IDI and PR-IDI contain a lifetime benefit rider wherein if Dr. Nylander is totally disabled due to injury prior to reaching the age of 65, she will continue to receive total disability benefits for her lifetime so long as she remains totally disabled. (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 16; 40-4 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 15, 2015, Dr. Nylander sustained an injury to her right index finger when her partner and husband, Dr. Carl Wingo (\"Dr. Wingo\"), accidentally cut her during a hysterectomy surgery. (Doc. No. 40-1 at 18-21.) Dr. Nylander had orthopedic surgery the next day to repair a \"full rupture with retraction\" of the tendon on that finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57; Doc. No. 40-26 at 44.) As Dr. Jason Haslam, Dr. Nylander's orthopedic surgeon explained it: \"Tendons are like ropes. And her rope was completely cut.\" (Doc. No. 40-26 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 21, 2015, Dr. Nylander submitted her claim for disability benefits under Unum-BOE, Unum-IDI and PR-IDI. (Doc. No. 40-5.) The claim form, which was prepared both by Dr. Nylander and her office manager of approximately 20 years, Carolyn Kelly, identified Dr. Nylander's job title as \"medical doctor\" and listed her occupational duties as \"physician/medical doctor/surgeon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Dr. Nylander further described her specialty as \"gynecology\" with particular duties as: \"performs annual exams which\n   include breast exams and pap smears ; surgeries both minor and major procedures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 8.) The claim form noted that Dr. Nylander's occupation required \"suturing following surgery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The claim form stated that Dr. Nylander spent 32 hours per week at her job, with 24 of those hours spent, on average, in the office and 6-8 hours spent at the hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 8.) Dr. Nylander apportioned her duties as 75% office time, 0% administrative tasks, 5% hospital rounds, and 25% surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) In addition to other office staff, Dr. Nylander stated that her practice employed a \"surgery scheduler.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 24, 2015, Dr. Haslam released Dr. Nylander to return to limited work duty activities. (Doc. No. 40-25 at 11.) He felt that it would probably be appropriate for Dr. Nylander to see patients for \"office visits,\" as long as she did not use her splinted right hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 12, 2015, Dr. Nylander reported stiffness and discomfort in her finger to Dr. Haslam. (Doc. No. 40-26 at 9.) However, Dr. Haslam released Dr. Nylander to resume work activities with no restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At a follow-up examination on July 24, 2015, Dr. Nylander reported continued discomfort with her hand over the knuckle of her right index finger and stated that heavy gripping aggravated significant discomfort. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) However, Dr. Nylander did not discuss with Dr. Haslam what level of finger functionality she needed for surgery at that time. (Doc. No. 47-5 at \u00b6 3.) Dr. Haslam again released Dr. Nylander to resume regular work duty activities with no restrictions. (Doc. No. 40-1 at 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late July 2015, Dr. Nylander reported to Defendants that she was performing surgeries but that Dr. Wingo was \"helping her.\" (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 5; 38-33.) Soon after, the parties agreed Defendants would pay Dr. Nylander's claim for total disability benefits under all three policies, beginning on April 15, 2015, less the elimination period set forth in the three policies, through October 15, 2015, which was the date by which Dr. Nylander expected to return to work full time, performing all duties, including all surgeries, and at full pay. (Doc. Nos. 38-1 at 136-37, 142; 38-31 at \u00b6 6; 38-34.) The parties also agreed that Dr. Nylander's premium payments would be waived through the October 15, 2015 date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 11, 2015, Dr. Nylander reported continued discomfort to Dr. Haslam, and other \"severe difficulties\" including problems \"us[ing] a knife to cut food.\" (Doc. No. 40-26 at 14-15.) Dr. Haslam found that Dr. Nylander had stiffness and range of motion deficits in her right index finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) On September 13, 2015, Dr. Haslam assessed an impairment rating of 7% to Dr. Nylander's right index finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) However, Dr. Haslam released Dr. Nylander with no restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Dr. Nylander was performing a solo vaginal laparoscopic hysterectomy. In the process of removing the patient's uterus, a \"bleeder\" occurred. In Dr. Nylander's own words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A: During the vaginal portion of the case there was a rather large bleeding vessel on the right side of the patient's pelvis after the uterus had been removed and I was temporarily unable to gain control of that, and it took much longer than usual to gain control of the bleeding vessel to get it sufficiently clamped and then to make a suture ligature around it to hold it tight. It was difficult. I think at that moment I realized I really cannot be the surgeon in the lead anymore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. And what would be the process you would go through to try to get the bleeding under control?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. I mean, it was suction, visualization, placing a clamp, and then placing the suture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Doc. No. 40-1 at 80.) On September 14, 2015, Dr. Nylander left a voice mail with Defendants saying that she could not do surgeries anymore because she could not tie a knot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-82; Doc. No. 38-31 at \u00b6 7; Doc. No. 38-35.) Two days later, Defendants' representative spoke to Dr. Nylander, who repeated that, due to her inability to tie knots, she may be able to assist in surgery but she would not be able to continue to work as a lead/solo surgeon-i.e., she would only be able to perform \"procedures such as pap smears\" in the office. (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 7; 38-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Nylander reported to Dr. Haslam \"an inability to perform surgical duties safely.\" (Doc. No. 40-25 at 27.) In part because Dr. Haslam had concluded \"there was no further treatment available,\" he ordered a Functional Capacity Evaluation (\"FCE\") so that he could \"understand more fully what [Dr. Nylander] could and could not do.\" (Doc. No. 40-26 at 21.) According to Dr. Haslam, \"[FCEs are] accepted by orthopedic doctors [as] a good way, a sound way to measure functional capacity, or the loss thereof\" and are \"as objective [observations] as we have.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In early October 2015, Jeffrey Gandy, a board-certified hand therapist and occupational therapist with twenty years of experience, performed the four-hour long FCE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. No. 47-1 at 5-7.) Mr. Gandy noted in his FCE that Plaintiff is an \"OBGYN (for 25 years/N/A months),\" but she did not provide Mr. Gandy with a job description. (Doc. No. 40-27 at 1, 4.) However, Gandy noted that Dr. Nylander described a typical surgery day as starting at 7:30 a.m. and being made up of \"3-5 cases during the morning and 3-4 smaller [ ] cases in the afternoon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Dr. Nylander further reported to Gandy that she would typically have to place \"at least 30-40 sutures per surgery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Gandy found that Dr. Nylander's right hand had gross grasp/pinch weakness compared to the left hand, and he observed Dr. Nylander's difficulty performing various suture techniques including \"speed/ease\" and \"pushing suture into tissue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Gandy also observed Dr. Nylander having difficulty handling surgical tools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Nylander exhibited pain in her right hand throughout the testing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 6-7.) Aside from any hand limitations, Gandy deemed Dr. Nylander capable of engaging in medium physical demand level work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the FCE, on October 23, 2015, Dr. Nylander had an office visit with Dr. Haslam. (Doc. No. 40-1 at 73.) Dr. Nylander conveyed her ongoing complaints about problems with gripping and suturing in the operating room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Dr. Haslam, Dr. Nylander stated that using instruments in the operating room, suture activity, and holding pressure for bleeding seemed to aggravate discomfort around the area of her index finger, and that this specifically included doing surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73; Doc. No. 40-26 at 22.) Dr, Haslam noted that Dr. Nylander was \"very concerned that she may harm patients during surgery given her ongoing problems and difficulty with gripping, using instruments, suturing, holding pressure on wounds for bleeding.\" (Doc. Nos. 40-1 at 75; 40-26 at 22.) Dr. Haslam relied on the FCE conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 40-26 at 21.) Based upon a \"combination of [Dr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nylander's] subjective complaints and the [FCE],\" Dr. Haslam instituted permanent work restrictions such that Dr. Nylander could not engage in heavy gripping and could not suture in the operating room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 24-25.) He further instructed Dr. Nylander to avoid instruments that aggravate her right index finger. (Doc. No. 40-1 at 76.) Dr. Haslam took these actions in part out of concern for the safety of Dr. Nylander's patients. (Doc. No. 40-26 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On November 4, 2015, Dr. Nylander re-instituted a claim for disability benefits under her three policies with Defendants. (Doc. Nos. 40-1 at 135; 38-31 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; 38-37.) In this claim form, Dr. Nylander stated that she had returned to work, but was only able to perform the following duties of her occupation: \"office based practice/exams/minor procedures.\" (Doc. No. 38-37 at 1.) She stated that she was unable to perform \"surgery-unable to tie knots/use finger for manual dissection/unable to use equipment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That claim form also contains an Attending Physician's Statement, signed by Dr. Haslam, indicating that Dr. Nylander is restricted as follows: \"No heavy gripping. No suturing in the operating room, and instruments which aggravate index finger MCP joint pain. Right finger.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In reviewing Dr. Nylander's claim for additional benefits, Defendants spoke with Ms. Kelly and Dr. Nylander on multiple occasions; gathered and reviewed relevant medical records from Dr. Nylander's medical providers, including Dr. Haslam; gathered and reviewed relevant practice records, reviewed billing records by CPT code;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and contracted for a medical exam (\"IME\") by Dr. David Martin, a board certified surgeon with certifications in hand and upper extremity conditions. (Doc. No. 38-31 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11 and exhibits cited therein.) Defendants did not select a gynecologist to review Dr. Nylander's claim file because they \"didn't feel it was necessary, nor did they consult with anyone other than Dr. Nylander regarding the important duties of a gynecologist and/or surgeon. (Doc. No. 47-3 at 42, 133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Martin completed the IME in approximately one-half hour. (Doc. No. 38-30 at 13.) In the IME, Dr. Martin opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [T]here is no reason that the time she devotes to the practice of medicine should be restricted. With regard to her hand, she is physically capable of working a full-time practice schedule. With regard to the limitation of her index finger, I would not recommend instituting any permanent work restrictions. It is my opinion that work restrictions are utilized to prevent additional injury or harm to the patient; she is unlikely to cause any injury or damage to her hand or finger as a result of any activity whatsoever. Continuing to participate in operative gynecological surgery, she has likely maintained the competence and technical proficiency to perform surgeries and, with reasonable accommodations, could likely return to performance of surgery it desired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the \"accommodations\" that Dr. Martin suggested to Dr. Nylander was wearing oversized gloves during surgery. (Doc. No. 38-1 at 148.) Dr. Nylander found this suggestion \"possibly ludicrous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his deposition, Dr. Martin testified that he found nothing that would prohibit Dr. Nylander from performing the full scope of her practice, including surgical duties. (Doc. No. 40-29 at 30.) He stated that Dr. Nylander's struggle with her finger would \"not necessarily\" impede her ability to manipulate surgical tools, and that Dr. Nylander might be able to use \"other digits\", \"other techniques of operating these instruments,\" or \"surgical assistants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) However, Dr. Martin noted that the safety of surgical patients is a \"very sober and important issue\" and that \"surgeons must be the ones to determine what procedures they can perform safely and comfortably, satisfactorily without endangering their patients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.) Dr. Martin further testified that Dr. Nylander \"appeared to be very honest in her description of the limitations she had,\" and that, even though he disagreed, he had \"no specific criticisms\" of the restrictions imposed on Dr. Nylander by Dr. Haslam. (Doc. No. 40-29 at 25, 60.) Defendants never conducted an analysis of whether Dr. Nylander would be totally disabled if she could not perform surgery, because they \"concluded she could perform surgery.\" (Doc. No. 47-3 at 125.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 30, 2016, relying in part on Dr. Martin's IME and the review of records by Dr. Groves and Dr. Saks, Defendants denied Dr. Nylander's claim for additional disability benefits. (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 13; 38-41.) Melissa Walsh, Defendants' corporate representative, testified that at the time of this denial Defendants \"didn't make any sort of determination that [Dr. Nylander] was engaged in her occupation.\" (Doc. No. 4703 at 50-51.) On April 29, 2016, Dr. Nylander submitted an appeal of Defendants' decision to deny her claim for additional benefits. (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 14; 38-42.) She claimed in the letter that she was totally disabled under the policies. (Doc. No. 38-42.) Dr. Nylander further advised Defendants in writing that if she was not paid the additional total disability benefits, she would pursue bad faith penalties pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2056-7-105\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 56-7-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 15; 38-43.) On May 4, 2016, Dr. Nylander was notified of Defendants' intent to complete the review of her appeal \"as soon as possible.\" (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 16; 38-44.) In evaluating the appeal, Defendants consulted in-house doctors Dr. John Groves and Dr. Joel Saks; asked follow-up questions of Dr. Martin; and consulted Andrea Coraccio, an in-house vocational rehabilitation expert. (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 18; 38-46, 38-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 30, 2016, fifty-five days after receipt of the bad-faith letter, Defendants affirmed their denial of additional benefits. (Doc. Nos. 38-31 at \u00b6 17; 38-45.) Dr. Nylander and Kelly both testified that, aside from the retrospective belief that that Defendants' representatives were gathering information for the purposes of eventually denying the claim, Defendants did not mislead them, provide them with inaccurate information, or unnecessarily delay the claims process. ( (Doc. Nos. 40-1 at 138-153; 40-16 at 104-106.) Indeed, Dr. Nylander testified that the Defendants' claims representative, Matthew LaRotonda was \"agreeable\" and \"acted as if he were [her] friend.\" (Doc. No. 38-1 at 138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Nylander states that she has not recovered from her injury-namely, not being able to achieve full flexion, lacking grip strength, pinch strength and dexterity. (Doc. No. 47-5 at \u00b6 6.) According to Dr. Nylander, this lingering injury prevents her from (1) suturing in pelvic and abdominal cavities, (2) adequately handling her surgical tools and the trigger devices of her surgical tools, and (3) being able to apply adequate pressure to tissue, veins, and arteries during surgery in some circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Dr. Nylander does not believe that she is able to work as\n   a lead surgeon on invasive gynecological procedures without putting her patients at risk of \"substantial and long-term injuries and disabilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Walsh testified that \"what Unum has stated is that as a gynecologist [Dr. Nylander] performed surgeries.\" (Doc. No. 47-3 at 89-90.) She testified that Dr. Nylander's surgical duties and clinical duties were all \"material and substantial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-89.) Stated differently, according to Walsh, Defendants \"didn't come out and say that any of these duties wouldn't have been material and substantial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89.) However, later in her deposition, Walsh reversed course and stated that \"everything was looked at and [Defendants] concluded surgery wasn't an important duty of [Dr. Nylander's] occupation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116.) Then Walsh admitted that she \"wasn't sure\" whether Defendants had given more importance in their analysis to the number of procedures Dr. Nylander performed or the income those procedures generated when determining what was important/material and substantial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. Nylander worked on numerous major, invasive surgical procedures before her injury, and she considers these surgical duties to be important/material and substantial aspects of her regular occupation.

For the several years prior to Dr. Nylander's injury, surgery comprised 20-25% of Dr. Nylander's actual time, between 5-9% of her CPT billing codes, but made up 40-50% of her practice revenues. (Doc.

(Doc. No. 47-5 at \u00b6 29.) More specifically, Dr. Nylander's inability to act as lead surgeon in major gynecological procedures has reduced (and will continue to reduce) her clinical practice because \"[g]ynecological patients expect a continuum of care from their gynecologists. Patients expect that the gynecologist who evaluates them during an office visit will be the same gynecologist who serves as their lead surgeon during a procedure. As a result, patients, and their referring doctors, are unlikely to choose gynecologists who cannot perform as a lead surgeon.\" (Doc. No. 47-5 at \u00b6 9.) Dr. Nylander has stated that she is \"unaware of any gynecologist who practices in Nashville who maintains only a clinical practice\" and she \"estimate[s] that less than five percent of all physicians who practice as gynecologists in the United States have only clinical practices. The reason for that is that it is not possible to maintain a strictly clinical practice that generates close to the revenue that a surgical and clinical practice generates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) Accordingly, Dr. Nylander maintains that \"referrals from other physicians have been gradually tapering off as more and more learn that [she is] unable to handle major gynecological procedures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) In addition, \"surgical consultations and post-surgical follow-up visits make up a significant portion of [Dr. Nylander's] clinical practice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) For these among other reasons, Dr. Nylander states that her \"ability to perform invasive, gynecological surgeries as a lead surgeon was an essential part of [her] practice; that ability drove [her] clinical practice and was directly and indirectly the source of a substantial portion of [her] income as a gynecologist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Dr. Nylander is now being paid $60.00 per hour for clinical work instead of receiving a \"practice draw\"; she has stated that she expects her 2018 practice income to further decrease to an estimated $94,000 per year, two-thirds less than before her injury.

(Doc. No. 36 at 11-15.) More specifically, Defendants argue that: (1) Dr. Haslam initially cleared Dr. Nylander to return to work with no restrictions, (2) Dr. Nylander's subsequent complaints to Dr. Haslam were subjective in nature, (3) Mr. Gandy's FCE was unconvincing and Dr. Haslam only reviewed its summary (as opposed to every detail of its testing results), and (4) Dr. Martin's IME is objective evidence to the contrary of the FCE and, in the end, the limitations imposed by Dr. Haslam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This argument is without merit. First, Dr. Haslam's initial clearances from Dr. Haslam were made before the extent of the problem performing surgery became evident to Dr. Nylander and was reported to Dr. Haslam. Little importance can reasonably be attached to when Dr. Haslam\n   cleared Dr. Nylander to return to work before she brought her complaints of disability to his attention. Dr. Haslam, a hand surgery expert whose records were provided to Defendants, eventually concluded that Dr. Nylander had a likely-permanent seven-percent deficit in her finger. Second, while Dr. Nylander's complaints may have been generally subjective in nature, she had particularized knowledge from her decades of experience in the practice of gynecology and surgery that reasonably enabled her to evaluate whether her injury affected her ability to manipulate surgical tools and tie sutures (and thereby prevented her from safely performing surgery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, the FCE clearly constituted objective evidence upon which Dr. Haslam could-and did-rely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caesar v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins.

Indeed, Unum's own claims manual states that an FCE is a valid factor to be considered when evaluating a claimant's symptoms, (Doc. No. 44 at 5-6), and Unum has taken the position in federal litigation that FCE results may be relied upon to deny benefits (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 42 at 9 n. 3 (collecting cases) ). In one of those cases from this circuit,\n   <em>\n    Pelchat v. UNUM Life Insurance Company of America\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:02cv7282,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021105075\">\n    2003 WL 21105075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 25, 2003), Unum argued that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   \"objective medical evidence\" supporting the plaintiff's claim file-\n   <em>\n    an FCE\n   </em>\n   -supported its claims decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *10 (\"UNUM gives much credence to the FCE. In fact, in UNUM's first denial letter to plaintiff, the FCE is the exclusive reason plaintiff was denied coverage.\") There is no evidence that Dr. Nylander in any way manipulated or distorted the FCE results. Indeed, Mr. Gandy conducted numerous repetitive trials and believed that Dr. Nylander was making a good faith effort. (Doc. Nos. 40-27 at 1; 47-1 at 11-12.) Furthermore, that Dr. Haslam reviewed only the FCE summary is of no moment for purposes of this motion. As in the case of many scientific reports, the summary sufficiently explains pages of test result numbers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40-27.) It was perfectly reasonable for Dr. Haslam to rely on Mr. Gandy's interpretation of the underlying results. In sum, the record contains Dr. Haslam's objective records, the objective FCE, and testimony from Dr. Haslam that he relied upon (in addition to Dr. Nylander's subjective complaints) the objective FCE results in formulating his final disability finding and work restrictions for Dr. Nylander. Finally, fourth, whether Dr. Martin's IME contradicts the FCE or Dr. Haslam's final restrictions is certainly irrelevant to the question of whether Dr. Nylander has adduced objective evidence of \"proof of loss.\" This argument merely highlights disputes of material fact about the extent of Dr. Nylander's physical disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   There is another more general basis for rejecting Defendants' overarching lack of \"objective medical evidence\" argument: namely, to require Dr. Nylander to prove that she is disabled by \"objective medical evidence\" would add a new requirement to the definition of \"disabled\" under the policies. To be totally disabled under Unum-IDI and Unum-BOE, Dr. Nylander must have an \"[i]njury or sickness [that] restricts the Insured's ability to perform the material and substantial duties of [her] regular occupation to an extent that prevents [her] from engaging in [her] regular occupation.\" (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 6; 40-3 at 7.) There is a parallel definition for residual disability. Further, Dr. Nylander must provide \"sufficient proof of loss.\" (Doc. Nos. 40-2 at 12; 40-3 at 11.) To be totally disabled under PR-IDI, Dr. Nylander must have an \"injury or sickness\" that renders her \"unable to perform the important duties of Your Occupation.\" (Doc. No. 40-4 at 7.) There is a parallel\n   definition for residual disability. Further, Dr. Nylander must provide \"satisfactory written proof of loss.\" (Doc. No. 40-4 at 17.) These policies do not condition benefits on a certain level of clinical evidence of the existence of the condition that renders a claimant disabled. To construe Dr. Nylander's policies to impose a requirement of \"objective medical evidence\" would inappropriately rewrite them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pelchat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021105075\">\n    2003 WL 21105075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In support of their arguments, Defendants cite to several cases for the broad principle that Dr. Nylander's subjective complaints are an insufficient basis for disability benefits. These ERISA cases, decided under the arbitrary and capricious standard, are unconvincing. For example, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Hartford Fin.

No. 36 at 13.) However, in\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals actually held that the insurance company did not act arbitrarily by denying benefits based on the detailed opinions of several independent medical examiners, where two of the claimant's doctors were \"unwilling to comment on her ability to work,\" and her third, most recently retained doctor offered only a conclusory statement that she could not work and described himself as an \"advocate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20Fed.%20Appx.%20444\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20Fed.%20Appx.%20444\">\n    at 450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   is not analogous to the instant case.

Again, this is not analogous to the instant case, where Dr. Nylander engaged in an extended course of treatment with Dr. Haslam, a hand surgery specialist, and obtained an FCE at his direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

A person is unemployable in a particular profession so long as she cannot perform a substantial proportion of that profession's important duties. At that point, it does not matter whether there are a few important duties that she can perform, because she will still be unable to function in that profession. The insurers' proposed interpretation appears disconnected from the risk insured against-the possibility that injury will force the insured to quit his occupation. This analysis justifies the approach of the Eighth Circuit (applying Minnesota law) and the Eleventh Circuit (applying Georgia law). Those courts have held that \" 'most' or the 'majority' of the [important] duties is ... a reasonable interpretation if an insured is unable to engage in his regular occupation as a result of his inability to perform most or the majority of those duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Giddens v.

Defendants' corporate representative testified that Dr. Nylander's surgical duties and clinical (i.e., office) duties were\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   material and substantial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-89.) Dr. Nylander has\n   taken the position that her ability as lead surgeon was the \"heart\" of her practice, it drove her clinical practice and was directly and indirectly the source of a substantial portion of her income as a gynecologist. Evidence in this case establishes that, until her injury in 2015, Dr. Nylander's practice consisted of 75% office consultations and minor office procedures and 20-25% assistant and lead surgical procedures. While the surgical procedures averaged 5-9% of Dr. Nylander's CPT billing codes, they generated 40-50% of her income. After her injury, primarily from 2016-2017, Dr. Nylander's practice consisted of office consultations, minor office procedures, and sometimes assisting Dr. Wingo with surgery. As of 2018, Dr. Nylander's practice will only consist of office consultations and minor office procedures. And there is more: (1) a significant portion of Dr. Nylander's clinical appointments were directly related to surgeries (i.e., pre-and post-operative consultations); (2) Dr. Nylander believes that she has lost existing and prospective patients because she cannot meet patients' preference for a unified provider of both clinical and surgical services; and (3) Dr. Nylander believes that other doctors will now not refer patients to her because she cannot be a lead surgeon. Dr. Nylander knows of very few, if any, existing non-surgical gynecology practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court acknowledges that Dr. Nylander's scenario is somewhat nuanced and not as straightforward as that in\n   <em>\n    Leonor\n   </em>\n   . Like the claimants in\n   <em>\n    Leonor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dowdle\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Giddens\n   </em>\n   , it appears clear that Dr. Nylander can still perform some important/material and substantial duties of her occupation (namely office consultations, minor office procedures, etc.). The strongest argument the Defendants have is that the 25% of time that Dr. Nylander spent on surgical duties does not fit \"comfortably\" along the lines of \"most important duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Leonor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273307\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/682/\">\n    790 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Overall, however, the Court concludes that Dr. Nylander's circumstances still fall within the strictures of\n   <em>\n    Leonor\n   </em>\n   , which instructs the Court to strictly construe the policies in favor of the insured and identify what is \"at the core\" of Dr. Nylander's occupation. Taking all evidence in the light most favorable to Dr. Nylander, the Court finds that she has raised a substantial issue of fact as to whether her ability to lead surgeries formed the heart of her practice. This finding is bolstered by the Court of Appeals' observation that where the \"continuum of disability\" falls might be affected by a dramatic change in a claimant's income-earning activities after her injury. Dr. Nylander estimates that, by 2018, her income from her gynecological practice is likely to have decreased by two-thirds in only three years. As just one example, in the twelve months prior to her injury, Dr. Nylander earned $84,500 from performing only two kinds of surgical procedures alone; after decades of such work experience, she is now being paid at a rate of $60.00 per hour for work only in her office. This is the type of extreme loss against that a physician would procure total disability insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perhaps even more important in this case is the Sixth Circuit's prescient recognition that \"for some occupations, a few activities that do not take up very much time might be so exceedingly important that they determine an individual's\n   ability to engage in the occupation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273307\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273307\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/682/\">\n    at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, Dr. Nylander has adduced competent evidence regarding the outsized impact of surgery on the nature and success of her practice and her ability to successfully engage in that practice after her injury. There are questions of fact as to whether Dr. Nylander's strictly clinical tasks, taken in isolation, will enable her to continue her occupation in a significant manner in the long-term.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Giddens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2783942\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/1286/#p1298\">\n    445 F.3d at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if Giddens can perform a few substantial and material duties ... his ability to perform those tasks in isolation still would not allow Giddens to continue in his real estate development occupation because he is unable to perform [those duties] ... which were the heart of his real estate occupation.\");\n   <em>\n    Dowdle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8974673\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/967/#p968\">\n    407 F.3d at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] determination of total disability does not require \"a state of absolute helplessness or inability to perform any task relating to one's employment.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8974673\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/967/#p968\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8974673\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/967/#p968\">\n    at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding office clinical practice was not substitute for surgical aspect of practice).

Defendants argue that their denial of Dr. Nylander's disability insurance claim was \"thoroughly reviewed by medical professionals and well-reasoned.\" (Doc. No. 36 at 24.) Defendants state that they relied upon (1) the IME and opinion of Dr. Martin; (2) the medical reviews by Dr. Groves and Dr. Saks; (3) the communications with Dr. Nylander; (4) the fact that Dr. Nylander was originally cleared to return to work by Dr. Haslam before he imposed work restrictions; and (5) the fact that \"[Dr. Nylander] never submitted documentation in support of a residual disability claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Dr. Nylander argues that Defendants acted in bad faith by (1) utilizing Dr. Martin, who (a) has never been a part of a gynecological practice or involved in gynecological surgery, (b) did not take any steps to determine the amount of flexion or pressure Dr. Nylander needed to use any of her surgical instruments, and (c) had no expertise to determine if Dr. Nylander could return to her surgical duties; (2) \"didn't feel it was necessary\" to hire a gynecologist to determine how Dr. Nylander's limitation would affect her practice, nor consult with a gynecologist regarding the important duties of a gynecological practice; (3) did not perform a systemic analysis of Dr. Nylander's income that was promised; and (4) reached inappropriate and conflicting conclusions regarding the important aspects of Dr. Nylander's practice.

Defendants' denials were based upon arguably legitimate grounds under the terms of\n   the policies. While Dr. Nylander has advanced the argument that the Defendants' investigation was insufficient or in the end substantively misguided, she has not, as is her burden, put forth evidence to demonstrate that it was somehow unreasonable, dishonest, negligently protracted, or fundamentally illegitimate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lance v.

Since then, she has not been able to perform any abdominal hysterectomies as lead surgeon. Similarly, in the 12 months prior to April 2015, Dr. Nylander performed about 50 surgical laparoscopies as lead surgeon. Since her injury, she has not been able to perform any surgical laparoscopies as a lead surgeon. (Doc. No. 47-5 at 5-6.) From a different perspective, in the twelve months prior to her injury, Dr. Nylander earned $84,500 from performing two kinds of lead surgical procedures (abdominal hysterectomies and LAVHs) alone.

The opportunity for me to earn income as an assistant in gynecological surgeries which I am unable to perform as the lead surgeon was unique to my relationship with my husband.

(Doc. No. 47-5 at \u00b6 25.) In addition, Dr. Nylander has income from her side business, She, LLC. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 26.) Prior to her injury, in approximately February 2015, Dr. Nylander received training in and started a separate business for female sexual health named She, LLC. She maintains that practice today, including offering laser treatments for vaginal atrophy using the \"Mona Lisa Touch\" laser. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .) In 2016, She, LLC's net revenue was $82,837, and through October 2017, She, LLC's net revenue for 2017 was $76,098.20. (Doc. No. 40-11.) Dr. Nylander has never taken a distribution from this company, but she has paid off the loan used to acquire the laser treatment unit. (Doc. No. 40-16 at 76-85.) Dr. Nylander has stated that the future of this business is unknown because the technology could become obsolete. (Doc. No. 47-5 at \u00b6 26.) In addition, Dr. Nylander believes that, as her clinical practice declines, she will meet fewer patients who can benefit from the elective services that She, LLC provides. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Defendants dispute the extent to which She, LLC is a \"separate\" business.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Dr. Nylander has also stated that: \"[W]ere it not for my husband [being a surgeon], it would be extremely difficult for me to be employed as a gynecologist.
