Plaintiffs maintain that the Graves Amendment,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , forecloses the possibility of lessor liability, and therefore, the Endorsement constitutes no insurance coverage. Before the Court are the Parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 68 and 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Infinity moves for summary judgment on the issue of whether the Endorsement provides insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 68. In support, Infinity advances six arguments: (I) Plaintiffs lack Article III standing; (II) even if the Endorsement is ambiguous, coverage exists under Florida law; (III) even under Plaintiffs' theory, coverage exists for accidents occurring in other states; (IV) Infinity has a duty to defend lessors, even against claims barred by the Graves Amendment; (V) even under Plaintiffs' theory, the remedy is not to void the Endorsement, but to ignore the exclusion or limitation that renders it illusory and find coverage; and (VI) the filed-rate doctrine bars Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment regarding Infinity's affirmative defenses on standing (defenses nos. 32, 35, 61), the filed-rate doctrine (defense no. 20), and fraudulent concealment (defense no. 9).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 56. Additionally, Plaintiffs\n   move for summary judgment on whether the Endorsement provides insurance. For the following reasons, the Court finds that the Endorsement is not illusory because Plaintiffs' interpretation of the Endorsement would render the Graves Amendment's savings clause a nullity. Moreover, the Court finds that the Endorsement imposes a duty to defend. Therefore, summary judgment is granted in Infinity's favor because there is no genuine dispute of a material fact and Infinity is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Legal Standard\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Summary judgment is authorized where there is no genuine issue of material fact.

Article III limits federal \"judicial power\" to the resolution of actual \"cases and controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. III \u00a7 2. To construe an Article III case or controversy, the plaintiff must have standing. \"[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements:\" (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact;\" (2) there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) it must be \"likely\" that the injury will be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Thus, because Plaintiffs contend that an insurance policy that protects their lessors is illusory, Infinity submits that Plaintiffs lack standing. In support, Infinity relies on a bevy of cases that hold that an insured lacks standing to challenge the enforceability of an insurance policy, unless and until the insured actually makes a claim, and the insurer denies the claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

Further, Plaintiffs submit that the line of cases Infinity relies on, confirms a court's ability to determine whether a product is valid insurance irrespective of whether a claim has been submitted or denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The standing analysis boils down to: (1) the injury Plaintiffs allegedly suffered and (2) whether that injury is sufficiently concrete and particularized-not conjectural or hypothetical-to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Plaintiffs maintain they were injured upon payment to Infinity-thereby satisfying their lessors' requirements-for an allegedly illusory Endorsement. In return, Plaintiffs became \"lessees\" and obtained possession of the leased vehicles from their lessors. Thus, Infinity posits that the premiums paid by Plaintiffs do not constitute an injury, because Plaintiffs continue to reap the benefits of their bargains-possession of the vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 68 at 6. (\"[B]ecause the Endorsement expressly covers only lessors, not Plaintiffs, any challenge to the sufficiency of the Endorsement must be brought by the lessors ...\"). Plaintiffs did receive what they bargained for, but did so at their financial expense, for an Endorsement that they allege can never trigger because it violates federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Requiring Plaintiffs to file a claim on their policies before bearing an Article III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   injury would be-at best-futile in this limited instance, because the Endorsement indemnifies entities-Plaintiffs' lessors-that do not bear the cost of the premium. Indeed, the very basis on which Plaintiffs filed this suit is the theory that the Endorsement is illusory because there is no situation in which the policy does not violate the Graves Amendment. Infinity maintains that Plaintiffs lack standing because Plaintiffs \"argue on behalf of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     third-party lessors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , who have never made a claim or had a claim denied. They never contend\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     their\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   claim was denied.\" D.E. 68 at 5. Expecting Plaintiffs to file a claim on an Endorsement that does not indemnify them is nonsensical. Conversely, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs have no standing because they have not suffered an injury, and thus, expecting their lessors to challenge the Endorsement, is similarly illogical, as the lessors are reaping the benefits-albeit through the power of contract-of being insured under an Endorsement they do not pay for. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have standing in this limited instance because they suffered concrete, cognizable injuries when they paid for an Endorsement that allegedly does not provide insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Ripeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, Infinity argues that this case is not ripe for review because it has not denied a claim. \"The ripeness doctrine protects federal courts from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the review of potential or abstract disputes.\n   <em>\n    Digital Properties, Inc. v. City of Plantation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285147\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/586/#p589\">\n    121 F.3d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (11th Cir. 1997). The case is ripe for the Court's review, notwithstanding Infinity's contention that it has yet to deny a claim, because Plaintiffs suffered a concrete injury when they paid for an insurance policy that they allege does not provide insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Endorsement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The primary contention between the Parties is whether Infinity's obligation to indemnify Plaintiffs' lessors can ever arise in a scenario that is not foreclosed by the Graves Amendment. Plaintiffs assert that under the Endorsement, the damages that a lessor becomes legally obligated to pay post-Graves (and Infinity has an obligation to indemnify), can only stem from an injury for which the insured is legally liable. Such liability, Plaintiffs submit, falls squarely within the definition of \"vicarious liability\" that Graves did away with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Endorsement states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    LESSOR LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT (Optional)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In exchange for\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   increased premium, this endorsement has been added to\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   insurance policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The provisions in this endorsement are effective only while\n   <strong>\n    the insured auto\n   </strong>\n   is leased by\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   , for a period of at least six (6) months, as documented by a standard form lease agreement with expressly stated insurance coverage requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   During the term of this policy, the limits of coverage for damages\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   became legally obligated to pay, as defined by\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   policy, shall be those limits listed on\n   <strong>\n    your Declarations Page\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The endorsement provides the following additional Liability Coverage for\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   lessor:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   This additional coverage will apply to damages\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   lessor becomes legally obligated to pay that arise from and are legally related to a loss covered under\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The coverage provided by this endorsement is in addition to that listed on\n   <strong>\n    your Declarations Page\n   </strong>\n   and is available only to indemnify\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   lessor pursuant to the terms listed herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The provision of the coverages in this endorsement shall in no event increase\n   <strong>\n    our\n   </strong>\n   limits of liability for any damages\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   become legally obligated to pay, pursuant to the terms of\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If\n   <strong>\n    we\n   </strong>\n   terminate this policy, notice will also be mailed to the lessor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The lessor is not responsible for payment of premiums.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   D.E. 44 at \u00b6 11 (emphasis in Amended Complaint).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In pertinent part, the Graves Amendment provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) In general.-An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable under the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, by reason of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner), for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) the owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030106\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Infinity claims that the Endorsement is not illusory because it insures lessors in several plausible scenarios.

For example, a Florida lessee that drives the insured vehicle into Alabama and causes an accident will be jointly and severally liable with the lessor, if the lessor is sued for negligent entrustment or negligent maintenance, because Alabama is a pure joint and several liability state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lafarge N.

Plaintiffs argue that the Endorsement does not cover a lessor's direct negligence because coverage is first limited to the \"\n   <strong>\n    damages\n   </strong>\n   that [the insured's] lessor becomes\n   <strong>\n    legally obligated to pay\n   </strong>\n   that\n   <strong>\n    arise from\n   </strong>\n   and are\n   <strong>\n    legally related to a covered loss under [the] policy\n   </strong>\n   .\" In essence, their position is that the Endorsement \"purports to cover lessor liability that causally arises from-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it is secondary to-not the lessor's own conduct (or anyone else's conduct), but an underlying loss covered under a policy.\" D.E. 81 at 16. And this purported \"vicariously liability\" coverage is what Plaintiffs suggest the Graves Amendment foreclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs' interpretation of the Endorsement would render the Graves Amendment's savings clause a nullity. It is true that the Graves Amendment preempts Florida's vicarious liability statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4234910\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/540/1242/#p1253\">\n    540 F.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (11th Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Vargas v.

Under Plaintiffs' theory, a lessor's purported liability would never arise because it would stem directly from-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"causally arise from\" or be \"secondary to\"-the actions of a lessee, and not the actions of a lessor. Plaintiffs' argument is readily analogized to the age-old adage: which came first, the chicken or the egg? That is, an automobile collision in which a lessee is at fault (first), that results in bodily injury or property damage covered under the policy, can never give rise to a claim against a lessor, because such claim amounts to vicarious liability (second), which is prohibited by the Graves Amendment. Such logic renders the Graves Amendment savings clause a nullity. The plain language of the savings clause makes clear that claims for a lessor's negligence or criminal wrongdoing are not prohibited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030106\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (\"An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle ... shall not be liable ... if ...\n   <strong>\n    there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner\n   </strong>\n   ...\") (emphasis added). The truth is, the fact that a lessor's liability under the Endorsement can-as a matter of cause and effect-only stem from the action of its lessee, does not foreclose the possibility that liability can be imposed upon the lessor for its own negligence (first), that caused a collision in which the lessee was also negligent (second).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Indeed, courts have held that negligence claims can proceed against a lessor as a result of the savings clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698565\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/451/#p457\">\n    611 F.3d at 457-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting claims for negligent maintenance and entrustment under the savings clause);\n   <em>\n    Johnke v.

Stated simply, there is no plausible scenario in which a lessor could be sued for negligence-and the plaintiff suffered an Article III injury-in-fact-without the plaintiff in such case having suffered a cognizable injury as a result of a lessee's action. Vicarious liability, as precluded by the Graves Amendment, would hold a lessor negligent for the actions of its lessee. The Endorsement does not contemplate such. To the contrary, the Endorsement indemnifies a lessor for its\n   <strong>\n    own liability\n   </strong>\n   that arises as a result of\n   <strong>\n    its own actions\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

A ruling in Plaintiffs' favor would ostensibly require the Court to disregard the plain language of the savings clause-a task too tall for this Court. Congress explicitly permitted claims of negligence and criminal wrongdoing to proceed against a lessor, not from the lessee's action, but from the action of the lessor itself. Such liability is precisely what Infinity's Endorsement endeavors to indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, Infinity argues that even if the Graves Amendment provides a complete defense to liability for\n   <strong>\n    every\n   </strong>\n   lessor in\n   <strong>\n    every\n   </strong>\n   case, it would still owe a duty to defend the lessor and raise the Graves Amendment as an affirmative defense. Plaintiffs contend, in somewhat circular fashion, that there is no duty to defend because the Endorsement is illusory.

Thus, it is plausible-rather, highly likely-for a lessor to be named as a defendant in a lawsuit. Even if Plaintiffs were correct, their position fails to take into account that the Endorsement does more than indemnify their lessors, it defends them-through the power of contract-from\n   potentially covered claims even if those claims are barred under the Graves Amendment. Post-Graves, Infinity must continue defending lessors sued for claims that are barred by the law, because inevitably, a lessor will be named as a defendant under a theory of vicarious liability, as a result of the lessee's alleged negligence. In such a case, a lessor will incur cost associated with hiring counsel that will: analyze the claims asserted and determine whether the suit is grounded in vicarious liability, and therefore foreclosed by Graves, or the savings clause, and therefore permitted to proceed against the lessor; presumably file a motion to dismiss relying on Graves as a defense if vicarious liability is asserted; and potentially defend the case on appeal.
