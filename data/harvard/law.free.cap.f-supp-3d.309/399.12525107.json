No. 101), Scottsdale has filed a Reply (Dkt. No. 106), and PLM has joined Scottsdale's arguments in reply (Dkt. No. 107). For the reasons set forth below, the six Motions to Dismiss are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a declaratory judgment action arising out of the construction of Palmetto Pointe at Peas Island, a condominium complex in Charleston, South Carolina (the \"Peas Island Project\"). Complete Building Corporation (\"Complete\") was the general\n   contractor for the Peas Island Project. Plaintiff FCCI issued commercial general liability policies and umbrella policies to Complete. The Palmetto Pointe at Peas Island Condominium Property Owners Association, Inc. (the \"Peas Island POA\") filed the underlying complaint against Complete and a number of subcontractors alleging latent construction defects that caused water intrusion and other damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FCCI is defending Complete in the underlying action. FCCI filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Complete qualifies as an additional insured under the policies Defendants issued to Complete's subcontractors and that FCCI is therefore absolved of its duty to defend Complete under the \"Other Insurance\" provision in the policies FCCI issued to Complete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"Other Insurance\" provision in the general liability policies FCCI issued to Complete provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

(Dkt. No. 84.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    FCCI also requested declarations regarding whether FCCI owes Complete coverage under FCCI's policies, and if FCCI is found to owe Complete a duty to defend or indemnify, an apportionment of the time on the risk between FCCI and other insurers which issued policies to Complete. (Dkt. No. 101 at 2.) These claims do not apply to the Defendants whose Motions to Dismiss are at issue here because they were not parties to FCCI's contracts with Complete and did not issue policies to Complete.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n    a.

Travelers, which had issued a non-profit management and organization liability policy to the insured, refused to provide a defense. Auto-Owners filed suit seeking a judicial declaration that Travelers had a duty to defend their mutual insured in the underlying lawsuit. Judge Harwell determined that although Auto-Owners had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    , it had failed to state a claim against Travelers upon which relief could be granted.\n    <em>\n     Auto-Owners,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203687338\">\n     2014 WL 3687338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4. Judge Harwell determined that the Supreme Court of South Carolina would likely find\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    that, under\n    <em>\n     Sloan\n    </em>\n    , Auto-Owners had failed to state a claim against Travelers, especially in light of the Supreme Court's observation in\n    <em>\n     Sloan\n    </em>\n    \"that the insurer seeking to compel the other insurer to defend was not damaged: 'since it was a stranger to the contract' between the other company and its insured.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. Judge Harwell said this analysis was \"equally applicable to a situation where the insurers insure different risks, and where a declaratory judgment is sought rather than contribution.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    He ultimately determined that Auto-Owners' declaratory judgment claim against Travelers failed as a matter of law because Auto-Owners was not a party to the insurance contract with Travelers.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Judge Harwell noted that the opinion of the Court of Appeals of South Carolina in\n    <em>\n     Askins\n    </em>\n    supports this conclusion.\n    <em>\n     Id. at *4 ;\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Shelby Mut.

Ct. App. 1992) (\"Fundamental to the concept of duty to defend is the requirement that the party seeking the defense must be an insured under a contract of insurance.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Applying\n    <em>\n     Sloan\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Auto-Owners\n    </em>\n    , this Court finds that FCCI has failed to state a declaratory judgment claim against any of the six moving Defendants. As was the case in\n    <em>\n     Auto-Owners\n    </em>\n    , FCCI is not a party to any contract between a moving Defendant and one of Complete's subcontractors under which it alleges that Complete qualifies as an additional insured. For this reason, FCCI cannot compel any moving Defendant to fulfill an alleged duty to defend Complete under those contracts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    FCCI repeatedly insists that \"is not seeking a declaration requiring another carrier to defend Complete,\" but rather seeks this Court's declaratory judgment to interpret the \"other insurance\" clause in\n    its own policy. (Dkt. No. 101 at 6.) FCCI admits, however that it seeks to determine \"whether Complete qualifies as an additional insured under one or more of its subcontractors' policies, whether such policies include a duty to defend, and whether any coverage is primary.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5.) FCCI claims that if its \"policies are excess, then FCCI has the right to elect not to continue to defend Complete.\" (Dkt. No. 101 at 5.) The plain language of the contract does not confer that right upon FCCI. The contract provides that, \"If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured's rights against all those insurers.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 25-26.) For this reason, even if this Court issued the requested declaration-that Complete qualifies as an additional insured under one of the subcontractor's policies-that declaration would not be sufficient for FCCI to obtain the relief it seeks because it has contracted to defend Complete if \"no other insurer defends,\" and, under\n    <em>\n     Auto-Owners\n    </em>\n    , cannot compel the moving Defendants to defend Complete in the underlying suit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    A court should only grant a declaratory judgment \"when the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling legal relations in issue, and when it will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     Centennial Life Ins.

A court should not grant a declaratory judgment when doing so would \"try a controversy by piecemeal[ ] or [would] try particular issues without settling the entire controversy.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 257 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Quarles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1014441,1014719\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/92/321/\">\n     92 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    325 ). For the reasons discussed above, FCCI's declaratory judgment claim against the moving Defendants is subject to dismissal because it cannot afford FCCI the relief it seeks-release from its duty to defend Complete. In the alternative, to the extent FCCI argues in earnest that it does not seek to compel the moving Defendants to defend Complete but seeks only this Court's interpretation of its obligations to Complete, then the declaratory judgment claim against the moving Defendants is subject to dismissal because there is no \"actual controversy\" between FCCI and these Defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Indemnification\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    No factual findings have been made in the underlying lawsuit, so a determination of whether any party has a duty to indemnify is not ripe for this Court's consideration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London v.

Feb. 13, 2017) (Observing that, generally, a determination of whether an insurer has an affirmative duty to indemnify is not ripe for adjudication until factual findings are made in the underlying lawsuit.)

FCCI seeks to dismiss certain parties from the lawsuit, replace improperly identified parties, and add additional information, but says it does not seek to advance any new legal theories. Because FCCI's claims against the six moving Defendants are subject to dismissal under South Carolina law and Fourth Circuit precedent, FCCI's pending Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint is denied without prejudice. FCCI may file a new motion for leave to\n    amend after considering this Order and conferring with opposing counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     V.
