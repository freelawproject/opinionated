It argues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, Exemptions 1 and 3 apply to CIA's provision of the five emails in question to a select group of reporters. Exemption 1 applies because the material redacted from the five emails that are the subject of this litigation is classified. And Exemption 3 applies because The National Security Act, grants the CIA \"broad discretion\" and \"sweeping power\" to protect intelligence sources and methods, and to do whatever may be necessary, in CIA's discretion, to exercise that power. National Security Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1(i)(1)(2013). The Supreme Court has thus recognized that the NSA authorizes the CIA to undertake limited and selective disclosure of information that may lead to the identity of intelligence sources when it is in the national interest to do so-including specifically when such disclosure is necessary in order not to compromise the agency's carrying out of its mission.\n   <em>\n    CIA v.

The full content of the emails is known only to the sender (CIA's Office of Public Affairs) and the recipients (the journalists who received the emails, and perhaps certain of their colleagues at their respective newspapers). CIA notes that the so-called public domain doctrine-pursuant to which materials ordinarily immunized from disclosure lose their \"protective cloak\" when they are both \"disclosed\" to persons not ordinarily authorized to see that information and \"preserved in a permanent public record,\" (\n   <em>\n    Afshar v.

In each of those cases, limited disclosure that went no further than the party to whom disclosure was made was held not to waive the protections of FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, the very exemptions invoked in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiff's Argument in Support of His Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff was given an opportunity to respond to the Government's brief. Plaintiff himself filed a two page, single spaced letter brief. However, he enlisted the assistance of five parties who engage frequently in FOIA litigation against the CIA: The Government Accountability Project, Government Information Watch, National Security Counselors, the New Venture Fund (d/b/a Demand Progress), and the Project on Government Oversight. Collectively, these institutions sought leave to appear in this case as\n   <em>\n    amici curiae\n   </em>\n   , and to file a brief in support of Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and opposition to the CIA's motion. In this instance,\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   truly are acting as \"friends of the court,\" as they have a wealth of experience in this type of litigation and were able to make more sophisticated arguments on Plaintiff's behalf than he did himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's and\n   <em>\n    Amicis\n   </em>\n   ' position can be summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, they agree that the National Security Act authorizes limited disclosure of otherwise protected information in particular instances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brief of\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   at 6). That being so, it is undisputed that CIA could ordinarily rely on Exemption 3 to bar disclosure of the withheld material:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Exemption 3 differs from other FOIA exemptions in that its applicability depends less on detailed factual contents of specific documents, the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of the withheld material within the statute's coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Association of Retired R.R.

They thus contend that CIA's Exemption 3 protection-like any other exemption from FOIA disclosure-is waivable. I think it is fair to say that the Government has not here argued to the contrary; rather, as indicated above, it argues that FOIA protection has not been waived, because the selective disclosure described above is not disclosure to the public generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, Plaintiff and Amici contend that the CIA has indeed waived its right to rely on the applicable FOIA exemptions, because it chose to send the confidential information to the journalists in emails, instead of bringing them in for an oral briefing or a show-and-tell. This, they urge, means that CIA caused the information so disclosed to be \"preserved in a permanent public record,\" thereby losing its \"protective cloak.\" They argue-correctly-that in all of the cases cited by the Government, as well as in additional cases cited by\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   , the disclosed information was conveyed to the authorized recipients either by telling it to them or by showing it to them. In no instance were the recipients able to retain permanent copies of exactly what was disclosed to them in their files. Here, by contrast, CIA deliberately sent the emails to selected reporter-recipients at their email addresses at three major newspapers. Nothing would have prevented the reporter-recipients of those emails from printing them out, sharing them on screen or in print form with others, and preserving them on their computers. That, they urge, is a difference that makes a difference, because it created a \"permanent public record\" of the disclosed information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court will begin by summarizing the principal cases discussing the public disclosure doctrine; I will then analyze the principles thus disclosed to the first-impression facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Public Disclosure Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Courts, including specifically this one, have long recognized that information could not remain classified after it had been \"specifically revealed to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamont v.

However, what we now call the \"public disclosure doctrine\" has been developed over four decades principally by the courts in the District of Columbia Circuit, which (at least until recently) have handled the lion's share of FOIA cases addressed to the CIA and other Executive Branch agencies involved in the national security arena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   One thing comes through from reading those cases from oldest to newest: the courts most often entrusted with applying Exemptions 1 and 3 to the CIA have bent over backwards to protect CIA and sister agencies (principally the Departments of Justice and State) from having to disclose anything that the CIA deems to fall within the ambit of the term \"intelligence sources and methods.\" As a result, the courts have heavily circumscribed what action on the part of CIA officials could possibly constitute a waiver of Exemptions 1 and 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As discussed in the January 19 Order, the two \"Glomar Explorer\" cases-\n   <em>\n    Military Audit Project v.

That, of course, is more or less what happened here-with the key factual twist identified by Plaintiff and Amici.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the years that followed the Glomar Explorer cases, the courts have had an opportunity to flesh out this principle more thoroughly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Afshar v.

Plaintiff argued that the agencies had waived the right to rely on FOIA exemptions (including specifically Exemption 3 for the CIA) because \"substantially the same information\" that he believed was contained in those documents was already in the public domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ashfar's request for disclosure of the documents was rejected. After noting that FOIA \"bars courts from prying loose even the smallest bit of information that is properly classified or would disclose intelligence\n   sources and methods\" (\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640642,1847947\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1125/\">\n    702 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1130 ), the D.C.

And in each of these cases, that fact was determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Students Against Genocide (SAGE) v.

C. Cir. 2001), the information at issue consisted of intelligence photographs, some of which had been as shown in confidence to members of the United Nations Security Council. SAGE received two such photographs in response to a FOIA request, but fourteen others were withheld by the Department of States. SAGE argued both that the Government had waived the right to withhold the fourteen photographs by showing them to United Nations delegates whose governments were at the time members of the Security Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    SAGE\n   </em>\n   court held, in line with such precedents as\n   <em>\n    Military Audit\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cottone,\n   </em>\n   that the public disclosure of two of the photographs did not waive the relevant\n   exemptions (1 and 3) with respect to others. And it concluded that showing the photographs to the U.N delegates did not make them available to the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its decision, the court placed great store on the fact that the photographs were not \"released\" at all, but were simply displayed to the members of the Security Council. This was deemed particularly important because the context of this display made it unlikely that the technical capabilities of the reconnaissance systems that took the photographs could be compromised, because they were seen only briefly and by persons who did not themselves possess the technical expertise to perform such analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To SAGE's argument that the disclosure of the photographs to hostile foreign governments-the very parties against whom the statutory exemption was intended to protect-vitiated the danger of disclosing them to the American public, the court responded that it saw nothing unreasonable about the government's contention that it might have affirmative foreign policy reasons for sharing sensitive information with some governments (including unfriendly governments) and not others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The next step along this path came a decade later, in\n   <em>\n    Muslim Advocates v.

There, the FBI showed a document known as the Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG) to a small number of representatives from civil rights and civil liberties groups. The representatives were not allowed to keep copies of the records they were shown, but they were permitted to take notes. The session lasted for about two hours, which should be enough time to take quite a few notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But because they felt they did not have time to take sufficiently extensive notes, the civil liberties groups filed a FOIA request for disclosure of the DIOG. When it was withheld citing Exemption 7(E) (records compiled for law enforcement purposes), they (understandably) argued waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   They lost. The court specifically held that the fact that the documents disclosed had to be returned at the end of the meeting, and so were not otherwise available to the plaintiffs and the general public, meant that the limited disclosure described above did not rise to the level of \"public\" disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The fact that the representatives were permitted to take notes about the documents they were shown was held not to create a \"permanent public record\" of the contents of the documents, because the plaintiff had produced (and could produce) no evidence that the specific information being withheld from them could be found in the notes that were taken by the participants. The court's conclusion in this regard rested on the fact that underlay the lawsuit-the people who had reviewed the documents and taken the notes were complaining that they had not been given an adequate opportunity to conduct a \"rigorous examination\" of their contents, and that two hours with the documents was not sufficient to conduct \"a meaningful review.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131682\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/92/#p101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 101 ) Judge Sullivan wrote, \"As the participants in the November meetings lacked sufficient time for a 'rigorous examination' or 'meaningful review' of the disputed chapters, the Court is not persuaded-absent some evidence to the contrary-that the note-taking participants assembled a permanent public record that 'duplicates that being withheld.' \"\n   <em>\n    Muslim Advocates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131682\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/92/#p101\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (citing\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817177,11311285\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/198/\">\n    11 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   201 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even the fact that the FBI eventually published portions of the DIOG on its web site did not constitute a waiver of FOIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Exemption 7(E), because Plaintiffs could not demonstrate that there was any public record of the portions of the document that had not been publicly posted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch v.

In each of the cases discussed above, it was impossible for the plaintiff to know (or, at least in the\n   <em>\n    Muslim Advocates\n   </em>\n   case, to show) exactly what information had been shared with outsiders. Therefore, most plaintiffs who have tried to jump the first hurdle of the\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   test have failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   And the plaintiff must also demonstrate that that precise information he seeks is in the \"public domain.\" Moreover, courts have very narrowly construed what constitutes the \"public domain,\" thereby creating \"safe harbors\" within which the Director can carry out his statutory duty of protecting intelligence sources and methods via selective disclosure without fear of waiving his FOIA protection. In particular, courts have repeatedly held that, for purposes of the public disclosure doctrine, simply showing or conveying classified or statutorily protected information to third parties, but not allowing them to retain the disclosed information (at least, not in a form that is\n   <em>\n    in haec verba\n   </em>\n   with what was disclosed), does not cause the information to enter the \"public domain.\" This may not be the most obvious or logical understanding of what \"public disclosure\" means, but it has taken root in the FOIA case law-especially FOIA case law relating to the CIA, which enjoys a very special and highly protected status among federal intelligence sources and methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, however, we have something like a \"perfect storm\" of a case-a situation in which the CIA appears to have ignored every safe harbor the courts have afforded it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As regards the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   test for \"public disclosure\" or \"official acknowledgement,\" this plaintiff-in contrast to all of the plaintiffs discussed above except SAGE and Salvatore Cottone-has been able both to identify the exact information that he wants, and to match it with information that was previously disclosed, in an admittedly authorized disclosure, to the \"favored\" reporters. That is because CIA has identified it for him, by producing to him, in redacted form, the emails identified in this record as Sun Ex. C, D, E, F and G (ECF Document # 17). Those emails, without redactions, were sent to the reporters at their workplace email addresses by the CIA's Office of Public Affairs. CIA concedes as much. There can be no dispute that whatever is blacked out from the emails that were produced to Johnson in response to his FOIA request is the exact information that was sent to Scott Shane, David Ignatius and Siobhan Gorman. Johnson wants nothing more-and nothing less-than what is underneath those redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   So thanks to CIA, Johnson is able-as so many plaintiffs before him were unable-to identify with precision the information he is seeking, and to match it with information that was disclosed to others by the Agency. The fact that he does not already have a hard copy of that information, and so does not know what it says under those black marks, does not mean that he has failed to meet his burden under the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   test, because\n   <em>\n    Cottone\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that Johnson need not have a hard copy or be able to quote the contents of the documents he seeks (if he could, he would not need to invoke FOIA) in order to meet his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But that only gets plaintiff halfway home. Johnson must also prove that the information he seeks resides in the \"public domain.\" Put otherwise, he must show that there exists a \"permanent public record\" of the information that was selectively disclosed. It is to that much more interesting question that I now turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The linchpin of all the \"safe harbor\" decisions discussed above is what we used to call \"plausible deniability.\" When grappling with the possibility of waiver\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   selective and limited disclosure of classified information, courts clearly outlined a way for Government officials dealing with national security and foreign affairs material to have their cake and eat it, too. They could make disclosures to third parties when the Director deemed it necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods, and they could do so without waiving their right to invoke relevant FOIA exemptions, as long as they did so in a way that created no permanent record outside the confines of the agency of exactly what was disclosed (exactly meaning, literally, \"\n   <em>\n    in haec verba\n   </em>\n   \"). In that way, the courts could never be entirely sure that whatever \"public\" record did exist (the notes taken by the people who were briefly shown the records at issue in\n   <em>\n    Muslim Advocates\n   </em>\n   , for example) was the \"specific information\" that had been disclosed previously. This bit of sophistry allowed the courts deny FOIA requests on the basis discussed in\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487083\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/171/#p186\">\n    586 F.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 (2d Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, Johnson argues that CIA has managed to create the elusive permanent public record, because the information was disclosed to certain reporters (who are, of course, members of the public), not by showing it to them, but by sending it to them in a manner that allowed them to keep it. For Plaintiff and\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   , that is the difference that makes a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In this case, unlike in previous cases, the reporter-recipients did not have to rely on their memories of conversations, or on notes quickly taken in a secure room; they got copies of the information in their email inboxes. Whatever understanding they may have reached with the CIA about how they would treat the disclosed information (about which the record is entirely silent), the reporters were presumably able to do what they liked with what they received: read the emails on screen-maybe even on their tablets or cell phones, print them out, forward the electronic versions to other recipients, or share any printed copies with others. This, Plaintiff insists means that the CIA has managed to create the \"permanent public record\" necessary to bring the selective dissemination of otherwise-exempt information within the ambit of the public disclosure doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   I cannot deny the allure of Johnson's argument. I do think the CIA was careless in this instance-especially given the generosity of courts in making sure that the Agency had a safe harbor within which it could do what the Director deemed needful without jeopardizing its\n   right to rely on the relevant FOIA exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nonetheless, I conclude that Plaintiff has not satisfied the virtually insuperable burden of demonstrating the existence of a permanent public record that the case law imposes on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, assuming arguendo that disclosure by sending emails to the reporter-recipients placed the emails in the public domain, Plaintiff offers the court no proof that the emails \"remain\" in the public domain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882258\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/963/6/#p12\">\n    963 F.Supp.2d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519352,3499688\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/1276/\">\n    968 F.2d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no evidence that the reporter-recipients of the emails Plaintiff seeks have retained copies of those emails-that the emails still exist in unredacted form anywhere except at CIA headquarters. For all we know, the emails were never printed out, never forwarded to anyone, never copied, and were deleted after reading by the reporter-recipients-sent to trash and trash emptied. Plaintiff certainly has not proven otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But of course we all know (to our sorrow) that email lasts forever. Efforts to rid oneself of all evidence of an unwanted or unwise communication sent\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   email is destined to fail; this because somewhere, in some electronic cloud, there exist pulses that can be reconstructed-whether by information technology professionals in the private sector or working for law enforcement, or even by nefarious hackers-into the original messages. Does this mean that the fact that emails were admittedly sent from the CIA to the reporter-recipients automatically creates a permanent public record of those messages?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This seems to be a matter of first impression, but the answer has to be no. Even though the emails in this case will reside for all eternity on the servers-the public, non-secure servers-of the three receiving newspapers, I do not believe that the CIA has created a permanent public record of its authorized disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For something to be \"public,\" it has to, in some sense, be accessible to members of the general public. Assuming arguendo that the emails are as deleted as they can possibly be, the electronic impulses that can be used to reconstruct \"copies\" of the emails are not accessible to the general public. Even on those non-secure servers, they can be accessed only by (1) the intended recipients of those email messages (i.e., the three reporters); and (2)\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   users, such as IT professionals who work with and for the recipient newspapers, and who have both the ability and the authority to recover those emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Any other member of the public who wanted to obtain a copy of the unredacted emails from the servers of the\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   and the Journal would have to steal that copy from the newspapers, by breaking into servers on which they are not authorized users and reconstructing and downloading messages that they are not authorized to receive. The cases cited above may not have dealt with information conveyed over the internet-indeed, many of them were decided before there was an internet-but no case suggests that the possibility of theft of confidential information by an unauthorized individual places that information in the public domain. Simply asserting that proposition reveals its fallaciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For as long as there has been FOIA litigation, there existed the possibility that confidential information kept by the Government could be stolen out of a locked filing cabinet by a faithless employee, or by a spy who managed to infiltrate the location where it was kept. Today locked filing cabinets are becoming passe, but an unauthorized user who wanted to find out what was under the redactions in those\n   five emails could, were he capable of doing so, hack into the CIA's \"secure\" server (from which the emails were sent) and download and publish unredacted copies of the messages. But disclosure of information obtained from the Government in this manner would not waive the Government's FOIA protection, because it would not be an \"authorized\" disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I fail to see why the fact that the information exists in electronic form on some private organization's server, which server can theoretically be hacked by an unauthorized user, should be treated any differently. If the only way that information can be seen by the general public is by stealing it from an authorized recipient, logic dictates that the information is not available to the general public-it is not \"in the public domain.\" Plaintiff and Amici make a good deal out of the fact that the newspapers' servers are not secure servers, but I do not believe that the security level of a sending or receiving server makes the slightest difference to the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   So Plaintiff fails because he is unable to demonstrate that the information he seeks resides today in the public domain; assuming, for purposes of argument, that the CIA's decision to email the information to the reporters placed it there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   There is another reason why one cannot conclude that these particular emails are in the public domain. Even if there were a copy of the emails in the files of Mr. Shane or Mr. Ignatius or Ms. Gorman, or even if the reporter-recipients could still readily call up the full text on their computers, there is no evidence in the record that any member of the public could walk into the offices of the Times or the WaPo or the WSJ and demand to see a copy. For that matter, there is no evidence that anyone could obtain the information\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   service of a subpoena on the reporter-recipients. This court would be shocked if the three eminent news organizations whose employees received these emails did not fight tooth and nail against any effort to make them public; and as I understand matters, the law is on their side. If that were not so, Johnson would not be asking the CIA to disclose the redacted information; he would be suing the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In short, selective disclosure of protectable information to an organ of the press, which guards the privacy of its own sources and methods as zealously as does the CIA, in circumstances like the circumstances of this case, and for the reasons offered by the Director in camera to this court, does not create a \"truly public\" record of that information.\n   <em>\n    Niagara Mohawk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11754883,3668839\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/16/\">\n    169 F.3d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cited in\n   <em>\n    Cottone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">\n    193 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The public disclosure doctrine \"is premised upon the logic that a FOIA exemption can no longer serve its purpose when there is a permanent public record of the requested information,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Muslim Advocates,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131682\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/92/#p101\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131682\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/92/#p101\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 101, n.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Cottone,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">\n    193 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the CIA's carelessness in not ensuring that every copy of the information it disclosed remained within its custody-thereby giving it the benefit of a carefully crafted \"safe harbor\" that has long been recognized by the courts-the plaintiff in this case and the Amici that support his quest have not proven that there exists a permanent public record of the information they are requesting.
