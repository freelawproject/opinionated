[Doc. No. 24]. The motion is fully briefed. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant manufactures Raisonets candy. The products are regularly sold at grocery stores, convenience stores, and other food retail outlets throughout Missouri and the rest of the United States. Plaintiff bought an opaque, non-pliable, cardboard box of Raisonets for about $1.59 apiece at a Walgreens store in Rolla, Missouri, for his personal, family, or household purposes. His lawsuit focuses on Defendant's packaging of the candies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Consumers spend an average of 13 seconds making an in-store purchasing decision. The decision is heavily dependent on a product's packaging, in particular, the package dimensions. When faced with a large box and a smaller box, both containing the same amount of product, a consumer is more likely to choose the larger one, thinking it is a better value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The dimensions of a Raisonets box are 3 ?? x\n   <sup>\n    11\n   </sup>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    16\n   </sub>\n   ? x 6\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    16\n   </sub>\n   ?. The front of the box includes the description, \"California Raisins\n   covered in chocolate.\" The front of the box also states: \"NET WEIGHT 3.5 OZ (99.2 g)\"; \"190 CALORIES\"; \"5 g SAT FAT\"; \"15 mg SODIUM\"; and \"28 g SUGARS\" per \u00bc cup. About 45% of each box has \"slack filled,\" or empty, space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she \"attached importance\" to the \"size\" of the Raisonets boxes, and was misled to believe that she was \"purchasing more Product than was actually received.\" She alleges that boxes are \"uniformly under-filled\" or \" 'slack-filled,' \"; the slack-filled space serves no purpose; and had she known the boxes were \"substantially slack-filled,\" she would not have purchased the products or would have purchased them on different terms. She alleges that she \"suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of Defendant's unlawful conduct because the actual value of the Products as purchased was less than the value of the Products as represented.\" Plaintiff alleges that she \"would...likely purchase the Products in the future if the Products complied with applicable laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit as a putative class action. In Count I, she claims a violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (MMPA) for a Missouri Consumer Subclass, and she requests injunctive relief and damages under the statute. Count II is a claim for unjust enrichment brought on behalf of All Classes (class members in all states who purchased the products), in which Plaintiff requests restitution or disgorgement of Defendant's economic enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant argues that Count I must be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to state a claim under the MMPA and has no standing to seek injunctive relief. Defendant also argues that argues that Count II must be dismissed because it is derivative of her legally insufficient MMPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

For example, under 15 C.S.R. \u00a7 60-9.020(1), \"deception\" is defined as \"any method, act, use, practice, advertisement or solicitation that has the tendency or capacity to mislead, deceive or cheat, or that tends to create a false impression.\" Under 15 C.S.R. \u00a7 60-9.030(1), \"Deceptive Format,\" \"[i]t is deception for any person in an advertisement or sales presentation to use any format which because of its overall appearance has the tendency or capacity to mislead consumers.\" Another rule, 15 C.S.R. \u00a7 60-9.070(1), defines \"misrepresentation\" as \"an assertion not in accord with the facts[.]\" The rules further provide that reliance and intent are not elements that must be proven to establish deception or misrepresentation for purposes of \u00a7 407.020(1). \u00a7 60-9.020(2) and \u00a7 60-9.070(2). The regulation concerning \"unfair practice[s]\" provides that proof of deception, fraud, or misrepresentation is not required. 15 C.S.R. \u00a7 60-8.020(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court's focus is on what is alleged in a plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's packaging, containing slack-filled space, misled her to believe that the boxes contained more candy than they actually did, and that Defendant's conduct constituted the act, use or employment of deception, fraud, false pretenses, false promises, misrepresentation, unfair practices and the concealment, suppression, or omission of any material facts in connection with the sale of advertisement of their products, in violation of the MMPA. She also alleges that the actual value of the product he purchased was less than the value of the product as represented by the packaging. More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that consumers spend an average of 13 seconds making an in-store purchasing decision. The decision is heavily dependent on a product's packaging, in particular, the package dimensions. When given a choice, consumers are more likely to choose larger boxes, thinking they are a better value. Defendant makes its candy boxes from opaque, non-pliable cardboard. Defendant fills the boxes such that 45% of a box of Raisonets is empty. The empty, or slack-filled, space in the boxes serves no purpose, such as protection of the contents. The slack-filled space is not attributable to settling of the contents. Nothing prevents Defendant from placing more candy in the boxes, or reducing the size of the boxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As discussed above, consumer protection is paramount under the MMPA and its prohibitions are construed broadly. The Missouri Supreme Court has explained that an \"unfair practice\" under the MMPA covers every unfair practice imaginable and every unfairness, to whatever degree. Practices made unlawful by the act are also broadly defined by regulation, such as deception, which is any practice having the tendency or capacity to mislead, deceive, cheat, or create a false impression; or misrepresentation, which is an assertion not in accord with the facts. A plaintiff need not even allege or prove reliance on an unlawful practice to state a claim under the act. Defendant's candy boxes are opaque and non-pliable, and a reasonable consumer could conclude that the size of a box suggests the amount of candy in it. Larger packages are attractive to consumers, and consumers tend to make their purchasing decision in 13 seconds. Yet there is 45% non-functional, slack-filled space in a Raisonets's box. Plaintiff has plausibly alleged, at minimum, that the packaging unfairly suggests the boxes contain more product than they actually do, or tends to\n   or has the capacity to mislead consumers or to create a false impression, which is sufficient for purposes of alleging an unlawful practice under the MMPA. The Court cannot conclude as a matter of law and at this stage of the litigation that the packaging is not misleading.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Regardless of whether Plaintiff may prove her MMPA claim by pointing to such violation, an issue that has not been fully briefed by both parties at this time, the existence of the Federal prohibition against slack-fill supports the reasonableness of a consumer's belief that the package of candy she purchases will not have 45% non-functional slack-fill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that a reasonable consumer, upon picking up the Raisonets' container, would instantly realize that it is not filled to the brim: with each movement of the package, its contents noticeably and audibly \"maraca-like rattle. No such allegations are in Defendant's complaint, which is the pleading that controls for purposes of Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent that Defendant's statements are couched as facts, they are not facts of which the Court may take judicial notice. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), the Court may take judicial notice of a \"fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it ... can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Such facts \"can include[,]\" for example, \"well-established scientific theories and principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Defendant points to no authority demonstrating that its statements are not subject to reasonable dispute because they can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, nor is the Court aware of such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, Defendant's statement that a reasonable consumer would instantly realize upon picking up a box that it is not filled to the brim because the contents rattle does not go to what Plaintiff has alleged. Plaintiff has alleged that the boxes are substantially empty, have substantial, non-functional slack-fill, and have an amount of slack-fill that cannot be justified; that industry-standard machines are capable of filling and enclosing the boxes with far less slack-fill; and that the level of fill can certainly be increased. She does not allege that the boxes should be filled to the brim, let alone that the packaging is misleading because the contents do not rattle. Nonetheless, even in the context of what Plaintiff has alleged, whether a reasonable consumer would notice rattling in the 13-second course of making the purchasing decision and what a consumer would make of it, let alone instantly conclude the boxers are as much as much as 45% slack-filled, are questions of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition, Defendant's statement that \"some\" empty space in the boxes is related to \"efficient manufacturing and distribution\" is at odds with Plaintiff's allegation that the slack-filled space in the boxes takes up as much as 45% of the box's space, that the slack-filled space serves no purpose and is not related to the settling of the contents, and that nothing about the manufacturing process prevents Defendant from filling the boxes fuller. To the extent that Defendant disputes these allegations, such dispute cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant further argues that the clear and accurate labeling on the packages-net weight, number of pieces of candy per serving, and number of servings per box-is fatal to Plaintiff's claim because it tells a consumer how much candy is in the box. The Missouri Court of Appeals recently rejected an analogous argument in\n   <em>\n    Murphy.\n   </em>\n   That case involved a consumer's claim under the MMPA against the manufacturer of a muffin mix that was labelled \"all natural.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177324\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/308/#p311\">\n    503 S.W.3d at 312-313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The package's ingredient label, placed there pursuant to federal law, disclosed that the product contained sodium acid pyrophosphate. The manufacturer argued that the label's ingredient disclosure entitled it to dismissal. But the court \"expressly reject[ed] the notion that the 'ingredient list' defense asserted by [the defendant] defeat[ed] [the plaintiff's] claim as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177324\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/308/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177324\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/308/#p311\">\n    at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   court further held that a reasonable consumer would expect that the ingredient list comported with the representations on the packaging, and that in any event, the manufacturer was in the superior position to know and understand the ingredients in the product, and whether they comported with the packaging.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177324\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/308/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court held that the allegations were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The \"all natural\" package labelling in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   is analogous to the information suggested to consumers by the dimensions of Defendant's opaque, non-pliable cardboard boxes. As discussed above, the dimensions of the boxes can suggest to reasonable consumers how much candy is in them, and consumers tend to choose larger packages, thinking they are a better value. Consumers also tend to make their purchasing decision in about 13 seconds. Following the\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   rationale, a reasonable consumer would expect the candy box's' labeling information to comport with the dimensions of the box and it is Defendant that is in the superior position to know whether the dimensions do. In other words, similar to the\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   scenario, the question of whether a consumer would figure out, from the labeling information and in the 13 seconds spent making a purchasing decision, that the box contained 45% slack-filled space rather than the amount suggested by the dimensions of the box goes to reasonableness, which is a question of fact. Moreover, Defendant's narrow focus and emphasis on the net weight, number of pieces of candy per serving, and servings per box, as printed on the boxes, overlooks that the Court must consider the plausibility of the complaint as a whole, not the plausibility of each individual allegation.\n   <em>\n    Zoltek,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686729\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/893/\">\n    592 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   896 n.4.
