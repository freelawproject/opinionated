The courts have found that primary care physicians are able to provide opinions on mental impairments. Specifically, \"it is well established that primary care physicians (those in family or general practice) 'identify and treat the majority of Americans' psychiatric disorders.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sprague v.

Generally, benefits may be awarded immediately \"if all essential factual issues have been resolved and the record adequately establishes a plaintiff's entitlement to benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Faucher v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830367\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/171/#p176\">\n    17 F.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (6th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

The Court may only award benefits where proof of disability is strong and opposing evidence is lacking in substance, so that remand would merely involve the presentation of cumulative evidence, or where proof of disability is overwhelming.\n   <em>\n    Faucher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830367\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/171/#p176\">\n    17 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   176 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felisky v.

In this case, evidence of disability is not overwhelming. Therefore, a remand for further proceedings is proper.
