(\"Quantum\") brings this patent infringement action against defendants Charter Communications, Inc. and Spectrum Management Holding Company, LLC (together, \"Charter\"). Quantum alleges infringement of three of its patents that relate to the pairing of \"secondary\" advertising content based upon a user's real-time selection of \"primary\" content or upon other data, so as to result in a customized presentation of content and dependent advertising to the user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court now is Charter's motion to dismiss this action for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Charter argues that Quantum's three patents are drawn to patent-ineligible subject matter and are thus invalid under \u00a7 101 of the Patent Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the following reasons, the Court holds that Quantum's three patents at issue claim as their inventions no more than the abstract idea of custom advertising, including when advertising is directed to a user based upon qualities of the user, such as the user's selection of other content. The Court therefore grants Charter's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

These claims disclose as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the '626 Patent :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. A system for providing secondary content for inclusion in video content, the system comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a consumer device comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   at least one network connector for receiving secondary content selected based on targeted criteria and for receiving (a) video content having at least one vacancy, and (b)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   information relating to the video content, wherein the information relating to the video content includes one or more attributes associated with the at least one vacancy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   at least one storage device for storing the secondary content and information relating to the secondary content, wherein the information relating to the secondary content includes one or more attributes; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   at least one processor for inserting the secondary content to fill the at least one vacancy of the video content, wherein the insertion is based on matching the one or more attributes associated with the at least one vacancy with the one or more attributes of the information relating to the secondary content; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   at least one server interface for transferring the video content and the secondary content to the consumer device;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   wherein the consumer device outputs the secondary content within the at least one vacancy of the video content.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   '626 Patent, cl. 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Claim 1 of each of the other two patents, the '228 Patent and the '136 Patent, are quite similar, with the '228 Patent being a narrower invention subsumed by the '136 Patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The narrowing is accomplished by the use of two servers in the '228 Patent, one for the storage and selection of secondary digital video advertisements and another for the transmission of a primary content digital video program. The '136 Patent differs in that while it could utilize the same configuration of two servers as described in the '228 Patent, it does not require precisely two servers, but instead could use additional servers. Both patents use a \"network\" and \"network connectors\" to connect the servers to a \"consumer device,\" which inserts the secondary advertising into the vacancies contained within the primary content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As such, both patents differ from the '626 Patent in that the \"consumer device\" in the '228 and '136 Patents does not contain a \"storage device\" for storing secondary advertising content. In the '626 Patent, the \"processor\" of the consumer device draws from such a device to select secondary advertising content based upon attributes evaluated in a selection function and inserts that secondary content into primary content vacancies. Instead, in the '228 Patent, the secondary advertising content is delivered to the consumer device over a network from a \"second server,\" in which a \"storage device\" of secondary advertising content is located. And in the '136 Patent, it is delivered over a network from at least one \"second server\" that transmits the selected secondary advertising content to the consumer device. In both the '228 and '136 Patents, the selection of the particular secondary advertising content is accomplished in the \"second server\" (the '228 Patent discloses a \"processor\" in the second server for this function), while the processor in the consumer device in both the '228 and '136 Patents is used for insertion of the already selected secondary advertising content into the primary content vacancies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Claim 1 of the '136 Patent is thus broader and discloses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1.

That is because there is no \"distinctive significance of any claim limitations other than those included\" in claim 1 of each patent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs of Tex., LLC v.

Br. at 14. But the Court's evaluation of the claims reveals that, beyond claim 1 of each patent, they do not differ meaningfully in manners relevant to the \u00a7 101 inquiry. For example, the dependent claims at most recite additional specified arrangements of types of generic attributes that might be considered in the selection of secondary content.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '136 Patent, cls. 7-8 (providing for use of \"age and physical location of the consumer\" as part of the \"demographic information for selecting the at least one digital video advertisement\"). Nor are the differences among the representative claims meaningful within the context of the \u00a7 101 inquiry. All-albeit through seemingly differing arrangements of types of generic devices-implement the same idea of customizing advertising based upon other criteria, such as a user's selection of primary content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Quantum notes, for example, that claim 1 of the '136 Patent\"calls for comparing targeted criteria to attributes of the ads, which is not in claim 1 of the '626 Patent,\" which calls for \"insertion based on matching of attributes of [the] vacancy with attributes 'of the information relating to the secondary content,' which is not in claim 1 of the '136 or '228 Patent.\" Pl. Br. at 14-15 (quoting '626 Patent, cl. 1). But this purported distinction does not supply a persuasive basis to treat the claims as meaningfully different. Each in substance calls for the comparing of various types of criteria to either (in Quantum's words) \"attributes of the ads\" (the '136 Patent ) or \"information relating to the secondary content\" (the '626 Patent ). The Court considers these claims to be \"substantially similar and\"-for the reasons developed below-\"linked to the same abstract idea\" because they \"recite little more than the same abstract idea,\"\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction and Transmission LLC v.

Because customized advertising will always require a comparison of different attributes, along with a method for selecting the advertisements based on user-specific attributes and a means for presenting them to the user, Quantum's claims capture nothing more than a recitation of the abstract idea of customizing secondary advertising content based on user or other criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Indeed, Quantum's patents claim ideas that are strikingly similar to abstract ideas relating to customization of products that the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court have held to be non-patentable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2353\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (idea of risk hedging is a \"fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures\n   </em>\n   is particularly apposite.

The criteria disclosed in the claims are broad. They include criteria very similar to criteria held abstract in\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures\n   </em>\n   , such as selections of\n   ad content based on the user's \"age and physical location,\" '136 Patent, cl. 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   '626 Patent, cls. 15, 17 (disclosing that \"age and physical location\" are part of the \"demographic information,\" which is used \"for identifying the secondary content for insertion into the at least one vacancy\"), on \"time and date qualifications for the vacancy,\" and on other \"[s]tatic attributes\" such as \"required secondary content type (such as teenage advertising, sales opportunity, syndicated news, an audio stream), the physical size and location of the vacancy ... or classification of the vacancy,\" '136 Patent at 6:46-50. This task of customization has been performed-as the Federal Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures\n   </em>\n   -in numerous contexts. These include outreach to potential consumers or users by a wide range of entities. For example: an advertising company or a content provider that utilizes sophisticated and complex formulae to customize advertisements to numerous particular consumers. Or a college radio station that runs different advertisements shortly before or during a sporting event than during final exam period. The three patents, notably, do not recite any specialized formulae or specific methods of selecting content. Instead, they merely recite potential types of attributes that could be harnessed as part of such a selection function. And they then recite generic types of equipment that interact with each other in various arrangements to create a customized presentation of content, whether in real time or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The arrangements described in Quantum's patents do not themselves affect and are not designed to improve the functioning of a computer process.

Quantum argues, for example, that \"the independent claims include: (1) a system with a specific arrangement of servers, network connectors, and consumer devices that are performing specific operations; (2) delivery of video programs to the consumer device separately from targeted video ads; and (3) a processor in the customer\n   device that inserts a targeted video ad into the video program as the video program is viewed by the consumer.\" Pl. Br. at 17. It notes that other independent claims describe additional elements: \"(4) video content including a vacancy into which video ads are inserted; and (5) using attributes associated with the video content/vacancy and video ads to identify available video ads for insertion into the video content.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The end result, Quantum states, is \"delivery of video ads to a consumer device that are targeted to a particular consumer and inserted and displayed by the consumer device at a moment in time when the consumer is likely to be interested in the ads.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   These claims do not introduce an inventive concept. As the Federal Circuit has held, the straightforward implementation of the benefits of an abstract idea does not itself give rise to an inventive concept, including when it is to be accomplished through generic computer equipment that performs the implementation of the abstract idea. Rather, an inventive concept requires that \"the claims do significantly more than simply describe that abstract method.\"\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n    772 F.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Here, the claims described in Quantum's three patents are straightforward, conventional applications of the concept of custom advertising and the selection of advertising content as a function of the selection of primary content or other data. And while Quantum notes that its patents anticipate that the customized advertisements would be inserted in \"real time,\" that is inadequate to make the abstract idea here patent-eligible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n    at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Adding routine additional steps ... does not transform an otherwise abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Significant in this regard, the implementation described in the patents entails the use of various generic devices, without more. The patents describe, at a high-level, the application by a computer of the abstract idea of customization-for example, the delivery of the primary content to the consumer and the insertion, by a \"processor\" in a \"consumer device,\" of the customized secondary advertising content that had been selected into the vacancies in the customer's primary content. These, however, are \"[s]teps that do nothing more than spell out what it means to 'apply it on a computer' [and] cannot confer patent-eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1366\">\n    792 F.3d at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2353\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2359 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1371 (\"Requiring the use of a 'software' 'brain' 'tasked with tailoring information and providing it to the user' provides no additional information beyond applying an abstract idea, restricted to the Internet, on a generic computer.\"). Even if the patents' system arrangements envision a more elegant or efficient system for creating custom advertising-and here, the arrangement is described at such a highly generic level to make any characterization by the patents wishful-the relevant \"precedent is clear that merely adding computer functionality to increase the speed or efficiency of the process does not confer patent eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The system arrangements disclosed in the patents' claims simply describe generic equipment performing the straightforward, conventional tasks of assembling custom advertising.

This too weighs against Quantum at step two. A human mind could evaluate attributes or other criteria (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the user's age), derive from these tailored secondary advertising content, and implement these selections by using a simple device that inserts digital advertising content into the stream of primary content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cybersource\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1371\">\n    654 F.3d at 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] method that can be performed by human thought alone is merely an abstract idea and is not patent-eligible under \u00a7 101.\"). As the Federal Circuit has recognized, tasks that are implemented by generic computer system arrangements but that a human operator, even with a pencil and paper, can also perform in real-time with the assistance of a device to implement the human's commands typically do not, without more, entail an inventive concept and thus are unpatentable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1366\">\n    792 F.3d at 1368-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he budgeting calculations at issue here are unpatentable because they could still be made using a pencil and paper with a simple notification device, even in real time as expenditures were being made.\" (quotation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tranxition, Inc. v.

But, because the system arrangements disclosed in the claims of the three patents would be invalid under \u00a7 101 under any reasonable construction, claim construction would not aid the Court in resolving the \u00a7 101 claim of invalidity, or elucidate any dispositive legal issue, and thus is not required in order to rule on the patents' validity under \u00a7 101.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    DietGoal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326578\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/33/271/#p284\">\n    33 F.Supp.3d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Claim construction \"is not an inviolable prerequisite to a validity determination under \u00a7 101.\"\n   <em>\n    Bancorp Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865822\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1266/#p1278\">\n    687 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1273 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bilski II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    561 U.S. at 611-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding patent's subject matter ineligible for patent protection without undertaking claim construction). \"While claim construction may sometimes be helpful in resolving a Section 101 motion where detailed explication of the claims in a patent would reveal material legal issues,\" claim construction is not required in every case involving a \u00a7 101 inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lumen View\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059601\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/189/#p204\">\n    984 F.Supp.2d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Here, the claims of the three patents are straightforward such that formal claim construction is unnecessary to define or illuminate their content or clarify any uncertain\n   legal determination.

These materials are cognizable on the instant motion because they are attached to the complaint as exhibits and are thereby deemed included as components of the complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chambers v.

On February 26, 2018, Charter filed its claim construction brief, and a declaration of Daniel L.

This was so even though \"a manual process would not necessarily capture all the configuration settings in a computer.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20968\">\n     664 Fed.Appx. at 972\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

What matters is the application.... [The patent's claims] merely describe a generic computer implementation, using routine, conventional activities, of the abstract idea, which is insufficient to transform the patent-ineligible abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (quotation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court has nevertheless examined the parties' preliminary claim construction materials to confirm this conclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 41 (Joint Claim Construction Statement); Dkts. 42-43 (Quantum's opening claim construction brief and declaration in support); Dkts. 48-49 (Charter's claim construction brief and declaration in support, with a slightly edited joint claim construction statement attached as Exhibit A). Neither the claims whose constructions are undisputed nor the disputed claims as construed by Quantum supply any basis to disturb the Court's determination the three patents are drawn to patent-ineligible subject matter. Quantum's proposed constructions as to the disputed claim terms adopt straightforward constructions of those terms; indeed, for many, Quantum argues that claims should be construed according to their \"plain and ordinary meaning.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkts. 41 &amp; 49, Ex. A (arguing \"attribute\" should be construed as a \"characteristic\"; arguing \"static attributes\" should be construed as \"attributes that are fixed\"; arguing \"targeted criteria\" should be construed as \"criteria associated with one or more consumers\"; seeking the \"plain and ordinary meaning\" for 11 claim terms (out of 17 total claim terms in construction) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
