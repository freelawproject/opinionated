Although the TLC's regulatory scheme permits advertising in medallion taxis and street-hail liveries, it is effectively banned in all other vehicles. Vugo, Inc., a Minnesota-based company that places digital content, including advertising, in rideshare vehicles such as those affiliated with Uber and Lyft across the country, has sought to expand its business into New York City. After the TLC refused Vugo authorization to do so, it brought this First Amendment challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Both Vugo and the City now move for summary judgment. Because the City is unable to justify the challenged regulations, even under the relaxed judicial scrutiny applied to restrictions on commercial speech first articulated in\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York,\n   </em>\n   Vugo's motion is granted and the City's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts, which are based on the parties' Rule 56.1 statements and supporting materials, are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TLC, a City agency, is responsible for the \"regulation and supervision\" of vehicles for hire in the City. N.Y.C. Charter \u00a7 2303(a). In connection with its obligation to establish a comprehensive transportation policy, it is tasked\n   with considering, among other things, \"the promotion and protection of the public comfort.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2300. Its authority extends to \"[t]he regulation and supervision of standards and conditions of service,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2303(b)(2), and it is expressly empowered to establish \"standards of ... comfort ... in the operation of vehicles and auxiliary equipment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2303(b)(6). As of August 2016, the TLC oversaw more than 94,000 vehicles, including medallion taxis and for-hire vehicles (\"FHVs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF No. 47. The following vehicles are considered FHVs: community-based liveries, black cars, luxury limousines, and street-hail liveries (\"SHLs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def. 56.1 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The TLC currently allows two types of regulated vehicles to display interior advertising: medallion taxis and SHLs. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12, 14, ECF No. 39. Medallion taxis are New York City's ubiquitous \"yellow cabs.\" Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 4. SHLs, which are commonly known as \"green\" or \"borough\" taxis, are a relatively new class of FHVs that are authorized to accept street hails in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens (with the exception of the airports), Staten Island, and in certain parts of Manhattan. Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 30. In addition to being the only two types of regulated vehicles allowed to display interior advertising, medallion taxis and SHLs are also the only regulated vehicles that accept street hails. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before May 2005, no TLC-regulated vehicles were authorized to display interior advertising.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. 56.1 \u00b6 13; Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 22, ECF No. 50. The rules being challenged in this action, which prohibit interior advertising in FHVs, were originally adopted as a single rule (the \"Original Rule\") on August 5, 1999.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 3. The Original Rule provided, in relevant part, that \"[a]n owner may not display any advertising, either on the exterior or the interior of a for-hire vehicle, unless such advertising has been authorized by the Commission.\" Wanttaja Decl. Ex. B, at NYC0263. It was adopted \"to establish consistency between TLC's regulation of advertising in medallion taxicabs and FHVs.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 20. The rule governing interior advertising in medallion taxis at the time prohibited taxicab owners from \"display[ing] inside a taxicab any advertising or other notice not specifically authorized by [the Taxicab Owners Rules] or the Commission's Marking Specifications for Taxicabs unless approved by the Commission.\" Wanttaja Decl. Ex. A, at NYC0452.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Original Rule was codified at 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 6-12(f)(2). Wanttaja Decl. Ex. B, at NYC0263. In 2010, the Original Rule was re-codified as 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59A-29(e)(1) as part of a reorganization of the TLC's rulebooks. Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 21 n.7. The TLC also adopted a parallel provision that applies to FHV owners, which is codified at 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59B-29(e)(1). Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 6. The language in these provisions differs somewhat from the Original Rule, but the parties agree that the differences are not \"substantive.\" Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 4; Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 21 n.7. In its current form, 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59A-29(e)(1) provides that \"[a]n Owner must not display any advertising\n   on the exterior or the interior of a [FHV] unless the advertising has been authorized by the Commission and a License has been issued to the Owner following the provisions of the Administrative Code.\" Similarly, 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59B-29(e)(l) provides that \"[a] Vehicle must not display advertising on the outside or the inside unless the Commission has authorized the advertising and has given the Vehicle Owner a permit specifying that the advertising complies with the Administrative Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The TLC disfavors interior advertising in all of the vehicles that it licenses and regulates. Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28, 52. \"Because the Commission had authorized no form of interior advertising in taxicabs or FHVs prior to 1999, passage of the rule did not alter the fundamental fact that advertising was not authorized in either taxicabs or FHVs at that time. Rather, the rule was intended to make clear that interior advertising was not permitted and inform licensees that they could not display interior advertising without prior TLC authorization.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The TLC allows advertising in medallion taxicabs and SHLs for one reason: to offset the costs associated with the technology systems that must be installed in those vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. 56.1 \u00b6 28; Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 47. In 2004, the TLC\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   promulgated rules requiring [medallion] taxicabs ... to install equipment capable of performing the following functions: (1) electronic receipt and collection of trip data; (2) acceptance of debit cards and credit cards for payment; (3) driver receipt of text messages; and (4) display of route guidance and other important information to passengers via passenger information monitors [\"PIMs\"].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 30. The new equipment was intended to serve a variety of policy objectives. The goal of the electronic receipt and collection of trip data was to establish \"an efficient and accurate method of maintaining information regarding the date, time, and location of passenger pick-ups and drop-offs, duration of the trip, the number of passengers, and the metered fare paid by the passenger(s), among other data.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 31. This electronic collection of data was intended to allow the TLC to \"more efficiently synthesize and analyze this enormous volume of data so as to guide the agency in its day-to-day operations and larger policy decisions.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 31. The acceptance of debit and credit cards was intended to provide a convenience for passengers and improve the safety of drivers, as they would presumably carry less cash. Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 32. The purpose behind the text messaging system was threefold: (1) \"to communicate public service announcements and emergency notifications to taxicab drivers\"; (2) \"to assist in the recovery of lost property\"; and (3) \"to inform drivers of fare opportunities, which [would] improve[ ] overall customer service.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 33. The PIM was intended \"to display the total fare at the end of every trip, communicate public service announcements to passengers, allow passengers to track their route, and allow passengers to complete credit card payments.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 34. The purpose of these features was to prevent customers from being overcharged by providing them with greater transparency with respect to their fare and route. Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The equipment contemplated by these rules came to be known as the Taxicab Passenger Enhancement Program (\"TPEP\"), which is now required to be installed in all medallion taxis. Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 13. A similar system called the Street Hail Livery Technology System (\"LPEP\") must be installed in SHLs. Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 44. The TPEP and\n   LPEP requirements \"added a significant new cost to vehicle owners without any expectation of increased business.\" Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 47. \"[A]s a means by which owners could offset the new costs,\" the TLC crafted an exception to its ban on interior advertising and promulgated new rules authorizing interior advertising on the PIMs of medallion taxis and SHLs. Wanttaja Decl. \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, as of August 2016, interior advertising was permitted in about twenty-two percent of the vehicles licensed and regulated by the TLC. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Formed in 2015, Vugo is a media distribution company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota that distributes advertisements, entertainment content, and public service announcements. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Vugo partners with rideshare drivers affiliated with companies such as Uber and Lyft. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 18. Drivers download Vugo's software onto tablets that are mounted in their vehicles in a manner that allows passengers to view and interact with the tablets. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 18. Approximately seventy-five percent of the screen displays primary content-typically video-while the remaining portion is a static display related to the main content, the Vugo logo, and volume controls. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 27. Passengers cannot turn off the display, but they can reduce the volume to a \"near-mute\" level. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 30. Advertisers pay Vugo to display their content and Vugo provides the drivers with sixty percent of the advertising revenue. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the spring of 2015, Vugo launched its beta program, making the platform available to ride-share drivers across the country. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 33. During the beta period, a driver from New York City informed Vugo that TLC rules banned advertising in for-hire vehicles. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 34. Vugo contacted the TLC about entering the New York market and was informed that its product was prohibited because FHVs are not permitted to display advertisements.

When a law is challenged under the First Amendment, the degree of scrutiny applied by courts is often dictated by whether the law restricts speech based on its substance: content-based laws generally receive strict scrutiny whereas content neutral laws are subject to less exacting forms of judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    at 2232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

United States\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Supreme Court recognized both that it has applied\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   \"more strictly\" in the years since it first formulated the test and that various commentators have urged for the test's repudiation in favor of a more \"straightforward and stringent\" standard, an invitation the Court declined to accept at that time.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248628\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/173/#p182\">\n    527 U.S. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248628\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/173/#p182\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248628\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/173/#p182\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999).

Both parties agree, however, that at its core this case is about commercial speech,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 25:21-26:1, July 27, 2017. Indeed, the City invites the Court to construe the regulations so as to apply\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to commercial speech, Def.

Ultimately, the Court need\n   not adjudicate the precise level of scrutiny required because the regulations at issue cannot pass constitutional muster under either standard.

In\n   <em>\n    Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Court invalidated a regulation prohibiting the specification of alcoholic content on beer labels-intended to prevent advertising \"strength wars\"-in part because (1) the practical effect of the regulatory regime was to allow such statements in beer\n   <em>\n    advertisements\n   </em>\n   and (2) labels on bottles of other types of alcoholic beverages were not subject to the ban.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/#p488\">\n    514 U.S. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/#p488\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/#p488\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has employed similar logic,\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. v.

Rather, the rationale for exempting taxis and SHLs,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the costs associated with TPEP and LPEP, exists only because the City has mandated that those vehicles install such systems and subsequently allowed drivers to recoup the resulting costs specifically by displaying advertisements. Were the City permitted to justify the under-inclusiveness of the ban on this basis, the reasonable fit prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   would lose much of its force. Municipalities would be able to selectively restrict commercial speech on nearly any basis. It is true that the TPEP and LPEP requirements allegedly derive from the primary functional difference between the exempted vehicles and FHVs: taxis and SHLs accept street hails while FHVs do not. This difference, however, similarly bears no relationship to the protection of citizens from advertisements.

But when the third and fourth elements of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   are considered in tandem, this final portion of the test does not weigh sufficiently in favor of the City so as to render the fit between the means and ends reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The City may have had a stronger argument with respect to overall fit if, rather than prohibiting all advertisements, the regulations limited their placement, size, or some other manner in which they are presented.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Long Island Bd. of Realtors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451522\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/277/622/#p628\">\n    277 F.3d at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any devices displaying advertisements could, for instance, be required to be outfitted with a properly functioning on-off switch or a mute button. This would effectively leave the decision to be faced with such advertisements to the passenger, preventing any citizen from becoming a captive audience subjected to unwanted noise and imagery. The City rightfully points out that such limitations could result in a substantial burden on city officials to monitor compliance. These examples, however, are by no means an exhaustive set of alternatives, but are meant simply to illustrate the number of options, short of a complete ban on advertising, by which the city could pursue its articulated interest. Accordingly, the unnecessarily restrictive nature of the regulations buttresses the Court's conclusion that the means employed by the regulations do not justify the ends sought by the City under\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
