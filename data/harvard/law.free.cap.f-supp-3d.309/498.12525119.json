Doc. 4. Defendant has not yet\n   been served with a copy of either Plaintiff's complaint or his motion for preliminary injunction. Accordingly, Defendant has not filed a memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff's motion and the Court has not yet had an opportunity to otherwise hear from Defendant with regard to Plaintiff's motion. Nevertheless, finding that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of showing that issuance of a preliminary injunction is appropriate, the undersigned finds that a response from Defendant is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case involves claims arising from Plaintiff's employment with Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1.

On March 13, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant in this Court alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Defendant violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by failing to properly pay him for all the hours he has worked, including overtime hours.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 5-11. Plaintiff also alleges that he was constructively terminated on the basis of: (1) his race in violation of Title VII; and (2) his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Along with his complaint, Plaintiff also filed the instant motion for issuance of a preliminary injunction seeking an order requiring Defendant to immediately reinstate him to his position.
