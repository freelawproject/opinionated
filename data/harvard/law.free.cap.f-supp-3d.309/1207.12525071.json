Relevant Allegations of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The relevant allegations of the EEOC's Amended Complaint are as follows. Kimberly Lowe (\"Lowe\") began working for Massage Envy as a massage therapist on January 13, 2012. (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 13) Lowe did not have a disability at any time relevant to this matter during or after her employment at Massage Envy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14) In September 2014, Lowe requested time off to visit her sister in Ghana, West Africa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17) Massage Envy's Business Manager, Roxanna Iorio (\"Iorio\") approved\n   Lowe's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18) On October 22, 2014, three days prior to her trip, Iorio and one of Massage Envy's owners, Ron Wuchko (\"Wuchko\"), terminated Lowe out of concern that \"she would be infected with Ebola if she traveled to Ghana\" and that she would bring it home and infect Massage Envy's employees and clients upon her return.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-22; Dkts. 16-1, 16-2) Lowe subsequently traveled to Ghana. (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 24)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon her return, Lowe filed a Charge of Discrimination (\"the Charge\") with the EEOC, alleging that she was discriminated against in that Massage Envy \"perceived [Lowe] as disabled or ... as having potential to become disabled,\" in violation of the ADA. (Dkts. 16-1; Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 7) The EEOC conducted an investigation of Lowe's claim and on September 6, 2016, issued a Letter of Determination finding that there was reasonable cause to believe that Lowe was terminated \"because she was 'regarded as' disabled\" in violation of the ADA. (Dkt. 16-2) The EEOC invited Massage Envy to engage in informal conciliation efforts to reach a just resolution of the matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 9) On December 27, 2016, the EEOC informed Massage Envy that it was unable to secure an acceptable conciliation agreement. (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 10) In the instant action, the EEOC alleges (1) \"regarded as\" disability discrimination in violation of Section 102(a) of the ADA, and (2) \"association discrimination\" in violation of Section 102(a) and (b)(4) of the ADA.

(Dkt. 16 at 11) However, in its response, the EEOC expressly states that it \"does not allege that Massage Envy 'failed to reinstate or rehire' Lowe\" in its Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 20 at 4) Indeed, the only discriminatory act that the EEOC alleges is Massage Envy's termination of Lowe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Parties do not dispute that the EEOC exhausted its administrative remedies with respect to the alleged discriminatory act of termination, as this claim \"falls squarely within the scope of the underlying Charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 16 at 11) As such, the Court considers the EEOC's discrimination claims only to the extent that they apply Lowe's October 22, 2014 termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Massage Envy also contends that the EEOC's association discrimination claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(4) should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. (Dkt. 16 at 14) However, the Court finds that the EEOC's association discrimination claim is sufficiently related to the facts alleged in Lowe's Charge. Although the factual allegations are brief, Lowe states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Wuchko terminated me because he believed that in [sic] my trip I could come into\n   <em>\n    contact with a person having Ebola\n   </em>\n   and could bring it back home and to work after my trip. However, Ghana has never had Ebola ; thus, there was no risk to my health or the health of those around me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Dkt. 16-1) (emphasis added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Lowe does not expressly allege that she has been discriminated against due to her association with known disabled persons, an association discrimination claim could reasonably be expected to grow out of the facts alleged in her Charge. While she does not use the word\n   \"associate,\" she alleges that she was terminated due to her potential \"contact with a person having Ebola.\" This language is sufficient to give rise to an investigation into an association discrimination claim. Thus, the Court finds that the EEOC exhausted its administrative remedies with respect to its association discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Regarded As\" Disabled Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The EEOC alleges that Massage Envy discriminated against Lowe in violation of Section \u00a7 102(a) of the ADA when it terminated her because Massage Envy regarded her as disabled. (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 28) Section 102(a) prohibits discrimination against a \"qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to ... discharge of employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"Disability\" under the ADA is defined as (1) having \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual,\" (2) having \"a record of such an impairment,\" or (3) \"being regarded as having such an impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 12102(1). The EEOC does not allege that Lowe was disabled or had a record of disability. In fact, the EEOC's Amended Complaint expressly states that \"[a]t no time material to this Complaint did Lowe have a disability.\" (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 14) Thus, the EEOC posits its claim for discrimination under the \"regarded as\" prong of the definition of disability. An individual is regarded as having a disability when he or she is subjected to a prohibited action (such as termination of employment) because of \"an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 12102(3)(A). As pointed out by the EEOC, in amending the \"regarded as\" definition in the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (\"ADAAA\"), Congress \"broadened the application of the 'regarded as' prong of the definition of disability\" to include persons who were not actually impaired or whose impairments did not constitute a disability, but were perceived to be impaired nonetheless. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630 App'x. \u00a7 1630.2(l). However, in the ADA Interpretive Guidance, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, it is clarified that impairment \"does not include characteristic predisposition to illness or disease.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1630.2(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Massage Envy contends that the EEOC's Amended Complaint does not assert a valid claim of disability under the regarded as disabled definition because at the time of Lowe's termination, Wuchko did not perceive Lowe as presently having Ebola ; rather, he perceived her as having the potential to become infected with Ebola (i.e., become disabled) in the future. (Dkt. 16 at \u00b6 9) Massage Envy contends that viewing Lowe to be \"predisposed\" to becoming disabled in the future due to her then impending trip does not fall under the protection of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its response, the EEOC asserts that employers can violate the ADA even when they discriminate against an \"otherwise healthy individual based upon misconceptions about that person's potential to become disabled in the future.\" (Dkt. 20 at 10) To support this proposition, the EEOC relies on three cases:\n   <em>\n    School Board of Nassau County v.

The EEOC contends that the employee in\n   <em>\n    Valdez\n   </em>\n   had nonetheless implicitly established a prima facie case of discrimination under the regarded as definition because the court decided the matter based on an affirmative defense. However, this Court is not persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Valdez\n   </em>\n   is factually similar to the instant case.

(Dkt. 16 at 14) The Court agrees. At the time of Lowe's termination, three days prior to her trip, Lowe had not yet had any association with persons in Ghana. (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 24; Dkt. 16-2) Moreover, there is no evidence that Wuchko knew that any individual in Ghana had Ebola.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The EEOC argues that the timing of the discriminatory act does not control in association discrimination claims, citing to an Eleventh Circuit case in which the Court held that \"because the FMLA requires notice in advance of future leave, employees are protected from interference prior to the occurrence of a triggering event, such as the birth of a child.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereda v.

As such, the Court finds this case to be inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plain language of the ADA makes clear that the relevant individual complainant must be \"known to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     have\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [present tense] a relationship\" or association with a person known to have a disability in order for that relationship to serve as a basis for association discrimination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) (emphasis added). Further, the Eleventh Circuit has held that to establish a prima facie case for association discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) that she was subjected to an adverse employment action; (2) that she was qualified for the job at that time; (3) that her employer\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     knew at that time that she had\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   a relative [or associate] with a disability; and (4) that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances which raised a reasonable inference that the disability of the relative was a determining factor in the employer's decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Wascura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088567\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/1238/#p1242\">\n    257 F.3d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). It is evident by the plain language of the ADA and binding case law that an employer must know of a presently existing or past association with a disabled person (or persons) at the time of the adverse action to fall within the ADA's association discrimination provision. The EEOC has not presented, nor is the Court aware, of any Eleventh Circuit case in which an association discrimination claim was sustained based on an employer's knowledge of a potential future association with a disabled person or persons. Rather, the Eleventh Circuit has evaluated association discrimination claims only when the allegations are based on an existing relationship or association with a disabled person or persons.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cusick v.

The EEOC misconstrues the purpose of the ADA association provision, which is to protect individuals from discrimination based on unfounded stereotypes and assumptions about the known disabilities of the people with whom they associate (e.g., to protect against the assumption that an individual can contract AIDS by merely associating with an AIDS patient).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404792\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/859/596/#p604\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ADA does not establish a cause of action for discrimination against an individual who associates with people who are merely\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     regarded as\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   disabled. Lowe expressly pleads in her Charge that she was not planning to associate with any people who were known by Wuchko to have Ebola. (Dkt. 16-1) Indeed, it is central to the EEOC's theme of the case, as articulated in its complaint and opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, that Wuchko was woefully ignorant in his beliefs and resulting bias that people in Ghana have Ebola.

In its proposed Second Amended Complaint, the EEOC would allege that when Lowe was terminated, Wuchko \"coerced, intimidated, and threatened\" Lowe to change her travel plans so as to prevent her from associating with people who had Ebola and foreclose Lowe's \"future exercise of rights protected by the ADA including, but not limited to, the right to a reasonable accommodation.\" (Dkt. 34-1 at \u00b6 28-29) Unlike its association discrimination claim, which could reasonably be expected to grow out of the limited facts alleged in Lowe's Charge, there is no hint of an unlawful interference claim alleged in Lowe's Charge. (Dkt. 16-1) There are no facts in the Charge that reference any coercion, intimidation, or threats made to prevent Lowe from enjoying purported rights under the ADA.

As discussed extensively above, Lowe had no existing rights under the ADA at the time of her termination, including no right to an accommodation, because she was not disabled, she was not regarded as being disabled, nor had she associated with any persons known to be disabled.

(Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 20) However, the pleadings demonstrate that Lowe was terminated on October 22, 2014, as stated in Lowe's Charge of Discrimination (\"on 10/22/14 Mr. Wuchko terminated my employment\") and in the EEOC's Letter of Determination (\"Respondent ... terminated [Lowe] 3 days prior to a planned trip to Ghana\") attached to Massage Envy's Motion to Dismiss. The Eleventh Circuit permits a district court to consider documents attached to a motion to dismiss without converting the motion into one for summary judgment where the document is central to the plaintiff's claim and is undisputed.\n    <em>\n     Horsley v.

The Court finds that it may consider the Charge of Discrimination and Letter of Determination attached to Massage Envy's Motion to Dismiss, as they are referenced in the EEOC's Amended Complaint (Dkt. 14 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8) and the EEOC has not otherwise disputed their authenticity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
