Pending before this Court are Defendants Christine and Steven Dykstra's Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction under Federal Civil Rule 12 (b)(2) (Docs. 3, 4). Plaintiff William Thomas filed a Combined Opposition (Doc. 7). The Dykstras filed separate Replies (Docs. 8, 9), and a joint Surreply (Doc. 11). After an evidentiary hearing, this matter is now decisional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this case are somewhat unique: Thomas is the father of Christine Dykstra, and the father-in-law of Steven Dykstra. Although there are disputed facts, they primarily relate to liability rather than this Court's personal jurisdiction. Here are the undisputed facts, drawn from the Complaint (Doc. 1-2), the Dykstras' affidavits (Docs. 3-1, 4-1), and the evidentiary hearing (Docs. 10, 13; Hearing Transcript).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Dykstras reside in Florida, after moving there in 2015-16 from Texas (Doc. 3-1 at 1; Doc. 4-1 at 1). Neither Defendant has resided or worked in Ohio for over twenty-five years, and their only contact with Ohio during that time was the occasional phone call, e-mail, and visit to Christine's family members (Doc. 3-1 at 1; Doc. 4-1 at 1). The only alleged contacts relevant to this dispute are a few phone calls between Christine and her father, and a few e-mails between Christine and her sisters (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-5; Doc. 3-1 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In late 2015, Christine reached out to her father about relocating to Florida due\n   to concerns about her mother's health and his ability to care for her without assistance (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; Doc. 3-1 at 1). Christine made the call after she and her sisters discussed their concerns about their parents and possible care arrangements, ultimately agreeing that the best option was to propose they join Christine and her family in Florida (Doc. 3-1 at 1). During the call with her father, Christine allegedly promised to help care for her parents and build her father a woodworking shop once he arrived in Florida (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). In exchange, her parents would contribute to the purchase of the Florida home from the sale proceeds of their Ohio home (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5; Doc. 3-1 at 1). There is no allegation that Steven participated in these discussions, other than generally agreeing that his wife's parents could move in with his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Three weeks later, Thomas called Christine to inform her he had decided to make the move (Doc. 3-1 at 1). In early 2016, he sold his Ohio home and most of his personal belongings without any input from his children and, in fact, contrary to Christine's suggestion that he wait until her family completed their move to Florida to avoid having to relocate twice (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 6; Doc. 3-1 at 1-2). Thomas and his wife then joined Christine in Texas before all parties moved to Florida (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 3-1 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the exact details are unclear, at some point Christine and her father opened a joint bank account. Steven was not named on the account (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 5; Doc. 13-1 at 1). The Complaint alleges Christine requested an account be opened \"to help with the expense of housing her parents\" (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 5), while Christine says the account was created because her father did not want to continue writing checks or tracking his bills (Doc. 3-1 at 2). Regardless of its exact intended purpose, the account was clearly opened in Texas (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; Doc. 13-1 at 1), and money was not withdrawn from it until after Thomas resided in Texas (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13-1; Tr. at 5-7). Eventually, $109,674.05 from this account was transferred to the Sun Trust Bank to help purchase the Florida home (Doc 1-2 at \u00b6 8; Tr. at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   All parties agree their relationship declined\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the parties resided together in Florida (Doc 1-2 at \u00b6 9; Doc. 3-1 at 2). As promised, Thomas was provided a residence with his woodworking shop (Doc. 3-1 at 2). The parties dispute why, and upon whose insistence, Thomas left Florida. Unbeknownst to his daughter or son-in-law, Thomas returned to Ohio and then filed this lawsuit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). Thomas claims unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel. He does not allege fraud or misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thomas carries the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is proper \"over each defendant independently.\"\n   <em>\n    Days Inns Worldwide, Inc. v. Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2782953\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/899/#p904\">\n    445 F.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (6th Cir. 2006). Thomas has not submitted his own affidavit, but relies on the allegations in the Complaint, the Dykstras' affidavits, and bank records provided at this Court's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The exact burden placed on Thomas depends on whether an evidentiary hearing was held. When no evidentiary hearing is held, only a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction is required, and the pleadings and affidavits are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Neogen Corp. v. Neo Gen Screening, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474797\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/883/#p887\">\n    282 F.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (6th Cir. 2002). But when an evidentiary hearing is held, the plaintiff must establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Youn v. Track, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160910\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/409/#p417\">\n    324 F.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417 (6th Cir. 2003). This Court heard arguments and evidence at a Record Phone Hearing on February 2,\n   2018. Thus, Thomas must establish this Court's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because this is a diversity case, Thomas must satisfy the state-law requirements for personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Thomson ex rel.

Rowlette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228476\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/718/#p721\">\n    228 F.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing\n   <em>\n    Goldstein v.

Thus, this Court must separately analyze whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is both (1) authorized by the laws of Ohio and (2) in accordance with due process.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Thomson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858806\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/357/#p361\">\n    545 F.3d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Ohio Long-Arm Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, Thomas argues the Dykstras are subject to Ohio's long-arm statute under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2307.382(A)(1), which authorizes personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant when the cause of action arises from the defendant \"[t]ransacting any business\" in Ohio.

The Complaint states\n   <em>\n    Christine\n   </em>\n   called her father,\n   <em>\n    Christine\n   </em>\n   made the alleged promises, and\n   <em>\n    Christine\n   </em>\n   was to be named on the joint account (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-5). Thomas contends that Christine's contacts with Ohio should be imputed to Steven because he \"agreed with [his] wife ... that [they]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   should ask her elderly parents if they would like to move to Florida with [them]\" (Doc. 4-1 at 1; Tr. at 10-11). In support, Thomas cites\n   <em>\n    AgriSales Dynamix, LLC v. RECON Technologies, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2013027094\">\n    2012 WL 13027094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

Ohio 2011).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although these cases support the general proposition that an agent's contacts with a forum may be imputed to the principal, they are easily distinguishable from this case. In\n   <em>\n    AgriSales Dynamix\n   </em>\n   , the court imputed an individual's contacts to a company with which he had a formal consulting relationship.\n   <em>\n    AgriSales Dynamix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2013027094\">\n    2012 WL 13027094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4. The court concluded that because the company had contracted with the individual to \"derive benefits from his ongoing Michigan contacts,\" it could not \"disclaim those same contacts\" to limit personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n   <em>\n    Stolle Machinery\n   </em>\n   involved a misappropriation of trade secrets claim. The court found an agency relationship existed between a company and its CEO because the CEO allegedly stole the trade secrets at issue and then used them to establish the company.\n   <em>\n    Stolle Mach.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206293323\">\n    2011 WL 6293323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4, *7-8. The company subsequently ratified its CEO's conduct by \"knowingly using those trade secrets ... for its own financial gain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Both\n   <em>\n    AgriSales Dynamix\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stolle Machinery\n   </em>\n   involved developed business relationships and companies that ratified the other party's contacts by intentionally misusing the information gleaned from the contacts for their own benefit. Neither of these factors is present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Steven did not create an agency relationship with his wife by merely agreeing that his wife's parents could move in with their family. And, when prompted, Thomas offered no other argument or evidence suggesting an agency relationship existed. Thus, because Thomas has not alleged Steven had\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   direct contacts with Ohio, this Court lacks jurisdiction under both the Ohio long-arm statute and the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Christine Dykstra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for Christine, this Court finds her contacts with Ohio do not satisfy Section 2307.382(A)(1). Despite Ohio courts' broad interpretation of \"transacting,\" this Court is skeptical that the conversations in this case constitute \"business\" negotiations or a \"business\" dealing. The extent of the alleged contacts are a few phone calls between a daughter and her father making arrangements for his relocation to Florida, and a few e-mails between sisters about their concern for their parents' well-being and their desire to offer assistance. These conversations were between private individuals-family members. And although the conversations had financial implications, Thomas does not suggest Christine's proposal was motivated by pecuniary gain or made in bad faith. The type of discussions alleged do not constitute \"business\" under the ordinary understanding of the word, and do not naturally fit within the statutory language or the Ohio Supreme Court's definition of \"transacting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, when asked to provide analogous case law extending Section 2307.382(A)(1) to discussions of this nature, Thomas provided one case:\n   <em>\n    Ramsier v. Western &amp; Southern Life Ins.

Pl. 1987). But\n   <em>\n    Ramsier\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable from the facts here.\n   <em>\n    Ramsier\n   </em>\n   involved a suit against a woman by the administrator of her deceased brother's estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.E.2d%20615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.E.2d%20615\">\n    at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike Christine, the woman made several trips to Ohio to \"perform services in respect to [her brother's] personal property\": she met with the administrator several times in person, purchased\n   items at her brother's estate auction, and signed a paper obligating her to pay her brother's funeral expenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.E.2d%20615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.E.2d%20615\">\n    at 616-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Thomas does not allege Christine was ever present, caused injury, or had any contractual obligations in Ohio. Although not dispositive, the lack of case law applying this provision to similar relationships or discussions supports the conclusion that this was not a \"business\" transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, even if these discussions are considered \"business\" dealings, Christine's alleged contacts still fail under the long-arm statute. The first consideration is who initiated the dealing, or whether the non-resident defendant \"reached out\" to the forum to create a \"business relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    McMunigal v. Bloch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202106186\">\n    2010 WL 2106186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ohio 2010) (citation omitted). Again, this analysis is a bit strange when applied to the relationship here. Nevertheless, after discussing the potential arrangement with her sisters, Christine did reach out to her father to suggest he and his wife relocate to Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But the parties' discussions did not occur in Ohio. Thomas and Christine communicated by phone, and Christine and her sisters communicated by e-mail. Thomas does not allege his daughter was ever in Ohio during the relevant period. \"[M]ere communications to an Ohio resident are insufficient to constitute 'transacting business' within the meaning of the Long-Arm statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   And Thomas' relocation did not materially affect Ohio and does not demonstrate Christine has a \"substantial connection\" to the state.
