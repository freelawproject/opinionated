After due consideration, the Court enters the following Order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 24, 2014, the parties signed an agreement where Defendant agreed to buy and Plaintiff agreed to sell up to 117 Super98 drag reduction devices (\"Systems\") for Defendant's MD-88 aircraft (\"Agreement\"). Dkt. No. [7249] \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. Starting in November 2014, Defendant began issuing Purchase Orders for Systems, culminating in a consolidated Service Purchase Order for 117 Systems in early 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. On or about November 12, 2015, Defendant asked Plaintiff to stop shipping additional Systems until Defendant could calculate the average Performance Improvement of the first ten Systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. By that time, Plaintiff had delivered 42 Systems to Defendant and procured most of the components necessary to complete delivery on the remaining 75 Systems from the Purchase Orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Defendant contends that the Performance Improvement calculation showed that the Performance Improvement of the first ten Systems fell short of the 2.5% fuel savings guaranteed by the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Dkt. No. [85] 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant canceled the Purchase Orders for the 75 undelivered Systems and alleges that the delivered Systems did not provide sufficient Performance Improvement as guaranteed in the Agreement. Dkt. No. [72-49] \u00b6\u00b6 22, 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties disagree as to how Performance Improvement was supposed to be calculated. Defendant contends that at the time of the Agreement it believed that the Performance Improvement Guarantee applied to\n   <em>\n    mission\n   </em>\n   fuel mileage, while Plaintiff alleges that it only applied to\n   <em>\n    cruise\n   </em>\n   fuel mileage. Dkt. No. [85] \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. \"Mission\" fuel mileage measures the mileage of the entire flight from takeoff to landing, while \"cruise\" fuel mileage only measures the mileage when the aircraft operates at a steady, high altitude.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant contends that the cruise/mission issue is an essential element to the contract because other Agreement provisions are related to the Performance Improvement Guarantee\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it would not have entered into the Agreement if the Performance Improvement Guarantee only applied to cruise fuel mileage. Dkt. Nos. [72] at 10; [85] \u00b6 5. Defendant further contends that because there was no meeting of the minds on an essential element of the Agreement, the Agreement is invalid. Dkt. No. [72] at 17, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant notes that during discussions on earlier versions of the Agreement, Plaintiff represented to Defendant that the Performance Improvement Guarantee applied to\n   <em>\n    mission\n   </em>\n   fuel mileage. Dkt. No. [85] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 12. However, Plaintiff maintains that because the Agreement itself unambiguously defines Performance Improvement with reference to\n   <em>\n    cruise\n   </em>\n   fuel mileage, any prior representations are parol evidence that should not be considered in\n   determining whether there was a meeting of the minds, particularly in light of the Agreement's Integration Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties also disagree on whether Defendant is bound by the Purchase Orders and therefore owes Plaintiff for the 75 undelivered Systems. Defendant alleges that it is not bound by the Purchase Orders because the delivered Systems did not provide sufficient Performance Improvement, and therefore Defendant has the right to \"discontinue the purchase of Systems\" under the Agreement. Dkt. Nos. [60-1] at 6; [72] at 19-20. Plaintiff argues that even if the Systems did not provide sufficient Performance Improvement, Defendant's right to \"discontinue the purchase of Systems\" under the Agreement only applies to\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   Purchase Orders, and therefore Defendant must pay for the 75 undelivered Systems. Dkt. No. [60] at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, the parties disagree on whether the Performance Improvement Guarantee and its related Price Reduction apply to partially-installed Systems. This is relevant because while Defendant has stated it will pay for the 42 delivered Systems, Dkt. No. [85] \u00b6 22, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant did not fully install 25 of the 42 delivered Systems and therefore should not be able to receive a price reduction on those Systems. Dkt. No. [60] at 18, 19. The parties further differ on whether Defendant can delay payments owed to Plaintiff by delaying Systems installation, and whether Defendant can set-off payments owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 12, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint asserting breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment/restitution. Dkt. No. [1]. On July 12, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Dkt. No. [59].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, the Court will look to both the Agreement's express language and the parties' extrinsic communications to determine whether there was a meeting of the minds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although the Agreement's express language supports a finding that the Performance Improvement Guarantee should be calculated using cruise fuel mileage, the language is not sufficiently clear to foreclose other interpretations. Though Section 3.1(a) defines \"Performance Improvement\" in terms of Exhibit D which makes numerous references to \"cruise\" fuel mileage, this occurs in the context of Plaintiff's calculation of Performance Improvement. Section 3.1(a) provides that \"Seller will provide to Purchaser, prior to the delivery of the first System, flight test data as set forth in Exhibit D, Nominal Performance, which demonstrates the nominal fuel mileage performance improvement (Performance Improvement) resulting from installation of the System.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453021\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/339/246/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exhibit D specifically references the \"nominal incremental percentage increase in\n   <em>\n    cruise\n   </em>\n   fuel mileage due to installation of the System.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (emphasis added).

This is the relevant calculation for the Performance Improvement Guarantee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Section 3.1(a) provides that \"Performance Improvement for Purchaser's Aircraft with an installed System will be determined by the following methodology:\" and then proceeds to list several requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unlike the instructions for Plaintiff's Performance Improvement calculations, Defendant's instructions do not specify whether to use cruise or mission fuel mileage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, it only references \"average gallons burned per flight hour\" and \"fuel consumed on a flight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff made several pre-Agreement representations to Defendant that Performance Improvement would be measured using mission fuel mileage. First, in a September 12, 2012, email Plaintiff's engineer stated that \"[o]ur 2.5% [guarantee] is literally for cruise only.\" Dkt. Nos. [72-41] at 3, 4; [85] \u00b6 11. In an email response that same day, Plaintiff's lead salesman stated: \"I suspect you are aware that all of our 'guarantee language' over the past 36 months has actually been considered by the customers to be 'mission average,' not cruise only.\" Dkt. Nos. [72-41] at 2; [85] \u00b6 12. The next day, Plaintiff's Vice President replied to Plaintiff's salesman's response and stated that there was \"[n]o need to change our guarantees\" as \"[o]ur main objective right now is to get to [the] point\" where other companies are \"measur[ing] our product\" because \"many of us believe our product will outperform when given an opportunity.\" Dkt. Nos. [72-41] at 2; [85] \u00b6 13. In addition, Plaintiff's December 2013 presentation to Defendant approximately nine months before the finalized Agreement referred to \"fuel savings of installed kits (2.50% of MD-88 avg\n   <em>\n    mission\n   </em>\n   fuel).\" Dkt. No. [72-3] at 15, 59 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff argues that none of Defendant's extrinsic evidence from prior years pertaining to discussions on earlier Agreement versions casts doubt on the parties' mutual assent\n   <em>\n    at the time of the Agreement.\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiff does not contend that it ever clarified to Defendant that \"cruise\" was the proper standard in the months leading up to the Agreement. This is further evidenced by Plaintiff's Vice\n   President's statement that there was \"[n]o need to change our guarantees,\" despite Plaintiff's knowledge of Defendant's potential \"mission\" interpretation.

The provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Seller guarantees to Purchaser that there will be a 2.5% Performance Improvement for each Aircraft with an installed System. Purchaser, in its sole discretion, shall have the option to\n   <em>\n    discontinue the purchase of Systems\n   </em>\n   if the aggregate Performance Improvement of the first ten Systems that are installed is less than 2.5% for the three-month period following installation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Dkt. No. [60-1] at 6 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant argues that it is not bound by the Purchase Orders to the extent it could discontinue the purchase of Systems when it determined that the Performance Improvement Guarantee was not satisfied by the first ten Systems. In contrast, Plaintiff argues that the Discontinue Clause only allows Defendant to stop purchasing\n   <em>\n    addi\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tional\n   </em>\n   Systems, as opposed to canceling prior System orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that its interpretation is reasonable in light of the Discontinue Clause's plain meaning. In particular, Defendant notes that to \"discontinue\" is \"to stop doing or providing something.\" Dkt. No. [72] at 16. And a purchase cannot be \"discontinued\" before it has been started, particularly when Defendant was under no obligation to purchase a set number of Systems. Dkt. No. [60-1] at 4. Therefore, Defendant contends that the right to discontinue cannot apply to additional purchases because, as those purchases have not been made, there is nothing to stop. Defendant argues that interpreting discontinue to refer to prior purchases is further bolstered by the fact that, under the Agreement, a purchase was a multi-step process that took roughly two years to complete\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the initial Purchase Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Discontinue Clause only applies to additional purchases. Plaintiff contends the Agreement contemplates that Defendant would purchase up to 117 Systems and increases each System's price if Defendant fails to purchase at least 102 Systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Therefore, Plaintiff argues there was an expectation, though not a requirement, that Defendant would purchase a large number of Systems. So, Defendant's refusal to purchase additional Systems if Performance Improvement was not met could constitute \"discontinu[ing]\" relative to the Agreement's expectations. Plaintiff argues its interpretation also avoids the uncertainty that Defendant's interpretation creates because of the Agreement's unique nature, Performance Improvement Guarantee, and two-year payment plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, it is unclear whether Defendant's interpretation would allow Defendant to cancel prior orders up until final payment was due more than two years after installation, or only within a reasonable time after testing revealed that Performance Improvement was not met based upon the first ten Systems' aggregate performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because each interpretation is a reasonable reading of the Discontinue Clause, the Clause is neither clear nor unambiguous. Therefore, the Court will look to rules of contract construction to resolve the ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiff's interpretation of the Discontinue Clause renders Article 1 of the Agreement redundant. Georgia law prohibits an interpretation that would render another contract provision redundant.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Pitts v. City of Atlanta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293240\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/323/70/\">\n    323 Ga.App. 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293240\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/323/70/\">\n    746 S.E.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Duke Galish, LLC v.

Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's interpretation giving Defendant the right to cancel additional purchases renders Article 1 redundant because Article 1 already gives Defendant that right as it expressly imposes no obligation on Defendant to place any orders at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [60-1] at 4 (\"Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller\n   <em>\n    up to\n   </em>\n   117 [Systems].\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, Plaintiff's interpretation does not necessarily render Article 1 redundant because discontinuing the purchase of Systems affects the price under Section 4.1.2 in a way that declining to purchase Systems to begin with does not. Section 4.1.2 states: \"The Price shall be increased by ten percent (10%) if less than 102 Systems are purchased by Purchaser, except when fewer than 102 Systems are purchased\n   <em>\n    pursuant to Section 3.1(b)\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added). Therefore, Section 3.1(b) may allow Defendant to discontinue the purchase of additional Systems without suffering a price increase, whereas Article 1 may allow Defendant to decline to purchase Systems subject to a price increase on the\n   Systems it does purchase. Thus, the construction rule against redundancy is not helpful in resolving the ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff looks to another construction rule and argues that \"discontinue\" cannot allow the cancellation of prior orders because the Agreement uses the term \"terminate\" in that context, such as in Section 6.4's Delay Clause. And \"when parties to the same contract use such different language to address parallel issues ... it is reasonable to infer that they intend this language to mean different things.\"\n   <em>\n    Taracorp, Inc. v.

No. [60-1] at 9 (emphasis added). In contrast, Section 3.1(b) allows Defendant to\n   <em>\n    discontinue\n   </em>\n   the purchase of Systems if Performance Improvement is not met. Plaintiff argues that because the word \"terminate\" applies to canceling prior orders in the delay context, if the parties wanted Defendant to have that right in the Performance Improvement context, the Agreement would have used \"terminate\" instead of \"discontinue\" in Section 3.1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, Defendant argues that Sections 3.1(b) and 6.4 are distinct and should not be conflated. Defendant notes that the termination in Section 6.4 deals with a single \"System\" if the delivery is delayed. In contrast, the discontinuation in Section 3.1(b) deals with plural \"Systems\" and is only exercisable after the first ten Systems have been purchased and tested, as opposed to their delivery dates. This is relevant because the more distinct the provisions are, the less \"parallel\" they are and the less weight the construction rule holds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taracorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412691\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/738/#p744\">\n    73 F.3d at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying the construction rule \"when parties to the same contract use such different language to address\n   <em>\n    parallel\n   </em>\n   issues\") (emphasis added). And the Discontinue and Delay Clauses are less \"parallel\" than the parallel issues in\n   <em>\n    Taracorp\n   </em>\n   which consisted of indemnification obligations regarding two different facilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412691\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/738/#p744\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, because the two provisions are not clearly parallel, the Court gives less weight to this parallel provision construction rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that Defendant's interpretation leads to inequitable results where Defendant could order all 117 Systems, forcing Plaintiff to begin manufacturing the Systems to meet Defendant's delivery schedule, and then cancel under the Discontinue Clause, leaving Plaintiff with uncompensated costs. Plaintiff argues this violates the principle that courts should \"endeavor to give a construction most equitable to the parties, and one which will not give one of them an unfair or unreasonable advantage over the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Hutto v.

And Exhibit C to the Agreement contains a break-down of the fourteen essential components of the System.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Thus, the Court finds that the Agreement clearly and unambiguously provides that the Performance Improvement System and related Price Reduction only apply to fully-installed Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant argues that whether its decision not to fully install the Systems waived the Price Reduction is a fact question for the jury. However, while the extent to which Defendant did not fully install Systems is a fact question for the jury, the Court can still decide as a matter of law the related contract interpretation issue, namely whether the Performance Improvement Guarantee and Price Reduction apply to partially-installed Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff did not mention that Defendant failed to fully install certain Systems in Plaintiff's statement of material facts, and therefore the Court cannot consider it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 56.1B(1)(d) (\"The Court will not consider any fact set out only in the brief and not in the movant's statement of undisputed facts.\").

Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to whether the Performance Improvement Guarantee applies to partially-installed Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Whether Defendant Can Delay Payments by Delaying Installation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to hold that under the Agreement Defendant cannot delay payments to Plaintiff by unilaterally delaying Systems installation. Defendant argues that because the Agreement was never modified to include a proposed induction schedule, a jury question exists on whether the parties intended for Defendant to be bound by any proposed schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Exhibit A of the Agreement includes only a blank proposed induction schedule. Dkt. No. [60-1] at 16. However, Plaintiff contends that after the parties signed the Agreement, Defendant sent Plaintiff a proposed induction schedule that ultimately became the final delivery schedule (\"Final Schedule\"). Dkt. No. [59-7] at 3-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant delayed payments by delaying installation after the Systems were timely delivered according to the Final Schedule in violation of Section 5.1.4 of the Agreement. Dkt. No. [60] at 27. Section 5.1.4 provides: \"Should Purchaser delay installation from the proposed induction schedule (if an Unexcused Delay), Purchaser shall make payment on the Systems for which installation was delayed as if the Systems were installed pursuant to the proposed induction schedule.\" Dkt. No. [60-1] at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff contends that though the Agreement itself does not include a proposed induction schedule, the Final Schedule is a clear extension of Exhibit A of the Agreement, and is also incorporated in the Agreement via Section 12.9. Section 12.9 states that \"references to this Agreement shall be deemed to include all Exhibits to this Agreement,\n   <em>\n    and all related documents.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (emphasis added). Plaintiff contends that this is also in line with Georgia law which provides that contracts may be supplemented by \"evidence of consistent additional terms.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-2-202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant argues that it did not improperly delay payments to Plaintiff under Section 5.1.4 because there is no \"proposed induction schedule\" recognized in the Agreement. Defendant notes that the proposed induction schedule in the actual Agreement is blank, and the parties did not amend the Agreement to include any of Defendant's subsequent proposed schedules. Therefore, Defendant argues that whether the parties intended Defendant to be bound by the Final Schedule is a jury issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, even if there is a jury question on whether the parties intended to be bound by the Final Schedule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court\n   can still decide whether Defendant can delay payments by delaying installation as a matter of contract construction. Section 12.9 states that the Agreement includes exhibits \"and all related documents.\" Dkt. No. [60-1] at 14. If a jury finds that the parties intended to be bound by the Final Schedule, then the Final Schedule would constitute a \"related document\" and thus part of the Agreement under Section 12.9. And since the Final Schedule would be part of the Agreement, Section 5.1.4 would bar Defendant from delaying payments to Plaintiff by delaying System installations relative to the Final Schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court finds that, should a jury determine that the parties intended to be bound by the Final Schedule, the Agreement does not allow Defendant to delay payments by delaying the installation date relative to the Final Schedule. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to whether Defendant can delay payments by delaying the installation date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Whether Defendant Can \"Set-off\" Payments Owed Under the Agreement\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to hold that the Agreement does not allow Plaintiff to set-off or recoup payments owed under the Agreement. Defendant argues that the Agreement's provision prohibiting \"set-offs\" does not apply to \"recoupment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Agreement specifically provides that \"[a]ll payments required under this Agreement will be made in full without set-off or counterclaim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has withheld at least $500,000 in payments Defendant owes to Plaintiff. Dkt. No. [60-19] at 2-3. Plaintiff argues that though Defendant characterized its withholding as a \"recoupment,\" a recoupment is a type of set-off and is therefore also not allowed under the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crow v.

In contrast, \"a recoupment is a right of the defendant to have a deduction from the amount of the plaintiff's damages because the plaintiff has not complied with the cross-obligations or independent covenants\n   <em>\n    arising under the contract being sued upon.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572697\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/288/326/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-7-2. Therefore, the Agreement provision prohibiting set-offs does not necessarily apply to recoupment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In its reply brief, Plaintiff argues that even if recoupment is separate from set-offs, the Court should still hold that the Agreement prohibits recoupment because (1) the clear intent of the Agreement was to require payment in full; (2) the Agreement did not provide for a right to recoupment; and (3) courts often merge the concepts of setoff and recoupment. Plaintiff also argues in its reply brief that Defendant cannot recoup because recoupment is considered to be a \"counterclaim\" which, like set-offs, the Agreement waives. Dkt. No. [83] at 19. However, because Plaintiff only raised these arguments in its reply brief, the Court will not consider them at this time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Egidi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870712,4103333\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/1156/\">\n    571 F.3d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"Arguments not\n   properly presented in a party's initial brief or raised for the first time in the reply brief are deemed waived.\"). Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to whether the Agreement allows Defendant to recoup payments to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
