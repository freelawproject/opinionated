BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   AAM filed suit against Neapco on December 18, 2015, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,774,911 (the \"'911 patent\"), 8,176,613 (the \"'613 patent\"), and 8,528,180 (the \"'180 patent\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 1) The pending motions are principally (if not entirely) addressed to the '911 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The '911 patent\"generally relates to shaft assemblies for transmitting rotary power in a driveline and more particularly to a method for attenuating driveline vibrations transmitted through a shaft assembly.\" ( '911 patent col. 1:4-7) The reason for attenuating such vibrations is to reduce the tonal noise that can be heard by occupants in the vehicle as a result of the vibrations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 1:8-23) \"Modern automotive propshafts are commonly formed of relatively thin-walled steel or aluminum tubing and as such, can be receptive to various driveline excitation sources,\" which \"can typically cause the propshaft to vibrate in a bending (lateral) mode, a torsion mode and a shell mode.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 1:39-44) Several techniques existed in the prior art \"to attenuate vibrations in propshafts including the use of weights and liners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 1:53-54) However, many of the prior art liners only attenuate shell mode vibrations and not also bending or torsion mode vibrations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 2:34-38) The '911 patent purports to provide \"an improved method for damping various types of vibrations in a hollow shaft,\" which facilitates the damping of shell mode vibration as well as bending mode vibration and/or torsion mode vibration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 2:40-43)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 7, 2017, the Court issued its Claim Construction Opinion (D.I. 113), which found certain claims of the '911 patent indefinite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 11, 2017, the parties filed motions with respect to the claims that remained asserted after the Court's Claim Construction Opinion. In particular, the motions were directed to '911 patent claims 22-24, 26, 27, 31, and 34-36 (the \"Original Claims\"). (D.I. 149, 155, 157, 159) The parties completed briefing on their initial motions on September 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the meantime, on September 6, 2017, the Court granted AAM's motion for reconsideration of the Claim Construction Opinion, finding that new evidence demonstrated that Defendants had failed to prove that any of the claims of the '911 patent were indefinite. (D.I. 180) The Court then ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing to address how the pending motions might apply to the claims that had been initially invalidated as indefinite, but were now newly-revived in the case. In particular, the supplemental briefing relates to claims 1-6, 12, 13, and 19-21 of the '911 patent (the \"New Claims,\" and collectively with the Original Claims, the \"Asserted Claims\"). (D.I. 188) The parties submitted supplemental briefs and motions on December 1, 2017 and responsive briefs on December 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Collectively, the parties filed a total of 287 pages of briefing in relation to their many motions. The Court heard oral argument on January 18, 2018.

Step One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With respect to step one, the issue presented is whether the Asserted Claims as a whole are directed to laws of nature: Hooke's law and friction damping. AAM does not dispute that Hooke's law is the linear relationship between force\n   <em>\n    F\n   </em>\n   and displacement\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   of a spring with stiffness\n   <em>\n    k\n   </em>\n   , specifically F=\n   <em>\n    kx.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 160 at 6; D.I. 160-4 at \u00b6 389) AAM also does not dispute that the frequency is affected by a change in mass\n   <em>\n    m\n   </em>\n   or stiffness\n   <em>\n    k.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 150 at 29-30; D.I. 151 at 496 (inventor Sun testifying frequency is changed by adjusting mass and stiffness); D.I. 153 at 142 (AAM executive director testifying, \"the natural frequency is strictly a function of stiffness and mass\"); D.I. 160 at 6) Furthermore, AAM's expert stated that friction damping, or the reduction in friction, \"is a property of physics experienced by any two surfaces in contact.\" (D.I. 172 at 6 (quoting D.I. 160-4 at \u00b6 396);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 150 at 30-31)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Neapco argues, \"[t]he Asserted Claims do nothing more than use a prior art liner design (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , cardboard having, for certain embodiments, elastomer winding) and apply (or just characterize) the physics behind 'tuning' and vibration attenuation or damping.\" (D.I. 150 at 28) Therefore, Neapco asserts, in order to \"tune\" the liner, one merely applies Hooke's law and then measures the amount of damping. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 150 at 29; Tr. at 53)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court agrees with Neapco. There is no dispute that adjusting the mass and stiffness of the liner will change the amount of damping of a certain frequency. The claimed methods are applications of Hooke's law with the result of friction damping. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 151 at 496 (inventor Sun testifying that \"tuning\" is \"basic physics\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   AAM's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. AAM contends that the Asserted Claims are patent-eligible because they are directed to industrial processes for manufacturing very large automotive components, rather than any law of nature or natural phenomenon. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 160 at 5; Tr. at 21 (arguing \"[m]ethod of manufacturing a prop shaft is not some law of nature\") ) But the Asserted Claims do not disclose a method of manufacturing a propshaft; instead, considered as a whole, they are directed to the mere application of Hooke's law, and they fail to instruct\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to design the tuned liners or manufacture the driveline system to attenuate vibrations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.

AAM's other argument-that the tuned liners in the propshaft make up a complex system with multiple degrees of freedom, so Hooke's law, which relates to \"a very simple spring and mass,\" does not apply (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.I. 160 at 6; Tr. at 22)-also fails. There is no genuine dispute of material fact that a liner with multiple degrees of\n   freedom may be broken down mathematically into multiple, single degrees of freedom, and Hooke's law can then be applied to each individually. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 151 at 512 (inventor Sun testifying, \"a tunable liner theoretically or mathematically can be simplified as just single degree[s] of freedom[ ] of mass spring systems,\" and if one breaks down each of the modes, \"they're all a combination of [ ] single degree[s] of freedom[ ]\"); D.I. 173-1 at 45 (Neapco's expert explaining if one has a multi-degree of freedom system, then \"you're going to be applying Hooke's Law in a couple of axes\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Looking at the \"focus\" of the claims and their \"character as a whole,\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

First is the claim limitation \"tuning a mass and a stiffness of at least one liner,\" which the Court has construed as \"controlling a mass and stiffness of at least one liner to configure the liner to match a relevant frequency or frequencies.\" (D.I. 113 at 6) But this claim limitation is just the application of Hooke's law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AAM argues that this element makes the claim inventive because \"[p]rior to this invention, people used untuned liners and just put them in the prop shaft in hopes of getting some general damping,\" whereas the claimed method requires one \"to actually target certain frequencies and modes.\" (Tr. at 23) One's intentional act of controlling the characteristics of a liner is not inventive, because, as Neapco explained at oral argument, controlling the characteristics of a liner \"is just an inherent part of any design process.\" (Tr. at 33) Since Hooke's law governs the relationship between mass, stiffness, and frequency, the \"tuning\" claim limitation does nothing more than suggest that a noise, vibration, and harshness (\"NVH\") engineer (D.I. 156 at 5) consider that law of nature when designing propshaft liners to attenuate driveline vibrations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   AAM argues that a second inventive concept is that the Asserted Claims cover a dual-tuned liner to absorb vibrations in both bending and shell modes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22-24), as reflected in the claim limitation \"wherein the at least one liner is a tuned resistive absorber for attenuating shell mode vibrations and wherein the at least one liner is a tuned reactive absorber for attenuating bending mode vibrations.\" In the Court's view, this claim limitation is, instead, the result that is achieved from performing the method rather than an active step in the method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, as in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/\">\n    566 U.S. at 79-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Asserted Claims \"inform a relevant audience [NVH engineers] about certain laws of nature [Hooke's law and friction damping]; any additional steps consist of well-understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community [inserting liners with certain characteristics into propshafts to attenuate driveline vibrations]; and those steps, when viewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum of their parts taken separately [having the same, but potentially slightly improved, effect of attenuating certain frequencies and modes of driveline vibrations].\" Hence, as in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , the Asserted Claims here are not patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court further agrees with Neapco that another obstacle to the Asserted Claims being patent-eligible is that they \"are not directed to any specific, discrete liner design but rather a solution to the problem of attenuating shell and bending mode vibrations generally by applying physics.\" (D.I. 172 at 9)\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n    830 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides support for this conclusion.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Asserted Claims of the '911 patent are invalid under \u00a7 101, as they are directed to nonpatentable subject matter. Thus, the Court will grant Neapco's motion for summary judgment with respect to \u00a7 101 and will deny AAM's cross-motion on the same issue. The other motions-with the exception of AAM's motion directed to striking testimony from Neapco's damages expert-will be denied as moot. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    At the hearing, Neapco advised the Court they did not think the Court would need to resolve infringement issues if it determined the patent is not eligible for patentability. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. at 54) While AAM stated it preferred the Court to rule on all the issues before it, AAM recognized that the Court could exercise its discretion on this matter. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 74) It appears that the only motion that may arguably remain ripe is AAM's motion to preclude Neapco's damages expert, Mr. Chase. (D.I. 157)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Since the hearing on these motions, the Federal Circuit has expressly observed that the patent eligibility inquiry, which is a question of law, may involve issues of fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Berkheimer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1368\">\n     881 F.3d at 1368\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But here the record reveals no genuine disputes of material fact. The parties here do not dispute that the non-tuning claim limitations are well-understood, routine, and conventional.
