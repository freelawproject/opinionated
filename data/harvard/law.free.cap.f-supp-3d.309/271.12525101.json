Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this action, Plaintiff City of Philadelphia, which has in place policies that \"seek to foster trust\" between immigrants and officers of the City, challenges the recent imposition by Defendant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Attorney General of the United States, of three immigration-related funding conditions on receipt of federal\n   law enforcement aid under the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (\"JAG\") program. (Am.

The City asserts the following six counts in its Amended Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Count I asserts that the Attorney General acted\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by imposing the Challenged Conditions. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-21, ECF 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Count II asserts that the imposition of the Challenged Conditions by the Attorney General violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the Challenge Conditions contravene the separation of powers.

Byrne JAG Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following facts are taken as true from the City's Amended Complaint. (ECF 84.) The federal funding program at issue in this case is the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (the \"JAG Program\" or the \"Byrne Program\"), which was formed in 2005 from a merger of the Edward Byrne Memorial Formula Grant Program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) The Byrne JAG Program is a formula grant, whose authorizing statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010151\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , allows states and localities to use grant awards for a wide variety of purposes, such as personnel, equipment, training, and other criminal justice needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010152\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) ) Since the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program was created in 2005, the City has applied for, and received, awards each year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) The City plans to use its FY 2017 funds to provide use-of-force training to officers, support collaborations with inner-city youth, and provide doses of naloxone to Philadelphia police officers to counteract opioid overdoses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Challenged Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2016, the Office of Justice Programs added a condition on Byrne JAG funds, applicable to fiscal year 2017 and thereafter, requiring applicant jurisdictions to certify compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Certification Condition\").

(Am. Compl. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In late July 2017, the Attorney General announced two new conditions on every grant provided by the JAG Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The two new conditions require, first, that local authorities provide federal agents advance notice of the scheduled release from state or local correctional facilities of certain individuals suspected of immigration violations (the \"Notice Condition\"), and, second, that local authorities provide immigration agents with access to City detention facilities and individuals detained therein (the \"Access Condition\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Office of Justice Programs described the three new conditions applicable to JAG recipients as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    The Notice Condition\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A State statute, or a State rule, regulation, policy, or practice, must be in place that is designed to ensure that, when a State (or State-contracted) correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in such facility, then such facility will honor such request and-as early as practicable-provide the requested notice to DHS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    The Access Condition\n   </strong>\n   A State statute, or a State rule, regulation, policy, or practice, must be in place that is designed to ensure that agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact are given access to any State (or State-contracted) correctional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to inquire as to such individuals' right to be or remain in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    The Certification Condition\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The applicant local government must submit the required \"Certification of Compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" (executed by the chief legal officer of the local government).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Award Letter to Greenville, SC at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 55, ECF 21-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Philadelphia Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Philadelphia has a number of policies in place intended to \"engender trust with the City's immigrant community\" that are relevant to this case and the Challenged Conditions. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Police Department Memorandum 01-06\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In 2001, the Philadelphia Police Department issued a memorandum prohibiting its officers from unnecessarily disclosing individuals' immigration status, subject to three exceptions: \"(1) required by law, or (2) the immigrant requests, in writing, that the information be provided, to verify his or her immigration status, or (3) the immigrant is suspected of engaging in criminal activity, including attempts to obtain public assistance benefits through the use of fraudulent documents.\" (Mem. 01-06 at 1-2, ECF 1-3.) Memorandum 01-06 states also that \"[t]he Philadelphia Police Department will continue to cooperate with federal authorities in investigating and apprehending immigrants suspected of criminal activities. However, immigrants who are victims of crimes will not have their status as an immigrant transmitted in any manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Confidentiality Order\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In 2008, then-mayor Michael Nutter signed the \"Confidentiality Order,\" Executive Order 08-09, which prevents city officers outside of law enforcement from \"inquir[ing] about a person's immigration status unless: (1) documentation of such person's immigration status is legally required for the determination of program, service or benefit eligibility or the provision of services; or (2) such officer or employee is required by law to inquire about such person's immigration status.\" (Exec. Order 08-09 at 2, ECF 1-4.) With respect to law enforcement, the Confidentiality Order states that \"Law enforcement officers shall not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) inquire about a person's immigration status, unless the status itself is a necessary predicate of a crime the officer is investigating or unless the status is relevant to identification of a person who is suspected of committing a crime (other than mere status as an undocumented alien);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (3) inquire about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or others who call or approach the police seeking help; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (4) inquire regarding immigration status for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The following section ordered law enforcement officers \"to cooperate with state and federal authorities in investigating and apprehending individuals who are suspected of criminal activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Executive Order 5-16\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In 2016, Mayor James F. Kenney signed Philadelphia Executive Order No. 5-16, which outlined the circumstances under which Philadelphia prison facilities honor requests to hold inmates pending immigration proceedings. Executive Order 5-16 states in Section 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   No person in the custody of the City who otherwise would be released from custody shall be detained pursuant to an ICE civil immigration detainer request pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20287.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nor shall notice of his or her pending release be provided, unless such person is being released after conviction for a first or second degree felony involving violence and the detainer is supported by a judicial warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Exec. Order 5-16 at 1-2, ECF 1-6.) A subsequent memorandum issued to the Prisons Commissioner clarified that \"the Department of Prisons is directed to cooperate with all federal agencies, including ICE, when presented with a judicial warrant,\" irrespective of whether \"such person is being released from custody after conviction for a first or second degree felony involving violence.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ICE Interview Protocol\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2017, the Philadelphia Department of Prisons implemented a new policy allowing ICE to interview inmates only if the inmate consents in writing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) When ICE seeks to interview a prisoner, the Philadelphia Department of Prisons provides a consent form informing the inmate that \"ICE interviews are voluntary\"; \"[y]ou have the right to remain silent\"; \"[y]ou may request to have an attorney present during any interview\"; and \"[i]f you are already in removal (deportation) proceedings, you have the right to have your immigration lawyer present during any questioning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ICE interview consent form, ECF 1-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Participation in Federal Databases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Philadelphia law enforcement employ several case management databases visible to or managed by federal law enforcement agencies, which \"provide[ ] the federal government notice about-and identifying information for-persons stopped, detained, arrested, or convicted of a crime in the City.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 55.) The federal government, in turn, \"can use information derived from those databases to obtain knowledge about undocumented persons of interest in the City.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shared databases include the Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System (PARS), the Automated Fingerprint Information System (AFIS), and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The City asserts that ICE generates detainer requests based on the information used in AFIS, which is maintained by the FBI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On August 30, 2017, the City filed a six-count Complaint in this Court (ECF 1). On September 28, 2017, the City filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 21). The Attorney General responded to the City's Motion on October 12, 2016 (ECF 28) and the City replied on October 19, 2017 (ECF 46). Several amicus briefs were filed in support of the City's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (Brief of County of Amici Curiae Santa Clara et al., ECF 45; Brief of Amici Curiae Philadelphia Social and Legal Services Organizations, Philadelphia ECF 49; Brief of Amici Curiae Administrative Law, Constitutional Law, and Immigration Law Scholars, ECF 50; Brief of Amici Curiae ACLU, et al., ECF 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n   on October 26, 2017, during which testimony was received from multiple City officials. Oral argument on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction occurred on November 2, 2017. On November 15, 2017, this Court issued a memorandum and order granting the requested Preliminary Injunction. (ECF 74, 75.) The memorandum concluded that the City was likely to succeed in its claims that the Challenged Conditions are unconstitutional under the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and general principles of federalism. Additionally, this Court concluded that the City had demonstrated that it was likely to succeed in proving that it is in substantial compliance with Section 1373, and as such, can properly certify its compliance with the Byrne JAG condition requiring as much. As a result, this Court issued an order preliminarily enjoining the Attorney General from rejecting the City's application for FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding, or withholding any FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding from the City on the basis of lack of compliance with Section 1373. The Attorney General appealed the Preliminary Injunction to the Third Circuit on January 16, 2018 (ECF 86), which appeal is now pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The City filed an Amended Complaint on January 8, 2018 (ECF 84), stating six causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   I.

The City responded on February 16, 2018 (ECF 119), and the Attorney General replied on February 28, 2018 (ECF 130).

(Def. Br. in Support of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def. Br.\") at 9, ECF 102.) The Attorney General asserts that DOJ has not yet made a decision in response to the City's FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding application, and as such could not possibly have imposed conditions on the grant of an award that has not yet been granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The City argues that the first requirement is met by the allegations that the Challenged Conditions were included in the JAG award to Greenville, South Carolina, which the DOJ represented in the Chicago litigation would provide the terms for every FY 2017 JAG grant, and that the DOJ represented at oral argument in this Court that it will not grant Philadelphia a JAG award until the Chicago appeal is\n   \"resolved.\" (Pl. Br. in Op. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pl. Br.\") at 11, ECF 119.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The City has alleged facts to properly make out final agency action on the part of the DOJ in imposing the Challenged Conditions on the FY 2017 at the Motion to Dismiss stage. The Amended Complaint alleges that prior to the application deadline for FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants the DOJ publicly announced that all grant recipients must comply with all three of the Challenged Conditions-the Section 1373 condition, the advance notification condition, and the jail access condition. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92, 97.) The Amended Complaint further alleges that if it is required to comply with these conditions as the DOJ construes them in order to receive its grant money, the City will have to significantly alter its policies, to the detriment of public health and safety.

The City responds that by \"imposing conditions on federal spending that Congress itself has not, the Attorney General has usurped Congress' appropriations power.\" (Pl. Br. at 24.) The City argues that imposition of the Challenged Conditions amounts to an unconstitutional refusal to disburse funds that Congress had already appropriated, in violation of the President's duty to \"take Care that the Law be faithfully executed,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

Article I of the U.S. Constitution states that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power ... to ... provide for the ... general Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 76.) Following the report, the Assistant Attorney General announced that in response to this report the Office of Justice Programs determined that Section 1373 is an \"applicable\" federal law under the Byrne JAG program, and that JAG grantees must certify compliance with Section 1373. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) On April 21, 2017 the DOJ sent a letter to Philadelphia instructing the City that it must certify compliance with Section 1373 pursuant to its receipt of funds under the Byrne JAG program in 2016. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 83.) The City alleges that no explanation was given then, or has since been given, for the decision to require\n   Section 1373 compliance. The jail access and advance notification conditions were announced on July 25, 2017. The City alleges that the DOJ did not offer satisfactory explanations for how it arrived at any of these three conditions, alternatives that were considered, or what purpose of the JAG program they further. A review of the relevant documents relied on in the Complaint and thus available for our consideration at the Motion to Dismiss stage confirms that the City has in fact properly made out its claim that the Attorney General's decision to impose the Challenged Conditions was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Indeed, the \"Backgrounder on Grant Requirements\" published by the DOJ identified \"the goal of increasing information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement\" in order to \"ensur[e] that federal immigration authorities have the information they need to enforce the law and keep our communities safe,\" but failed to specify how the Challenged Conditions would achieve that end. (ECF 1-1). A July 6, 2017 press release from the DOJ repeated similar concerns, again without detailing the connection to the Challenged Conditions. (ECF 1-2). Exchanges on May 31, 2016 and July 7, 2016 between the Inspector General to the Attorney General's office are largely descriptive of the investigative process it undertook into several jurisdictions' level of compliance with Section 1373, and lack any thorough evaluation of why requiring compliance would further the purpose of the Byrne JAG program. (ECF 1-10, 11.) DOJ guidance materials on the imposition of the Challenged Conditions are likewise thin on this subject. (ECF 1-12, 13, 15, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   At the Motion to Dismiss stage, we cannot say that the City will be unable to establish that the DOJ has not properly explained its decision to impose the Challenged Conditions, or that the decision to impose the conditions runs counter to the evidence available to the DOJ, or an alternative theory that the decision was arbitrary and capricious. Based on the facts alleged, viewing them in the light most favorable to the City, the Court concludes that the City has plausibly stated a claim that the challenged conditions are arbitrary and capricious.

Citing legislative history evincing a Congressional desire to allow localities to develop their own solutions to criminal justice issues, the City argues that the Challenged Conditions, which seek to enforce immigration law, do not further the purposes of the Byrne JAG program, and impose unconstitutionally ambiguous requirements on the City. (City Br. at 29-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As with much of the briefing on the motion to dismiss, the parties mostly repeat their prior positions from the preliminary injunction phase. In its memorandum issued on November 15, 2017, the Court discussed at considerable length the reasons that the City was likely to succeed on the merits of its challenge to the imposition of the Challenged Conditions as violating the Spending Clause. The Court began by reviewing some basic principles of Spending Clause jurisprudence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Article I, Section 8, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the \"Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. Article I grants this power to Congress, and Congress alone. Nothing in Article II of the Constitution provides the Executive with any independent authority to spend, or withhold, federal funds that Congress has appropriated. Rather, the Executive is obligated to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Congress regularly appropriates money to be paid out to states and localities, and uses that financial leverage to induce policy changes at the state and local level. In this way, \"Congress may, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take.\"\n   <em>\n    Coll.

The Attorney General moves to dismiss this Count, arguing that because the Challenged Conditions are attached to a grant that the City is free to decline, the conditions cannot possibly violate the Tenth Amendment. (Def. Br. at 24.) The Attorney General further argues that the City has put forth a deficient facial challenge to Section 1373. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.) The City does not address the argument that it can turn down the grant and thus avoid complying with the conditions, but instead responds that it has properly stated a claim that the Challenged Conditions constitute affirmative commands on City employees and would therefore commandeer City officers and employees in violation of the Tenth Amendment. (Pl. Br. at 37.)

The Attorney General argues that the City has not stated a proper cause of action to seek this declaratory judgment. (Def. Br. at 28.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31.)

Having already determined that this case is ripe before this Court, the City's request for a declaratory judgment is appropriate, and we now conclude that the City has alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for declaratory relief at the Motion to Dismiss stage. The City's policies, as alleged, appear to comply with the requirements of Section 1373. The City alleges that it has no policy prohibiting the sharing of any immigration status information. Further, the City is correct that it would be a logical fallacy to conclude that policies that instruct City officials and employees not to collect immigration status information in certain contexts violate Section 1373-as the City points out in its Memorandum, \"Philadelphia cannot restrict the sharing of information it does not collect\" in the first place. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 154.) The City has made out a proper claim for a declaratory judgment that its policies are in compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
