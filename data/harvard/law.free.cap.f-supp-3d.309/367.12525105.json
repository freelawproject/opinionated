Am. Compl. \u00b6 14. Goodwin then discovered H.'s friends had been spreading rumors that she had consented to have sex with multiple PHS students the night of the rape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. About six weeks after the assault, in February 2015, Goodwin\n   told her mother and therapist about it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. In March 2015, Goodwin reported the rape to the police, who investigated the incident but never prosecuted it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. That same month, Goodwin's mother met with Assistant Principal Scott Hegen, the \"grade principal\" for Goodwin's sophomore class, and reported the rape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Hegen told Goodwin's mother that, because the assault took place off campus and H. had not been prosecuted, PHS could not take any disciplinary actions against H. or offer any accommodations to Goodwin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hegen's advice to Goodwin's mother was contrary to PSD policy, which specifically authorized the school to investigate reports of off-campus behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. PHS students regularly report harassment that involves off-campus behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. PSD failed to supervise and train its employees regarding its actual off-campus behavior policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, and also failed to train its staff and administrators in their obligations under Title IX to address sexual harassment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2015, a friend of Goodwin's sent her screen shots of text messages showing that H. and his friends intended to physically harm her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28 (messages from B. stated Goodwin \" 'is getting jumped' and 'needs to learn her place' \"). On another occasion, H. confronted Goodwin in the hallway during school hours using expletives and gender-specific language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Goodwin reported the harassment to Hegen and DeBona, who met with Goodwin to discuss the incidents, and then informed H.'s family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. No disciplinary action or remedial plan was undertaken.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DeBona has unreviewable authority to resolve harassment complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By May 2015, Goodwin was regularly missing classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. She submitted a letter to Hegen from her psychiatrist and therapist stating that her absences were due to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. PSD did not propose an individualized education plan or safety plan to accommodate Goodwin's PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. Goodwin completed her sophomore year at home and returned only for final examinations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2015, Goodwin's mother contacted Hegen and asked PHS to ensure Goodwin's safety at school during the coming year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. She also asked for the contact information for PSD's Title IX coordinator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. Hegen did not know who the Title IX coordinator was or what she did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. After conducting additional research, Hegen informed Goodwin's mother that the PSD Title IX coordinator was Jacqui McHale, and provided McHale's contact information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 24, 2015, Goodwin's mother emailed McHale, described the harassment Goodwin had endured as well as her reaction, and requested that PHS ensure Goodwin did not share any classes with H. or his friends N., B., and C., who had participated in the harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. She offered to provide McHale copies of the harassing text messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   McHale arranged to meet with Goodwin's mother on September 2, 2015, after Goodwin's junior year had begun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. McHale also invited DeBona, Hegen, and Troy Price, the administrator in charge of student affairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. DeBona chose not to attend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. On September 1, 2015, Goodwin's mother sent McHale a timeline of harassment-related events and a powerpoint presentation on Title IX.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Goodwin's junior year schedule included a study hall shared with H., and lunch period with N., B., and C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. At the meeting, the administrators refused to change the schedules of H., N., B., or C. because they were seniors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   They gave Goodwin the option of removing herself from their classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also informed Goodwin's mother that H. would likely be assigned to a different study hall location for unrelated reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That same month, Goodwin's mother spoke with Superintendent Rattigan about the school district's inadequate response to the ongoing harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. Rattigan advised Goodwin's mother to direct her concerns to DeBona.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For two weeks after the meeting with administrators, Goodwin shared a study hall with H., even though he was supposed to have been moved to a different location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. During this time period, Goodwin's mother sent multiple emails asking about the move.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although PSD administrators told her they were working on it, they failed to provide updated information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During her junior year, Goodwin was consistently put in close proximity with H., B., C., and N. during study halls, lunch, and assemblies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. C., N., and B. were never removed from Goodwin's lunch period, and sat two tables away from her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Goodwin would often retreat to the library rather than stay near them, which isolated her from her peers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Goodwin's mother requested that Goodwin be informed ahead of time if she would be in the same space as her harassers, but PHS regularly failed to provide advance notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. One example of this failure occurred in October 2015, during an assembly for Goodwin's World Culture Class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Also during October 2015, H. threw a female student to the ground during a game of musical chairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. Hegen praised H. for this, which Goodwin understood to be part of a pattern of encouraging H.'s violence against female classmates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goodwin regularly reported behavior of H., N., B., and C. to PHS officials, including DeBona, as Rattigan had advised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. Nonetheless, PHS officials rarely intervened and, when they did, their actions did not end the harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, Goodwin and H. attended a college fair during spring 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because he was a senior, H. had no reason to attend the college fair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goodwin informed Hegen of H.'s presence and Hegen asked H. to leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When H. refused, Hegen took no further action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Goodwin was subjected to verbal and physical harassment nearly every day during her junior year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. On December 27, 2015, the one-year anniversary of Goodwin's rape, C. sent her a harassing text message.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Goodwin's mother reported the harassment to DeBona, Rattigan, McHale, and Hegen on January 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Hegen agreed it was a harassing text, PSD took no action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Goodwin withdrew from many activities due to the ongoing harassment, including attending football and basketball games, regularly attending classes, and participating in the debate team and student council.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. Her G.P.A. dropped from a 3.9 to a 3.2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also turned down a nomination to become student council president.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In spring 2016, Goodwin confronted Hegen about his inadequate response to her harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. He suggested she leave PHS and attend the alternative school, whose student population consisted primarily of expelled students and students with behavioral challenges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In early April 2016, C. shoved Goodwin in the hallway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. Goodwin asked DeBona to set up a meeting with C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DeBona declined because she claimed \"this information is confidential.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 7, 2016, Goodwin's mother emailed the guidance counselor, Erik Henryson, requesting\n   that the school coordinate with Goodwin's therapist to accommodate her PTSD, and asking administrators to instruct C. not to interact with Goodwin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. Goodwin's mother referenced Goodwin's Title IX rights in this email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Henryson agreed to meet with Goodwin, C., and DeBona.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. During the April 11, 2016 meeting, the administrators asked Goodwin to explain why she had called the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. DeBona alleged the meeting was a waste of time because Goodwin was in no danger, and concluded the meeting by telling Goodwin and C. to do their best to avoid each other.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   That day, Goodwin's mother emailed PSD officials and informed them Goodwin would transfer schools due to the district's failure to address the sexual harassment and/or accommodate Goodwin's PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. In an email response on April 12, 2016, DeBona encouraged Goodwin's mother to consider private school, cyber school, and homeschooling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Goodwin spent the rest of her junior year enrolled in an experimental pilot cyber school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. She was unable to take non-academic courses, such as music or art, and was limited to courses that did not correspond to her PHS classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She could not continue taking honors-level courses, and was required to retake French 2 to meet her credit requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although she had once been a \"straight A\" student, Goodwin failed her keystone exam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PHS offered no accommodations based on her PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   H., N., B., and C. graduated from PHS in June 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the end of September 2016, Goodwin re-enrolled at PHS for her senior year, after H., N., B., and C. had graduated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. She enrolled in a dual program with Bucks Community College for her fall semester.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She struggled with PTSD and often missed classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In October 2016, B. was allowed back into PHS for a military recruiting event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. PSD did not warn Goodwin ahead of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Goodwin did not see B. when he returned to PHS, she felt unsafe knowing her tormentors could return without notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goodwin spoke with Henrysen about B.'s return, and Henrysen told her the harassers would not be allowed on school premises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   One week later, H. visited PHS for another military recruitment event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. He was let on campus by David Laboski, an assistant principal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   H. wandered the halls unattended and visited Goodwin's classroom, although she was not there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goodwin's mother emailed Rattigan, DeBona, and other administrators, asking why B. and H. had been allowed to return, and requesting advance notice of their presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. DeBona explained H. had been allowed on campus because Laboski had not been instructed otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. DeBona promised PHS would address the harassment and keep Goodwin safe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   During her senior year, Goodwin learned about another girl, M., who had been harassed based on her race and sex while a student at PHS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. PHS had refused to discipline M.'s harassers because some of the harassment had occurred off-campus, and had also encouraged her to drop out of PHS and attend the alternative school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   More recently, Goodwin learned that another classmate was also sexually harassed by her classmates throughout her high school career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even though the classmate reported the harassment, PHS refused to discipline the harassers and ultimately forced her to transfer to the alternative school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In early May 2017, Goodwin contacted Hegen to ensure she would not see B., who was dating another PHS senior, at her\n   prom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71.

At that meeting, however, Hegen told Goodwin's mother, in contravention of PSD's own policy, that no investigation or discipline could be imposed on H. because the sexual assault took place off campus. Am. Compl. \u00b6 19. Defendants also list the meeting they held with Goodwin regarding the verbal harassment and physically threatening text messages. Def. Br. at 8. After this meeting, however, during which Goodwin showed Defendants screen shots of threats against her, the defendants took no disciplinary action. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.

Def. Br. at 8. But when Goodwin's mother first asked for the name of the Title IX coordinator, Hegen had no idea who held that position or what it entailed. Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. Defendants cite Hegen's research to identify PSD's Title IX coordinator as additional evidence that its response to Goodwin's complaints was not \"clearly unreasonable.\" Def. Br. at 8. Viewed in a light most favorable to Goodwin, however, it is \"clearly unreasonable\" for an agent in Hegen's position of principal to be ignorant of\n   Title IX and which school official had enforcement responsibility for it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3 (failure to train claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Similarly, Defendants claimed they took four actions in response to Goodwin's mother's request for a meeting in August 2015: (1) responding to the request; (2) holding the meeting; (3) discussing changing student schedules and ultimately changing one student's study hall; and (4) responding to inquiries about moving the study hall. Def. Br. at 8. As alleged in the Amended Complaint, however, Goodwin's mother requested reassurances about the upcoming school year. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-39.

Such allegations of actions by PSD's authorized agents are sufficient to plead a custom or practice of failing to address complaints of harassment against PSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As to Rattigan, Goodwin alleges she is a \"final policymaker,\" with power over \"a number of matters, including expulsions for repeated physical assaults and aggressive behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.
