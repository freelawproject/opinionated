[DN 1, at 2.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to its website, the company was founded in 1973 by George Otis (\"Otis\"). [www.highadventure.org.] Otis has since passed away and Jackie Yockey, (\"Yockey\"), is now the President and Chief Executive Officer of High Adventure. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] According to her Bio on the company's website, Yockey \"has established a radio studio that is sending the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout Israel and around the world from Jerusalem.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Yockey's Bio further notes that, in addition to the radio station, High Adventure has three internet television stations and provides radios to people across the globe to further spread its religious message.

[DN 1, at 4.] Tayloe began his career with High Adventure \"in 1986 as a radio announcer, and ultimately served as Executive Vice President of the company and Corporate Director.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] According to High Adventure's Complaint, by virtue of \"his position at High Adventure, Tayloe had access to all of the confidential material of the company, including detailed donor lists and operating information\" about the company. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.] Due to internal \"discord\" concerning the manner and direction of the management of High Adventure, Tayloe was fired from the company in 1996. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.] High Adventure brought Tayloe back into the fold soon thereafter, but he was again fired. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In 1998, High\n   Adventure hired Tayloe a third time, but fired him again in 1999. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to High Adventure's Complaint, Tayloe incorporated Defendant company Strategic Communications Group, Inc., (\"SCG\"), \"[a]t some point in 1998.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] SCG \"operates radio stations in the vicinity of Simi Valley, [California,] including country music stations as well as Christian broadcasting.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.] SCG apparently has a similar company vision as Otis had for High Adventure: namely, the establishment and operation of radio stations in the Middle East to spread a religious message.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.] High Adventure asserts that SCG \"claims to be involved in international gospel radio broadcasting to 'honor the original vision of George Otis,' the founder of Plaintiff High Adventure Ministries and Voice of Hope,\" and that SCG \"acquired the domain name of 'voiceofhope' and promotes, markets, and advertises its radio stations and other services through traditional commerce channels and at the website www.voiceofhope.com.

[DN 16, at 7.] Indeed, in Tayloe's second affidavit, he avers that \"Nichols never donated any money to [SCG].\" [DN 16-1, at 2.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    High Adventure's claims in this case are for: false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets, federal unfair competition, common law unfair competition and trademark claims, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, a declaratory judgment, and a civil RICO Act claim.

High Adventure's claims for false advertising and unfair competition stem from Defendants' use of a website and the term \"voice or hope,\" which, in High Adventure's view, misleads the public and potential donors into believing a connection exists between Defendants and High Adventure. [DN 1, at 10-15.] High Adventure\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    mention its donor list in its misappropriation of trade secrets claim, although it does not allege that Nichols was on that list nor does it allege that Tayloe obtained Nichols' name or contact information from that list. [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12-13.] High Adventure's trademark infringement and dilution claims do not relate directly to any alleged solicitations made by Tayloe, and do not name Nichols either. [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16-18.] High Adventure's claim for a declaratory judgment points again to Defendants' allegedly improper use of the \"voice of hope\" name in connection with its business. [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19.] Finally, while High Adventure's civil RICO Act claim\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    mention Defendants' allegedly improper solicitation of former High Adventure donors, the Complaint does not provide any specific allegations concerning the names and/or residencies of these individuals, instead merely alleging misrepresentations by Defendants \"domestically and abroad,\" while focusing in particular on contacts Defendants allegedly had with individuals in Israel. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-23.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The \"operative facts of the controversy\" relate, for the most part, to trademark and misappropriation issues concerning Defendants' allegedly improper use of the \"voice of hope\" phrase. To be sure, High Adventure's claims touch on Tayloe's alleged solicitation of either current or former High Adventure donors (and improperly taking lists containing donor names), but none of these individuals are named, nor are their residencies; therefore, the Court has nothing in the way of evidence that any of the alleged harms done to High Adventure were proximately caused by actions taken by Defendants directed at Kentucky. Indeed, as the Court noted above, Nichols reached out to Tayloe, not the other way around, and no donation was ever made. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DN 16-1, at 2-3.] At best then, some of High Adventure's claims may be tangentially related to Tayloe's contact with Nichols in September 2016, but the connection remains insufficient to satisfy this second prong.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The third prong asks whether \"the acts of the defendant or consequences caused by the defendant...have a substantial enough connection with the forum state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant reasonable.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beydoun\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264583\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/499/#p505\">\n     768 F.3d at 505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Moreover, \"even assuming,\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    , that [High Adventure's] interest in obtaining relief counsels in favor of a finding of reasonableness\" under the third prong, \"the other two factors weigh heavily against such a finding.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beydoun\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264583\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/499/#p505\">\n     768 F.3d at 508\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In its Response to the instant Motion, High Adventure, in arguing that the ends of justice require this Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants, states the following: \"[i]n a RICO action, the 'ends of justice' require nationwide service of process to further the congressional intent of allowing 'plaintiffs to bring all members of a nationwide [ ] conspiracy before a court in a single trial.' \" [DN 14, at 6 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Butcher's Union\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569602\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/535/#p539\">\n     788 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    539 ).] However, the language from\n    <em>\n     Butchers Union\n    </em>\n    explicitly refers to a \"nationwide [ ] conspiracy.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569602\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/535/#p539\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Here, there are allegations against a single individual, John Tayloe, and SCG, the company of which he is Chief Executive Officer and a co-founder. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DN 11-1, at 1.] There are no overly complicated jurisdictional issues concerning numerous defendants across multiple states or countries such that this Court would consider utilizing the RICO jurisdictional provision to bring these two Defendants to Kentucky to stand trial. Accordingly, the Court rejects High Adventure's RICO jurisdiction argument under these facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Service of Process\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The other component of Defendants' Motion to dismiss the action against them concerns what they characterize to have been insufficient service of process.
