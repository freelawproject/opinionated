The Site &amp; Alleged Liability of PNI and MOLP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Nelson Tunnel/Commodore Waste Rock Pile Superfund Site (the \"Site\") is located in the San Juan Mountains, just north of the town of Creede, Colorado, in an area with a long history of silver mining. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) As alleged by the United States, mining activity commenced there by the 1890s and continued at least through the 1980s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In general terms, the United States alleges that over the course of many years, waste rock from mining excavations \"was cast down the mountainside into the West Willow Creek drainage,\" creating the Rockpile; and that \"[l]ayers of cribbing to contain waste rock\" and \"makeshift hydraulic structures to convey West Willow Creek over and under the [Rockpile] ... were installed over many years by several mining companies,\" including certain wooden flume structures and \"a steel pipe ... pieced together from parts of railroad tank cars.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this CERCLA case, the United States alleges that PNI and MOLP, as well as another related entity, Mesa Limited Partnership (\"MLP\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   conducted mining operations at the Site between 1983 and 1989 (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 22-26), using the Rockpile \"as the hub of their mining operations,\" and taking certain actions to alter or maintain the \"deteriorating cribbing\n   and water conveyance system\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the United States alleges that in 1988 Mesa retained an engineering firm which recommended that certain actions be taken to address the \"failing cribbing and water conveyance\" and the unstable Rockpile, but that Mesa did not complete those actions, thus failing to prevent a subsequent collapse of the water conveyance system and resulting \"washout\" that \"released mine waste contaminated with heavy metals ... into West Willow Creek\" and in turn into the Rio Grande River.

Corporate Entity History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The present Motion retells a lengthy corporate history somewhat in the fashion of an Old Testament genealogy, with one company begetting another, and another, through a series incorporations, name changes, sales, and mergers, dating from 1906 through 1997, when the transactions creating the present Defendants, Pioneer Natural Resources and Pioneer-USA were completed. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 at 5-35, \u00b6\u00b6 9-146.) However, the facts relevant to the presently disputed issues focus only on a few months in 1986, when PNI's parent, Pioneer Corporation, through a series of corporate actions, first merged a number of its subsidiaries into itself, and then transferred its assets and liabilities to Mesa. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 at 6-10, \u00b6\u00b6 13-34; ECF Nos. 46-7, 46-9, 46-11, 46-12.) The Court details each of the corporate actions and documents relevant to the present dispute in turn. The following facts are undisputed unless attributed otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    March 5, 1986 Conveyance Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As memorialized in an \"Agreement of Sale and Purchase,\" dated March 5, 1986 (the \"March 5, 1986 Agreement\" (ECF No. 46-7) ), Pioneer Corporation, MLP, and MOLP entered into an agreement for Pioneer Corporation to sell its assets to MLP, which would, \"[i]mmediately upon the acquisition of the assets,\" \"convey, transfer, and contribute the same to the MOLP,\" together with \"Assumed Liabilities,\" as defined by the March 5, 1986 Agreement. Several provisions of this document are relevant to the disputed issues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An initial recital states that the agreement was entered because Pioneer Corporation \"desire[d] to contribute to the Buyers ... all of the assets, properties, goodwill and business\" of Pioneer Corporation, \"as a going concern.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The subsequent \"Conveyance, Contribution and Transfer of Assets\" clause states that \"at the Closing,\" Pioneer \"will convey, transfer and contribute to the MLP the Seller's [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Pioneer Corporation's] Assets ... as provided in Section 3.9\" of the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, \u00a7 1.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 3.9 of the March 5, 1986 Agreement in turn provides that on or before closing, Pioneer Corporation\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   and each of its subsidiaries shall have taken all necessary action, including all necessary corporate action, to convey and transfer to the Seller [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Pioneer Corporation] all of the assets, properties and business and to cause the Seller to assume all liabilities and obligations, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, of each direct or indirect subsidiary of the Seller as shall be selected by the Buyers and specified to the Seller .... Such conveyances shall have been effective to vest in Seller all of the right, title and interest in such assets held by the Seller's subsidiaries immediately prior to such conveyances and to obligate the Seller to pay, perform or discharge all such liabilitie....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40, \u00a7 3.9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, Section 1.2 of the March 5, 1986 Agreement defines the \"consideration\" to be exchanged for the asset purchase, defining Mesa's obligations and agreement that Pioneer Corporation's assets would be delivered to MLP \"in exchange for\" a specified stock transfer, and \"MLP's assumption of and agreement to pay, perform or discharge the Assumed Liabilities,\" which were broadly defined to include \"all debts, liabilities, obligations, taxes and contracts of the Seller [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Pioneer Corporation] of any kind, character or description, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, no matter whether arising before or after the Closing Date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, \u00a7 1.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    June 26-27, 1986 Articles of Merger and Certificate of Merger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 26, 1986, Pioneer Corporation executed an \"Articles and Plan of Merger,\" reciting that Pioneer Corporation \"desire[d] to ... succeed to the debts, liabilities and duties of\" certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which Pioneer had agreed to convey to MLP. (ECF No. 46-9 at 3 (the \"Articles\").) The Articles also recited that \"Pioneer ... adopts the following Articles ... for the purpose of merging .... Pioneer Nuclear Inc. [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , PNI, together with other subsidiaries] with and into Pioneer [Corporation], with Pioneer [Corporation] being the surviving corporation.\" (ECF No. 46-9 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Significantly, the Articles listed PNI among the listed subsidiaries which, on the effective date of the merger, would \"be merged with and into Pioneer Corporation,\" with the effect that \"the separate existence of each Subsidiary shall cease,\" and Pioneer Corporation would thereafter \"have all the rights, privileges, immunities and powers and shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities of each Subsidiary\" (ECF No. 46-9 at 4-5, Arts. I, IV.A., IV.D.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 27, 1986, these Articles were filed with the Texas Secretary of State, which the same day issued a \"Certificate of Merger of Domestic Corporations into Pioneer Corporation\" (the \"Certificate of Merger\"), identifying PNI among the subsidiaries merged into Pioneer Corporation, and certifying that the Articles of Merger had been received by the Secretary of State and \"found to conform to law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    June 30, 1986 Conveyance and Closing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A \"Closing Memorandum\" recording the closing of the asset sale documents states that \"[t]he Closing was held ... on June 30, 1986,\" outlines the steps of the transaction leading up to the closing, and also the steps taken as part of closing. (ECF No. 46-11 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the closing date of June 30, 1986, MLP, MOLP, and Pioneer Corporation executed a \"Conveyance From Pioneer Corporation to Mesa Limited Partnership and from Mesa Limited Partnership to Mesa Operating Limited Partnership.\" (ECF No. 46-12 (the \"Conveyance\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Conveyance includes the following recital:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   WHEREAS, Pioneer [Corporation] is the successor in interest by merger to title to all of the assets of Amarillo Oil Company, Pinaga, Inc., Pioneer Gas Products Company and Pioneer Production Corporation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (ECF No. 46-12 at 3.) Notably, this paragraph names all of the subsidiaries that Pioneer Corporation had merged into itself\n   <em>\n    except for\n   </em>\n   PNI. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46-9 at 3\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46-12 at 3.) As addressed below, Defendants rely on this omission to argue the United States has failed to prove PNI's assets passed to Mesa, while the United States argues this omission was evidently an error, and \"does not change the operative outcome of the final transaction between Pioneer [Corporation] and MLP.\" (ECF No. 60 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Later clauses of the June 30, 1986 Conveyance refer back to the March 5, 1986 Agreement of Sale and Purchase (ECF No. 46-12 at 1), and define the \"Assumed Liabilities\" being conveyed to Mesa as including \"all liabilities and obligations of Pioneer, fixed or contingent ... other than any obligation to pay the Cash Distribution Amount,\" which was a liquidating cash distribution to be paid by Pioneer to its shareholders (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, Art. 1.1(m) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Consistent with the statements in the March 5, 1986 Agreement, the Conveyance transferred the assets of Pioneer Corporation to MLP (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, \u00a7 2.1), and reflects that MLP \"assume[d] and agree[d] to pay, perform and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities\" of Pioneer Corporation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00a7 2.4). MLP in turn transferred the assets and liabilities it had just received from Pioneer Corporation to MOLP (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3.1), and MOLP \"assume[d] and agree[d] to pay, perform and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, \u00a7 3.4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, the June 30, 1986 Closing Memorandum summarized that on June 27, 1986, PNI (and other named subsidiaries of Pioneer Corporation) had been \"merged into Pioneer.\" (ECF No. 46-11 at 7, \u00b6 J.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The day after the Conveyance, Pioneer Corporation filed Articles of Dissolution. (ECF No. 46-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Actions After 1986\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As detailed in the United States' Motion (and documented in supporting exhibits), after the actions detailed above, MLP was converted into Mesa, Inc., at the end of 1991. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 at 12-15, 17-18 \u00b6\u00b6 47-59, 67-71; ECF No. 46-17.) Mesa, Inc. was in turn merged with and into Defendant Pioneer Natural Resources in 1997. (ECF No. 46 at 19-22, \u00b6\u00b6 73-86; ECF No. 46-22.) Defendants do not contest that these actions occurred, nor dispute that they made Pioneer Natural Resources the successor of MLP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Defendants do not dispute this claim, conceding that Pioneer-USA \"has not denied that it is a 'successor' to [MOLP],\" and that the Court \"can grant\" the United States' Motion on this issue. (ECF No. 55 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 62 \u00b6 13 (\"PNR-USA admits that PNR-USA is the corporate successor to MLP\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court therefore grants the United States' Motion on this undisputed issue, having reviewed the factual record and arguments included in the United States' Motion, and concluding that the United States is entitled to partial summary judgment under Rule 56(a) as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Natural Resources's Successor Liability for PNI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, the United States seeks summary judgment on the successor liability of Defendant Pioneer Natural Resources for PNI, that is, a summary judgment holding that Pioneer Natural Resources \"is the corporate successor of PNI.\" (ECF No. 46 at 1, 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants dispute this contention, arguing the United States \"has not come forward with sufficient evidence\" to prove this claim as a matter of law, and that for summary judgment purposes, \"[g]enuine issues of material fact exist as to the issue of [Pioneer Natural Resources'] corporate successor liability.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55 at 1, 10-11.) However, the Court finds Defendants have not raised any\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   dispute that Pioneer Natural Resources succeeded to the liabilities of PNI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The transactions which occurred in 1986, detailed in Parts II.B.1.-3.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , effectively transferred all of PNI's liabilities first to Pioneer Corporation, via merger, and then to MLP and MOLP, via an asset sale including express assumption of liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, the June 26, 1986 Articles of Merger and the June 27, 1986 Certificate of Merger effectively transferred all of PNI's liabilities to Pioneer Corporation. This transfer of liabilities is reflected in the explicit terms of the Articles (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   No. 46-9 at 3, 4-5), was plainly effected by the Texas statutes (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; ECF No. 46-42 at 5-6; 32 Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code. \u00a7 1396-5.06A(5) (1986) ), and is consistent with the general rule that in a merger all liabilities are transferred to the surviving corporation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith Land\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337187\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/851/86/#p91\">\n    851 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   91 ;\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants' arguments suggesting that PNI's liabilities were somehow not transferred to Pioneer Corporation are unavailing. Defendants focus on the \"selection\" and \"specification\" provisions of \u00a7 3.9 of the March 5, 1986 Agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , arguing that Agreement did not require the transfer of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Pioneer Corporation's subsidiaries to Mesa, but only those \"specified\" by Mesa, and that there is \"no evidence\" that either MLP or MOLP \" 'specified to' Pioneer Corporation that they had selected to receive [PNI's] assets and liabilities.\" (ECF No. 55 at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But whatever uncertainty was left open by the March 5, 1986 Agreement is foreclosed by the June 27, 1986 Articles, which unequivocally merged PNI into Pioneer corporation, explicitly making Pioneer Corporation \"responsible and liable for all liabilities and obligations of [PNI].\" (ECF No. 46-9 at 5.) Moreover, both the terms of the Articles and Texas statutes establish that \"the separate existence\" of PNI\n   <em>\n    ceased\n   </em>\n   as of the effective date of the Articles, which by statute was the date of \"the issuance of the certificate of merger,\" or June 27, 1986. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; ECF No. 46-42 at 5.) Thus, the \"separate existence\" of PNI (and the other subsidiaries merged into Pioneer Corporation) ended on June 27, 1986, and only Pioneer Corporation survived thereafter, becoming \"responsible and liable for all liabilities and obligations\" of PNI, and of the other merged subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   32 Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code. \u00a7 1396-5.06A(2) &amp; (5) (statute docketed at ECF No. 46-42 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Given the unequivocal nature of the merger, Defendants' focus on the omission of PNI from the list of merged subsidiaries in the Conveyance document executed three days later is irrelevant. By that date, PNI no longer existed. So whether or not the recitals of the June 30, 1986 Conveyance mentioned PNI's prior existence, all of PNI's liabilities had already been transferred into Pioneer Corporation. And Defendants do not, and cannot, dispute that Pioneer Corporation's liabilities were then expressly assumed by MLP and MOLP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While Defendants argue that the United States has provided \"no evidence that [Mesa] 'selected' to receive the ... liabilities of [PNI],\" and \"no evidence that [Mesa] 'specified to' Pioneer Corporation that they had selected to receive [PNI's] assets and liabilities,\" the Court disagrees, finding the United States has provided\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   such evidence, and that it is conclusive. Namely, the June 26, 1986 Articles and the June 27, 1986 Certificate of Merger reflect that PNI\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   merged into Pioneer Corporation before June 30, 1986. As was expressly anticipated by the March 5, 1986 Agreement, this merger was then effected by way of the June 26-27, 1986 Articles and Certificate of Merger, and also explicitly confirmed in the June 30, 1986 Closing Memorandum. These documents, read together, are undisputed and dispositive evidence that the transfer of PNI's liabilities to MLP and MOLP was completed with Mesa's knowledge, and as contemplated in the March 5, 1986 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Given the clarity of the record detailed above, the absence of some\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   documentation or communications showing exactly how or when Mesa \"selected\" or \"specified\" that PNI was included in the merger and asset sale hardly reflects that it did not occur. The only\n   <em>\n    arguably\n   </em>\n   contrary evidence is the omission of PNI from\n   a single \"whereas\" recital in the June 30, 1986 Conveyance. But, given the preceding merger, and under the terms of the same document, that omission could have any effect only if it were the case that sometime\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   June 27, 1986 (when PNI ceased to exist) but\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   June 30, 1986 (when the asset sale closed), Pioneer Corporation had divested itself of the exact liabilities that it had just acquired from PNI. But not even Defendants suggest that such an improbable and completely undocumented transfer occurred, and there is no reason to believe that it did. Thus, to the extent there is any factual dispute regarding the merger of PNI's liabilities into Pioneer Corporation and their subsequent conveyance to Mesa, the Court finds no reasonable jury could find for Defendants on this issue. At most, Defendants have raised a \"metaphysical doubt,\" regarding the transfer of PNI's liabilities to Mesa, but one that does reflect a\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   factual dispute under Rule 56 requiring a trial to resolve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Champagne Metals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386559\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/1073/#p1084\">\n    458 F.3d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Accordingly, the Court grants the United States' Motion on this issue, finding that Pioneer Corporation took on the liabilities of PNI via merger, and that by way of the June 30, 1986 Conveyance, MLP explicitly assumed those same liabilities. At least for present purposes, there is no genuine dispute that Pioneer Natural Resources is the corporate successor of PNI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Since the parties do not dispute the issue, and since it does not appear to make any difference to the present outcome, the Court proceeds for present purposes assuming that Texas law controls the successor liability issues raised here.\n    <em>\n     Accord\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Colo. 2001).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Although the June 30, 1986 Conveyance also purported to immediately transfer from MLP to MOLP the very same assets and liabilities which MLP had just received from Pioneer Corporation (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 46-12 at 8-9 \u00a7\u00a7 3.1, 3.2, 3.4;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 46-8 \u00a7 1.2(b) ), the Conveyance also includes MLP's \"unconditional\" and \"absolute\" guaranty for \"the obligations of [MOLP] to pay the Assumed Liabilities\" (ECF No. 46-12 at 9, \u00a7 3.5). This guaranty also refers back to \u00a7 1.2 of the March 5, 1986 Agreement, which expressed \"MLP's assumption of and agreement to pay, perform, or discharge the Assumed Liabilities\" (which are broadly defined), and \u00a7 1.8 of the March 5, 1986 Agreement further repeated that \"MLP ... guarantees the obligations of the MOLP to pay the Assumed Liabilities, if and to the extent the MOLP fails to timely make such payment,\" and that this amounts to \"an absolute guaranty of payment and performance of all of the Assumed Liabilities.\" (ECF No. 46-7 at 3, 7.) The net effect of these terms appears to make MLP fully liable for the liabilities received from Pioneer Corporation, notwithstanding their nominal transfer to MOLP. Put another way, these guaranty provisions may be viewed as an express assumption of PNI's liabilities by MLP.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The parties' arguments do not address these provisions, and in any event Defendants do not argue that these terms defeat the conclusion that MLP (as opposed to MOLP) became the corporate successor to PNI, and to its liabilities. Defendants argue only that \"[b]ecause [MLP] did not select ... [PNI's] ... liabilities, [MLP] could not have carried those ... liabilities into its conversion into Mesa, Inc.,\" and thence into Defendant Pioneer Natural Resources, and that \"it is unclear\" whether PNI's assets and liabilities were conveyed \"to\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    entity\" in 1986. (ECF No. 55 at 14.) Having rejected these arguments, it follows that the liabilities which MLP took on and guaranteed in the June 30, 1986 Conveyance later flowed to MLP's successors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
