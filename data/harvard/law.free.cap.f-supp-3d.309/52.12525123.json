Each maintains that she was arrested for \"doing nothing more than walking down the street in the neighborhood[ ] where [she] live[s].\" (Dkt. 93 at 1). The charges against plaintiffs were ultimately either dismissed or adjourned in contemplation of dismissal. (Amended Complaint (\"AC\") \u00b6\u00b6 123, 140, 155, 175, 190, 203, 215, 237). They have filed suit against the City of New York (\"City\") and numerous officers in the New York Police Department (\"NYPD\"), asserting twenty claims under federal and state law, thirteen of which are also raised on behalf of a putative class. In the main, they challenge the constitutionality of New York's prohibition against loitering for the purpose of prostitution, the City's policies and customs concerning its implementation, and the legality of its enforcement against them. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 240-337).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The key provision at issue on this motion is section 240.37 of the New York Penal Law, which provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Any person who remains or wanders about in a public place and repeatedly beckons to, or repeatedly stops, or repeatedly attempts to stop, or repeatedly attempts to engage passers-by in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor vehicles, or repeatedly interferes with the free passage\n   of other persons, for the purpose of prostitution as that term is defined in article two hundred thirty of this part, shall be guilty of a violation and is guilty of a class B misdemeanor if such person has previously been convicted of a violation of this section or of section 230.00 of this part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their amended complaint, plaintiffs assert that section 240.37 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, resulting in \"inconsistent and arbitrary enforcement.\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 8, 240-251). They also allege, among other things, that defendants subjected plaintiffs to intentional discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or gender identity, arrested them without probable cause, arrested them for activity protected by the First Amendment, infringed their liberty interests in \"self-expression, bodily integrity and privacy,\" and engaged in unlawful, bias-based profiling. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 252-319). Plaintiffs further assert that the officers of the 52nd Precinct conspired to perform \"sweeps\" to arrest the transgender plaintiffs \"for their status as transgender women.\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 280-83). For these claims, plaintiffs request declaratory relief that section 240.37 is void and that defendants have violated plaintiffs' rights. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 339-40). They also seek an injunction restraining the City from enforcing section 240.37, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 341-57). In addition, plaintiffs raise five individual claims against the individual defendants. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 304-19). D.H., who is deaf, also asserts a claim against several of the individual defendants under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and analogous state laws for actions occurring during and after her arrest, (AC \u00b6\u00b6 320-33), and N.H. raises an excessive force claim under state and federal law against defendant Dawkins for actions occurring after her arrest, (AC \u00b6\u00b6 334-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants have moved for partial dismissal of the amended complaint. (Dkt. 87). On this motion, defendants do not challenge plaintiffs' section 1983 claims for damages against the individual defendants for alleged violations of plaintiffs' rights to \"self-expression, bodily integrity and privacy,\" freedom of speech, and freedom from unreasonable seizures. Nor do they challenge D.H.'s claim for damages under the ADA, or N.H.'s section 1983 excessive force damages claim. They have, however, moved pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., to dismiss all of plaintiffs' claims insofar as they seek declaratory or injunctive relief. They have also moved under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., to dismiss plaintiffs' claims challenging section 240.37 on vagueness and overbreadth grounds and to dismiss plaintiffs' other claims on various grounds that will be explained. For the reasons to follow, defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief for two reasons. First, they assert that plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact \"because [plaintiffs have] failed to plead a sufficient likelihood of future harm from[,] and the existence of an official policy or its equivalent regarding the NYPD's enforcement of[,] [section] 240.37.\" (Dkt. 89 at 6). Second, defendants argue that plaintiffs have not adequately established that the requested declaratory or injunctive relief would likely redress the alleged injuries. Although not raised by defendants, the Court will also address whether the alleged injuries are fairly traceable to the actions of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Cent.

Second, that plaintiff Marchando was arrested twice under section 240.37 in the span of eight days, that plaintiff Grissom \"has been repeatedly followed, stopped, questioned, arrested and detained for loitering for the purpose of prostitution,\" and that this pattern of repeated arrests establishes that injury is imminent for them. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 181, 219-39). Third, that one defendant, after arresting N.H. during a \"sweep,\" stated to N.H., who is transgender, and a group of other transgender arrestees that \"if they saw 'girls like them' outside after midnight, they would arrest them.\" (AC \u00b6 134). Plaintiffs argue that this statement evinces a credible threat of future harm because a week later, officers arrested K.H, who is also transgender, and another transgender woman walking with K.H. during another \"sweep\" even though the two women had purportedly not engaged in any conduct proscribed by the statute. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 146, 153).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Allegations of past unlawful arrests alone do not suffice to allege an injury in fact.

The allegation that officers have arrested plaintiffs based solely on previous arrests for prostitution offenses is too attenuated from the pivotal question-that is, the question of imminence. The allegation requires the Court to assume that an officer who sees a plaintiff will recognize the plaintiff, that the officer will know (and remember) that the plaintiff was previously arrested for prostitution-related charges, and that the officer will arrest the plaintiff under section 240.37 regardless of whether the plaintiff is engaged in any activity proscribed by the statute.

She has not plausibly alleged any facts from which the Court could infer a causal nexus between the threat of future arrest and discriminatory conduct on the basis of gender or race. Additionally, she has not plausibly alleged that her injury in fact could be traced to the conduct of any defendant outside the 52nd Precinct.

This conduct does not conceivably fall within the statute, and plaintiffs\n   do not plead that uncertainty over the conduct prohibited by the statute resulted in their arrests.

For example, plaintiff Grissom has plausibly alleged that defendants Savarese and Pocalyko, both from the 52nd Precinct, arrested her after she spoke with a man for around thirty to forty-five minutes. (AC \u00b6 182). Savarese and Pocalyko did not, however, arrest the man despite the fact that he engaged in the same conduct as Grissom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These allegations, along with the purported lack of probable cause and falsification of arrest paperwork, support a plausible inference that these defendants' actions were taken at least in part because of Grissom's gender or gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Similarly, plaintiff Bankston alleges that defendants Salazar, Doe NYPD Officer # 8, and Doe NYPD Officer # 9 stopped her when she was observed riding in a car with a man, who was driving the vehicle. (AC \u00b6 207-09). The officers allegedly forcibly removed Bankston from the vehicle and accused her of being a prostitute and the man of being her pimp. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 208-09). The officers arrested Bankston but did not arrest the man. (AC \u00b6 209). During the arrest, these defendants purportedly \"verbally abused [Bankston] by using racial slurs.\" (AC \u00b6 210). These allegations, in combination with the alleged facts that the defendants arrested Bankston without probable cause and predicated the arrest on events that did not happen, allow a plausible inference that these defendants intentionally discriminated against Bankston because of her gender or race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs D.H., N.H., and K.H. have alleged that they were arrested during \"sweeps\" to allegedly get \"girls like them\" who were outside after midnight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AC \u00b6\u00b6 112, 128, 134, 146).

(AC \u00b6\u00b6 158-77). But Martin has not alleged any facts to support a plausible inference that this arrest was motivated by discriminatory intent. After the arrest, Allen purportedly asked \"which one of you is going to process the he/she?\" while he and the other officers drove Martin to the 83rd Precinct. (AC \u00b6 168). Martin, however, states that Doe NYPD Officer # 6 arrested her after Siev instructed to do so. (AC \u00b6 166). Allen's comment, while rude, was made after the arrest by an officer that did not have any meaningful role in the allegedly unlawful arrest. The comment does not support a plausible inference that Martin was \"targeted\" based on her race, gender, or gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs attempt to support an inference of intentional discrimination from allegations generally applicable to all individual defendants. Plaintiffs rely on statistics, observing that women constitute eighty-one percent of arrestees under section 240.37 and that black and Hispanic individuals comprise eighty-five percent of arrestees, but they do not compare these percentages to any helpful baseline. (AC \u00b6 91 n.16; Dkt. 93 at 13). Because the usefulness of statistics \"depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances,\" it is impossible to assess from these percentages alone-or in conjunction with the demographics of New York City, as plaintiffs have offered-whether there is even disparate treatment of individuals who are loitering for the purpose prostitution or who are arrested under the statute without probable cause, let alone discriminatory intent motivating any individual defendant.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v.

Plaintiffs' Eleventh and Sixteenth Claims are dismissed against all defendants for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) except for plaintiff Grissom's claims against defendants Savarese and Pocalyko, plaintiff Bankston's claims against defendants Salazar, Doe NYPD Officer # 8, and Doe NYPD Officer # 9, plaintiff D.H.'s claims against defendants Kinane, Doe NYPD Officer # 1 and Doe NYPD Officer # 2, plaintiff N.H.'s claims against defendants Dawkins, Keane, Doe NYPD Officer # 3, and plaintiff K.H.'s claims against defendants Imburgia, Doe NYPD Officer # 4, and Doe NYPD Officer # 5.
