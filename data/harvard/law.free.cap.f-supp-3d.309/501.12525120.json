Plaintiffs requested additional detail regarding the cost of the extension on August 5, 2013 (doc. 85-2 at PageID 5050) and, on August 9, 2013, Plaintiffs advised the City that construction documents could not be executed because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the financial burden\" of the electrical extension \"is too great for ... the developer ... to bear[.]\" Doc. 85-3 at PageID 5052.

Plaintiffs concede that the first two elements exist in this case, but argue that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   does not bar their federal claims because they could not have been litigated in the first lawsuit and because they do not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the first lawsuit. Doc. 96 at PageID 6402-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they could not have raised these claims in the first lawsuit because the electrical agreement was not binding on the parties until ultimately approved by the City via ordinance in 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 96 at PageID 6404. Plaintiffs' position is contrary to\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court stated that, with regard to takings claims under an unconstitutional conditions theory, a taking occurs whenever there is an \"[e]xtortionate demand[ ] for property in the land-use permitting context[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698478\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/595/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 2596-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[e]xtortionate demands for property in the land-use permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause\"). Because the City's demand predated Plaintiffs' execution of the electrical extension agreement on August 30, 2013, and Plaintiffs' first lawsuit was commenced approximately one year later in August 2014, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiffs could have, in the first lawsuit, sought just compensation for a taking arising from the City's allegedly excessive fee demand-as well as their ancillary equal protection claim. Thus, the third element is present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The fourth and final element concerns whether or not Plaintiffs' constitutional claims in the second lawsuit arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as that presented in the first lawsuit. Upon entry of a final judgment, not only are a plaintiff's specific claims extinguished, but so are \"all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.\"\n   <em>\n    Grava v.

Plaintiffs' first lawsuit concerned,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , an application for a writ of mandamus action seeking to compel the City to pass an ordinance approving the final plan after the original ordinance failed on August 4, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 96-17 at 6848, 6854-55. Without dispute, the final plan that Plaintiffs sought to compel the City to pass in the first lawsuit included the electrical extension agreement that Plaintiffs now allege they were required to sign before the City would ever consider approving final plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 75 at PageID 2828; doc. 85-7 at PageID 5080, 5099;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 96-17 at PageID 6848, 6854. Accordingly, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiffs' constitutional claims asserted here in the second lawsuit arise from the same transaction\n   or occurrence also at issue in the first lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs' constitutional claims are barred by application of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the City's motion for summary judgment, as it relates to Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claims, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiffs' cross motion for partial summary judgment (doc. 75) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs' remaining claims all concern causes of action asserted under Ohio state law. \"Once [a] district court dismisse[s] all of the claims over which it ha[s] original jurisdiction, it act[s] squarely within its discretion by declining supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining [state law] claim[s] and dismissing [them] without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Booker v.

Rather than dismissing state law claims without prejudice, however, in a case removed from state court to the federal court, where \"all federal claims have been dismissed before trial, the best course is to remand the state law claims to the state court from which the case was removed.\"\n   <em>\n    Thurman v.

There are any number of \"considerations which lower courts in our circuit should weigh\" when determining whether \"convenience, comity, fairness, and judicial economy\" outweigh the substantial interest in comity to state courts-although \"[t]he Sixth Circuit has not expressly stated a comprehensive list of factors\" that must be considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

Ohio 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs' remaining claims all involve unique issues of state law,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the timeliness of the City's responses to Plaintiffs' numerous public records requests under Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 149.43, and application of the implied covenant of good faith in a land development contract between a developer and an Ohio municipality. The issue presented with regard to the electrical extension agreement is especially novel and the parties at this time cite no Ohio authority on the issue presented-whether the implied covenant of good faith within a contract requires a municipality to minimize all costs and expenses associated with its contractual duties so as to perform its work for substantially less than the estimated cost agreed to by the parties. Given that the federal claims have been resolved on procedural grounds without consideration of the merits of any of Plaintiffs' claims, there is no compelling need for this Federal Court to weigh in on such novel issues of Ohio contract law-or to address what is or is not timely as it relates to responding to public records requests under Ohio law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While this case has been pending in this Court for over a year and the Court supervised discovery through its completion, the Common Pleas Court is no stranger to the dispute between these parties given that (1) it presided over the entirety of the first lawsuit and (2) this second lawsuit was originally pending there prior to removal. The issue of whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims is a close call, but after carefully weighing the\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   factors, the undersigned is compelled to conclude that remand is required. The factors weighing in favor of the Court exercising supplemental jurisdiction do not outweigh the factors favoring remand in light of the strong presumption against exercising supplemental jurisdiction. Accordingly, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiffs' state law claims be\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to the Miami County Common Pleas Court for resolution of Plaintiffs' state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In light of this remand, the merits of the parties' remaining motions (docs. 102, 014, 113, 115-16) need not be reached.
