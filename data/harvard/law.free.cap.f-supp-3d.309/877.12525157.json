In 2016, Jo Sanders moved to Lincoln City, Oregon with her daughter, Sarah Sanders, and 4-year-old granddaughter. While living out of a hotel room, Plaintiffs inquired about a vacancy at Defendants' Hilltop Apartments complex. Their application indicated that Jo Sanders owned a service dog. Despite qualifying for the apartment, Defendants discouraged Plaintiffs from pursuing a lease agreement, demanding an inflated deposit and refusing to install clean carpeting. Plaintiffs re-inquired about the apartment one week later, this time without the dog, but received no response from Defendants. After remaining homeless for two months, Plaintiffs filed the instant suit, alleging disability discrimination under both state and federal fair housing law. The parties now move for summary judgment. Because no rational trier of fact could find that Defendants' actions were primarily motivated by anything other than discriminatory intent, Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 27, 2016, Jo Sanders moved to Lincoln City, Oregon with her daughter, Sarah Sanders, and 4-year-old granddaughter. Sanders Dep. 138:12-23. When Plaintiffs arrived, they lacked permanent housing and were living out of a hotel room. Sanders Dep. 138:12-23. On March 5, as part of their effort to secure permanent housing, Sarah Sanders called Hilltop Apartments to inquire about a vacant unit. Suckow Dep. 41:9-16. She spoke with Krisitin Suckow,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the property manager for the apartment complex, and was encouraged to apply for the unit. Suckow Dep. 9:11-15, 41:9-16; Seidl Dep. 9:24-10:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 11, Sarah Sanders completed and submitted an online application. Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 3-4. The application represented that Jo Sanders owned a \"VA registered service animal\" which was \"trained with documentation.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 4. Jo Sanders suffers from diabetes, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, vision impairment, and has difficulty walking and balancing. Sanders Dep. 88:15-19. She previously owned a dog, River, which she trained to detect changes in her insulin levels and assist with her balance. Sanders Dep. 26:18-21; Sanders Dep. 92:17-20. At the time of her application, Jo Sanders owned a puppy, Winston, which was undergoing basic obedience training. Sanders Dep. 25:22-26:15. She intended to train\n   Winston in substantially the same manner as River. Sanders Dep. 26:8-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Ms. Suckow received Plaintiffs' application, she contacted William Seidl. Suckow Decl. 1. Mr. Seidl is a member and the manager of SWS Hilltop, LLC, the entity which owns Hilltop Apartments. Seidl Dep. 9:15-23. Despite the apartment complex's policy of allowing animals in their units, Mr. Seidl stated that he was \"[n]ot super excited about a 50 pound (probably larger) dog on new carpet\" and noted that Plaintiffs were \"pretty tight on income,\" suggesting a $1200 deposit. Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 3. After Ms. Suckow responded that Defendants could not seek a deposit for service animals, Mr. Seidl repeated that he did not want to replace the \"old and warn out carpet ... since [Jo Sanders] has a large service animal.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2. \"Hopefully she'll change her mind,\" he continued, and instructed Ms. Suckow not to contact Plaintiffs: \"Lets [sic] make it tough ....\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 15, Sarah Sanders called Ms. Suckow to follow up. According to Ms. Suckow, she requested a second application fee in accordance with Defendants' policy and repeated the following scripted remarks provided by Mr. Seidl: \"[T]he owner hasn't yet decided about your application. Your income barely meets our financial approval limits and the carpet is old and worn out in that unit, and the owner doesn't want to replace it and then put an animal on it. So you're going to have a really high deposit and old carpet.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2; Suckow Decl. 1. A few days earlier, the carpet had been described by one employee as \"FILTHY, NASTY, ... PUKE.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 8 at 1 (capitalization in original). Sarah Sanders maintains that, although Ms. Suckow related the carpet's condition and noted the missing application fee, she also \"stated there was no point [to paying the second fee] because the owner was not going to rent to us.\" Sanders Dep. 158:4-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs inquired once more about the apartment on March 17, this time after giving away Winston. Ellis Decl., Ex 11 at 1; Sanders Dep. 172:12-19. When Ms. Suckow informed Mr. Seidl that Plaintiffs had given away their dog and wished to be reconsidered, he instructed her not to return their call, stating that \"they'll just move the dog in later and we won't be able to stop them.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 1. \"Let's be picky,\" he continued, \"[w]e're coming into the time of the month when responsible people are looking.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 1. Although the parties disagree as to whether they ever discussed Plaintiffs formally withdrawing their application,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Seidl Decl. 2,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Sanders Dep. 166:12-20, they agree that Defendants issued a refund shortly before the second inquiry and despite Plaintiffs having offered to submit a second application fee. Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 4, Jo Sanders, now living out of her car with Sarah Sanders and her granddaughter, called Ms. Suckow to determine why Plaintiffs' application had been denied. Sanders Dep. 172:12-17. Ms. Suckow asked her to submit the request in writing, which she did that afternoon. Ellis Decl., Ex. 12 at 1. Defendants never responded. Suckow Dep. 72:1-9. Shortly thereafter, and after remaining empty for nearly two weeks, Defendants leased the unit to another applicant, Kelly Bay. Ellis Decl., Ex. 13 at 1. Although Ms. Bay reported a lower income than Plaintiffs, she did not own a dog and indicated no plans to acquire one. Seidl Dep. 66:10-21. Three months after starting her lease, Ms. Bay signed a Pet Agreement so that her brother, who visited \"on [an] occasional basis,\" could bring his dog. Ellis Decl., Ex. 13 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 15, 2017, Plaintiffs initiated the present action, alleging disability discrimination\n   under both state and federal fair housing law. After completing discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The matter is now before this Court. Because no rational trier of fact could conclude that Defendants' actions were primarily motivated by anything other than discriminatory intent, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court must grant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

To prevail on a claim of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show that she qualified for protection under the FHA, that the defendant engaged in conduct prohibited by the FHA, and that the defendant's prohibited conduct was motived by discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

If a plaintiff presents indirect evidence of discrimination, courts generally employ the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework, which, separate from the question of intent, first requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and then requires the defendant to rebut it with a non-discriminatory explanation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556829\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1109/#p1114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If, however, a plaintiff presents direct evidence of discriminatory intent, she may proceed straight to the task of satisfying her burden of persuasion.\n   <em>\n    McGinest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164199\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/1103/#p1122\">\n    360 F.3d at 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defs.' Br. 7-8. They concede that Jo Sanders is disabled and that Sarah Sanders intended to apply for housing on behalf of Jo Sanders. Defs.' Br. 8. Nevertheless, Defendants argue that, because the alleged disparate treatment was based\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on Plaintiffs' status as dog owners, and the dog in question does not qualify as a service animal, Defendants' actions were, at most, based on an attribute unprotected by the FHA (i.e., traditional dog ownership). Defs.' Br. 8; Defs.' Reply Br. 4. This argument fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As applied to the facts of the present case, the FHA does not require Plaintiffs' dog to qualify as a service animal. To bring suit under the FHA, an individual need only allege that she has suffered a \"distinct and palpable injury\" stemming from a defendant's discriminatory conduct.\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p372\">\n    455 U.S. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p372\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p372\">\n    71 L.Ed.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). It is well settled that, even if an individual is not disabled or only represents that she is disabled, the FHA nevertheless permits recovery if she suffers\n   a pecuniary or other concrete harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549322\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/183/1043/#p1051\">\n    183 F.3d at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). This Court, for example, has previously held that the FHA affords standing to \"fair housing testers\" who pose as prospective tenants with service animals, even though such individuals are neither disabled nor the owners of actual service animals.\n   <em>\n    Avakina ex rel. Fair Housing Council of Oregon v.

Or. Jan. 30, 2015). This liberal construction is consistent with the FHA's definition of \"handicap,\" which includes individuals not only suffering from a qualifying impairment, but also those \"regarded\" as having a qualifying impairment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203602\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(3). Although U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") guidance permits a landlord, contemporaneous with a plaintiff's application, to request documentation of a disability or disability-related need for a service animal, the burden is on the landlord to address any doubts with further inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FHEO Notice 2013-01 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the record contains uncontroverted evidence that Defendants operated under the assumption that Plaintiffs owned a service animal. Plaintiffs' housing application clearly represented that Jo Sanders owned a \"VA registered service dog\" and that it was \"trained with documentation.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 4. Defendants never asked Plaintiffs for any verification of this representation and their internal emails expressly refer to the dog as a \"service animal.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2. Ironically, the emails even discuss \"precautions\" Defendants should take in communicating with Plaintiffs so as to avoid legal exposure under the FHA. Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2. Although Defendants vociferously contest whether Plaintiffs' dog fits the definition of a service animal, they never contest, nor present evidence, that they ever questioned Plaintiffs' representation that the dog was a service animal. Indeed, to the contrary, they concede that \"[t]he fact that the Sanders [sic] had a service animal was known at the time we made the offer to rent to them with the higher deposit.\" Defs.' Br. 3. Since the record contains uncontroverted evidence that Defendants \"regarded\" Plaintiffs' dog as a service animal, and Plaintiffs were forced to expend additional time and resources searching for alternative housing, their claims fall within the scope of federal and state fair housing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Prohibited Conduct Under the Fair Housing Act\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants next contend that their conduct was not prohibited by the FHA. Defs.' Br. 7-8. They advance two overlapping theories. First, Defendants argue that, because Plaintiffs never completed their housing application and eventually withdrew the partially completed application, it was never rejected and Plaintiffs were never denied housing. Defs.' Br. 4-5. Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs were actually offered the apartment, simply subject to \"three conditions.\" Defs.' Br. 8. Although there is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Defendants explicitly refused to rent Plaintiffs the apartment,\n   the dispute is immaterial since, even if Defendants offered the apartment, their underlying conduct still violated the FHA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The FHA prohibits not only outright refusals to rent or sell a dwelling to disabled persons, but also every practice which has the \"effect\" of making it more difficult for disabled persons to obtain housing.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In particular, Mr. Seidl flatly admitted that Defendants would only offer the apartment with the puke-stained carpet and an inflated deposit \"since [Jo Sanders] has a large service animal.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2. This admission, moreover, is just one part of a longer, unguarded exchange with Ms. Suckow about Defendants' general aversion to allowing a \"large\" service dog onto new carpet, their \"plan\" to falsely represent that they would never \"deny [Plaintiffs'] application because [of their] dog,\" and, oddly, repeated instructions for Ms. Suckow to explicitly tell Plaintiffs that the lease conditions were\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   \"the owner doesn't want to replace [the carpet] and then put an animal on it.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 1-4.

The Court acknowledges that, on one occasion, Mr. Seidl expressed concern that Plaintiffs' income was \"tight.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 4. However,\n   he later noted that the income met Defendants' minimum requirements, Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 2, and, shortly thereafter, Defendants rented the apartment to a non-dog-owning individual with a\n   <em>\n    lower\n   </em>\n   income, Seidl Dep. 66:1-22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Plaintiffs re-inquired after giving away their dog, moreover, Mr. Seidl refused to even answer the inquiry, stating that \"[t]hey'll just move the dog in later and we won't be able to stop them.\" Ellis Decl., Ex. 11 at 4. The statement-which makes no mention of income-leaves no doubt that, even once Plaintiffs no longer owned a dog, Defendants' focus was exclusively on the issue of dog ownership. Taken together, no rational trier of fact could conclude that Defendants' actions were primarily motivated by anything other than discriminatory intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
