The Court described the policies at issue in\n   <em>\n    Brach Family Found., Inc. v. AXA Equitable Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 16-CV-740 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207351675\">\n    2016 WL 7351675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2016), a related case, and will not repeat the description here. For now, it suffices to say two things. First, each of the policies-which are known as Athena Universal Life II (\"AUL II\") policies-\"consists of two distinct components: (1) the life insurance component, for which the insurance company charges a cost to cover the risk of the insured's death (the cost of insurance); and (2) a savings component, where premiums paid in excess of the cost of insurance (and certain other policy charges) accumulate and earn interest at a rate that will not be lower than a guaranteed minimum crediting rate.\" (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 64 (\"\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC\"), \u00b6 5). Second, under the terms of the policies, AXA is permitted, subject to certain restrictions, to change the cost of insurance (\"COI\")-which is typically the largest expense that a policyholder has to pay. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19 (\"\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27). The policies, however, provide that any such changes \"will be on\n   a basis that is equitable to all policyholders of a given class, and will be determined based on reasonable assumptions as to expenses, mortality, policy and contract claims, taxes, investment income, and lapses.\" (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62 Ex. 2 (\"\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   Doe Policy\"), at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in these cases allege that, by increasing the COI for a group of life insurance policyholders (namely, holders of policies that: (1) insure individuals who were seventy years or older at the time of issue; and (2) have face values of $1,000,000 or greater), AXA breached their contracts. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 73-77;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 64-68). In addition, they bring claims, sounding in both contract and tort, for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 78-91;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 69-75). They seek compensatory damages and, with respect to the tort good-faith-and-fair-dealing claims, punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 16, 84;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12, 75). They also seek declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 92-95;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 76-79). AXA now moves, pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for partial dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 75;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 64;\n   <em>\n    see also EFG\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 76 (\"AXA Mem.\") ). In particular, AXA moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' good-faith-and-fair-dealing claims as well as their requests for punitive damages and declaratory relief. AXA does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seek to dismiss Plaintiffs' express breach-of-contract claim. (AXA Mem. 5, 18, 19-20). For the reasons that follow, AXA's partial motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court \"must accept[ ] all factual allegations in the complaint and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v.

The gravamen of Plaintiffs' contract claims is that AXA increased COI rates for reasons other than those permitted under the terms of the policies (namely, \"based on reasonable assumptions as to expenses, mortality, policy and contract claims, taxes, investment income, and lapses\" (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   Doe Policy 11) ) and impermissibly discriminated against certain classes of insureds. (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13-14, 38-44, 73-77;\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 30-35, 64-68).

In fact, with one exception-Plaintiffs' claim that AXA failed to \"provide or make available the documents that Defendant contends support its alleged bases for raising the cost of insurance rates\" (\n   <em>\n    EFG\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 81(h);\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 72(h) )-the allegations underlying the two claims are identical in substance, if not identical in words. (AXA Mem. 8-9 (chart comparing the language of Plaintiffs' express contract claims and implied-covenant claims) ). Nor does Plaintiffs' allegation regarding the non-disclosure of documents save their claims, as the relief they seek is \"intrinsically tied to the damages allegedly resulting from the breach of contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Grant &amp; Eisenhofer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201809001\">\n    2015 WL 1809001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That is, the damages Plaintiffs seek as a result of AXA's alleged failure to turn over documents is identical to the damages they seek for the alleged breach of contract. Thus, the fact that they do not allege non-disclosure of documents as a basis for their express contract claim (presumably because the policies contain no such provision) \"does not mean that those acts support a separate claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Alter v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AXA Mem. 19-22). The\n   Court agrees. Declaratory relief is a prospective remedy intended to resolve or mitigate disputes that may yield later litigation. Such disputes \"must not be nebulous or contingent but must have taken on fixed and final shape so that a court can see what legal issues it is deciding, what effect its decision will have on the adversaries, and some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them. Where the relief sought would ... merely determine a collateral legal issue governing certain aspects of ... pending or future suits, a declaratory judgment action falls outside the constitutional definition of a 'case' in Article III,\" and thus should not proceed.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

More generally, a decision whether to award relief under the DJA lies within the discretion of the district court; in making that determination, a district court should consider: \"(1) whether the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal issues involved; and (2) whether a judgment would finalize the controversy and offer relief from uncertainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Duane Reade, Inc. v.
