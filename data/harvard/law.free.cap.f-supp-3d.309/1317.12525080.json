[ECF Nos. 12; 50; 53]. Carnival has once again moved to dismiss. [ECF No. 58]. Gharfeh filed an opposition response, and Carnival filed a reply. [ECF Nos. 59-60].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons outlined below, the Undersigned\n   <strong>\n    grants the motion in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    denies it in part\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff has 14 days from the date of this Order to file an optional second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court outlined the factual allegations underlying Gharfeh's lawsuit in the initial dismissal Order, and I will not repeat the summary here. For present purposes, suffice it to say that his amended lawsuit arises from a cruise he took as a passenger aboard the\n   <em>\n    Carnival Freedom\n   </em>\n   in February 2016. It focuses on the care and treatment he received (or did not receive) while a passenger aboard the ship. He alleges that he received substandard care in myriad ways. The Court will discuss the specifics in the analysis of each count, all of which Carnival seeks to dismiss. One of the counts is against the\n   doctor, who Gharfeh has apparently not served and who has not filed a response to the amended complaint. That count (i.e., Count IV) will therefore not be discussed. All other counts are against Carnival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Count I is for negligent medical treatment by the shipboard physicians and medical staff under a vicarious liability theory based on actual agency and respondeat superior. Count II is also based on the same medical treatment and is also based on vicarious liability, but seeks damages under an apparent agency/agency-by-estoppel theory. Count III is based on the negligent medical treatment by the one shipboard physician and is premised on a third type of vicarious liability: a purported joint venture (to provide medical services to cruise passengers) between the doctor and Carnival. Count V is a direct liability claim for negligently provisioning and equipping the ship's medical facility. Count VI also asserts a direct liability claim, but this count is for the negligent failure to timely evacuate Gharfeh. Count VII, also a direct liability count, alleges negligent hiring, retention, monitoring, and training of the onboard medical staff, including the onboard physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Carnival's Defense Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Carnival argues that Counts I, II, and III should be dismissed because they are \"shotgun\" pleadings that impermissibly comingle multiple claims. Specifically, Carnival contends that these three counts, although purporting to assert claims only for vicarious liability, also assert claims for\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Carnival also challenges Count II on substantive grounds, arguing that Gharfeh did not adequately allege an apparent-agency type of negligence claim because he did not allege that he had a reasonable belief that the doctor or any other medical staff member was acting as Carnival's agent and because he did not allege facts indicating that he reasonably relied on any Carnival representation\n   <strong>\n    about the doctor's agency status\n   </strong>\n   in selecting the cruise or in seeking medical attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For Count III, Carnival argues that Gharfeh did not adequately allege a vicarious liability claim based on Carnival's alleged joint venture with the shipboard doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also, Carnival contends that Counts V, VI, and VII should be stricken because Gharfeh impermissibly modified the counts by adding alleged breaches of duties and other grounds for liability without leave of Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Carnival then repeats the substantive arguments it unsuccessfully raised about these counts in the initial complaint. It says Count V should be dismissed because Carnival has no duty to provide reasonable medical facilities onboard its ship. It contends that Count VI should be dismissed because it has no direct duty to evacuate passengers in need of medical care. Finally, Carnival contends that Count VII should be dismissed because Gharfeh does not allege sufficient facts demonstrating how or why Carnival knew or should have known of the doctor's alleged incompetence and because it has no obligation to monitor or train the onboard doctor or medical staff it provides for the passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Applicable Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must accept all the complaint's allegations as true, construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Pielage v.

As noted above, he separated his theories of vicarious liability into three different counts, based on three different theories. Each theory, of course, needs to be based on a sufficiently alleged negligence claim (asserting breaches by Carnival's agents or joint venture partner, which Gharfeh seeks to use against Carnival, as the principal or joint venturer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Counts I-III (Overall)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Compared to Gharfeh's first effort to allege vicarious liability counts, his amended complaint is far more organized and significantly less confusing. There is substantially less commingling. But there is still\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   commingling of theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Counts I, II and III are all labeled as vicarious liability counts, so there should be little confusion over Gharfeh's\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   . Although the unequivocal title on each of the three counts announces a vicarious liability theory (as opposed to a direct-liability type of negligence count), some of the actual allegations make it seem as though these three counts include a direct liability negligence claim against Carnival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For example, paragraph 36 of the amended complaint alleges that \"[t]he Defendant\n   <strong>\n    cruise line\n   </strong>\n   and the onboard doctor and medical staff owed a duty to provide medical care and treatment to its\n   passengers which was proper and reasonable under the circumstances and within the standard of care.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 14 (emphasis added) ]. Similarly, paragraph 37 alleges that \"[t]he Defendant\n   <strong>\n    cruise\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    line\n   </strong>\n   and the shipboard physician and medical staff, including Dr. Carvajal,\n   <strong>\n    breached and violated\n   </strong>\n   the duties\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   owed toward the Plaintiff herein by\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   actions and conduct.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 14 (emphasis added) ]. To provide another illustration, paragraph 39 alleges that\n   <strong>\n    \"[b]oth\n   </strong>\n   the Defendant\n   <strong>\n    cruise line\n   </strong>\n   and shipboard physicians and medical staff\n   <strong>\n    failed to warn\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiff that the medical center and staff were not equipped to properly handle the Plaintiff's condition.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 15 (emphasis added) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Likewise, paragraph 51 alleges that \"[t]he Defendant\n   <strong>\n    cruise line\n   </strong>\n   and the shipboard physician and medical staff, including Dr. Carvajal, breach and violated the duties\n   <strong>\n    it\n   </strong>\n   owed toward the Plaintiff herein by its actions and conduct.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 22 (emphasis added) ]. And paragraph 68 alleges that \"[t]he Defendant\n   <strong>\n    cruise line\n   </strong>\n   through its joint venture with Dr. Carvajal failed to recognize and treat the Plaintiff correctly given his medical emergency as more fully described.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 31 (emphasis added) ]. The final numbered paragraph in the vicarious liability counts, paragraph 73, alleges that \"[t]he\n   <strong>\n    Defendants'\n   </strong>\n   negligence proximately caused permanent injuries and damages to the Plaintiff in the past and in the future.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 33 (emphasis added) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   All the paragraphs described above are found in Counts I, II or III, which are purportedly for vicarious liability, not direct liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In his opposition response, Gharfeh stridently contends that these three counts are for vicarious liability only and that the paragraphs highlighted above \"do not allege direct negligence.\" [ECF No. 59, p. 3]. He concedes a scrivener's error but then argues that other language in Count III \"makes it abundantly clear the claim is a theory vicarious liability [sic] based on joint venture.\" [ECF No. 59, pp. 3-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Gharfeh also urges the Court to take a holistic, practical, common-sense approach to the allegations in Counts I, II, and III, explaining that \"[w]hen read in their totality, it is clear that these paragraphs do not claim direct negligence, but rather establish the relationship from which the three theories of vicarious liability are premised.\" [ECF No. 59, p. 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Counts I, II, and III are not classic illustrations of clear pleading. They are somewhat confusing because the title (announcing vicarious liability theories) is at times at odds with specific allegations in the counts. Some of the allegations sound like they concern a direct liability theory of negligence. Nevertheless, the Undersigned is not convinced that dismissal would be appropriate here because the confusion does not make it \"virtually impossible\" for Carnival to know the nature of the overall allegations.\n   <em>\n    Weiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/\">\n    792 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If this Order did not otherwise dismiss some counts on substantive grounds (which it does), then I likely would not require Gharfeh to replead the allegations in Counts I, II, and III to eliminate the vicarious liability/direct liability confusion.

He alleged that they intended to do so. He alleged that there was a \"verbal agreement\" and a \"long-term agreement\" to provide medical services to passengers in exchange for payment. [ECF No. 53, p. 26]. He alleged that they maintained joint control (or the right to control) joint proprietary interests. He further alleged that they had the right to share in the profits and the duty to share in the losses. And he alleged that they \"share in profits and losses based on the circumstances of their agreement.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Specifically, he also alleged that \"[t]he cruise line and shipboard physicians and medical staff share profits and losses and split revenue from medical services and supplies rendered to the thousands of cruise passengers.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 29].

For now, Gharfeh has stated a cause of action for negligence against Carnival based on a joint venture theory of vicarious liability. Determining whether Gharfeh presents adequate evidence to support those allegations is another question for another day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Counts V, VI and VII (Overall)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Carnival argues that these three counts should be dismissed or stricken because they contain new allegations that were not present in the initial complaint and that the Court did not authorize. It argues that these new allegations are, for all practical purposes, amendments that require either Carnival's consent or leave of Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court acknowledges that the better practice would have been for Gharfeh to have sought and obtained Carnival's consent before adding new allegations to these counts or, failing that, to have moved for leave. He did not. But under the circumstances, the Undersigned will not dismiss these three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The three counts at issue are not new; they were in the initial complaint. For all practical purposes, they are not based on new theories of liability. Instead, they contain additional factual allegations and more-nuanced and specific contentions about Carnival's alleged direct negligence. Thus, it is unlike\n   <em>\n    Moyer v. Village of Fort Sumner\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13-CV-00164,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012146128\">\n    2013 WL 12146128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M May 30, 2013), where the district court required the plaintiff to seek leave of court before amending aspects of her complaint to add \"a new theory of relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, the earlier dismissal order required Gharfeh to engage in what he describes as \"a total revamping of the entire document.\" [ECF No. 59, p. 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   But regardless of whether the amended complaint is, in fact, the result of a \"total revamping,\" it is clear that substantial, substantive changes were made. These changes amplified and clarified the factual allegations underlying the counts. At bottom, Carnival is criticizing Gharfeh for providing additional detail. The Court is not going to dismiss these three counts merely because Gharfeh did not obtain consent or leave. Because the Court is not going to dismiss these three counts on the \"failure-to-obtain-leave\" theory, I see little benefit in now engaging in a finger-wagging exercise, criticizing Gharfeh's counsel for the plunge-ahead approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Undersigned will now turn to Carnival's substantive challenges to these three counts alleging direct liability for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Count V (Failure to Provide Adequate Medical Facilities &amp; Equipment)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Carnival argues that it has no duty to even provide medical facilities on its ships, a position it says requires dismissal of the count for violating \"a duty to properly man the ship's medical facilities, to provide the appropriate resources to the medical staff, and to provide reasonable and appropriate equipment, supplies, and medications for the ship's medical facility.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 36].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court previously denied Carnival's motion to dismiss this claim, but Carnival asks that I reconsider my prior ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court was not persuaded by Carnival's argument the first time it was presented, and I see nothing in the renewed motion to change the earlier ruling. Also, the issue of whether Carnival has a duty is a non-issue here-because, regardless of whether it has a duty, Carnival decided to provide a medical facility, doctors, and medical staff for its passengers. Once it did that, regardless of whether it was required, Carnival had a duty to do so reasonably and to exercise \"reasonable care under the circumstances\" surrounding the operation, staffing, and equipping of the facility it chose to create and staff.\n   <em>\n    Franza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n    772 F.3d at 1247-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"cruise lines have chosen quite deliberately to enter the business of medicine, often in a large way, and they reap the tangible benefits of this business strategy\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rojas v.

But that hardly means that a cruise ship operator, once it voluntarily decides for business and marketing purposes to create and staff onboard medical facilities, is immune from liability and can with impunity establish a substandard medical facility with inadequate doctors and staff, lacking basic medical equipment reasonably foreseeable for medical emergencies arising during a cruise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   And in any event, Gharfeh's amended complaint does not allege direct negligence against Carnival for failing to have an onboard medical facility that is on par with a shoreside hospital.

Carnival's theory is fundamentally at odds with\n   <em>\n    Franza's\n   </em>\n   practical understanding of the \"industry's decision to construct, outfit, and staff medical centers onboard its ships.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n    at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, the logical consequences of Carnival's position would run counter to\n   <em>\n    Franza's\n   </em>\n   basic policy arguments, such as the position that \"we are loath to adopt a principle of law that\n   <strong>\n    always\n   </strong>\n   immunizes a shipowner\n   <strong>\n    without regard to any of the facts\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, if Carnival's theory were to be adopted, then it could advertise its medical center, persuade prospective passengers to purchase cruise tickets, hire only high school graduates who took a few online first-aid courses, provide aspirin as the only medicine in the medical facility, and fail to provide any equipment beyond a stethoscope and a blood pressure cuff -and then always avoid direct liability for its own negligence when passengers with medical issues suffered medical complications or even death because of the substandard staffing, medical equipment, and medications. The Undersigned is \"loath to adopt\" a rule that would yield that type of result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The only issue before me now concerning Count V is whether it states a cause of action or whether it should be dismissed. Without opinion or predicting whether\n   Gharfeh will ultimately be able to survive summary judgment or persuade a jury to find Carnival directly liable, the Undersigned concludes (as I did in the earlier order) that Gharfeh has at least stated a claim.

On the other hand, Gharfeh has not called my attention to any post-\n   <em>\n    Franza\n   </em>\n   decisions holding that this duty\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   in fact exist and can support a direct liability claim against the cruise ship operator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (The Undersigned understands, of course, that\n   <em>\n    Franza\n   </em>\n   involved a vicarious liability claim.

On neither occasion did Judge Lenard hold that a cruise ship operator had no duty to timely and appropriately evacuate a passenger for medical treatment.

Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Carnival's motion to dismiss Count VI of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Undersigned's ruling is\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   one establishing that cruise lines always have a duty to evacuate a sick or injured passenger from the ship, nor does it hold that there is a general duty for cruise ships to evacuate passengers and that a failure to do so breaches that duty. For example, if a passenger were to demand that a cruise ship located in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and five hours from the nearest hospital-equipped port arrange for his evacuation to an onshore hospital because his bunions were painful, then, in the absence of other facts, no duty to evacuate would arise. On the other hand, if a passenger's appendix burst and she went into septic shock and would likely die in less than 12 hours without intravenous antibiotic treatment that the cruise ship did not possess, then a failure to arrange her medical evaluation to a hospital less than an hour away would be, for purposes of assessing whether a duty existed, assessed quite differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In other words, determining whether a passenger has a viable direct liability claim against a cruise ship for failure to evacuate him or her for medical treatment depends on whether the shipowner's \"conduct breaches the carrier's more general duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Rojas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334621\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/93/1305/#p1311\">\n    93 F.Supp.3d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Franza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1246 ). Thus, when evaluating a cruise ship operator's \"treatment of ailing passengers, the exercise of reasonable care is defined as the 'duty to ...furnish such aid and assistance as ordinarily prudent persons would render under similar circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n    at 1309-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing claim of passenger who sustained injuries during a scooter collision in Nassau for ship's failure to secure air ambulance transportation to the United States) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Franza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1246 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   So there is no special, free-floating, independent duty imposed on a cruise ship to provide medical evacuation. Instead, the issue is more properly viewed as a subset of the overall duty to provide\n   <strong>\n    reasonable care under the circumstances.\n   </strong>\n   Under some circumstances (e.g., the bunion scenario), a carrier likely would have no duty to arrange for a medical\n   evaluation. Under other circumstances (e.g., the burst-appendix scenario), a carrier might have a duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At this preliminary point, when the Court is simply evaluating pleading sufficiency, the amended complaint adequately alleges a factual scenario that could, if established at trial, lead a factfinder to conclude that Carnival owed such a duty to Gharfeh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   There are a host of factors, not sufficiently developed yet, which would help inform the analysis. To list just some possible factors, answers to the following questions could be relevant in determining whether Carnival had a duty to evacuate Gharfeh: (1) what medication was aboard, and would it have likely helped to treat his condition?; (2) what diagnostic equipment was aboard to provide a more-nuanced assessment of his medical condition, and why necessary or recommended equipment was not provided?; (3) what medical advice did doctors in the United States provide to Carnival's ship doctor and medical staff about Gharfeh's diagnosis and treatment?; (4) how far away was the nearest hospital and what equipment and staffing did it have?; (5) how far away from the United States or a port with a hospital was the\n   <em>\n    Inspiration\n   </em>\n   when Gharfeh's medical condition allegedly worsened to the point where urgent care was critical?; (6) what type of hospital was nearest to the port closest to the ship, and what medical equipment and staffing did it have?; (8) had the Coast Guard been contacted to discuss using its helicopters for emergency evacuation, and, if so, what was its view on its ability and willingness to do so?; (9) how medically risky would a helicopter-type evacuation be, and how would those risks balance against the risks of\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   evacuating Gharfeh?; (10) how confident was the ship's doctor in her diagnosis, and how did her diagnosis compare with the diagnosis of any other doctors who she or other health care providers contacted?; (11) what were the weather and sea conditions, and would they have had any effect on a plan to divert the ship to a port or to arrange for helicopter evacuation?; (12) had Carnival or Gharfeh or his son (also a doctor) contacted a private air-ambulance service, and, if so, could the service timely transport Gharfeh from the\n   <em>\n    Inspiration\n   </em>\n   ?; and (13) what recommendations do any applicable or persuasive or reliable maritime authority provide for this situation?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The answers to this non-exhaustive list of questions would create the overall scenario that a factfinder would evaluate when determining if Carnival had a duty to render aid through medical evaluation. If the answer is \"yes,\" then Gharfeh would\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   need to establish that Carnival's breach of this duty proximately caused his illness to worsen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rojas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334621\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/93/1305/#p1311\">\n    93 F.Supp.3d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting motion to dismiss claim for failure to provide air-ambulance transportation, without prejudice, because plaintiff did not allege facts describing how the alleged delay caused any jury or caused any existing injuries to worsen);\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rinker v.

Carnival challenges the allegations of negligent hiring, selection, and retention on pleading grounds, but he challenges only the claims for negligent monitoring and training on substantive grounds-i.e., it says these are not legally viable claims because \"there is no obligation for a carrier to monitor or train the onboard physician or medical staff it provides for its passengers.\" [ECF No. 58, p. 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court previously denied Carnival's motion in the initial Order, and Carnival asks the Court to reconsider the earlier ruling. I have done so, and I now agree, but only in part, with Carnival's argument about the legal insufficiency of the pleadings. I do not, however, agree with Carnival that, as a matter of law, a cruise passenger can never allege a direct liability claim against a cruise operator for negligent hiring, retention, monitoring, and training of its ship's doctors and medical staff. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    dismisses\n   </strong>\n   this Count, albeit\n   <strong>\n    without prejudice\n   </strong>\n   . The reasoning underlying the ruling is outlined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   To state a cause of action for the tort of negligent hiring or retention, a plaintiff must allege that (1) the employee/contractor was incompetent or unfit to perform the work; (2) the employer knew or reasonably should have known of the particular incompetence or unfitness; and (3) the incompetence or unfitness was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Upon further review, however, I conclude that they are actually\n   <em>\n    too\n   </em>\n   conclusory to adequately allege a claim for negligent hiring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that Carnival \"knew or should have known to investigate Dr. Carvajal's educational credentials and training...including [her] prior employment with other cruise lines and medical providers as well as educational credentials and recent training.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 44]. It further alleges that \"the Defendant [i.e., Carnival] also knew or should have known of [ ] Dr. Carvajal's unfitness to provide adequate medical care to its shipboard passengers.\" [ECF No. 53, p. 45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   And it also alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The shipboard physician and medical staff did not have the mental temperament and analytical abilities and did not have sufficient knowledge and training to properly diagnose or to create a reasonable and appropriate plan for urgent or emergent care and treatment including evacuation of the patient and getting the Plaintiff to a medical center on an expedited basis appropriate for urgent or emergent care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   [ECF No. 53, p. 45].
