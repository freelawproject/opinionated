Thereafter, the parties filed a series of related motions. Defendant AllianceOne Receivables Management, Inc. filed a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (Doc. # 10). In response, Plaintiff Gloria D. Alexander opposed the motion and filed Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (Doc. # 17), including the proposed Amended Complaint as an exhibit (Doc. # 17-1). Defendant then filed a reply in support of its motion to dismiss as well as a response in opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint. On March 13, 2015, Plaintiff filed an Amended Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (Doc. # 32) to correct two inadvertent errors to the jurisdictional allegations that were stated in the proposed Amended Complaint submitted to the Court. Plaintiff made no other changes to the proposed Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As the pending motions are now ripe and for the reasons stated herein, it is ORDERED that: 1) Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) (Doc. # 10) is DENIED; 2) Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (Doc. # 17) is DENIED as moot; and 3) Plaintiff's Amended Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (Doc. # 32) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At this stage, the Court makes no findings of fact but instead relies solely on the\n   allegations made by Plaintiff in the removed, state-court Petition and in the proposed Amended Complaint. This lawsuit arises out of an alleged attempt by a third-party debt collector to recover interest on a \"charged off\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   debt. Plaintiff alleges Defendant sent her a debt-collection letter that violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\") in that it threatened to charge her contractual interest under the credit agreement when the original creditor, Capital One Bank, N.A. had waived any right to collect interest on the debt by \"charging off\" the account and ceasing to send Plaintiff periodic billing statements. The letter, which is incorporated into the Petition by reference and attached to the Petition as an exhibit, states in relevant part that \"[a]s of the date of this letter, you owe $1,607.65. Your account balance may be periodically increased due to the addition of accrued interest or other charges\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   so provided in your agreement with your original creditor.\" Pet. Ex. A. (Doc. # 1-1) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The removed, state-court Petition contained one count, a violation of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) The collection of any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The proposed Amended Complaint contains two additional counts for violation of different provisions of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(5), which provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) The false representation of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (A) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (5) The threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that the original creditor, Capital One, waived any right to charge interest on Plaintiff's account, contractual or statutory. Amended Complaint (Doc. # 17-1, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25). In support of waiver, Plaintiff alleges that her \"credit report with Equifax indicated that Capital One had ceased charging interest on all accounts listed as charged off prior to\" Defendant's letter and that Capital One had ceased sending her periodic billing statements as required by Regulation Z, implementing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201637\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) of the Truth in Lending Act, in order to charge any additional fees or interest on the account. Amended Complaint (Doc. # 17-1, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15-21). As a result, Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant had no legal basis for charging interest on the account but that its letter constituted a threat to\n   charge and collect\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     contractual\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   interest. Amended Complaint (Doc. # 17-1, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28-29). This threat to charge and collect contractual interest, Plaintiff alleges, was not allowed by law or agreement and constituted a threat to apply interest the original creditor was not adding and did not intend to add, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692f(1), 1692e(2)(A) and 1692e(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues in its briefing on the motion to dismiss that the removed, state-court Petition fails to state a claim for three reasons: 1) Defendant was allowed to accrue statutory prejudgment interest; 2) Plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to infer waiver of the original creditor's right to collect interest; and 3) the conditional language used in Defendant's letter insulates it from liability. In responding to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint, Defendant argues that leave should be denied because the proposed Amended Complaint would be futile in that it would not survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for the same reasons that the removed, state-court Petition fails to state a claim. Accordingly, the Court will address each of Defendant's arguments in turn as resolution of these issues will resolve both pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Defendant argues that even if its debt-collection letter threatens the collection of interest, it was allowed to accrue statutory interest, and as a result, the subject letter cannot be proven to violate the FDCPA provisions at issue. Defendant's position ignores that Plaintiff's proposed Amended Complaint alleges the imposition of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     contractual\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   interest that was waived by the original creditor. This allegation in conjunction with language in the debt-collection letter, which refers to the imposition of \"interest ... if so provided in your agreement with your original creditor\" is sufficient to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In support of its position, Defendant relies upon cases that are readily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Northland Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-0488-CV-W-ODS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204854658\">\n    2014 WL 4854658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2 (W.D. Mo. Sept. 30, 2014), the court denied a motion to dismiss and granted leave to file an amended complaint where Plaintiff did not specify in the complaint that Defendant \"charged the improper (contractual) interest.\" In\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Fin. Recovery Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889593\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/915/#p918\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (W.D. Mo. 2014), the court granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim stating, \"Plaintiff has not adequately asserted facts to support her claim because she has not specified that the type of interest charged was at the contractual rate.\" Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Kirk v. LVNV Funding, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-00516-CV-W-DW, slip op. (Doc. 25) at *4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012540481\">\n    2014 WL 12540481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Mo. Oct. 29, 2014), the court granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \"because the complaint [did] not specify that interest was charged at the contractual rate[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to plead \"facts that plausibly show the original creditor waived the right to collect interest.\" Suggestions in Support of Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 11, p. 5). In\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   , however, a case relied upon by Defendant in a different context, the court was faced with a very similar set of factual allegations and found that the plaintiff's complaint established a plausible claim that the original creditor waived its right to collect interest. No. 14-00516-CV-W-DW, slip op. (Doc. 25) at *3. There, the complaint alleged that the original creditor charged off the account and stopped sending periodic billing statements to the plaintiff pursuant to the charge off exception under TILA, which precluded the original creditor in whose shoes the defendant now\n   stood, from charging additional interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012540481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the court denied dismissal on that issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012540481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient factual allegations to state a plausible claim that the original creditor waived its ability to charge interest and that the Defendant was thereby precluded from doing the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that its use of conditional language in the debt-collection letter insulates it from liability, i.e. by stating that it \"may\" add accrued interest \"if so provided\" in the agreement, Defendant made a true statement that could not mislead even the \"least sophisticated consumer.\" Reply in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 25, p. 2-3). In the Eighth Circuit, \"[i]n evaluating whether a debt collection letter is false, misleading or deceptive, the letter must be viewed through the eyes of the unsophisticated consumer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Duffy v. Landberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11218671\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/871/#p873\">\n    215 F.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 873 (8th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). This standard is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   designed to protect consumers of below average sophistication or intelligence without having the standard tied to the very last rung on the sophistication ladder.... This standard protects the uninformed or na\u00efve consumer, yet also contains an objective element of reasonableness to protect debt collectors from liability for peculiar interpretations of collection letters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11218671\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/871/#p873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11218671\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/871/#p873\">\n    at 874-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). For Plaintiff's claims to survive a motion to dismiss, it must be plausible that an unsophisticated consumer would believe that by sending the letter, Defendant was attempting to collect fees or interest that it could not collect. At this early stage in the litigation, the Court cannot say that Plaintiff will be unable to show that an unsophisticated consumer would find Defendant's debt-collection letter misleading as Plaintiff has alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of its position, Defendant relies primarily upon\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Cavalry Inv., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n    365 F.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574-75 (7th Cir. 2004). In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   the Court consolidated two closely related cases on appeal where the debtors brought FDCPA claims against two debt collectors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n    at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One matter was on appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment in the debt collector's favor, and the other matter was on appeal from the grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the debt collector's favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n    at 574, 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In affirming both decisions, however, the court specifically based its holding on the fact that the plaintiffs' only proof in support of the debt-collection letter being misleading to an unsophisticated consumer were affidavits that the plaintiffs were \"confused\" by the letters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254028\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/572/#p574\">\n    at 575-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
