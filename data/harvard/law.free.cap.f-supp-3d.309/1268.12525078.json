MICHAEL MOORE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration (ECF No. 14). Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition (ECF No. 20), and Defendant filed a Reply (ECF No. 22). The matter is now ripe for review. For the reasons stated below, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises out of a dispute over a subscription to Comcast services. Plaintiff alleges that when Plaintiff signed up for Comcast's services, Comcast obtained a credit report without authorization despite a payment of $100 deposit which Comcast allegedly agreed to accept in lieu of performing a credit check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November of 2017, Plaintiff Jean Milfort (\"Plaintiff\") contacted Comcast to order cable television services and to schedule installation of those services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Nicole Patel (ECF No. 14-1) (\"Patel Decl.\"), at \u00b6 5-6. In November of 2017, Plaintiff entered into a 12-month agreement with Comcast for a discounted \"Digital Starter\" package of television services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agreement expressly stated that it is \"subject to ... Comcast's standard terms and conditions of service\" and further states that its provisions \"supplement the terms and conditions of the Comcast agreement for residential services for Cable, High Speed Internet and Digital Voice services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was Comcast's routine and regular business practice to provide a copy of the Subscriber Agreement to subscribers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Comcast sent Plaintiff an email on November 17, 2017 at 5:27pm EST containing\n   hyperlinks to the Subscriber Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Comcast sent Plaintiff another e-mail on November 17, 2017 at 5:43pm EST confirming the details of Plaintiff's order and upcoming installation. The email notified Plaintiff that: \"Your Xfinity services are provided to you on the terms and conditions set forth in the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services\" and included a hyperlink to the Subscriber Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At Plaintiff's installation on November 18, 2017, Plaintiff added an additional television adapter and signed forms confirming acceptance of the services and acknowledging that they were subject to Comcast's Subscriber Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. In December 2017, Plaintiff voluntarily disconnected the services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Pursuant to its 30-day money-back guarantee, Comcast gave Plaintiff a refund of all payments he had made, including the $100 deposit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges three causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (ECF No. 1). In Count I, Plaintiff alleges Comcast violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act when Defendant accessed Plaintiff's credit report without authorization. In Count II, Plaintiff alleges Comcast violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act by misrepresenting to Plaintiff that Defendant would not obtain Plaintiff's credit report if Plaintiff paid Defendant a non-refundable deposit of $100.00. In Count III, Plaintiff alleges Comcast committed common law fraud by intentionally and recklessly misleading Plaintiff regarding whether Defendant would obtain Plaintiff's credit report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Comcast moves to compel arbitration. Comcast argues that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement (the \"Subscriber Agreement\") which provides that the parties will arbitrate disputes and that this dispute falls within the scope of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Compel Arbitration (\"Mot. to Comp. Arbitration\") (ECF No. 14). In opposition, Plaintiff argues that there is no operative agreement to arbitrate because the Agreement was terminated upon cancellation of service in December 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Opposition (\"Pl's Opp.\") (ECF No. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Agreements Between Comcast and Plaintiff\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The relationship between Comcast and each customer is governed principally by a service contract between the parties, the Subscriber Agreement, which sets forth the parties' rights and obligations, and explains the terms and conditions of subscribing to Comcast services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Patel Decl. at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff received copies of the Subscriber Agreement on several occasions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7-8, 10-11, 13. The Subscriber Agreement contained the arbitration provision in question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Subscriber Agreement states, \"[t]his agreement contains a binding arbitration provision in section 13 that affects your rights under this agreement with respect to all service(s). The arbitration provision requires that disputes be resolved in individual arbitration or small claims court proceedings. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Patel Decl., Ex. F. Further, the Subscriber Agreement contains a section entitled \"Binding Arbitration\" and applies to \"any dispute involving you and us shall be resolved through individual arbitration\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Patel Decl., Ex. F \u00a7 13. There is a right to opt out of arbitration by notifying Comcast within thirty days of activation by visiting their website, or in writing by mail to Comcast.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. F \u00a7 13(d). The life of the arbitration provision is governed by a clause stating that it \"shall survive the termination of your Service(s) with us.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Second, Plaintiff argues that the methods specified in the arbitration provision to opt out are \"ambiguous.\" Defendant argues that the Arbitration Provision is valid despite cancellation of the Agreement.

In order to be arbitrable, the claim must\n   <em>\n    relate to\n   </em>\n   the agreement, any addendum, or the customer's service. Here, Plaintiff negotiated a service contract, and in the process Comcast obtained Plaintiff's credit report without authorization despite payment of a $100 deposit which Comcast allegedly agreed to accept in lieu of performing a credit check. The Court finds that this is related to Plaintiff's service and thus falls within the scope of the arbitration provision in the Subscription Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Plaintiff is hereby ORDERED to submit this dispute to arbitration pursuant to the Subscriber Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date of this Order. All proceedings in this action are STAYED pending arbitration of the Parties' dispute. The Parties are directed to notify the Court of the outcome of the arbitration within thirty (30) days of its completion. The Clerk of the Court is directed to administratively CLOSE this case.
