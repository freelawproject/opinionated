For the reasons discussed below, the court finds that plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge is ripe under both the constitutional and prudential inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, defendants argue that plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge is unripe because plaintiffs may not have to provide any warning if their products' glyphosate levels are below the \"safe harbor\" level that will likely be adopted by the State before the warnings are required. However, regardless of the State's possible enactment of a safe harbor level, plaintiffs still face a significant risk of injury. The court recognizes that (1) Proposition 65 provides that no warning is required for a product where an exposure poses no significant risk assuming lifetime exposure at the level in question,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2025249.10\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 25249.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) the OEHHA has set specific safe harbor levels for several chemicals, and no warnings are required if the daily exposure caused by a product is below that safe harbor level, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 27 \u00a7 25705 ; and (3) the OEHHA has proposed a safe harbor level of 1,100 micrograms per day for glyphosate, and the corresponding regulation setting that level is expected to be completed by July 1, 2018, (Fernandez Decl. \u00b6 9 (Docket No. 48) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nevertheless, assuming plaintiffs' products were tested and found to contain concentrations of glyphosate below the safe harbor level as set by Cal. Code. Regs. tit. 27 \u00a7 25705, plaintiffs would still have no reasonable assurance that they would not be subject to enforcement action. Plaintiffs have provided evidence that private plaintiffs have brought enforcement actions for various chemicals notwithstanding a defense of compliance with the safe harbor level for those chemicals, including where the California Attorney General said a proposed enforcement suit had no merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, plaintiffs, who have stated they intend to give no warning based on their constitutional right against compelled speech, face a credible threat of enforcement as a result of exercising such right, regardless of the possible enactment of a safe harbor level for glyphosate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants claim that enforcement actions would be unlikely in the event that a product did not exceed the safe harbor level for glyphosate, citing both the steps required to file suit (which require 60 days' notice and the filing of a certificate of merit) and the fact that the Attorney General will likely inform the private enforcer that (1) there was no violation, (2) an action was not in the public interest, and (3) the action would not warrant civil penalties and fees. Defendants also note that if the private enforcer refused to withdraw its notice of violation, the Attorney General would then post a letter on the Attorney General website stating that there was no merit to the proposed enforcement action. Notwithstanding these purported barriers, one California Court of Appeal has explained that the instigation of Proposition 65 enforcement actions is \"easy-and almost absurdly easy at the pleading stage and pretrial stages.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Consumer Def.

However, that would merely be an affirmative defense which plaintiffs would have to assert once the enforcement action is brought against them,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and facing enforcement actions, or even the possible risk of enforcement actions, are cognizable injuries.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors Rest. v.

However, as discussed in detail below in the court's discussion of the likelihood of success on the merits, any warning which plaintiffs might be able to devise consistent with defendants' demands under the regulations interpreting Proposition 65 would be inconsistent with plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As in initial matter, plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the listing of glyphosate violates the First Amendment, because the listing is government speech, not private speech. \"The Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private speech; it does not regulate government speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Grove City v. Summum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). California's listing of chemicals it purportedly knows to cause cancer is neither a restriction of private speech nor government-compelled private speech. The fact that the listing triggers Proposition 65's warning requirement does not transform the listing itself into government-compelled speech. Indeed, glyphosate has been listed by California since July 2017, and plaintiffs have not been required to provide any warnings. It is only the upcoming July 2018 deadline for providing the Proposition 65 warning that compels private speech. Thus, plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the listing of glyphosate violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similarly, plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of irreparable harm should the court fail to enjoin the listing of glyphosate, because any harm that plaintiffs might suffer is caused by the warning requirements of Proposition 65, rather than the listing itself. Notably, plaintiffs do not claim that they have already suffered any injury as a result of the listing, but only allege that they will suffer injury as the warning requirement deadline approaches and takes effect. In other words, any alleged irreparable injury could be prevented directly by enjoining the warning requirement. Accordingly, the court will deny a preliminary injunction based on plaintiffs' claim that the glyphosate listing violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A different analysis is required for the warning requirement, as it compels commercial speech.

A reasonable consumer may understand that if the warning says \"known to cause cancer,\" there could be a small minority of studies or experts disputing whether the substance in fact causes cancer. However, a reasonable consumer would not understand that a substance is \"known to cause cancer\" where only one health organization had found that the substance in question causes cancer and virtually all other government agencies and health organizations that have reviewed studies on the chemical had found there was no evidence that it caused cancer. Under these facts, the message that glyphosate is known to cause cancer is misleading at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court also rejects defendants' arguments that the warning requirement is permissible under\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   because (1) Proposition 65 does not require plaintiffs to use the language \"known to the state of California to cause cancer,\" and (2) plaintiffs may not have to provide warnings if their products fall below the safe harbor level that will likely be adopted. Under the\n   applicable regulations, in order for a warning to be per se clear and reasonable, the warning must state that the chemical is\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   to cause cancer. California regulations also discourage, if not outright prohibit, language that calls into doubt California's knowledge that a chemical causes cancer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, defendants provide no example of a more detailed warning explaining the debate regarding glyphosate's carcinogenicity that would pass muster under Proposition 65 and the applicable regulations; and at oral argument, defense counsel repeatedly rejected various alternative warnings proposed by the court which would provide more context or use more accurate language.

For example, the EPA has reviewed studies regarding the carcinogenicity of glyphosate multiple times and has determined each time that there was no or insufficient evidence that glyphosate causes cancer, most recently in September 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several international agencies have likewise concluded that there is insufficient evidence that glyphosate causes cancer, including the European Commission's Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General, multiple divisions of the World Health Organization besides the IARC, and Germany's lead consumer health and safety regulator.

The court expresses no opinion as to whether a statement that a chemical is known to cause cancer is factually accurate and uncontroversial where there is stronger evidence in support of the chemical's carcinogenicity. However, here, given the heavy weight of evidence in the record that glyphosate is not in fact known to cause cancer, the required warning is factually inaccurate and controversial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CTIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277381\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1105/#p1118\">\n    854 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1119 ;\n   <em>\n    Am.

Whether Proposition 65's statutory and regulatory scheme is good policy is not at issue. However, where California seeks to compel businesses to provide cancer warnings, the warnings must be factually accurate and not misleading. As applied to glyphosate, the required warnings are false and misleading.
