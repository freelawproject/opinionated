Ducore\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:18-cr-68 (E.D. Va. Feb. 7, 2018) (Indictment). The indictment alleges that on July 29, 2017, on JetBlue Flight 1528 flying from the Dominican Republic to New York City, defendant assaulted a flight attendant, disregarded flight attendant instructions, directed aggressive and abusive language towards the flight crew and fellow passengers, and engaged in other inappropriate behavior. Ultimately, as a result of defendant's actions, Flight 1528 was diverted from New York, its original destination, to Washington Dulles International Airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Relevant to the present motion, defendant was seated in seat 3A on Flight 1528. The first six rows of the aircraft comprised first class seating, and the government obtained a partial manifest from JetBlue containing a list of the names and phone numbers of all passengers in the first six rows. Defendant does not know how many persons were seated in first class during the flight. The government provided defendant with the names, but not the contact information, for the lead flight attendant, the pilot, and the five passengers who were interviewed by the government in its investigation of defendant's case. The government also provided defendant with copies of all the witness statements. The government did not produce the names of any other individuals seated in first class. Defendant alleges that the unnamed passengers were eyewitnesses to the events at issue, and that these passengers therefore may possess exculpatory information material to a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It is well settled that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   requires the government to disclose to a\n   defendant in a criminal prosecution all \"evidence ... material either to guilt or to punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giglio v.

In essence, defendant's request is a discovery request, not a request for\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material. Nonetheless, defendant frames her request in\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   terms, arguing that the other passengers in first class\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   produce statements that are exculpatory or statements that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   impeach the government's flight attendant witnesses. But this argument fails at the threshold, as the Fourth Circuit has held that where, as here, a defendant can only speculate as to what the requested information might reveal\" she \"cannot satisfy\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   's requirement of showing the requested evidence would be favorable to the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    Caro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220597\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/608/\">\n    597 F.3d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And of course, defendant here can only speculate as to the content of the statements of other witnesses on the flight; she has no evidence that the witnesses she seeks to have the government identify would provide any exculpatory information or impeachment evidence. As such, her\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   request fails before it can even get off the ground; defendant cannot show that the information she seeks would be \"favorable to the accused\" as required by\n   <em>\n    Brady.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Furthermore, with respect to the flight attendants, pilot, and passengers whose names and statements have already been given to defendant, the government has already produced the statements and names of the witnesses. Defendant now seeks to compel the government to produce contact information for these witnesses so that defendant can pursue an independent investigation. Defendant believes that these witnesses may have other information, not reflected in their statements to the government, which may be helpful to the defense either because the statements would show that defendant did not intend to intimidate the flight crew\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or because their statements would impeach the statements of the flight attendant witnesses. Again, defendant does not\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   that additional statements from the witnesses the government has already interviewed would be favorable, and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   does not impose an obligation on the government to turn over telephone numbers or other contact information for its witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lobo-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=468%20Fed.%20Appx.%20186\">\n    468 Fed.
