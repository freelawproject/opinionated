The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Ortiz's applications and Ortiz sought review by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). R. 58-77, 96-97. A hearing was held on November 30, 2015, at which Ortiz and his attorney appeared. R. 33-57. In a written decision dated December 14, 2015, the ALJ found that Ortiz was not disabled. R. 18-28. The Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1-7. Ortiz filed this action on June 9, 2017, seeking review of that final decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, filed June 9, 2017 (Docket # 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ortiz was represented by an attorney at the hearing before the ALJ. R. 35. Before calling any witnesses to testify, the ALJ reviewed the record which, among other things, indicated that Ortiz was 55 at the time of the hearing, that he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with polyneuropathy and paresthesias, that he had a benign tremor, and that he claimed leg pain. R. 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ortiz testified that he became disabled on June 30, 2013. R. 41. His right thigh was \"always in pain,\" which he described as being between an eight and ten on a ten point scale, with ten being the most amount of pain. R. 48. Ortiz also had a tremor and numbness in his right hand, which shakes \"once a day\" or \"once in a while,\" though Ortiz said that \"[i]t might shake here because I get nervous.\" R. 49. The ALJ observed that he \"didn't see it moving now.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ortiz said that he could type and write, and that he could also button his shirt and tie his shoes, but that he had to take his time in so doing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ortiz stated that he drank alcohol \"maybe once a year\" and did not take drugs except for medicine, which included tramadol for pain, as well as claritin, glipizide, and \"lantis.\" R. 42-43. Ortiz said that the tramadol\"doesn't do that well\" to control the pain in his right thigh. R. 48-49. Ortiz stated that his blood sugar was controlled, although he tested it only every two or three days. R. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Concerning daily activities, Ortiz testified that he lived on the first floor of an apartment building with his 77 year old mother. R. 38-39. Oritz testified that he shopped for groceries in the neighborhood for his mother because \"I'm the only guy she's got.\" R. 39-40. Ortiz used the bus to visit his doctors, but did not use trains because he could not go up or down the staircases. R. 41. Ortiz stated that although he had a driver's license, he had\n   not driven an automobile in seven or eight years. R. 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Concerning prior work history, Oritz testified that he stopped working in 2013 and received unemployment benefits for about \"six or nine months\" after that, and also received welfare benefits. R. 40. Before that, Ortiz said that he worked as a mail clerk for a bank, which consisted of carrying mail packages by hand to different locations on a single floor in the building. R. 43-44. Before that, Ortiz worked full time for a jewelry company in 2009, where he packed items weighing up to forty pounds into boxes while standing. R. 45-46. Before working for the jewelry company, Ortiz worked as a mail clerk for a company called \"Paychecks\" in 2007. R. 46. This mail clerk position was different than the one at the bank because at Paychecks, the packages were heavier (sometimes up to fifty or one hundred pounds) and Ortiz used a cart. R. 46-47. Before that, Ortiz worked as a typist for AT &amp; T for four and one half years, where he performed \"data processing into a computer system,\" but was ultimately laid off from that job. R. 47-48. Ortiz never graduated high school and did not receive a general equivalency diploma, though he finished 11th grade. R. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ortiz testified that he could not work for the bank as a mail clerk anymore because he could not sit or stand for too long without alternating, and that he could not work as a mail clerk for the jewelry company because it required him to walk all day, which he could not do. R. 49-50. Ortiz also testified that he could not work as a data processor because he could not sit for the length of time that job required. R. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bernard Gussoff, M.D., a medical expert witness, testified. Dr. Gussoff was chairman of the Department of Medicine at Jamaica Hospital for 12 years and worked at Maimonides Medical Center for 23 years in the specialties of medicine, hematology, and oncology. R. 50-51. Referring to evidence in the record, including treatment notes from Ortiz's doctors, Dr. Gussoff found that Ortiz had \"diabetes mellitus with a sensory polyneuropathy, not a motor,\" which caused \"paresthesia neuralgia,\" or altered sensation in his extremities. R. 51-52. Dr. Gussoff opined that Ortiz had \"mild osteoarthritis\" causing pain in his right hip, though Dr. Gussoff had no x-rays to document that. R. 52. Dr. Gussoff agreed with the ALJ that Ortiz had a tremor that had been described as intermittent and benign. R. 53. Based on this, Dr. Gussoff found that Ortiz did not meet or equal any listed impairment under \"9.08, 1.02a.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to Ortiz's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), Dr. Gussoff opined that Ortiz was still capable of sedentary work and lifting and carrying up to ten or twenty pounds occasionally, standing or sitting for up to six hours, and standing or walking intermittently during the day for two hours. R. 53-54. Dr. Gussoff based this determination in part on the fact that Ortiz \"shops, which means that he has to either walk, walk to the shopping center, walk down the aisles, pick items of various weights into his basket and carry them back to the house.\" R. 53. Dr. Gussoff also found only mild manipulative limitations and no reaching limitations because although Ortiz indicated that he had numbness in his hands, he was able to eat and type, indicating good sensory contact. R. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ALJ called Helene Feldman, a vocational expert witness (\"VE\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Feldman has a master's degree in \"rehab counseling,\" is a certified employee assistance practitioner, is licensed in New York State as a mental health counselor, and had been working \"in the field\" for over 25 years. R. 55. The ALJ told the VE that Ortiz had held three jobs before-mail clerk, packager\n   in a jewelry business, and data processor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The VE classified each of these jobs using the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\"DOT\"), and described Ortiz's prior work as a mail clerk as requiring \"light strength,\" his prior work with the jewelry business as a packer as requiring \"medium strength,\" and his prior work as a data processor as requiring \"sedentary strength.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The VE noted that Ortiz had no transferrable skills.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ asked the VE to consider a hypothetical individual with a sedentary RFC who was also limited to \"no climbing, no balancing, no crawling, occasional bending, stooping, kneeling and crouching, no driving, no heavy machinery, no unprotected heights, [and] occasional uneven surfaces.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The VE testified that such a person would be able to perform Ortiz's prior work as a data processor, as well as additional jobs which existed in substantial numbers in the national economy, including dowel inspector, and dial marker. R. 55-56. The VE testified, however, that if this person were off-task more than five to ten percent of the day, or needed to miss more than three days a month, then there would be no work that this person could perform.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The medical evidence in the record is summarized in the Commissioner's brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 2-5. We discuss the evidence relevant to our conclusions in Section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ALJ denied Ortiz's application for benefits on December 14, 2015. R. 18. The ALJ found that Ortiz met the insured status requirements of the Act through March 31, 2017, and that he had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since June 30, 2013, the alleged onset date. R. 23. The ALJ found that Ortiz had the following severe impairments: \"diabetes mellitus with sensory polyneuropathy ; history of mild osteoarthritis of the hip ; and obesity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He found, however, that Ortiz had no medically determinable psychological impairment. R. 24. The ALJ also noted that although testing performed in February 2014 by one of Ortiz's treating physicians, Dr. Yelena Lindenbaum, indicated that Ortiz had mild carpal tunnel syndrome and mild L3 radiculopathy, earlier testing and later studies and treatment notations did not document these findings. R. 24, 26, 524. The ALJ found that Dr. Lindenbaum's findings were evidence of an \"acute process\" and that Ortiz \"d[id] not have a severe medically determinable impairment associated with carpal tunnel syndrome or lumbar radiculopathy.\" R. 24. Finally, the ALJ found that evidence of Ortiz's benign tremor was not regularly corroborated by other physicians and thus was not associated with a severe impairment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The ALJ then determined that none of Ortiz's severe impairments met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ specifically considered Listing 9.00B5, which includes the endocrine disorders of \"[d]iabetes mellitus and other pancreatic gland disorders,\" with specific reference to \"sensory neuropathies listed under 11.00.\" R. 24-25. In so doing, the ALJ noted that Dr. Gussoff \"was of the opinion that the claimant's impairments did not meet or medically equal the severity of any impairment listed in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1,\" and that the ALJ found this conclusion to be \"well reasoned and supported by the credible evidence of record.\" R. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Turning next to Ortiz's RFC, the ALJ determined that Ortiz could \"perform sedentary work as defined in\n   20 CFR 404.1567(a) and 416.967(a) except for no climbing, balancing, or crawling; occasional bending, stooping, kneeling, and crouching; no operation of heavy machinery; no unprotected heights; and, occasional exposure to uneven surfaces.\" R. 25. In making this determination, the ALJ reviewed the evidence and medical opinions of record, as described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the ALJ noted that Dr. Gussoff's testimony at the hearing was \"well reasoned and supported by the credible evidence of record.\" R. 26. In this testimony, Dr. Gussoff noted that Ortiz had diabetes mellitus with sensory polyneuropathy, which was consistent with Ortiz's loss of sensation in his extremities. R. 25. However, Dr. Gussoff noted that there was \"no evidence of motor neuropathy which was considered more severe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Gussoff also found possible mild osteoarthritis in Ortiz's right hip, though that condition was not documented by x-ray.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Gussoff correspondingly found that Ortiz retained the RFC \"to perform sedentary work and possibly light work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ALJ also reviewed treatment notes from Dr. John Minutillo, one of Ortiz's treating physicians. R. 26, 31-32. The ALJ found significant that on July 26, 2013, after Ortiz had been hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory distress in June of 2013, Dr. Minutillo opined that Ortiz \"could return to [work] the next week.\" R. 26. Moreover, Dr. Minutillo's later treatment notes indicated that Ortiz's weight was stable and that Ortiz felt \"well\" other than claims of numbness and pain in his right thigh.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Minutillo's later treatment notes failed to indicate that Ortiz was limited in his ability to perform sedentary work, and that although treatment notes from September of 2015 indicated that Ortiz complained of pain and shortness of breath with exertion, his overall physical exam was \"largely within normal limits\" and he reported that he was \"feeling well and working.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the ALJ noted that although physical therapy notes from Mt. Sinai indicated that Ortiz was using a cane that he held in the wrong hand, Dr. Minutillo's notes did not indicate that Ortiz ambulated with a cane.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record contained no opinion from Dr. Minutillo regarding Ortiz's RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The ALJ also noted that Ortiz was treated briefly by Dr. Mohammed Fahad Khan, although Ortiz did not complete his treatment plan after complaining of a lack of significant improvement. R. 26, 32, 528. The record contained no opinion from Dr. Khan regarding Ortiz's RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In compiling Ortiz's RFC, the ALJ weighed the opinions of one treating source and one consulting source. R. 25-27. The ALJ gave \"some weight\" to the opinion of consulting physician Dr. John Fkiaras, who found that Ortiz had significant functional limitations in his ability to perform sedentary work due to the pain in his right thigh, as well as his other conditions. R. 27, 31. The ALJ found that these limitations were inconsistent with the testimony provided by Dr. Gussoff, as well as Dr. Minutillo's treatment notes described above. R. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Meanwhile, the ALJ gave \"little weight\" to opinions from April and May 2014 that were provided by plaintiff's treating physician, Dr. Lindenbaum, who found that Ortiz suffered \"severe leg pain and sensory loss in the right thigh which interferes with walking, sitting, or standing for prolonged periods of time; and limits [Ortiz's] ability to take care of his daily needs.\" R. 26. In so doing, the ALJ noted that Dr. Lindenbaum treated Ortiz from October 2013 through March 2014, that \"EMG and other testing disclosed only mild sensory polyneuropathy, and mild meralgia paresthetica,\" that \"[p]hysical and neurological testing showed only mild positive findings;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   and, the claimant had a normal gait.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Morever, the ALJ noted that Dr. Lindenbaum's findings were \"made less than 12 months from the alleged disability onset date\" and that Ortiz later reported in July 2014 \"that he had an increase in symptoms with walking more than 5 blocks, standing more than 15 minutes, going up one flight of stairs, and sitting for more than 2 or 3 hours.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the ALJ noted that Ortiz reported living alone and performing activities of daily living independently with pain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to Ortiz's credibility, the ALJ found that Ortiz's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms,\" but that his \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms [were] not entirely credible.\" R. 25. The ALJ noted that Ortiz testified that he was unable to perform past relevant work due to the pain in his right thigh, that his pain was an eight to ten on a scale of one to ten, that medication was unsuccessful in alleviating this pain, and that he had numbness in his hands.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ found, however, that the credible evidence of record did not support the conclusion that Ortiz was significantly limited in his ability to perform sedentary work. R. 27. In making this finding, the ALJ noted that Ortiz testified that he remained capable of performing normal activities of daily living, that Dr. Minutillo's recent notations indicated that Ortiz was working, and that other descriptions of Ortiz's ability to perform work related functions, such as notes from Mt. Sinai, indicated that Ortiz's description of his abilities and functions were consistent with sedentary work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the ALJ found that Ortiz retained the RFC as described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After determining Ortiz's RFC, the ALJ turned to the question of whether Ortiz could perform his past work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Relying on the testimony of the VE, the ALJ found that a person of Ortiz's RFC could perform Ortiz's past work as a data processor \"as actually and generally performed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the ALJ found that Ortiz could perform his past work, the ALJ did not consider whether there was other work in the national economy that Ortiz could perform, despite his limited RFC. Accordingly, the ALJ found Ortiz not disabled under the Act and denied his application for benefits.

The record also contained the treatment notes of Ortiz's treating podiatrist, Dr. Isaac Tabari,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 316-22, 551-63, although the ALJ did not make reference to these notes in his opinion. While only Dr. Lindenbaum rendered an opinion that was weighed by the ALJ, R. 26, 524-37, the ALJ also referred to Drs. Minutillo's and Khan's treatment notes in his assessment of Ortiz's RFC, R. 25-27. Tellingly, Ortiz does not point to any gaps in the medical record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 10-12. Given the presence of all relevant treatment notes, and the absence of any gaps in the record, the ALJ was not required to seek additional opinions from Ortiz's treating sources notwithstanding the fact that only one such source rendered an opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tankisi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20Fed.%20Appx.%2029\">\n    521 Fed.Appx. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"remand is not always required when an ALJ fails in his duty to request opinions, particularly where, as here, the record contains sufficient evidence from which an ALJ can assess the petitioner's [RFC].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Similarly, Ortiz's argument that the ALJ failed to properly weigh the medical opinions in the record pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 416.927(c) is without merit. The ALJ gave \"little weight\" to Dr. Lindenbaum's opinion that Ortiz \"suffers severe leg pain and sensory loss in the right thigh which interferes with walking, sitting, or standing for prolonged periods of time; and limits his ability to take care of his daily needs.\" R. 26. Of course, Dr. Lindenbaum was Ortiz's treating physician, and her opinion was due controlling weight absent \"good reasons.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). The ALJ provided such reasons, however, by noting that \"EMG and other testing disclosed only mild sensory polyneuropathy, and mild meralgia paresthetica. Physical and neurological testing showed only mild positive findings; and, the claimant had a normal gait.\" R. 26. These findings are contained in Dr. Lindenbaum's own treatment notes, as well as those of Dr. Minutillo, R. 299, 301, 306, 428, 437, 440, 443, 446, 465, and are inconsistent with the notion that Ortiz's pain interfered with his normal activities, including walking. Similarly, the ALJ noted that Ortiz \"reported that he lived alone and performed [activities of daily living] and instrumental [activities of daily living] independently with pain.\" R. 26, 368. These findings correspond to the factors listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 416.927(c), including the opinion's consistency\n   with the record as a whole, and the extent to which the opinion is supported by medical signs and laboratory findings.

Dr. Fkiaras was a consulting examiner who did not treat Ortiz. R. 27, 347-58. As such, his opinion was not presumptively entitled to controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), 416.927(c)(2). The ALJ noted that Dr. Fkiaras's opinion, insofar as it assessed \"significant functional [ ] limitations associated with right thigh pain and other conditions,\" was contradicted by the medical expert's testimony and treatment notes of Dr. Minutillo. R. 27. In particular, Dr. Minutillo's treatment notes from September of 2015 indicated that Ortiz's physical exam produced results that were \"largely within normal limits,\" and that Ortiz reported that he was \"feeling well and working.\" R. 26, 463, 466. Similarly, the ALJ indicated that prior treatment notes from Dr. Minutillo failed to indicate any limitations in functioning, and that Dr. Minutillo did not describe medical findings or complaints indicating that Ortiz was limited in his ability to perform sedentary work. R. 26, 217. In other words, the ALJ relied on consistency with the record as a whole, a factor contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), in providing only \"some weight\" to Dr. Fkiaras's opinion.

Based on his review of the record, as well as Ortiz's testimony regarding daily activities, Dr. Gussoff testified that Ortiz remained capable of lifting and occasionally carrying up to ten, and possibly twenty, pounds, sitting up to six hours a day, and standing or walking intermittently for two hours a day. R. 53-54. The ALJ found Dr. Gussoff's opinion \"well reasoned and supported by the credible evidence of record.\" R. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This opinion was supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ referred to the contemporaneous treatment records of Dr. Minutillo, one of Ortiz's treating sources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513077\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/563/#p568\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In so doing, the ALJ noted that Dr. Minutillo did not indicate that Ortiz had limitations in functioning, and generally did not describe medical findings or complaints indicating that Ortiz lacked the capacity to perform at least sedentary work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513077\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/563/#p568\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, later treatment notes from Dr. Minutillo indicated that Ortiz reported \"feeling well and working.\" R. 26, 463, 466. As such, Dr. Minutillo's treatment notes,\n   as referenced by the ALJ, are consistent with Dr. Gussoff's finding that Ortiz's impairments were not so severe as to render him incapable of sedentary work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Similarly, Dr. Gussoff's statement that Ortiz maintained sufficient RFC to perform sedentary work was supported by the record evidence indicating that Ortiz independently carried out his own activities of daily living. At the hearing, Ortiz testified that he went grocery shopping in his neighborhood on his mother's behalf. R. 39-40. Likewise, in a function report, Ortiz indicated that he occasionally cooked for himself, and also cleaned around the house and performed other housework, though he had to \"take [his] time cause the pain [he's] having in [his] [ ]right thigh.\" R. 183-84. This report also confirmed that Ortiz shopped for his mother three to four times a week, and that it took him between ten and thirty minutes. R. 185. Finally, a report from Mt. Sinai Center for Advanced Medicine also indicated that Ortiz performed his own activities of daily living, albeit with pain. R. 368. These activities are consistent with the opinion provided by Dr. Gussoff, as well as the ALJ's ultimate RFC determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, we note that in granting \"some weight\" to the opinion of consultative examiner Dr. Fkiaras, R. 27, the ALJ adopted many of the limitations that Dr. Fiarkas noted in his report. Dr. Fkiaras's medical source statement indicated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [t]he claimant is restricted from any lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, squatting, kneeling, crouching, and bending. The claimant has a moderate limitation sitting, standing, and walking. The claimant is restricted from activities which require use of the right lower extremity. The claimant has a moderate to severe limitation climbing stairs. The claimant is restricted from activities which require exposure to unprotected heights. The claimant is restricted from driving and operating heavy machinery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   R. 350. Similarly, the ALJ's assessment of Ortiz's RFC found limitations in many of the same areas in which Dr. Fkiaras noted limitations, such as restrictions from unprotected heights, the operation of heavy machinery, and some limitations in bending, stooping, kneeling and crouching, albeit not to the extent suggested by Dr. Fkiaras. R. 25. To the extent that the ALJ's RFC differed from Dr. Fkiaras's medical source statement-most notably, with respect to Ortiz's ability to lift items weighing up to ten pounds, as required for sedentary work-his determination was supported by the opinion of Dr. Gussoff, which in turn was consistent with the record evidence of Ortiz's activities of daily living for the reasons stated above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, we find that the ALJ's RFC determination that Ortiz could perform sedentary work, subject to additional limitations, was supported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Ortiz's motion for judgment on the pleadings\n   (Docket# 16) is denied, the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket# 13) is granted, and the case is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Commissioner's Notice of Motion, filed Nov. 27, 2017 (Docket # 13); Memorandum of Law in Support of the Commissioner's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed Nov. 27, 2017 (Docket # 14) (\"Def.

This statement has little value as to the RFC determination given that Ortiz's hospitalization was for an illness unrelated to thigh pain.
