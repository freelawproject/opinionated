PERRY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Country Preferred issued three automobile insurance policies to Christopher and Sandra Lee, each with a policy limit of $100,000. The Lees paid separate premiums on each policy for underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. On November 2, 2016, Christopher Lee was struck by a wrong-way driver while riding his motorcycle and suffered substantial injuries. The at-fault driver had an automobile insurance policy with a policy limit of $100,000, and his insurance company settled with the Lees for the full amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Lees now seek to recover additional amounts from Country Preferred under the UIM provisions of their own insurance policies. Because Country Preferred contends that the Lees are not entitled to UIM coverage, it filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to pay the Lees any amounts under their insurance policies. The Lees then filed counterclaims, seeking a declaration that Country Preferred owes them the full amount of the UIM coverage under each of the three policies and alleging unjust enrichment, fraud, and vexatious refusal to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before me now is Country Preferred's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Because the Lees are not entitled to recovery under the unambiguous UIM provisions of their policies or any of their counterclaims, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Standards Governing Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) provides that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial-a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.

The first policy was issued to Christopher Lee and insured his 2015 Harley Davidson motorcycle (Insurance Policy Number P24A5361315). It had effective dates of May 29, 2016 through May 29, 2017. The second policy was issued to Christopher Lee and insured a 2015 Ford automobile (Insurance Policy Number P24A7818593). It had effective dates of June 29, 2016 through December 29, 2016. The third insurance policy was issued to Sandra Lee and insured a 2008 Dodge automobile (Insurance Policy P24A7450349). It had effective dates of June 10, 2016 through December 10, 2016. The three policies contain identical language with respect to the relevant provisions at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Each policy has UIM coverage limits of $100,000.

This means that under the plain language of the policies, a vehicle is not \"underinsured\" if it is covered by an insurance policy with a limit of at least $100,000.

The at-fault driver had an insurance policy covering the accident with a policy limit of $100,000, and his insurance company paid the full policy limit to the Lees in settlement of their claim. The Lees now seek to recover under the UIM provisions of their insurance policies with Country Preferred because Christopher Lee's damages greatly exceed the $100,000 they recovered from the at-fault driver. According to the Lees, they are entitled to recover under the UIM provisions of each policy for a total amount of $300,000. Country Preferred contends that the UIM provisions of the policies do not apply and that the Lees are not entitled to \"stack\" their policies as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because this is a diversity case, I apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\n   <em>\n    Gasperini v.

But any ambiguity as to the amount of UIM coverage provided by this policy is irrelevant because such an ambiguity, if one exists, would not render this policy ambiguous as to when UIM coverage applies.

By focusing solely on \"aggregate maximum limit of insurance,\" the Gohagans ignore the stipulation that the aggregate maximum limit \"shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of insurance under any one policy.\" In this case, the tree-falling incident that resulted in Mr. Gohagan's injury represents the \"occurrence\" from which our interpretation of the policies flows. Both policies have an each-occurrence limit of $1,000,000. For the occurrence at issue, then, the \"highest applicable limit of insurance\" under either individual policy is equivalent to the each-occurrence limit. Thus, the aggregate maximum limit of insurance under both policies combined may not exceed the each-occurrence limit under either policy-in this case, $1,000,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The anti-stacking provision in the Lees' policies compels the same conclusion here. As in\n   <em>\n    Gohagan\n   </em>\n   , the anti-stacking provision in the Lees' policies is not ambiguous because it uses the identical language to limit the maximum amount of liability \"under all the policies\" to \"the highest applicable limit of liability under any one policy,\" which in this case is $100,000. Because the limit of the Lees' UIM coverage is $100,000, and they received the policy limit of $100,000 from the at-fault driver's insurance company, they are not entitled to stack and recover under the UIM provisions of their insurance policies as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Lees also argue that the \"other insurance\" clause of their policies renders the UIM provision ambiguous. The \"other insurance\" provision provides that \"[i]f there is other applicable uninsured-underinsured motorists insurance that covers a loss,\n   <strong>\n    we\n   </strong>\n   will pay\n   <strong>\n    our\n   </strong>\n   proportionate share of that loss.

While acknowledging that\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   construed a similar policy, the Eighth Circuit nevertheless concluded that it was not bound by the state court's interpretation of the \"other insurance\" clause because the\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   policy contained an additional \"two or more cars insured\" provision which resolved any ambiguity with respect to stacking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1579714,1554074\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/757/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the Lees' policy contains the same type of clarifying anti-stacking policy in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , I likewise find that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   does not render the policy at issue here ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midwestern Indem.

Because the Lees are not entitled to UIM coverage, their claim that Country Preferred vexatiously refused to pay them (Count III) necessarily fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BSI Constructors, Inc. v.

The basis for both claims is that Country Preferred allegedly collected premiums from the Lees for multiple policies even though they never intended to pay UIM coverage on more than one policy. According to the Lees, if they are not permitted to stack their policies then the promise of coverage is illusory and fraudulent. Again, the Lees are wrong. This argument was rejected by the Missouri Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , which held that an underinsurance policy is not illusory or ambiguous because of \"the mathematical inability to collect the full...underinsured motorist coverage...The effect of underinsured motorist coverage is to assure the insured of receiving the contracted amount of protection.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9979733\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/808/379/#p383\">\n    808 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   383 n.1. The Eighth Circuit has also rejected this argument, concluding as a matter of law that a policy is not rendered illusory simply because it prohibits stacking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The Daughhetees also argue that a construction of the [insurance] policy that prohibits UIM stacking renders the policy illusory. Under Missouri law, an illusory promise is on that appears to be a promise, but in fact promises nothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordry v. Vanderbilt Mortg. &amp; Fin., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779708\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/1106/#p1110\">\n    445 F.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1110 (8th Cir. 2006). The district court correctly ruled that the [insurance] policy is not illusory. Paragraph 1 permits payment of the highest applicable limit of any one State Farm UIM policy. That the applicable limits are the same does not render the policy illusory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Daughhetee v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115712\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/1128/#p1134\">\n    743 F.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134 (8th Cir. 2014). The same reasoning applies here. The Lees' policies are not rendered illusory merely because they unambiguously prohibit stacking, and it was not fraud for Country Preferred to provide only the contracted amount of UIM protection in this case. That the Lees were not entitled to UIM coverage in this situation because the at-fault driver's coverage equaled their own does not render the policy illusory or demonstrate that Country Preferred would not pay UIM benefits if required to do so under the policy. \"A guarantee by [an insurer] of a minimum recovery is not an illusory protection, nor is it harsh to enforce a contract between an insurer and insured that guarantees insured will recover, from some source, the amount of insurer's damage up to the limit of UIM coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Melton v.
