Orrick, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Co. (\"Westchester\") brings an action against defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Liberty Mutual\") for equitable contribution stemming from Westchester's defense and indemnity of Tractel, Inc. (\"Tractel\") following an accident occurring on August 4, 2011 at a residential building located at 300 Berry Street in San Francisco, California. Westchester, which insured Tractel as part of a \"wrap up\" insurance program, argues that it is entitled to equitable contribution from Liberty Mutual because both parties previously issued a primary insurance policy to Tractel, while Liberty Mutual contends that its policy carves out coverage when a wrap up insurance program applies and that it had no obligation, equitable or otherwise, to defend Tractel in that circumstance. Both parties moved for summary judgment. For the reasons discussed below, Westchester is not entitled to equitable contribution from Liberty Mutual. I grant Liberty Mutual's motion and deny Westchester's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

B.1 at 1 (Dkt. No. 35-1). As a part of the Arterra Project, the owner created an owner controlled insurance program (\"OCIP\") in order to provide insurance coverage to contractors working on the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adams Decl., Ex. 2, OCIP Manual at 5 (Dkt.

GTE Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"512649\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/594/730/#p738\">\n    594 F.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (9th Cir. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Liberty Mutual argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Westchester's equitable contribution claim because (i) the Westchester Policy was intended to be the sole insurance policy applicable for job site related claims against an OCIP-enrolled contractor and (ii) the Liberty Mutual Policy expressly provided that, when Tractel is insured under an OCIP policy, the Liberty Mutual Policy is excess over the applicable limits for the OCIP policy. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    I. LIBERTY MUTUAL'S POLICY ACTS AS EXCESS OVER WESTCHESTER'S\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Westchester contends that both the Liberty Mutual Policy and the Westchester Policy insured Tractel as primary policies for the Underlying Litigation, and because the Liberty Mutual Policy is not a \"true\" excess policy, the Westchester Policy and the Liberty Mutual Policy are at the same\n   level of risk. Liberty Mutual concedes that its policy is not a \"true\" excess policy because it generally provides primary insurance to Tractel. But where Tractel is insured under a wrap-up policy, such as the OCIP for the Arterra Project, the Liberty Mutual Policy responds on an excess basis. It contains specific coverage carve outs when Tractel is also covered by wrap-up insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adams Decl., Ex. 11, Liberty Mutual Policy, at Endorsement No. 9 (ECF p. 35). Section VIII \u00b6 12 (ECF p. 23) (\"The coverage afforded by this Policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in excess of ... other insurance\"). Liberty Mutual contends that Endorsement 9 of its policy renders the Liberty Mutual Policy excess to the OCIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Westchester argues that Endorsement 9 is not applicable on its plain terms because the Liberty Mutual Policy does not afford higher limits of liability than the Westchester Policy. Its argument ignores that Endorsement 9 also applies where the Liberty Mutual Policy affords broader coverage than the Westchester Policy. Liberty Mutual provides several examples of how its policy provides broader coverage than the Westchester Policy, such that if implicated, Liberty Mutual would need to provide coverage to the Insured subject to limiting conditions (a)-(c) in its Policy; it would not provide coverage for (a) any claim below the amount of any applicable deductible of the wrap-up policy or (b) any claim \"arising out of the \"Insured's work\" for damage to any property under construction or any property forming part of the insured project under any wrap-up liability policy.\" Further, Liberty Mutual would provide coverage for claims for which the limits of liability for the Liberty Mutual Policy were greater (c) only for the difference between the Liberty Mutual Policy and the wrap up policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adams Decl., Ex. 11, Liberty Mutual Policy, at Endorsement No. 9 (ECF p. 35). While Westchester contends that these examples are immaterial and irrelevant because Liberty Mutual has not demonstrated that it covered defense fees or settlement funds excluded by the Westchester Policy, it is the potential reach of the policy, not how it applied in this circumstance, that is germane. Either the Liberty Mutual Policy provides no coverage for loss also subject to a wrap-up policy or it provides coverage subject to the language of Endorsement 9. Regardless, Endorsement 9 is applicable on its plain terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Westchester also argues that Endorsement 9 is not applicable because it only applies to a wrap-up policy to cover \"the Insured's work,\" and Tractel's role for the Arterra Project that gave rise to liability was to supply a product. Westchester contends that Tractel supplied a defective product through its off-site operations, which is not a risk that the OCIP policy was intended to cover. But Westchester expressly disavowed this \"product defect\" defense as a coverage position. Adams Decl., Ex. 16, August 30, 2011 Email (Dkt. No. 39-1) (\"[Westchester] is not distinguishing between the manufacturing issue and the installation issue ... [and will not] attempt to claim this was a product defect and deny liability\"). It cannot now contradict that position to assert that the Underlying Litigation involved a product defect such that Endorsement 9 was not triggered. Moreover, the work that Tractel performed on the Arterra project extended beyond merely providing a product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adams Decl., Ex. 1 at Ex. B.1 at 2 (detailing the scope of Tractel's work for the Arterra Project). Tractel's work and the subsequent claims arise out of its \"onsite\" activities. Westchester's argument that Endorsement 9 was not triggered because Tractel's role for the Arterra Project that gave rise to liability was to supply a product fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Westchester then asserts that even if Endorsement 9 is applicable, it should be disregarded as an unenforceable \"other insurance\" clause because (1) \"other insurance\" provisions are strongly disfavored and (2) Endorsement 9 is an unenforceable excess \"other insurance\" provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Century Surety Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1377274\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/118/1156/#p1159\">\n    118 Cal.

Accordingly, Westchester argues that Endorsement 9, which it describes as both an \"excess only\" and \"escape\" clause, should not be enforceable. An \"excess only\" clause \"require[s] the exhaustion of other insurance; in effect, this insurer does not provide primary coverage but only acts as an excess insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    Residence Mut.

Endorsement 9 is not a broad excess clause; it is rather a narrow exception to primary coverage.

Given that Endorsement 9 is a \"narrow exception\" rather than a broad excess clause and the circumstances under which the Westchester Policy acts as excess insurance were not triggered in the Underlying Litigation, it is clear that the \"other insurance\" provisions in the two policies do not conflict. This case is distinguishable from the cases in which the court found the \"other insurance\" provisions to be conflicting and consequently unenforceable. Accordingly, Endorsement 9 is enforceable under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Contractual terms of insurance coverage are honored whenever possible.

Nothing in the record demonstrates that Tractel would be prejudiced by the language of Endorsement 9 of the Liberty Mutual Policy. Accordingly, I honor its language.

In support, Liberty Mutual offers the OCIP manual for the Arterra Project as well as other extrinsic evidence.

For two insurers that arguably provide coverage for the same event, \"[t]heir respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden.

Westchester takes the opposite view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The OCIP is a wrap-up insurance program, designed to prevent the \"plethora of third-party action litigation, in which the various parties associated with the project seek indemnification or contribution from other parties.\" 4 Steven G.M. Stein, Construction Law \u00b6 13.08 (2009). It seeks to \"reduce the incidence of insurance companies' disputes and litigation and the associated costs because the policies are with a single carrier that is responsible for claims.\" U.S. General Accounting Office, Advantages and Disadvantages of Wrap-Up Insurance for Large Construction Projects 4 (June 1999),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/rc99155.pdf. Given this backdrop, Liberty Mutual argues that the intended function of the OCIP was that the Westchester Policy would cover any claims and liabilities arising from the Arterra Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As mandated by Tractel's subcontract with Bovis Lend Lease, which incorporated the OCIP manual by reference, Tractel enrolled in the OCIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adams Decl., Ex. 2, OCIP Manual, at 9. The cost of the Westchester Policy premium was deducted from the payments Tractel was due under the contract. Accordingly, Tractel is entitled to enjoy the benefits of an OCIP, specifically, the consolidated risk. By becoming the insurance carrier for the OCIP, Westchester received premiums from all contractors and subcontractors on the project in exchange for being the insurer for claims arising out of the Arterra Project. To allow Westchester to enjoy the benefits of being an OCIP insurer without being subject to the inherent risk would not \"accomplish ultimate justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Westchester responds that Liberty Mutual is equally liable for the costs of the Underlying Litigation because: (1) The Liberty Mutual Policy is a primary policy and not a \"true excess\" policy at the same level of risk as the Westchester Policy; (2) Liberty Mutual was on notice of the Underlying Lawsuit from its onset and yet refused to pay any sums toward the defense or indemnity toward its insured's loss; (3) Tractel was contractually required to provide general liability insurance and the Liberty Policy afforded such coverage; (4) the Underlying Litigation stemmed from offsite operations; and (5) Tractel's liability for strict products liability for the activities that were intended to be covered under the Liberty Policy were the predominant basis compelling a settlement in the Underlying Lawsuit. Argument (2) is irrelevant, and the others are answered by the discussion in Section I, above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, the Liberty Mutual Policy generally insured Tractel as a primary policy but responds as excess insurance in instances in which Tractel was also covered by a wrap-up policy. Liberty Mutual, by the language of its policy, was not required to pay toward the defense or indemnity of the loss because there was not excess past the limits of the Westchester Policy. Though Tractel was required to provide general liability insurance for the project, it had to do so in addition to the wrap-up policy, which acts as a way for an owner to consolidate risk and avoid insurance litigation over which policy should cover what loss. Westchester received the benefit of premiums from all the contractors and\n   subcontractors on the Arterra Project. That it had to pay the costs of the primary coverage it provided for Tractel is not unjust; it is what it contracted to do. Westchester expressly disavowed the \"product defect\" defense as a coverage position and cannot now revive it merely for the sake of this litigation for equitable consideration. The accident occurred on-site and did not stem from off-site activities. Westchester is not entitled to equitable contribution from Liberty Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons stated above, I GRANT Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment. Westchester is not entitled to equitable contribution from Liberty Mutual for settlement and defense costs of the Underlying Litigation, and I DENY Westchester's motion. Judgment shall be entered accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
