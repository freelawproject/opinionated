The motions are fully briefed, and the Court, having considered the parties' filings\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and oral arguments, now\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Defendants' motion and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiffs' motions for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Amended Complaint in this case contains five counts. The parties agree that Count I was fully resolved in the Defendants' favor by the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    King v.

In Count II, the Plaintiffs assert that applying the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") that are commonly referred to as the \"employer mandate,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H (\"ACA \u00a7 1513\"), to the School Districts, as political subdivisions of the State of Indiana, violates the Tenth Amendment, either because it is a tax that violates the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity or, if it is not a tax, because it impermissibly interferes with the residual sovereignty of the State of Indiana. The Plaintiffs make the same allegation in Count III with regard to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206056\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"ACA \u00a7 1514\"), which imposes certain reporting and certification requirements on employers. They assert in Count IV that the reporting requirements cannot be severed from the employer mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a previous ruling, the Court dismissed Counts II, III, and IV as to the State, finding that its claims were barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , or claim preclusion. Dkt. No. 77. That ruling, which the Court incorporates herein by reference, was based on the fact that the State was a plaintiff in a case that was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida and was eventually decided by the Supreme Court under the caption\n   <em>\n    National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    567 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively referred to as the \"Florida Litigation\"), and the claims in Counts II, III, and IV in this case were raised or could have been raised by the State in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While the School Districts were not parties in the Florida Litigation, the Defendants argued in their motion to dismiss that the judgment in that case nonetheless barred the School Districts' claims in this case because the School Districts were in privity with the State. The Court deferred consideration of the nonparty preclusion issue to the summary judgment stage and asked the parties to address it at oral argument, which they did. The Court therefore turns to that issue now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There is no question that \" '[u]nder\n   <em>\n    res judicata,\n   </em>\n   a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties\n   <em>\n    or their privies\n   </em>\n   based on the same cause of action.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

Qualifying relationships include, but are not limited to, preceding and succeeding owners of property, bailee and bailor, and assignee and assignor.

Thus, if the School Districts and the State have the type of \"substantive legal relationship\" that would justify the application of nonparty preclusion, the judgment in the Florida Litigation is binding on the School Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With regard to the claims dependent on the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, that issue is easily resolved.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [U]nder current intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine the States can never tax the United States directly but can tax any private parties with whom it does business, even though the financial burden falls on the United States, as long as the tax does not discriminate against the United States or those with whom it deals. A tax is considered to be directly on the Federal Government only when the levy falls on the United States itself,\n   <em>\n    or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities.\n   </em>\n   The rule with respect to state tax immunity is essentially the same, except that at least some nondiscriminatory federal taxes can be collected directly from the States even though a parallel state tax could not be collected directly from the Federal Government.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    South Carolina v.

A governmental entity need not be a \"state\" to be entitled to challenge a federal statute on Tenth Amendment grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Printz v.

The Court need not decide whether claim preclusion is nonetheless appropriate with regard to these alternative claims, however, because the holding in\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   compels this Court to find in favor of the Defendants on those claims on their merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiffs urge the Court not to apply the holding of\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   to their Tenth Amendment claims, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   's \"central premise has been explicitly jettisoned by the Supreme Court, and it no longer accurately states the law.\" Dkt.

Rather, they constitute the type of non-discriminatory regulation applied to the states and private entities alike that\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   held to be constitutionally permissible. Accordingly, the Court finds that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   dictates a finding that if ACA Sections 1513 and 1514 are properly examined as an exercise of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, rather than as a tax, their application to the School Districts is not barred by the Tenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt.

The Court dismissed certain of the State's claims after the parties had filed their summary judgment briefs; however, in making this ruling, the Court has considered all of the summary judgment briefs filed by the State, inasmuch as the School Districts sought and were granted leave to join in the State's motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

The Plaintiffs allege that if they are subject to the employer mandate, they will be required to provide health insurance to employees to whom they otherwise would not offer it and/or be obligated to make shared responsibility payments for some of their employees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    As this quote from\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    makes clear, the Plaintiffs' blanket statements in their briefs such as \"the Federal Government cannot exercise direct taxing authority over the sovereign states,\" Dkt. No. 45 at 29, \"[t]he Court in\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    explicitly held that the Constitution also forbids direct taxation of one level of government by another,\" Dkt.
