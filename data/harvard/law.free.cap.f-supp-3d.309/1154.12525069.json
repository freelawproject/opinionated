Plaintiffs' civil rights suit challenges Defendants' practices under a court referral program (the \"CRP\") that the AMC ordered them to participate in as a requirement of their probation and a suspension of their sentences tied to their misdemeanor convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs have summarized their respective AMC and CRP proceedings (doc. 83 at 7-26 \u00b6\u00b6 1-105) as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MR.

Mr. Loyd received a 60-day jail sentence, which was suspended, and was ordered to enroll in the CRP. Based upon the ECCRP records filed in the\n   <em>\n    Brannon\n   </em>\n   case that relate to Mr. Loyd, on September 22, 2009, the ECCRP issued a return to court form notifying Judge Kenneth Robertson of the AMC that Mr. Loyd had been terminated from the CRP with respect to AMC case number 09-461.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Brannon\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 165-3 at 6 (N.D. Ala. July 3, 2017) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 1, 2011, the ECCRP call logs note that Mr. Loyd was supposed to re-enroll in the CRP, however, no AMC written order to that effect can be found. At the same time, the absence of a written order does not mutually exclude an oral order by the AMC. CAF. Mr. Loyd was scheduled for an evaluation on March 14, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 15, 2011, AMC records show that Mr. Loyd contacted the AMC to request his time for participation in the CRP run concurrent with an Etowah County case he had in front of Judge Rhea. The AMC set the matter for hearing on April 21, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Throughout March, April and May, Mr. Loyd was doing well with the CRP requirements, showing up for drug tests, color-code screening, and paying his fees. There are no notes in the ECCRP call log indicating that he failed to show up or complete a requirement. However, on July 14, 2011, the ECCRP notes that Mr. Loyd \"owes too much to test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Mr. Loyd was sentenced on July 23, 2009, he maintains that the two-year statutory maximum period for probation and/or the CRP should have expired on July 23, 2011. There is no AMC record to indicate that his probation was revoked or that his probationary period was tolled for any reason. At the same time, the record lacks any evidence of a written order from the AMC indicating that Mr. Loyd's obligation to complete the CRP was no longer a condition of his suspended sentence for his AMC misdemeanor case. CAF. Mr. Loyd continued to be subjected to the CRP requirements beyond July 23, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 26, 2011, Mr. Loyd failed to show up for a color-code drug test. On August 1, 2011, Mr. Loyd paid his June and July color-code fees and late fees. On August 3, 2011, Mr. Loyd returned to the ECCRP for a color-code drug test. On August 16, 2011, Mr. Loyd came to the ECCRP for a color-code drug test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 24, 2011, the ECCRP called Mr. Loyd to report in by August 31, 2011, and pay $100 or he would be terminated from the CRP. There is no indication that he was notified in writing of this deadline. At the same time, the absence of a written\n   notice does not mutually exclude an oral contact being made by the ECCRP. CAF. On August 30, 2011, Mr. Loyd returned to the ECCRP for monitoring. He paid monitoring fees, August color-code fees, and late fees. It is noted that he had a \"bad attitude about fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 1, 2011, Mr. Loyd reported to the ECCRP for color-code testing. On September 12, 2011, Mr. Loyd was a no-show for a color-code drug test. On September 21, 2011, Mr. Loyd reported to the ECCRP for color-code testing. At this time, he claims to have started over in the CRP because of his failure to show up for drug testing on September 12, 2011. There is no record of a return to court form for the failure to show up for the drug test. There is no record of a AMC written order for Mr. Loyd's participation in the CRP to start over. At the same time, the absence of written order does not mutually exclude an oral order by the AMC. CAF. Finally, there is no indication that the ECCRP had ever started Mr. Loyd over previously due to his failure to show up for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 11, 2011, Mr. Loyd reported to the ECCRP for color-code screening but was not drug tested because he \"owe[d] too much to test.\" On October 24, 2011, Mr. Loyd reported to the ECCRP for color-code screening, but was not drug tested because he \"owe[d] too much to test.\" On November 2, 2011, Mr. Loyd was a no-show for color-code screening and was terminated from the CRP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 3, 2011, the ECCRP issued a return to court form notifying the AMC that Mr. Loyd failed to report for color-code screening on September 12, 2011, and November 2, 2011. The ECCRP also noted that he owed too much to test on October 11, 2011, and October 24, 2011. The form also requested that a warrant be issued for Mr. Loyd's arrest. The return to court form also referenced Mr. Loyd's no-show on September 12, 2011, but he had already started over on the CRP requirements and had reported to the ECCRP at least three times after that earlier no-show in September.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On November 17, 2011, the AMC issued a Notice of Return to Court and set a court date of January 19, 2012. On January 19, 2012, Mr. Loyd was found in \"Contempt/CRO\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ordered to serve 5 days in jail. The AMC also ordered Mr. Loyd to re-enroll in the CRP upon his release. Mr. Loyd was set to be released from jail on January 24, 2012, but was actually released on January 26, 2012, \"per Captain Higgins.\" Thus, Mr. Loyd actually served seven days in jail rather than five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On February 3, 2012, the ECCRP issued a return to court form notifying the AMC that Mr. Loyd failed to re-enroll in the CRP after his release from Attalla City Jail.

On this same date, Mr. Loyd also was noted as terminated in MIDAS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the AMC ordered Mr. Loyd to re-enroll in the CRP upon his release, there was no deadline by which to do so. At the same time, the absence of a written order does not mutually exclude an oral order indicating a deadline. CAF. There is also no indication that Mr. Loyd was given any written notice that he had a deadline to enroll or that he was about to be terminated from the CRP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 20, 2012, a new case management plan was submitted for Mr. Loyd, but it was designated as for his Gadsden Municipal Court (\"GMC\") case. Mr. Loyd was shown as active in MIDAS for his GMC case as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 26, 2012, Mr. Loyd called the ECCRP. On March 27, 2012, Mr. Loyd reported to the ECCRP, received drug testing pursuant to color-code screening, signed a new case management plan, and scheduled a new evaluation for April 12, 2012. It is also noted that Mr. Loyd owed $110 in back fees. After Mr. Loyd was terminated on February 3, 2012, there was is no written record of any AMC order for him to re-enroll in the CRP. At the same time, the absence of a written order does not mutually exclude an oral order by the AMC. CAF. Also, the record lacks any evidence of a written order from the AMC indicating that Mr. Loyd's obligation to complete the CRP was no longer a condition of his suspended sentence for his AMC misdemeanor case. CAF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 4, 2012, the ECCRP contact log notes that Mr. Loyd did not show up for a color-code drug test.

The form also requested the AMC to set a show cause hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It should be noted that Mr. Loyd was terminated from the CRP on February 3, 2012, and there is no record of any court order for him to re-enroll in the CRP.

Additionally, the record lacks any evidence of a written order from the AMC indicating that Mr. Loyd's obligation to complete the CRP was no longer a condition of his suspended sentence for his AMC misdemeanor case.

There is also no record of the missed evaluation on April 12, 2012, in the ECCRP contact logs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On May 11, 2012, the AMC issued a Notice of Return to Court and set a court date for June 14, 2012. On July 2, 2012, a complaint was filed against Mr. Loyd for Failure To Appear on June 14, 2012. The complaint was signed by the City. On that same date, an Alias Warrant for Arrest for Failure of Defendant To Appear was entered by a magistrate. The warrant and the complaint signed by the City have corresponding warrant numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 29, 2012, the Alias Warrant was stamped as cleared by Circuit Court Judge Millican.

Mr. Loyd maintains that the statutory maximum period for probation, the suspended sentence, and/or the CRP requirements should have expired on July 23, 2011. After this statutory maximum period had expired, Mr. Loyd continued to be subjected to the CRP requirements for more than a year-until October 11, 2012-when he was released from the CRP and his AMC case was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After October 11, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Loyd was scheduled for at least one monitoring session, called by the ECCRP at least twice, color-coded at least eleven times, and returned to court at least three times. Mr. Loyd was also charged drug-testing fees, monitoring fees, and/or late fees at least twice during this time. Mr. Loyd maintains that he was also incarcerated for at least seven days as a direct result of his failure or inability to comply with the CRP requirements\n   after the statutory maximum period had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Loyd had at least one complaint and warrant sworn out against him by the City that directly stemmed from his inability or failure to comply with the CRP requirements beyond the statutory maximum. He was never arrested as a result of that complaint or warrant, but he was required to hire an attorney to represent him in that matter and have the warrant recalled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mr. Loyd maintains that the ECCRP was actively and knowingly pursuing him for fees and failures under the CRP during a period of time that he should have been terminated from it and not been ordered by the AMC to re-start or re-enroll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MR.

On April 22, 2008, the ECCRP re-started Mr. Hunter on his CRP requirements because he had failed to attend the requisite number of AA meetings and, as a result, he received a new case management plan. Mr. Hunter points out that he was testing clean and paying, the only issue was that he lacked AA meetings. At the same time, attendance at AA meetings was one of the requirements of his suspended sentence ordered by the AMC.

This is a burden that they cannot meet, and a close examination of the evidentiary record reveals a total lack of factual support for Plaintiff[s'] allegations against ECCRP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   (Doc. 73 at 22-23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiffs generally respond that the ECCRP Defendants kept them \"on [p]robation and [s]ubjected to the [CRP] [r]equirements [b]eyond the [s]tatutory [m]aximum, [r]esulting in [c]onstitutional [h]arms.\" (Doc. 83 at 28 (emphasis omitted) ). Plaintiffs more specifically maintain as subpoints that the ECCRP Defendants restarted them in the CRP without an order from the AMC and without advising the AMC (doc. 83 at 29-32), imposed graduated sanctions on them without permission from the AMC (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-35), failed to check and report to the AMC their current probationary status (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-37), and failed to send written warnings to them prior to terminating their participation in the CRP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The City has supplemented its summary judgment materials by joining in the those additional arguments raised by the ECCRP Defendants, including the position that Plaintiffs lack evidence to support a triable constitutional claim. (Docs. 75, 76, 86). Plaintiffs base the City's constitutional liability upon the AMC's asserted violation of Alabama's two-year maximum probation period in enforcing the CRO and the City's signing of complaint against Plaintiffs after their respective maximum probation periods had expired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A municipal court may suspend execution of a sentence and/or place a misdemeanant on probation for a period of time, not to exceed two years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-13-13\">\n    Ala.

However, Plaintiffs have not offered\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   federal or Alabama case authority to support this argument of Defendants' alleged constitutional liability pursuant to this overarching proposition. Instead, this section of Plaintiffs' brief (doc. 83) points to provisions of the AMTA and the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts Court Referral Officer Field Manual (the \"CROFM\") as the legal grounds for establishing constitutional liability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-14-13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 28 (citing the AMTA and the CROFM as recognizing that \"[t]he courts are to supervise ECCRP and approve or give permission for ECCRP's actions\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Concerning the ECCRP Defendants' purported constitutional liability, Plaintiffs cite to various parts of the CROFM in an effort to show that Defendants failed to comply with it and likewise failed to communicate adequately with the AMC about Plaintiffs' status under the CRP. One form that Plaintiffs identify is the Order To Complete (\"OTC\"). (Doc. 83 at 31); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-4 at 36, 97, 138-140).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs point out that the record does not reflect that the ECCRP Defendants provided the AMC with OTC forms. (Doc. 83 at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Plaintiffs also complain that the ECCRP Defendants did not provide the AMC with any case management plan(s) for them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). Plaintiffs further fault the ECCRP Defendants for giving them graduated sanctions (due to their relapses) without the permission of the AMC. (Doc. 83 at 33-35); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-4 at 50 (\"If a relapse does occur, it is [CRP] policy that graduated sanctions be employed with the court's permission.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally maintain that the ECCRP Defendants violated their CROFM because they did not provide them with written notices of non-compliance before issuing a return to court form. (Doc. 83 at 37-38); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-4 at 85 (\"Defendants should receive\n   <em>\n    at least two written notices or warnings\n   </em>\n   advising of possible termination for failure to comply with the court's order before they are returned to court.\" (emphasis added) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the ECCRP failed to check on their \"current probationary status\" (doc. 83 at 36); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-4 at 47 (same) ). Then citing to the AMTA's requirement that court referral officers report \"appropriate evaluative measures to the court,\" Plaintiffs suggest that the ECCRP had a duty to keep track of Plaintiffs' statutory maximum date, but \"never made an attempt to [do so.]\" (Doc. 83 at 36). Plaintiffs further urge that the ECCRP Defendants \"had no excuse for not knowing when the court ordered probation period ended.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37). However, Plaintiffs fail to point to any provision of the CROFM which expressly requires the ECCRP Defendants to calculate the maximum probation period and/or verify the maximum time remaining on a criminal defendant's probation\n   <em>\n    term\n   </em>\n   . Further, the ECCRP Defendants' obligation to confirm the \"status designation (juvenile, youthful offender, other)\" (doc. 69-4 at 46) of a probationer, is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the equivalent of a duty to track that person's maximum probation period. Nor does the CROFM language requiring the ECCRP Defendants to check the status of a probationer straightforwardly signify such a duty. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-14-13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 18 \u00a7 II.E (\"Reviews sentence and probation requirements with a defendant and monitors participants for compliance, providing\n   follow-up support as necessary.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-14-13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 46-47 \u00a7 5.a-c (\"Check legal status [including]...[c]urrent probationary status[.]\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In fact, at the end of the \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MONITORING PROCEDURE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" section, the CROFM states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   Once the defendant has successfully completed all monitoring sessions, a certificate of completion should be issued, and the court should be formally notified of completion.

Thus, the CROFM makes no reference to any requirement that completion of the CRP must occur\n   <em>\n    within a probationer's maximum probation period\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Likewise, when Ms. Zaner was asked during her deposition if she had \"any responsibility to monitor the length of time that someone is-one of your clients, municipal court defendants, is involved in probation?\" (doc. 70-1 at 20 at 79),\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   she responded, \"I don't know how I could properly monitor that.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-14-13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Zaner also stated, \"I'm assuming it's the same for everyone\n   <em>\n    unless you take into account the tolling period\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, neither the CROFM nor Ms. Zaner's testimony establishes that the ECCRP Defendants disregarded an express duty to track a probationer's maximum probation period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Further, the Court has been unable to locate where the AMTA imposes such an express obligation on court referral officers. Section 12-23-7 of the AMTA mentions probation, but does not mandate that court referral officers keep track of a defendant's maximum probation term. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that the ECCRP Defendants had a duty to track Plaintiffs' maximum probation periods under Alabama law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Moreover, it is far from clear that a misdemeanant's compliance with the AMTA is subject to a two-year limitation. In the fact section of their brief, Plaintiffs cite to ALA. R. CRIM. P. 26.3(a) in an effort to dispute \"that the state of Alabama has never taken a position that the maximum period of time that a person can be enrolled in a court referral program is limited to two years for any reason.\" (Doc. 83 at 6 \u00b6 188). This Alabama criminal rule of procedure governs presentence reports and makes no mention of calculating probation terms. Instead, the non-felony subpart states only that \"[t]he court may require a presentence report in all cases in which it has either discretion over the penalty to be imposed or authority to suspend execution of the sentence.\" ALA. R. CRIM. P. 26.3(a)(1). Plaintiffs make no effort to explain how this non-substantive rule establishes the unlawfulness of Defendants' conduct under state (or federal) law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Plaintiffs also refer to 12-14-13(a), (g) of the AMCPS as establishing a two-year maximum period of time in which a misdemeanant can be subject to the AMTA. As set out above, the AMCPS (like the APS) has a two-year limitation. However, the AMTA has no such temporal restriction. Thus, the still unanswered question under Alabama law is whether the AMTA should be construed to contain an implicit cutoff of two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   However, even when accepting that the AMTA (or another statute) makes the ECCRP Defendants responsible for ensuring compliance with the maximum probation term or that the ECCRP Defendants violated provisions of the CROFM with respect to Plaintiffs' misdemeanor cases, Plaintiffs still have not demonstrated why that matters from a federal (or state) constitutional standpoint. Likewise, accepting that the AMC failed to properly track Plaintiffs' maximum probation periods and improperly extended their participation in the CRP beyond the two-year cutoff, Plaintiffs still have not demonstrated why a reasonable jury could conclude that the City violated Plaintiffs' federal or state constitutional rights because of that evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Concerning Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claims more specifically, \"[t]o obtain relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , [Plaintiffs] must show (1) that [Defendants] deprived [them] of a right\n   <em>\n    secured under the Constitution or federal law\n   </em>\n   and (2) that the deprivation occurred under color of state law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

Similarly, if Plaintiffs are correct that the AMC violated a duty to track Plaintiffs' probation periods and/or to limit Plaintiffs' time subject to the CRP to two years from the original sentence date, the Court nevertheless finds that Plaintiffs' attempt to show a triable constitutional claims against the City (for the AMC's omission) fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   More specifically, in the absence of referencing a single federal or state constitutional case factually comparable to theirs in which a constitutional right was recognized, or at least listing what elements support any of their purported constitutional claims along with identifying any corresponding proof that a reasonable jury could consider, Plaintiffs' constitutional claims are all fatally underdeveloped.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flanigan's Enters., Inc. v.

Despite the Court's early instruction to focus on fundamentals before this action was severed from\n   <em>\n    Brannon\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' oppositions still lack legal clarity as to why their facts present a\n   <em>\n    federal (or state) constitutional case against the ECCRP Defendants or the City\n   </em>\n   . In fact, reading Plaintiffs' briefs reminds this Court of the first two lines of Buffalo Springfield's \"For What It's Worth\": \"There's something happening here[.] But what it is ain't exactly clear[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   When a defendant argues that a claim is factually and/or legally insufficient on summary judgment, it is the plaintiff's job, as the non-movant, to make it clear to the Court why a\n   <em>\n    triable\n   </em>\n   claim does, in fact, exist. Scrutiny through a Rule 56 lens typically demands much more from a plaintiff than a showing of Rule 12(b)(6) plausibility; an unclearly developed claim is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a triable one. Here, Plaintiffs' nebulous efforts do not satisfy their Rule 56 burden to show how their facts, if proven to a jury, constitute a cognizable constitutional claim under either federal or state law against any Defendant. Accordingly, summary judgment is due to be granted as Counts One, Three, Four, Six, Seven, Nine, Ten, and Twelve in light of Plaintiffs' failure to carry their burden as the non-movants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In determining whether the nature of the parolee's interest was within the Fourteenth Amendment protection of liberty or property, the court stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   The parolee has been released from prison based on an evaluation that he shows reasonable promise of being able to return to society and function as a responsible, self-reliant person. Subject to the conditions of his parole, he can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different\n   from that of confinement in a prison. He may have been on parole for a number of years and may be living a relatively normal life at the time he is faced with revocation. The parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions. In many cases, the parolee faces lengthy incarceration if his parole is revoked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   We see, therefore, that the liberty of a parolee, although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a \"grievous loss\" on the parolee and often on others.

As set out above, Plaintiffs have not established how any of the other alleged wrongful conduct engaged in by the ECCRP Defendants-including imposing graduated sanctions without the AMC's permission and failing to provide written warnings of impending CRP termination-rises to the level of a federal constitutional concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, there is no need to reach the causation element for those purported offenses against the ECCRP Defendants.

Here, no reasonable jury could conclude that Ms. Zaner caused Plaintiffs a federal constitutional deprivation tied to their maximum probation period, much less that Ms. Zaner or the ECCRP was the moving force behind such deprivation(s). Unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence that the ECCRP Defendants affirmatively \"extended...probation sentences for earlier charges by 24 months when the Municipal Court actually issued probation orders in different case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 626 at 62). There also are no written orders from the AMC discharging Plaintiffs from probation or indicating that they were not required to complete the CRP. Consequently, there is no evidence that the ECCRP Defendants deviated from the AMC's orders by requiring Plaintiffs to participate in the CRP after the AMC had discharged them from probation, discharged them from the CRP, and/or closed their misdemeanor cases. Yet, the burden of proof is on Plaintiffs to prove each element of their claims. (\n   <em>\n    Cf. Ray\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 626 at 62-63 (\"Nothing in the Rule 56 record indicates that JCS employees informed [the plaintiffs] of these modifications to their 2009 and 2011 probation sentences. Nor does the record reflect that the Municipal Court agreed to these modifications.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Dissimilar from\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , the record here also lacks documentary evidence that the ECCRP Defendants \"invariably recalculated probation following purported reinstatements by extending the sentence [of] 24 months from the reinstatement date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 626 at 63). The record further lacks evidence that the AMC ever relied upon the ECCRP Defendants to provide it with probation period calculations, much less that the ECCRP Defendants had policies governing how to make those determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Cf. Ray\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 626 at 64 (\"These JCS policies instructed employees to extend the length of probation cases until all amounts owed were paid, prevented probation terms from running consecutively, and\n   <em>\n    granted considerable discretion to JCS employees to determine the amount of time left on a reinstated probation case\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that their AMC files do not contain written orders returning them to the CRP (after termination for non-compliance). Ms. Zaner has testified that the AMC would indicate this orally in open court. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 70-2 at 12 at 328 (\"When they reappear in court, they would have to restart [the CRP], the order by the judge to restart. I'm not allowed to accept them back into the program unless the judge orders them back into the program....Q. And you're going by based on what you hear in the courtroom as compared to what is actually written down on the order sheet? A. Correct.\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have not refuted Ms. Zaner's testimony\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor otherwise shown that it was somehow unlawful-under either federal or Alabama law-for the ECCRP Defendants to rely upon an oral order from the AMC about a probationer's need to continue treatment pursuant to the CRP. While Plaintiffs certainly have shown a lack of detail with the ECCRP Defendants' paperwork, such imperfection (without more) falls short of establishing a causal connection to any due process injury or other purported constitutional harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Instead, the only conceivable entity that caused Plaintiffs to be subject to the CRP beyond the statutory maximum period (if in fact they both were so subject after factoring in the APS/AMCPS's tolling framework) without prior notice or an opportunity to be heard was\n   <em>\n    non-party AMC\n   </em>\n   . Further, to the extent that Plaintiffs believed that the AMC was unlawfully continuing its jurisdiction over them by returning them to the CRP beyond their applicable statutory maximum period, then redress was available through a motion asking the AMC to enter an order of discharge or to review the amount of time remaining under the maximum probation term. Importantly, both the APS and the AMCPS provide that the only entity with the power to discharge a person from probation is the court with jurisdiction over that probationer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015-22-54\">\n    Ala.

(\n   <em>\n    Brannon\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 172 at 6 (N.D. Ala. July 24, 2017) ). Regardless, Plaintiffs have failed to present proof from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the\n   <em>\n    ECCRP Defendants caused or were the moving force behind\n   </em>\n   extending Plaintiffs' probationary term (through continuation of the CRP) beyond the state statutory maximum without prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. Thus, summary judgment is alternatively due to be granted due to the absence of a triable issue of \u00a7 1983 causation against the ECCRP Defendants with respect to any Fourteenth Amendment due process claim (or any other federal claim) tied to the two-year maximum probation period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The City\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Citing to\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Further,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   does not provide that an exception to the judicial function exists if the court or judge misapplies the law. For this case, that means it is of no legal consequence that the AMC\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have improperly continued Plaintiffs on the CRP in conflict with the AMTA and the AMCPS-the City cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 based upon the AMC's judicial conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs attempt to characterize their continuation with the CRP as an administrative failure of the AMC. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 80 at 42 (\"Without having conversations, reviewing the case plan recommendations, being aware of [the CRP] participants['] progression, and approving or denying requests for graduated sanctions, it would be impossible for the court to properly carry out its supervision of ECCRP.\") );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 (\"This is enough to create evidence of a policy or custom on behalf of the municipal court of not reviewing case management plans, not reviewing ECCRP recommendations for treatment,\n   and not reviewing the [CRP] participants['] progress, although all of these activities are essential for the court to properly carry out its administrative function in supervising ECCRP.\"). The problem with this logic is the lack of a casual connection between increasing the AMC's supervision over the ECCRP Defendants and any conceivable impact on Plaintiffs' one potentially viable federal claim-a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation based upon exceeding the maximum probation period. More specifically, because the ECCRP Defendants were not tracking any tolling aspects of a maximum probation term, increased supervision of them by the AMC would not have prevented that particular potential constitutional harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims against the City also fail due to the absence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence that the City exercises control over or establishes policies for the AMC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turquitt v.

In terms of the threshold inquiry, Plaintiffs offer no on-point cases to show that Ms. Zaner was acting outside the scope of her discretionary authority as a court referral officer and/or the head of the ECCRP concerning their constitutional claims. (Doc. 83 at 53-55). While Plaintiffs point out that qualified immunity does not protect a defendant from liability for \"ministerial\" acts or omissions (doc. 83 at 52), the Court disagrees with them that the CROFM transforms Ms. Zaner's job into one in which she exercises\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   discretion. Importantly, Plaintiffs do not set out any provisions of the CROFM that even pertain to calculating a probation term. Plaintiffs also do not show that Ms. Zaner was ever \"act[ing] entirely on [her] own behalf\" or \"acting\n   <em>\n    wholly\n   </em>\n   outside the scope of [her] discretionary authority[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Harbert Int'l, Inc. v. James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11685520\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1271/#p1281\">\n    157 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281 (11th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Having found that Plaintiffs' constitutional claims do intersect with Ms. Zaner's exercise of discretionary authority, qualified immunity applies because Plaintiffs have failed to establish a triable constitutional claim. In the absence of a viable constitutional claim, Ms. Zaner cannot be personally liable to Plaintiffs under \u00a7 1983 for her own conduct or in a supervisory capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Alternatively, even when assuming that Plaintiffs have adduced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find a viable Fourteenth Amendment due process (or other federal constitutional) violation, Plaintiffs have not pointed to (and the Court has not independently found) any clearly established law that would have put\n   Ms. Zaner on notice of her unconstitutional conduct. More specifically, the law was not clearly established that Ms. Zaner violated Plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to track Plaintiffs' maximum probation periods under the APS and/or the AMCPS. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, neither the AMTA-the statute that governs court referral officers like Ms. Zaner-nor the CROFM expressly renders her responsible for keeping track of maximum probation periods. Additionally, it is an open question under Alabama law whether completion of the CRP is even subject to the two-year maximum probation period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Zaner violated any other federal constitutional rights, they have offered no clearly-established controlling case authority for that supposed violation. Thus, qualified immunity provides an alternative basis for granting summary judgment to Ms. Zaner on Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The ECCRP Defendants have not carried their burden to show that they are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The ECCRP Defendants also assert that they are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. (Doc. 73 at 31-38). While the Court disagrees with Defendants that such a defense is available to the ECCRP as an entity, conceivably Ms. Zaner might have a right to rely upon that immunity. However, unlike the example of\n   <em>\n    Filarsky\n   </em>\n   in the context of Ms. Zaner's qualified immunity defense, Defendants have provided no examples of cases in which a private individual (as opposed to a public non-judicial official) was protected by such a defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court rejects this part of the ECCRP Defendants' Motion as underdeveloped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The Court does not reach the merits of the other grounds relied upon by Defendants to support a dismissal of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The remaining grounds that Defendants rely upon in support of dismissing Plaintiffs' federal claims include statute of limitations (doc. 72 at 32-33); (doc. 73 at 38-39);\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   (doc. 73 at 39-40), and\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   's favorable-termination rule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-43). In light of the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that reaching these remaining issues pertaining to Plaintiffs' federal claims is unnecessary. This is particularly so as Defendants' statute-of-limitations defense is a partial one that seeks only to dismiss alleged misconduct that occurred before July 1, 2011 (doc. 72 at 33); (doc. 73 at 38-39), and because the Court has previously explained why\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   do not bar Plaintiffs' federal claims.

Accordingly, those portions of the ECCRP Defendants' Motion and the City's Motion challenging Plaintiffs' federal claims are due to be termed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Similarly, there is an absence of proof that any employee under the control or direction of the City engaged in wrongful conduct with respect to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Additionally, Ms. Zaner cannot be liable for negligent training or supervision because the ECCRP is the employer and not her.

(Doc. 83 at 71-73); (Doc. 80 at 53-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Defendants rely upon two different jurisdictional reasons in support of dismissing Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief-the absence of standing and the doctrine of mootness. More specifically, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs are without standing to seek injunctive relief because they are no longer subject to the requirements of the CRP. (Doc. 72 at 69-70); (Doc. 73 at 49). Alternatively, Defendants contend that the relief Plaintiffs seeks has been rendered moot in light of the AMC Standing Order governing probation.

Consequently, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have abandoned pursuit of their injunctive claim by not addressing Defendants' arguments about the absence of standing.
