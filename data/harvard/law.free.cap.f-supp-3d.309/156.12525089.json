DANIELS, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Joan Pirundini brings this shareholder action under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"ICA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35, on behalf and for the benefit of the JP Morgan U.S. Large Cap Core Plus Fund (the \"Fund\"), against Defendant J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. (\"JPMIM\"), the Fund's investment adviser. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 12.) Plaintiff asserts that JPMIM owed a fiduciary duty to the Fund under Section 36(b) and that it breached that duty by charging the Fund excessively high fees in exchange for investment advisory services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) Plaintiff seeks a declaration that JPMIM breached its fiduciary duty under Section 36(b), as well as damages, including restitution of the excessive fees, lost profits, and interest. Plaintiff also seeks rescission of the investment advisory agreement governing JPMIM's provision of services to the Fund. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 14; Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Mem.\"), ECF No. 15, at 1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Fund\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Fund is one of a series of mutual funds housed within the JPMorgan Trust I (the \"JPM Trust\"), a management investment company established by Defendant JPMIM and non-party JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (\"JPMC\") in 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 37-38.) Like all other mutual funds housed within the JPM Trust, the Fund has no employees of its own. Rather, its operations are carried out exclusively by external service providers who provide services to each of the JPM Trust's mutual funds, including the Fund, pursuant to separate contracts with the JPM Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   JPMIM is one such service provider. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Under the terms of an Investment Advisory Agreement (\"IAA\") executed by and between JPMIM and the JPM Trust in August 2006, JPMIM provides the Fund with investment advisory services as described below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) In addition to its obligations under the IAA, JPMIM provides administrative services to the Fund pursuant to a separate agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) As the Fund's administrator, JPMIM maintains the necessary office space for the Fund's operations and prepares various reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) JPMIM is compensated\n   separately for the investment advisory and administrative services it provides pursuant to those separate contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The additional services the Fund requires to function, such as regulatory and shareholder-facing services, are provided by other external service companies, each of which are also separately compensated pursuant to their respective agreements with the JPM Trust. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-45, 50-55.) For example, J.P. Morgan Distribution Services, Inc. (\"JPMDS\"), which serves as the distributor and shareholder servicing agent for each fund housed within the JPM Trust, has the authority to solicit and accept orders to purchase the Fund's shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.) JPMDS also responds to shareholder inquiries, provides shareholders with information, and assists shareholders with other Fund-related services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.) JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMC Bank\"), which serves as custodian and fund accounting agent for each of the mutual funds housed within the JPM Trust, provides the Fund with an array of custodial and accounting services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Fund also has a board of trustees (the \"Board\") which oversees the Fund's activities, monitors its external service providers, and is charged with annually reviewing and approving the service agreements, including the fees charged to the Fund by such providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) The Board is comprised of twelve individuals, each of whom also serves as a trustee for 153 other mutual funds established by JPMIM and JPMC and housed within the JPM Trust and similar entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. JPMIM's Investment Advisory Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As the Fund's investment adviser, JPMIM provides a number of services related to the selection and management of the Fund's investment portfolio. For instance, JPMIM is responsible for researching potential investments for the Fund and deciding which securities to purchase or sell, at which times, and in what amounts. As the Fund's investment adviser, JPMIM also provides minor administrative and compliance-related services, as well as periodic reports to the Fund's shareholders and the Board concerning JPMIM's provision of portfolio selection services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the Fund's November 1, 2016 prospectus, the Fund's investment objective is \"to provide a high total return from a portfolio of selected equity securities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) JPMIM seeks to accomplish that objective by pursuing a set of \"principal investment strategies\" which includes taking both long and short positions in domestic equity securities and derivatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the overall investment strategy employed by JPMIM for the Fund is \"quite common,\" the use of short positions as well as long ones is \"less common.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From 2005 through 2015, the Fund's investments were overseen by only two JPMIM portfolio managers. During that\n   time period, the Fund's net assets increased significantly from under $1 billion to more than $10 billion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66, 126(a);\n   <em>\n    see also id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. E, ECF No. 1-6.) A third portfolio manager was added in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) The Fund's three portfolio managers are all managing directors of JPMIM and each is responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of a portion of the Fund's investments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Fund's portfolio managers rely on a team of twenty-seven research analysts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) The same analysts provide research to those portfolio managers responsible for managing the investment portfolios of other funds to which JPMIM provides investment advisory services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to those services it provides to the Fund, JPMIM also provides investment advisory services to several other mutual funds and portfolios, such as the JPMorgan U.S. Equity Fund (the \"JPM Equity Fund\") and the PSF Select Fund (the \"PSF Fund\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85(a).) The JPM Equity Fund is a mutual fund housed within the JPM Trust and with whom the Fund shares many of the same external service providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89(a).) The PSF Fund is a registered investment company that, like the JPM Trust, houses within it multiple funds and portfolios. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) JPMIM was retained by the PSF Fund's investment adviser to provide sub-advisory services to the PSF Fund's Long/Short Large-Cap Portfolio (the \"PSF Sub-Advised Fund\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. JPMIM's Fee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The IAA entitles JPMIM to a fee for the investment advisory services it provides the Fund. The fee, which is represented by an annualized rate, is computed and accrued on a daily basis, but paid monthly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) At all relevant times, the fee rate charged by JPMIM was .80% of the Fund's average daily net assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly, JPMIM's fee rate does not include any \"breakpoints,\" or points at which lower fees are assessed once the Fund's net assets exceed certain stated values. The fee rate is instead applied uniformly against all of the Fund's net assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   JPMIM has, however, entered into fee waiver agreements with the JPM Trust with respect to certain of its mutual funds, including the Fund. Pursuant to these agreements, JPMIM is required to waive fees it is otherwise owed when pre-specified caps are exceeded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.) On occasion, the fee waiver agreement reduces the fees owed to JPMIM by considerable amounts. During the last half of 2016, for example, the Fund was obligated to pay JPMIM $39.74 million in investment advisory fees. Of that sum, JPMIM waived $4.54 million, or about 11.5% of the total amount it was owed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Notwithstanding, Plaintiff claims that the fees JMPIM charges the Fund for investment advisory services are excessive and in breach of the fiduciary duty it owes the Fund under Section 36(b) of the ICA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 246-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Comparative Fee Structures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Gartenberg\n   </em>\n   factor the complaint addresses is comparative fee structures. Plaintiff compares the fee rates JPMIM charges the Fund to two different metrics: (1) the fee rates paid by JPMIM's other mutual fund clients for whom it provides substantially similar investment advisory services as those that it provides the Fund; and (2) the fee rates paid by mutual funds not advised by JPMIM but whose \"size, character[,] and investment strategy are comparable to the Fund['s].\" (Compl. \u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to the first category, Plaintiff points to the fees JPMIM charges the Fund for providing \"substantially similar and in large part identical\" investment advisory services as those it provides to the JPM Equity Fund and the PSF Sub-Advised Fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that the Fund, the JPM Equity Fund, and the PSF Sub-Advised Fund all have nearly identical investment objectives, strategies, and portfolios and are managed by the same portfolio managers, who in turn rely on the same team of research analysts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89(c)-(f), 97(c)-(f).) The sole discernible difference among them is that while the Fund and the PSF Sub-Advised Fund pursue investment strategies that include taking both long and short investment positions, the JPM Equity Fund takes only long ones. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89(d), 97(d).) Notwithstanding\n   these similarities, JPMIM charges the Fund fee rates that are higher than those it charges the others; whereas JPMIM charges the Fund a fee rate of .80%, the PSF Sub-Advised Fund and the JPM Equity Fund are charged fee rates of .60% and .40%, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the second category of comparative fee structures, Plaintiff cites data obtained from Bloomberg Finance L.P. (\"Bloomberg\"), which tracks information on more than 7,000 domestic mutual funds (the \"Bloomberg Funds\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Bloomberg categorizes the Fund as one of 291 \"U.S. equity large-cap blend funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-07.) Based on available data about the Bloomberg Funds, Plaintiff alleges that the average fee rate for investment advisory services paid by those funds is .54%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When the group of Bloomberg Funds is narrowed to those mutual funds that have net assets in excess of $1 billion, which Plaintiff claims represents a \"more apt comparison\" to the Fund, the average investment advisory fee rate drops to .36%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that the Fund pays the\n   <em>\n    highest\n   </em>\n   rate for advisory fees among its peers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

For example, Defendant argues that because the Fund pursues \"a more complicated investment strategy\" than the JPM Equity Fund by taking short investment positions as well as long ones, JPMIM provides the two funds with different investment advisory services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)

Here, Plaintiff alleges that as the Fund's net assets increased in size, JPMIM reduced its advisory fee rate in 2015 from 1.00% to .80% of the Fund's average daily net assets and that pursuant to its fee waiver agreements with the JPM Trust, it has waived investment advisory fees owed by the Fund, in some cases by more than twenty percent.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 155.) The complaint recognizes that because JPMIM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMC, it does not publicly disclose its financial results or its profit margins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nonetheless, and armed with no evidence of the costs JPMIM incurs to provide the Fund with investment advisory services, Plaintiff declares that JPMIM's profitability from advising the Fund \"is so unusually high as to be excessive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) Plaintiff purports to base this conclusion on three \"particularized facts\": (i) JPMIM charges the Fund a higher fee than it charges the JPM Equity Fund; (ii) the Fund's sharp asset growth has generated tremendous economies of scale, all of which have been monopolized by JPMIM; and (iii) the Fund's investment advisory fee rates are higher than all other comparable mutual funds pursuing similar investment strategies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157-60.) In other words, Plaintiff claims the Fund must be profitable for JPMIM because the fees JPMIM charges the Fund are high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   These allegations, recycled from other portions of the complaint, are plainly insufficient to support liability under Section 36(b) for the reasons explained above. Moreover, none of these \"facts\" identified by Plaintiff plausibly suggest that the Fund has been particularly profitable for JPMIM. As such, this factor also weighs in favor of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amron,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731118\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/338/#p340\">\n    464 F.3d at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no showing as to profitability \"without some allegation of the corresponding costs incurred in operating the funds\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paskowitz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268481\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/498/#p502\">\n    232 F.Supp.3d at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing Section 36(b) claim, in part, because the complaint made \"[n]o allegation ... about defendants' actual costs\");\n   <em>\n    Hoffman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5886160\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/591/522/#p539\">\n    591 F.Supp.2d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting as \"unsatisfactory\" plaintiff's allegation that the defendant received a \"windfall\" absent \"sufficient information for the [c]ourt to determine the profitability of [d]efendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

(Compl. \u00b6 161.) First, as the \"direct result\" of serving as the Fund's investment adviser, JPMIM and its affiliates, including JPMDS and JPMC Bank, were engaged to provide numerous other services to the Fund pursuant to separate service contracts and for substantial pay. Second, as a result of the services it provides the Fund, JPMIM is able to provide the PSF Fund with a \"clone\" of the Fund-the PSF Sub-Advised Fund-at almost no extra cost and with significant profits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the profits JPMIM realizes from the services it provides the PSF Sub-Advised Fund, Plaintiff's allegations can support an inference, albeit a weak one, that JPMIM enjoys a fall-out benefit to the exclusion of the Fund and its investors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346399\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/126/\">\n    175 F.Supp.3d at 144-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (crediting allegation that investment adviser \"was able to market the investment strategies and services originally generated for the Fund to other institutional clients at much lower costs and more competitive rates,\" but conceding that such a benefit may not be \"relevant to the excessiveness of the Advisory Fees\") (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's allegation as to the profits accruing to JPMIM and its affiliates for providing the Fund with other services, however, cannot properly be classified as fall-out benefits; JPMIM and its affiliates could just as likely have been so engaged regardless of whether JPMIM provided investment advisory services to the Fund. In fact, that JPMIM and its affiliates were engaged to provide the Fund with other services is far more likely attributable to the Fund having been established in part by JPMIM and it being housed within the JPM Trust than to JPMIM having been engaged to provide it with investment advisory services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For these reasons, this factor is at best neutral, weighing in neither party's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 170.) As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   courts considering claims brought under Section 36(b) \"must take into account both procedure and substance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n    559 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(2) ). \"Where a board's process for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser compensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford commensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining process.... even if a court might weigh the factors differently.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n    559 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

Instead, Plaintiff's allegations as to this factor rely entirely on a summary report of the Board's approval process set forth in the Fund's public SEC filings. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 183-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The summary report indicates that as part of its annual review of the IAA and JPMIM's fee rates in August 2016, the Board engaged an independent management consultant to report on the performance of certain of the \"J.P.

In addition, the summary report notes that the Board received and evaluated extensive materials from JPMIM, including performance and expense information compiled by Broadridge and Lipper, Inc., two independent providers of investment company data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the summary report, the Board reviewed the IAA with JPMIM representatives, in-house counsel to the JPM Trust, and outside legal counsel, the last of whom discussed the proposed agreement with the Board outside the presence of JPMIM representatives and provided the Board with a memorandum outlining the relevant legal standards for considering the IAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.) The Board held two in-person meetings, one in June and another in August of 2016, to review and consider the various data and reports before ultimately voting to approve the IAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-75.) According to the summary report, the Board found that JPMIM's compensation was \"fair and reasonable and that the continuance of the [IAA] was in the best interests of [the Fund] and its shareholders.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff alleges, without any factual support, that this description does not accurately depict the Board's evaluation of the IAA, nor does it reflect the Board's efforts \"to engage in a good-faith process designed to guard against taking excessive investment advisory fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 186.) Also without any factual support, Plaintiff alleges that the Board's approval was based on \"inaccurate and/or incomplete information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The remainder of Plaintiff's allegations do not address the Board's\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   for approving JPMIM's fee rates but instead focus on the\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   of the Board's conclusions.

It is well-settled that \"charging a fee that is above the industry average does not violate Section 36(b).\"\n    <em>\n     Paskowitz,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268481\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/498/#p502\">\n     232 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    504 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Amron,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731118\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/338/#p340\">\n     464 F.3d at 345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (rejecting as \"inadequate\" allegation that the challenged fee rate was above the \"industry mean\");\n    <em>\n     Gartenberg,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1487355\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/923/\">\n     694 F.2d at 929\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Reliance on prevailing industry advisory fees will not satisfy \u00a7 36(b).\"). That a particular fee rate is above the industry average says nothing about where the challenged rate lies on the distribution of fee rates charged and thus cannot, by itself, establish that a particular fee is beyond \"the outer bounds of arm's length bargaining[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Jones v.

Similarly unavailing is Plaintiff's allegation that, among its \"peers,\" the Fund pays the highest investment advisory fee rate. True as that may be, it is not the test for determining liability under Section 36(b). Moreover, a review of the fee rates paid by the Fund's peers indicates that the rate JPMIM charges the Fund is just one basis point-or one one-hundredth of one percent-above the next highest one, and just five basis points above the next two. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl., Ex. C-2.) These allegations do not suffice to show that the fee rates JPMIM charges the Fund are so outside the range of what could be negotiated at arm's length as to be actionable under Section 36(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In fact, however, as Plaintiff notes, a third individual was added in 2016 to manage the Fund's portfolio.
