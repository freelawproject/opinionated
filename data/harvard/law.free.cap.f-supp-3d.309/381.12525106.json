INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff Jennie Nicassio alleges that Defendants Viacom International, Inc. (\"Viacom\") and Penguin Random House LLC (\"Penguin\") are liable to\n   her for copyright infringement, unfair competition, tortious interference with prospective advantage, and tortious destruction of intellectual property. (Docket No. 1). Pending before the Court is Defendants' joint motion to dismiss the complaint, with prejudice, for failure to state a claim. (Docket No. 18). After careful consideration of the parties' briefs and oral arguments, and for the following the reasons, the Court will GRANT the motion [18] and dismiss the complaint, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nicassio is an author of illustrated children's books, including\n   <em>\n    Rocky: The Rockefeller Christmas Tree\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   \"), which is the story of a young Christmas tree that dreams of becoming the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree in New York City. (Docket No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10). In 2007, Nicassio copyrighted\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   when it was still unpublished. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). After becoming available for purchase on Amazon in July 2009,\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   quickly rose to the highest selling children's book in the site's holiday category. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17). In November 2009, Nicassio published\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   with On-Demand Publishing LLC, d.b.a. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; and, she switched to Indigo Sea Press in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15). In all, Nicassio has released three editions of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   , with the most current version having been released in May 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because Nicassio was interested in adapting\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   into an animated film or show, she sent copies of the book to numerous entertainment agencies and companies for evaluation between 2011 and 2016, including Liza Royce Agency LLC, Frederator Networks, Inc., David Higham Associates, and Defendant Viacom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). In this process, Nicassio claims that Viacom gained access to and knowledge of her copyrighted material and content in\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2016, Nicassio submitted\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   to the Top of The Rock gift store to be approved and stocked, and she separately executed an agreement with Lightning Source, Inc., a print on demand company, for the manufacture and distribution of paper copies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, 23). A month later, Penguin published\n   <em>\n    Albert: The Little Tree With Big Dreams\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   \"), an illustrated children's book. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 24-25). Nicassio claims that\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   mirrors the story of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   , as it too \"tells the tale of a young Christmas tree that wishes to one-day stand in a big city\" and otherwise \"contains substantial material copied from\"\n   <em>\n    Rocky.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following Penguin's publication of\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   in September 2016, sales of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). By the end of 2016,\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   had fallen from the number one selling holiday children's book on Amazon to number ten. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). During this time period, Nicassio received interest from Hallmark and \"hoped to negotiate the sale of the exclusive rights to\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   to Hallmark for the 2017 holiday season.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Meanwhile, in November 2016, Defendant Viacom began advertising a film adaptation of Penguin's\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). According to the complaint, Viacom's animation of\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   , like Penguin's book, \"contains substantial material probative of copying of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nicassio first learned of Viacom's animation of\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   on December 5, 2016 when she saw a television advertisement for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). She discovered that Penguin published\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   as a children's book four days later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Viacom's animation of\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   aired on Nickelodeon each day from December 9, 2016 to January 2, 2017, which the complaint avers not only generated significant advertisement revenue for Viacom through its on-air sponsorships but also caused\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   to surpass\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   and become one of the highest selling holiday children's books of the season. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37 39-41). At the same time, sales of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   sharply declined and it failed to meet projections, notwithstanding that it was advertised on Amazon as \"Book of The Day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In early 2017, Viacom generated additional revenue from its animation of\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   by making it available on several other platforms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Nicassio further alleges that Viacom plans to produce three additional\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   holiday film specials in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43). Based on Penguin's and Viacom's alleged copying of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   , the complaint claims that Nicassio has sustained damage and injury to her business, goodwill, reputation and profits in an amount not presently known. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44). In addition, Nicassio claims that Defendants' conduct has resulted in actual confusion among consumers, as evidenced by customer reviews on Amazon and experienced by her at book signings for\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45). The complaint also points out that a Google search for Nicassio's\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   purportedly yields results for Viacom's animation of\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nicassio initiated this action against Viacom and Penguin on June 17, 2017, asserting the following counts: (I) copyright infringement-book publications (against Penguin only); (II) copyright infringement-film production (against Viacom only); (III) unfair competition under the Lanham Act and state law; (IV) state law tortious interference with prospective advantage; and (V) state law tortious destruction of intellectual property. (Docket No. 1). Penguin and Viacom responded to the complaint by filing a joint motion to dismiss and brief in support on November 6, 2017. (Docket Nos. 18, 19). After being granted multiple extensions, Nicassio filed her brief in opposition on January 9, 2018, (Docket No. 32), and Defendants filed their reply on February 2, 2018. (Docket No. 34). The Court convened oral argument on March 12, 2018. (Docket No. 41). At the close of argument, the parties declined to submit supplemental briefing, but the Court permitted Nicassio to file the color version of the PowerPoint slides utilized during argument, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), which she did on March 14, 2018. (Docket No. 42).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the motion is fully briefed and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Copyright Infringement Claims-Counts I and II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court begins its analysis by addressing Nicassio's copyright infringement claims set forth in Counts I and II of her complaint. (Docket No. 1). To state a claim for copyright infringement, the plaintiff must allege ownership of a valid copyright, and unauthorized copying of protectable elements of the plaintiff's work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software Servs. v. Grace Consulting, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11343053\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/197/#p206\">\n    307 F.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206 (3d Cir.2002). At this stage of the case, Defendants do not challenge whether Nicassio sufficiently pled ownership of a valid copyright or access. (Docket No. 19 at 11 n. 6). Instead, Defendants only dispute that the complaint adequately pleads that they copied protectable elements of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   .

Bruce Spruce advises Rocky to withdraw from the annual Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree contest because, according to Bruce, he does not have chance to win.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Then a \"wood fairy\" named Mary Louise arrives, telling Bruce to leave Rocky alone. Bruce and AJ depart, although they continue to mock Rocky as they leave. Mary Louise proceeds to offer Rocky words and encouragement and even tries to make him laugh. Rocky asks her if she is enchanted and could use her magic to make him \"handsome and strong like Bruce Spruce and the mighty white pine.\" Mary Louise responds: \"There is no such thing as magic. You just have to believe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   These words motivate Rocky to drink more water and be more positive. He starts telling himself every day that he is \"tall and fluffy and green.\" In just a short time, Rocky grows twice in size, develops \"lush, dark green branches,\" and is beaming with \"new found confidence.\" The other animals in the forest notice the transformation, but are suspicious that Mary Louise used her magic to put a spell on Rocky, so they report their theory to Bruce. Once Bruce observes Rocky practicing standing tall for the contest, he too is convinced that Mary Louise used magic to make Rocky grow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Worried that he will lose to Rocky, Bruce conspires with AJ \"to catch the fairy and make her change Rocky back.\" Bruce and AJ capture Mary Louise by using a net of twigs. Bruce screams at her: \"You used magic on Rocky! Change him back or when I come back I'm tearing down your house!\" Bruce then leaves to enter the competition. Meanwhile, AJ holds Mary Louise captive behind a snow mound. Mary Louise denies to AJ that she used magic to make Rocky grow. Rather, she explains that she merely \"told Rocky to believe in himself and anything would be possible.\" Satisfied with her explanation, AJ frees Mary Louise, \"just in time to watch all the trees being judged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The judges pass overhead in red helicopters to decide which tree will be chosen. After looking at all of the contestants, they pick Rocky, proclaiming, \"[w]e found the perfect tree!\" Rocky is decorated with ornaments and twinkling lights and displayed at Rockefeller Center.

Albert, a tiny potted Douglas fir, is part of the family of plants in the nursery. He loves Christmas but grows sad each year as he watches \"all the big trees outside go home with happy families.\" Convinced that he is destined for something more, Albert jumps off his shelf and races for the door to leave. However, as he is on his way, he is spotted on the ground by Earth Mama, who asks: \"What in the world is this pip-squeak doing down here?\" Earth Mama's granddaughter Molly picks Albert off the ground and places him back on the shelf. Molly comforts him, saying, \"it's okay to be small, as long as it doesn't stop you from doin' big things.\" Then Molly's father, Donny, tells her that it is time to deliver the trees to \"Baker's Hill before the Empire City Christmas show in New York.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Almost suddenly, Albert hears an announcement on the television that tomorrow, in Baker's Hill, Vermont, \"one special tree, oozing with Christmas spirit, will be chosen as this year's Empire City Christmas Tree-the most famous Christmas tree in the world!\" Eager to be selected, Albert sneaks a ride to Baker's Hill with Donny and Molly, as well as his two friends: Gene, a stink-breath weed, and Maisie, an encouraging potted palm tree. Along the way to Baker's Hill, Donny and Molly make a pit stop at a restaurant called Cactus Pete's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the stop, Albert hears a voice screaming for help from beneath the snow, so he gets out of the truck and starts digging. Albert soon learns that the voice was coming from Cactus Pete himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Cactus Pete angrily complains to Albert, Maisie, and Gene that every year he is replaced in the restaurant by a Christmas tree. Upon learning that Albert aspires to be this year's Empire City Christmas Tree, Pete and \"his ragtag band of cacti chased after Albert, Maisie, and Gene, blasting spiky needles in every direction!\" Albert and his friends, however, escape from Pete (temporarily, at least) by flattening him behind a dumpster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When Albert and his friends return to the restaurant, they discover that Donny and Molly have already left. Albert, however, remains determined to continue to Baker's Hill. Just then, he and his friends see a truck with what appears to have \"BAKER'S HILL\" painted on the side pass by, so they hop aboard. Soon thereafter, the truck dumps them on a conveyor belt and they quickly realize they made a mistake. They are not at Baker's Hill but instead are at Baker's Mill-a paper mill where they are about to be mulched. To make things worse, they discover that \"Cactus Pete had survived the dumpster smash and followed them\" to the truck. Pete began shooting spikes at them again but was defeated when he \"rolled straight into the chipper.\" It looks like Albert and Maisie are next, but at the very last second, Gene the stink-breath weed pulls the emergency lever to stop the belt and save them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Albert and his friends proceed to a nearby forest in search of Baker's Hill but are chased by several vegetarian bunnies who are trying to eat them. They elude the bunnies by jumping into a log and sliding down a hill, which comes to a stop right in front of a news van. They made it to Baker's Hill just in time for the tree selection. The man from the news exclaims: \"This is it everyone! We've found our tree!\" At first, Albert is overjoyed, thinking the man is referring to him; however, he becomes deflated once he realizes the man selected the eighty-foot evergreen named Big Betty behind him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As Maisie comforts Albert, he notices that Cactus Pete-who is mangled from the wood chipper but still alive-hitched a ride on Betty's truck. Unwilling to let Pete ruin Christmas, Albert, Maisie, and Gene catch a ride to Empire City to stop Pete (in a news van in the book, and in a red helicopter in the film). When they arrive, they see Pete shoot a spike at the crane operator who was in the process of putting the famous star on Betty. This causes the operator to slice Betty's top off with the star. The large crowd is heartbroken, as there is now nowhere to place the star on Betty. But, Albert remembers Molly's words of encouragement from the nursery: \"It's okay to be small, as long as it doesn't stop you from doin' big things.\" So, with the help of the crowd, Albert is decorated and the crane operator hoists him atop of Betty, at which point the famous star is placed on his head. \"He had become the most famous Christmas tree in the world!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When Albert sees Maisie and Gene waving goodbye, however, he realizes that he misses his family at the nursery. Albert also spots Cactus Pete in the crowd and recognizes that Pete does not hate Christmas; he just hates being left out. Albert thus trades places with Pete, and Pete begins to joyfully sing on top of Betty. Albert, Maisie, and Gene smile at Pete and return home to the nursery, where they are welcomed by Jaws the Venus flytrap. The story ends with Molly placing a star on Albert, which causes him to smile back brightly at her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Defendants further contend that, despite sharing the same basic story concept,\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   are entirely dissimilar in their protectable expression, when considering all of the relevant factors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-21). But, according to Nicassio, the works are substantially similar, and the\n   <em>\n    scenes a faire\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not apply, because her \"originality in expressing the theme of perseverance by making the character a tree aspiring to be the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree\" does not flow from a \"commonplace\" idea. (Docket No. 32 at 15, 19). In her view, a tree with \"a dream of success\" that actually becomes a hero \"is an uncommon happenstance in literature,\" even in the context of a holiday story.

Admittedly,\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   shares this theme. (Docket Nos. 19 at 17, 34 at 7-10).

Only after soldiering on to Empire City to stop Cactus Pete from ruining\n   Christmas does Albert become the most famous Christmas tree in the world. In fact, the way Albert achieves this fame-being placed on top of Betty, an 80-foot evergreen with a severed top-stands in stark contrast to how Rocky is merely selected as the contest winner. Also, unlike\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   , once Albert reaches his goal, he realizes that family is more important than being the most famous Christmas tree in the world. He then discovers that Pete was only trying to ruin Christmas because he was lonely, so he trades places with Pete and returns home to spend the holiday with his family at the plant nursery.

(Docket Nos. 19 at 23-25, 34 at 14). The complaint alleges that Defendants are liable for tortious interference because they willfully interfered with her contractual agreement for the manufacture, distribution, and publication of paper copies of\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   and her \"hope\" of negotiating \"the sale of the exclusive right to\n   <em>\n    Rocky\n   </em>\n   to Hallmark for the 2017 holiday season.\" (Docket No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 34, 45, 68, 69).

Because Nicassio has not requested leave to amend her complaint, let alone presented the Court with a proposed amended pleading, the Court declines to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   extend her the opportunity to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garza v.
