Green (\"Plaintiff\"), a prisoner previously confined at the Erie County Holding Center (\"ECHC\"), filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint asserting claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 1). The operative complaint in this action is Plaintiff's third amended complaint, filed on October 3, 2016. (Dkt. 29). Defendant Sergeant Michael Anderson (named in Plaintiff's third amended complaint as \"Sergeant Anderson\") (\"Defendant\") has moved for summary judgment in lieu of filing an answer to the complaint. (Dkt. 42). Defendant contends that summary judgment is appropriate because Plaintiff made a mistake regarding his identity, and he was not involved in the complained of events or actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted and Defendant is dismissed from this action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment in lieu of an answer to Plaintiff's complaint on August 8, 2017. (Dkt, 42). Defendant also filed affidavits in support of his motion (Dkt. 45; Dkt. 46) with attached exhibits (Dkt. 45-1; Dkt. 45-2; Dkt. 45-3; Dkt. 46-1; Dkt. 46-2; Dkt. 46-3) as well as a memorandum in support of the motion (Dkt. 47). Plaintiff was\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at the time the motion was filed. The Court issued a motion scheduling order and notice to Plaintiff on August 10, 2017, which set a deadline of September 7, 2017, for Plaintiff's response and informed Plaintiff that if he did not file a response, the \"Court may accept Defendant's factual assertions as true\" and \"[j]udgment may then be entered in Defendant's favor without a trial.\" (Dkt. 53). Plaintiff did not file papers opposing the motion for summary judgment. On October 24, 2017, Attorney Matthew A. Albert entered a notice of appearance on behalf of Plaintiff. (Dkt. 61).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Summary Judgment Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In Plaintiff's third amended complaint, he names Defendant in the section regarding his conditions of confinement claim. (Dkt. 29 at 22-24). He refers to Defendant as \"Sergeant Anderson.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that on January 1, 2016, he complained about the poor conditions in his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). He complained that the \"cell is free[zing] cold and ... the vent is blowing cold air out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Plaintiff, Defendant arrived at Plaintiff's housing unit at 8:15 a.m. in response to Plaintiff's complaint about the temperature of his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant \"stated this cell feel[s] like an ice box\" and said that he would send maintenance to check on the ventilation system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff requested an extra blanket and Defendant responded that he would let Plaintiff know before he left for the day whether Plaintiff's request would be granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that he heard nothing from Defendant that day, did not receive a blanket, and the temperature in his cell did not improve. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his motion for summary judgment, Defendant states that he was not working\n   at ECHC on January 1, 2016. (Dkt. 47). In support, Defendant cites the Erie County Sheriff's Office (\"ECSO\") Sergeant's Schedule for the week of Saturday, December 26, 2015, through January 1, 2016. (Dkt. 45-1 (Exhibit B) ). The box in the row marked \"Anderson\" and the column marked \"1/1\" says \"RDO\" (Dkt. 45-1 (Exhibit B) ), which Defendant explains stands for \"Regular Day Off\" (Dkt. 47 at 2). Plaintiff also cites the affidavit of John Greenan (\"Greenan\"), Chief of Administrative Services at ECSO. (Dkt. 47 at 2). Greenan avers that the only \"Sergeant Anderson\" either \"(i) currently employed by ECSO, or (ii) employed by ECSO as of January 1, 2016, is Sergeant Michael Anderson.\" (Dkt. 46 at 2). He continues, \"[B]ased on my examination of ECSO's records ... generated, kept and maintained in the regular course of ECSO's business [Defendant] did not work at [ECHC] on January 1, 2016.... It was his regular day off[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 46-2 (Exhibit B) (Sergeant's Schedule for week of December 26, 2015, through January 1, 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment should be granted if the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Court should grant summary judgment if, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the court finds that no rational jury could find in favor of that party.\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Dec. 18, 2013). The standard for granting summary judgment is the same whether the motion is made in lieu of an answer or after discovery has occurred-the moving party must demonstrate that no genuine\n   issues of material fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106104\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/201/#p202\">\n    337 F.3d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rule 56 also provides that if a non-moving party fails to oppose a summary judgment motion, \"summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against\" him. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). However, \"where the non-moving party 'chooses the perilous path of failing to submit a response to a summary judgment motion, the district court may not grant the motion without first examining the moving party's submission to determine if it has met its burden of demonstrating that no material issue of fact remains for trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vermont Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 Beargram Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9231258\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/241/#p244\">\n    373 F.3d 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Amaker v.

The Court concludes that Defendant has met his burden to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to Plaintiff's claims against this defendant. Defendant has presented evidence that he was not working at ECHC on the day on which he is alleged to have participated in the events giving rise to Plaintiff's conditions of confinement claim. Defendant has averred to that in his affidavit (Dkt. 45 at 2), and has submitted the ECSO Sergeant's Schedule for the week of December 26, 2015, through January 1, 2016 (Dkt 45-2 (Exhibit B) ), as well as an affidavit by the Chief of Administrative Services at ECSO averring that Defendant was not scheduled to work on that date (Dkt. 46). Defendant cannot face liability for Plaintiff's claims if he had no personal involvement in the alleged wrongdoing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colon v.
