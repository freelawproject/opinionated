I am unpersuaded by this distinction. Rather, the elements of the abstract idea in\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   correspond respectively to claim 1's elements of (1) obtaining a recording identifier, (2) comparing the recording identifier with previously stored identifiers, and (3) storing the playback preferences in the playback preference database.

As to Plaintiff's first argument, playing back these recorded signals and setting these playback preferences, as with claim 1, can be performed by humans, and these claims are, at most, directed to automation of a once-manual procedure-playing back recorded signals, albeit with specified alternate sources of recorded signals and types of playback preferences.

Plaintiffs' argument that the dependent claims \"constitute [ ] a substantial improvement in the underlying functionality of the audio/visual equipment by improving the quality of audio reproduction and audio characteristics\" likewise does not save the claims from abstraction, because each dependent claim merely recites generic or well-known computer technology to describe alternate sources of recorded signals and types of playback preferences.

(D.I. 186). I need not reach Defendant's argument that the asserted claims of the '899 patent are invalid as anticipated under \u00a7 102. (D.I. 190 at 11). I previously denied Defendant's argument that any of the asserted claims is obvious under \u00a7 103. (D.I. 269 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The '899 patent incorporates by reference U.S. Patent App. No. 09/060,876. ('899 patent, 1:10-11). The incorporated patent application is \"effectively part of the ['899 patent] as if [it] were explicitly contained therein.\"\n    <em>\n     X2Y Attenuators, LLC v. Int'l Trade Comm'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125388\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1358/#p1362\">\n     757 F.3d 1358\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal citation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The claims under consideration in\n    <em>\n     Sonos v. D&amp;M\n    </em>\n    were considerably less abstract than the claims I am now considering, as the analysis in D.I. 242 makes clear. The claims I am now considering specify that \"the playback preferences\" and \"default preferences\" can \"include surround sound mode,\" but provide no further detail. ('899 patent, claims 13, 18, 31, 36).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Plaintiffs state that \"previously stored preferences\" has its plain and ordinary meaning. (D.I. 280 at 18).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    I would characterize the abstract idea as \"playing a recording according to one's tastes,\" which I think is a more easily understandable way of saying it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that the machine-or-transformation test demonstrates that claim 1 is patent eligible, and that claim 1 does not preempt \"any process or method applying the allegedly abstract concept.\" (D.I. 222 at 10-11). Indeed, unless \"playback preference database\" is limited to computer databases, claim 1 does not actually claim an automated method. It preempts both manual and computer-implemented methods of choosing to play back media with or without playback preferences. The claim is also not tied to a novel machine, and it does not transform an article.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
