Before the Court are Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment [ECF Nos. 126, 131, 142]. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants U.S. Bank and Nevel's Motions for Summary Judgment [ECF Nos. 126, 131] and denies the Skibbes' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [ECF No. 142].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Most of the facts are undisputed between the parties. The parties before the Court are the foreclosed-upon homeowners (the \"Skibbes\"), the bank (\"U.S. Bank\"), and the bank's law firm that filed the foreclosure actions (\"Nevel\"). There have been four foreclosures in this case. Each will be described here, although only the latter three are relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Mortgage Loan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2004, Dwayne and Deborah Skibbe (the \"Skibbes\") refinanced their home mortgage loan with Household Finance Corporation (\"HFC\") in the amount of $271,132.11 and secured the loan with their home. (U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 18 (U.S. Bank and Nevel filed separate responses to the Skibbes' Statement of Facts, but where no difference is apparent, the responses will be cited together).) Eventually, the Skibbes stopped making regular payments on their mortgage. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6 9.) A foreclosure action was filed in 2007 and later voluntarily dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    HFC v. Deborah Skibbe et al.,\n   </em>\n   No. 07 CH 1562 (Ill. Cir. Ct.).) This initial foreclosure is not relevant to the issues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Foreclosure I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Skibbes defaulted on their monthly mortgage payments again in 2010. (U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 20.) In December 2010, HFC filed a foreclosure suit against the Skibbes in Kane County seeking a judgment of foreclosure and sale of the Skibbes' home (\"Foreclosure\n   I\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    HFC v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skibbe,\n   </em>\n   10 CH 5758 (Ill. Cir. Ct.) ). The Skibbes filed for bankruptcy on December 23, 2011. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6 19.) During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Skibbes filed a statement of intention to surrender the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiffs' Chapter 13 Plan was confirmed on May 21, 2012, and HFC afterwards voluntarily dismissed Foreclosure I. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Foreclosure II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A little over a year later, in June 2013, Nevel, on behalf of HFC, filed a second foreclosure against the Skibbes in Kane County seeking foreclosure and sale of Skibbes' home (\"Foreclosure II\"). (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    HFC v. Skibbe,\n   </em>\n   13 CH 1418 (Ill. Cir. Ct.) ). Unfortunately for the Defendants, HFC voluntarily dismissed Foreclosure II five months later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) It seems a mystery even to the parties why Foreclosure II was voluntarily dismissed. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6 26.) The Skibbes converted their bankruptcy to Chapter 7 and subsequently received a bankruptcy discharge on January 6, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) The mortgage loan was later assigned from HFC to U.S. Bank Trust N.A. (\"U.S. Bank\") after having already been in default. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank's Add'l Facts \u00b6 2; U.S. Bank's Resp. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 25.) U.S. Bank retained Defendant Law Offices of Ira T. Nevel (\"Nevel\") to collect the debt through foreclosure on the property. (Nevel's Resp. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Foreclosure III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its ill-fated third attempt, Nevel, on behalf of U.S. Bank, filed a third foreclosure against the Skibbes in Kane County on January 8, 2015, seeking foreclosure and sale of the Skibbes' home to satisfy their mortgage obligation (\"Foreclosure III\"). (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    U.S.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank v. Skibbe,\n   </em>\n   15 CH 22 (Ill. Cir. Ct.) ). Foreclosure III is at the heart of the Skibbes' FDCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The propriety of Foreclosure III was (and still is) heavily disputed between the parties. The crux of the dispute was whether Foreclosure III was procedurally barred under Illinois law. The Skibbes argued (successfully) that Foreclosure III was barred by Illinois' single refiling rule, which allows a litigant to dismiss voluntarily a lawsuit and then refile that same lawsuit only once. The Skibbes argue that Foreclosure III was a\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   refiling and thus barred by the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   735 ILCS 5/13-217 ;\n   <em>\n    Timberlake v. Illini Hosp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295813\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/175/159/\">\n    175 Ill.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20831\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=676%20N.E.2d%20634\">\n    676 N.E.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (Ill. 1997). The Defendants argued that Foreclosure I and Foreclosures II and III were different cases because Foreclosure I was based on an April 2010 default date whereas Foreclosures II and III were based on an August 2010 default date. (Skibbes' Resp. to Nevel \u00b6\u00b6 8, 16, 22.) Thus, according to the Defendants, Foreclosure III was proper under the single refiling rule because it was just the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   refiling of Foreclosure II, not the second refiling of Foreclosure I. Now in federal court, the Defendants buttress their position by pointing to the fact that the foreclosure complaints allege different default dates because the Skibbes made additional payments in 2011, after Foreclosure I was filed. (U.S. Bank's Facts \u00b6 16; Nevel's Facts \u00b6 11.) The Defendants rely on the Skibbes' bank statements to support its assertion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=676%20N.E.2d%20634\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Skibbes do not dispute that these payments were made to HFC from their bank account, but they dispute characterizing them as mortgage payments, notably without any indication about what else those payments could possibly be. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank's Facts \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties continued to argue about whether Foreclosure III was proper, both\n   in letter correspondence prior to Foreclosure III's filing and then throughout the state court litigation, including on appeal. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Prior State Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Skibbes won that argument in state court. On June 24, 2015, the circuit court dismissed Foreclosure III with prejudice, holding it was barred by the single-refiling rule. (U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 34.) Nevel moved to reconsider. The court denied the motion, at least partially based on the court's understanding that no payments had been made after April 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38; Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) The court found that \"both sides agreed and reaffirmed this morning that no payments were made after April 2010\" and denied reconsideration, stating in its ruling that \"[b]ased on the representations that were made on the date of our first hearing and today that no additional payments were made ... what's been presented is that nothing has changed in terms of the payments since [Foreclosure I]\" and \"[t]he fact of the matter is ... the Plaintiff alleged the same breach in [Foreclosure I], [Foreclosure II], and [Foreclosure III].\" (Transcript of Mot. to Recon. Hearing 8:4-6, 17:17-19:14, Ex. F to U.S. Bank \u00b6 45; Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6 45.) The Defendants now state that additional payments were, in fact, made by the Skibbes in 2011, and that counsel for both parties incorrectly stated otherwise at the hearing. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6 46.) Neither party disputes that the state court denied the motion to reconsider, but the parties do dispute why. The Skibbes maintain that the court denied reconsideration because U.S. Bank through Nevel alleged the same breach in all three foreclosures and thus violated the single refiling rule; whereas the Defendants maintain that the state court denied reconsideration on the incorrect factual basis that all three foreclosures were based on the same default date because no additional payments had been made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Defendants appealed, but they fared no better. (U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 39.) On appeal, the appellate court denied Nevel's motion to supplement the record with proof of the additional payments, the court finding \"that a reviewing court cannot review the contents of a record that were not a part of the trial court record and reviewed first by that court.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. v. Skibbe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20151143-U\">\n    2016 IL App (2d) 151143-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204586091\">\n    2016 WL 4586091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ill. App. Ct. Aug. 31, 2016). The appellate court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to what transpired here, HFC filed a complaint to foreclose defendants' mortgage on December 23, 2010. In this complaint, HFC alleged that no payments were made on defendants' mortgage since April 2010. HFC subsequently voluntarily dismissed that complaint without prejudice on September 17, 2012. Thereafter, on June 5, 2013, which was well within one year after the initial complaint was voluntarily dismissed, HFC filed a second complaint to foreclose defendants' mortgage. In this complaint, HFC alleged that no payments were made since August 2010. This second complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on November 27, 2013. On January 8, 2015, plaintiff filed yet another complaint to foreclose defendants' mortgage. In this complaint, like the June 5, 2013, complaint, plaintiff alleged that no payments were made since August 2010. Pursuant to section 13-217, this third action to foreclose defendants' mortgage is barred even though it was filed within the applicable 10-year statute of limitations (see 735 ILCS 5/13-206 (West 2014) ).\n   <em>\n    Timberlake,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295813\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/175/159/\">\n    175 Ill.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20831\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=676%20N.E.2d%20634\">\n    676 N.E.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we find irrelevant the fact that the 2010 complaint\n   alleged that the default date was in April 2010 and the 2013 and 2015 complaints alleged that the default date was in August 2010. At the hearing on plaintiff's motion to reconsider, the court, with the parties' consent, made clear that no payments were made since April 2010. Accordingly, in contrast to what plaintiff alleges on appeal, the 2010, 2013, and 2015 complaints all involve the same transaction, i.e., defendants' failure to make any payments on their mortgage since April 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. The Skibbes incurred approximately $18,000 in legal fees and costs to defend Foreclosure III, which the appellate court ruled improper in the above opinion. (U.S. Bank and Nevel's Resps. to Skibbes' Facts \u00b6 44.) The fallout is that U.S. Bank is unable to foreclose on the property even though the Skibbes agreed to surrender the property during bankruptcy and are no longer making mortgage payments. (Skibbes' Resp. to U.S. Bank \u00b6 20.) Due to the Defendants' procedural blunder, the Skibbes received a windfall; essentially, the Skibbes get to keep their home despite not paying back the majority of their mortgage loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

There are two prongs to the definition of debt collector under the FDCPA.

There is no factual misrepresentation outside of the alleged misrepresentation of filing and pursuing litigation barred by the Illinois single-refiling rule. The parties heavily dispute the factual basis of the state court rulings, but that need not be decided here. What is true for the purposes of this motion based on the state court rulings is this: Foreclosure III was barred by Illinois' single-filing rule. However, \"the fact that a lawsuit turns out ultimately to be unsuccessful\" is not itself sufficient to constitute an \"action that cannot legally be taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Heintz v.

When the facts based on violating Illinois' single-refiling rule (and the litigation that followed) are removed from the case, the Skibbes are left with no other evidence of an FDCPA violation.

However, the Court does not find\n   <em>\n    Parkis\n   </em>\n   as analogous as the cases previously discussed above.

However, the Court's earlier ruling found only that the pleadings were sufficient, not that the Skibbes would prevail. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court assessed the adequacy of the pleadings taking all factual inferences in the Skibbes' favor. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Oral Ruling, 5:11-14 (May 11, 2016).) This ruling did not evaluate the alleged misrepresentations in the state court proceeding, nor whether the filing and subsequent prosecution of Foreclosure III was, in fact, false, deceptive, or misleading.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3939328\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/668/1480/#p1487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It merely determined that the Skibbes stated a claim that may have established liability under the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosales,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201436957\">\n    2017 WL 1436957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Now with the benefit of a full record, it is apparent that the state court proceedings here did not contain factual misrepresentations like in\n   <em>\n    Rosales\n   </em>\n   ; rather, the evidence established that Foreclosure III was barred by a state procedural rule-the Skibbes maintain this is enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court disagrees. Disputes over the application of state procedural rules should be resolved in its proper forum-the state court. This Circuit has made clear that it will not \"transform the FDCPA into an enforcement mechanism for matters governed by state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Bentrud v. Bowman, Heintz, Boscia &amp; Vician, P.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287408\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/871/#p874\">\n    794 F.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (7th Cir. 2015) (rejecting claim that filing a summary judgment motion containing inaccuracies in state court violated the FDCPA). Yet, the Skibbes entire argument is that the Defendants' loss in state court constitutes an FDCPA violation. The entire point of the Seventh Circuit's admonition is to prevent every state court debt collection or foreclosure loss from becoming a federal claim.\n   <em>\n    See,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287408\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/871/#p874\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Furthermore, a litigant should not fear bringing contested issues before a tribunal because a loss in state court will create a claim under the FDCPA. This would be a different case if, after Foreclosure III's final judgment, the Defendants filed Foreclosure IV. In that case, the Defendants may very well have violated the FDCPA if they brazenly ignored a final judgment from the state court. Yet those are not the facts before the Court. Rather, the Skibbes\n   would have this Court find an FDCPA violation merely for bringing a foreclosure suit that was later ruled to be improper based on the Illinois Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court questions the wisdom of attaching FDCPA liability to defendants who bring an unsuccessful suit, finding the Eighth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen v. Messerli &amp; Kramer, P.A.\n   </em>\n   persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen,\n   </em>\n   the Eighth Circuit rejected an FDCPA claim based on alleged misrepresentations within a summary judgment motion in state court.

U.S. Bank vehemently argues that merely losing a foreclosure action does not constitute a violation of ICFA. As stated above, the Court takes as true the fact that Foreclosure III was procedurally barred.

The Skibbes cite\n   <em>\n    Maldonado\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   but\n   <em>\n    Maldonado\n   </em>\n   held that bringing a debt collection action in a more distant venue,\n   <em>\n    although improper,\n   </em>\n   was \"not the kind of deceptive conduct that the ICFA contemplates.\"\n   <em>\n    Maldanado,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202330213\">\n    2015 WL 2330213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. Here, the state court found Foreclosure III was improper, but that alone is insufficient to avoid the litigation privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Skibbes also cite to\n   <em>\n    Grant-Hall v.

Ill. 2012), which held that the plaintiff stated a claim under ICFA when defendant filed a state action in violation of a state law requiring certain documentation of assignment. The complaint alleged that the defendant \"misrepresented to consumers and courts that it had the right to file suit,\" which was sufficient to plead under the ICFA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567602\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/856/929/#p942\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567602\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/856/929/#p942\">\n    at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration marks omitted). First, at summary judgment, the inquiry is different. And second,\n   <em>\n    Grant-Hall\n   </em>\n   involved a debt collection action where the creditor never had the legal documentation necessary to bring the suit, a scenario not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Skibbes analogize this case to\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Asset Acceptance, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725968\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1076/#p1079\">\n    736 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1079 (7th Cir. 2013), where the Seventh Circuit upheld a class action asserting violations of the FDCPA based on litigation filed after the statute of limitations had passed. In comparing the facts of\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    Rosales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rehman,\n   </em>\n   this Court finds\n   <em>\n    Rosales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rehman\n   </em>\n   more analogous. As discussed above, the public policy considerations underpinning a statute of limitations bar are not present where a state procedural rule is at issue. This would be a different case if the statute of limitations had run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, the Skibbes rely on their earlier victory where this Court denied U.S. Bank's motion to dismiss. However, denial of a motion to dismiss does not ensure victory at summary judgment. U.S. Bank did not raise the litigation privilege in its motion to dismiss. Now that it is before the Court, this Court finds that the litigation\n   privilege applies as a matter of law and bars the Skibbes' claim under the ICFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, U.S. Bank and Nevel's Motions for Summary Judgment [ECF Nos. 126, 131] are granted.
