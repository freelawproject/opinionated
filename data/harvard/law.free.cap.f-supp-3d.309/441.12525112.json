Having reviewed the documents, the relevant law, the arguments of counsel, and the case file as a whole, the Court now enters the following opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is an employment discrimination and retaliation case. In the fall of 2013, Rivera was hired by Townsquare as a radio announcer for KOOC, a hip-hop radio station located in Temple, Texas. Mot. Summ. J. [# 39-1] App. at 3; Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40-1] Ex. A at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a radio announcer, Rivera's primary on-the-job\n   duty was to act as an announcer and \"DJ\" for KOOC. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40-1] Ex. B (Rivera Decl.) at 2-4. In addition to these primary duties, Townsquare also required Rivera to author twelve short blog posts each week regarding current events and local news.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. According to Rivera, a comparatively large proportion of KOOC's audience is black, and in his capacity as a hip-hop radio announcer, Rivera frequently brought black music artists into the studio to have them on air.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   [# 40-3] Ex. C (Wiederhold Dep.) at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rivera's local manager at the station was Laura Wiederhold. Wiederhold Dep. at 5-7. Though the first year of Rivera's employment apparently passed without incident, Rivera alleges that Wiederhold frequently complained to Rivera about his interactions with black men at the radio station. Rivera Decl. at 2-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At one point in 2015, Wiederhold called the police when she saw black men congregating outside of the radio station after dark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wiederhold explained in her deposition that she called the police because the black men were assembled at the radio station's front entrance and she was unaware anyone was expecting visitors. Reply Mot. Summ. J. [# 41-1] App. at 1-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In actuality, the men had come to the station to meet with Rivera and were standing outside with him when Wiederhold called the police. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40-1] Ex. I at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rivera alleges Wiederhold's racial animus extended beyond casual remarks to impact operational aspects of his work for KOOC. For example, Rivera alleges the other Townsquare radio stations were given more opportunities and better equipment with which to work because their audiences consisted of non-black listeners. Rivera Decl. at 3. At his deposition, Rivera also alleged Wiederhold interfered with his ability to enter contractual arrangements with black music artists by attempting to make Rivera charge KOOC's predominately black artists for playing their music or for interviews, despite the fact that this was not typically done for artists on other stations. Rivera Dep. at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Eventually, Rivera complained to his operations manager, Vince Richards, about the unequal treatment he was receiving as the radio announcer at KOOC. Rivera Decl. at 3-4. Specifically, Rivera told Richards that Wiederhold, the local manager, was discriminating against Rivera because he was the announcer for the hip-hop station and because Wiederhold was afraid of black men.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rivera alleges Richards was insensitive to these complaints and told Rivera to stop complaining.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Richards allegedly told Rivera to be \"careful\" about having black men come to the station.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Either prior to or simultaneous with Rivera's complaints of discrimination,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tan\n   Curtis, a digital managing editor for Townsquare, \"began a campaign of concentrating on Rivera's blog posts\" to detect potential plagiarism. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40-1] Ex. A at 4. This alleged investigation revealed several instances of alleged plagiarism or shoddy attribution. Townsquare's motion for summary judgment identifies three instances in which Rivera allegedly plagiarized content produced by third parties. In the first instance, Rivera wrote a post which \"featured a quote originally published by the New York Times.\" Mot. Summ. J. [# 39] at 13. In the second instance, Rivera \"borrowed multiple quotes\" originally published in an AllHipHop.com article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the third instance, Rivera's post contained two sentences that \"were nearly identical\" to sentences in a TMZ article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 27, 2015, Tan Curtis and Vince Richards met with Rivera regarding Townsquare's plagiarism and attribution policies. Mot. Summ. J. [# 39-2] Appendix at 230. Curtis explained Rivera should include attribution and hyperlinks in his blog posts when he gathered information from outside sources and also informed Rivera he should add a local or personal spin when adapting posts written by Townsquare's national team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the meeting, Curtis sent out an email which states \"[o]ur concerns discussed, we look forward to a productive and creative 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The email does not suggest Townsquare was considering terminating Rivera for his past conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 8, 2015, Curtis emailed Wiederhold and Stephanie McMaster, a regional digital manager and reported Rivera was \"Plagiarizing Again (Sort of)\" but that Rivera's transgressions were \"not exactly plagiarism.\" Mot. Summ. J. [# 39-3] Appendix at 19. Curtis explained that Rivera's posts did not actually constitute plagiarism but probably violated Townsquare's \"proper attribution protocols.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Curtis believed the posts showed Rivera was intent on \"trying to find ... ways around putting in the effort required to complete his regular posting duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Wiederhold forwarded this email to Richards. Resp. Mot. Dismiss [# 40-4] Ex. D at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a follow-up email on May 27, 2015, Curtis emailed Richards and McMaster ten collected examples of alleged plagiarism and shoddy attribution. Mot. Summ. J. [# 39-3] Appendix at 19. Of these ten examples-drawn from over 600 blog posts authored by Rivera-only four were posted subsequent to the January 27 meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Curtis's email acknowledges these four instances of alleged plagiarism were \"more subtle\" than on previous occasions, a development he attributes to \"evolution\" in Rivera's plagiarism technique.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Curtis further explained that if he could google a phrase from one of Rivera's articles and find another article using the same phrase, \"that's plagiarism, plain and simple.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 28, 2015, Richards sent an email to Kurt Johnson, a senior vice-president for programming at Townsquare, stating they had \"discover [sic] a case of plagiarism\n   in the Killeen/Temple market.\" Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40-4] Ex. D at 40-41. Richards did not share Curtis's equivocations regarding whether or not Rivera's posts constituted plagiarism, instead informing Johnson that Curtis, Richards, and McMaster had concluded Rivera was actively engaged in plagiarism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the same day, Johnson also received an email from Rivera himself, in which Rivera complained of discrimination at the radio station, including the directive that KOOC music artists pay for interviews.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Rivera believed this constituted discrimination because other stations were not required to charge their music artists for interviews. Rivera Decl. at 2-4. In spite of the concerns raised by Rivera in his email, Johnson left the role of reviewing Rivera's posts to Richards and two other managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [# 40-5] Ex. E at 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following a review by Richards and others, Rivera was informed on June 23, 2015 that he was being terminated for violating Townsquare's plagiarism policy. Mot. Summ. J. [# 39-2] Appendix at 162. Townsquare then hired an African-American man, Shannon Brazier, to replace Rivera.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response to his termination, Rivera filed a complaint against Townsquare with the Texas Workforce Commission. Am. Compl. [# 9] at 5. Rivera subsequently filed this suit in federal court alleging Townsquare's actions violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-2(a), and 1981.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.

Rivera argues Curtis and Richards conducted a singularly\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   extensive campaign to review hundreds of Rivera's posts in hopes of locating superficial similarities to other articles reporting on the same news event. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40-1] Ex. A at 4. Rivera also points out, somewhat saliently, that the only clear-cut examples of \"plagiarism\" predated the January 27 meeting and involved Rivera adapting Townsquare's\n   <em>\n    own posts\n   </em>\n   for local use, a practice which had been explicitly condoned by management in the past and which Rivera ceased to engage in once Curtis began to clarify and narrow existing policy.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Feb. 5 Email (stating Rivera was \"welcome\" to appropriate content from national site posts),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Mot. Summ. J. [# 39-2] Appendix at 242 (stating contributors should \"never repurpose [n]ational content in place of local [content]\" and informing contributors they must obtain prior authorization before putting a personal or local spin on content contained in national site posts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is not the Court's duty at the summary judgment stage to definitively determine which party's factual account is correct. In light of limited evidence of plagiarism following the January 27 meeting and in light of Townsquare's failure to point to any previous instance in which it has ever fired an employee for plagiarism (let alone misattribution), the Court concludes a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Rivera would have been fired but for his protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In summation, because Rivera has identified a protected activity which was arguably the but-for cause of his termination, the Court finds Rivera has made out a prima facie case of retaliation under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Nondiscriminatory Reason\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because Rivera has made out a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts\n   to Townsquare to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Rivera's discharge. As already explained above, Townsquare has argued, somewhat unconvincingly, that Rivera was terminated because ten of the six hundred posts authored by Rivera during his time at KOOC allegedly violated Townsquare's plagiarism and source attribution. This qualifies as a legitimate albeit weak justification for Rivera's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Unworthy of Credence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because Townsquare has articulated a legitimate reason for Rivera's termination, the burden shifts back to the Rivera to \"demonstrate the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433655\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/342/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff can meet this burden by either providing evidence of intentional discrimination or retaliation or by providing evidence establishing the falsity of the employer's explanation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433655\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/342/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Rivera argues Townsquare's explanation is unworthy of credence for two reasons. First, as examined above in conjunction with the Court's analysis of but-for causation, Rivera argues his alleged infractions following the January 27 meeting with Curtis and Richards were too minor, even when viewed in the context of his prior record, to serve as credible grounds for termination. Rivera Decl. at 1-5. Second, and relatedly, Rivera argues the plagiarism review was initiated specifically because Townsquare was searching for a reason to fire Rivera.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433655\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/342/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On this point, Rivera notes Townsquare cannot identify a single instance in which it has ever previously fired any employee for plagiarism. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [# 40] at 15. In consideration of these arguments and the facts examined above with respect to but-for causation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court determines a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Townsquare's reason for firing Rivera is worthy of credence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds Rivera has failed to state a claim under either \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a) or 2000e-3(a) With respect to Rivera's claim under \u00a7 1981, the Court finds Rivera has met his burdens of production under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   but concludes genuine issues of material fact exist as to (1) whether Rivera's protected conduct was the but-for cause of his termination and (2) whether Townsquare's articulated reason for Rivera's termination is worthy of credence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Townsquare's Motion for Summary Judgment [# 39] is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as described in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    For consistency, all citations refer to CM/ECF pagination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In its reply, Townsquare alleges for the first time that none of Wiederhold's remarks can create a genuine issue of material fact because the remarks are inadmissible hearsay.
