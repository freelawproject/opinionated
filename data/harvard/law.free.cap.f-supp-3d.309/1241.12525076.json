Defendants move to dismiss the Amended Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction over Loews Corp. and LHHC; Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of Plaintiff's standing; and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state claims for relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 5-6). The Court has carefully considered the Amended Class Action Complaint [ECF No. 28]; the Motion; Plaintiff, Michael Fox's Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (\"Response\") [ECF No. 37]; Defendants' Reply [ECF No. 38]; and applicable law. For the reasons explained below, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff brings this consumer class action on behalf of people who purchased food and/or drinks at restaurants or public food service establishments owned or controlled by Defendants in Florida and who were charged a gratuity or service charge in violation of the Florida Deceptive Unfair Trade Practices Act, Section 501.201\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Florida Statutes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 1). Defendants allegedly violated Florida law by: unlawfully including an automatic gratuity or service charge in an amount\n   equal to or approximately 18 to 20 percent of the charges for food and beverage without providing statutorily required notice; presenting notice of an automatic gratuity or service charge in small and hard-to-read type; hiding the notice on page one of a multi-page menu; and improperly charging taxes on the gratuity in violation of the Florida Administrative Code. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a New York resident. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Loews Corp. owns 100 percent of LHHC. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). LHHC, \"through its subsidiaries,\" owns or controls seven hotel properties in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). MB is the owner of Loews Miami Beach Hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). LMBHOC operates the Loews Miami Beach Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Each of the Loews hotels is a public food service establishment or restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under Section 509.214, Florida Statutes, \"[e]very public food service establishment which includes an automatic gratuity or service charge in the price of the meal shall include on the food menu and on the face of the bill provided to the customer notice that an automatic gratuity is included.\" (Am.

An automatic 20 percent fee, listed as a \"20% SVC CHG,\" was included with the charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The menu did not mention an automatic gratuity or service charge of any amount would be added to the check.

Below the check total was an extra line for Plaintiff to add a \"Tip,\" which he then did add. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Plaintiff paid the check in full, including the automatic service charge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    \u00b6 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In somewhat contradictory fashion, Plaintiff later alleges the automatic gratuity or service charge was included on the menu \"in small, difficult to read type\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58(b) ), and was \"found on one page of a multi-page menu\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58(c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Plaintiff dined at the Lure Fishbar restaurant at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    \u00b6 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). When he was done eating, he was presented a check which included an automatic fee of an undisclosed percentage of the total listed as a \"SVC CHR FEE,\" equal to 20 percent of the subtotal of the food and/or beverage charges on the check. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The 20 percent service charge amount appears to have been included in the calculation of the charged taxes, although it is unclear how the tax is calculated or whether the fee is a non-taxable gratuity under Rule 12A-0115(7). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    \u00b6 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Below the check total was an extra line for Plaintiff to add an \"Additional Tip.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). There was no mention on the restaurant menu that an automatic gratuity or service charge would be added to the check. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    \u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Plaintiff sues individually and on behalf of a class consisting of all persons who were customers of a Loews hotel restaurant in Florida during the class period and who were billed and paid for food and/or beverages where the bill included an automatic service charge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff brings five claims for relief. Each count incorporates all of the prior allegations, including allegations supporting a particular claim for relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

As such, it is a quintessential shotgun pleading-a defect Defendants pointed out existed in the initial Complaint [ECF No. 1] (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 15] 6-7), and which they argue in the present Motion is fatal to the Amended Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. 10-11). Remarkably, despite Defendants having put him on notice of the defect in the initial Complaint, Plaintiff did not cure the defect with his Amended Complaint. Rather, he finds it disingenuous and \"hypocritical[ ]\" for Defendants to claim they are unable to understand his claims given they managed to prepare a 26-page motion to dismiss. (Resp. 12 (alteration added) ). Shame on Plaintiff for not heeding the Eleventh Circuit's repeated pronouncements criticizing shotgun pleadings like his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The typical shotgun complaint contains several counts, each one incorporating by reference the allegations of its predecessors, leading to a situation where most of the counts (i.e., all but the first) contain irrelevant factual allegations and legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Strategic Income Fund, L.L.C. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50). Plaintiff alleges Defendants' failure to provide the statutorily required notice constitutes a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the FDUTPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.203\">\n    \u00b6 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But according to Defendants, Plaintiff's allegations confirm notice is provided on the menus and on the bills, thereby \"fly[ing] in the face of any suggestion that he was unaware that an automatic gratuity or service\n   charge was included in his bill. As a result, his claims lack facial plausibility ....\" (Mot. 12 (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff reminds Defendants of his allegations, where he states no notice of the automatic gratuity appeared on the restaurant menus, either the hard copy received in the restaurant or the menu posted online. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 13 (quoting Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 30) ). Defendants do not resurrect this issue in their Reply. Consequently, Defendants' request for dismissal of Count I on the basis it does not state a plausible claim of a FDUTPA\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Counts I and II: Fair Notice of the FDUTPA Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants next challenge the sufficiency of the FDUTPA claims by insisting the Amended Complaint does not put each of the Defendants on notice of what deceptive or unfair conduct each is responsible for, and fails to reconcile its allegation the restaurants are operated by subsidiaries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 13-14). Defendants also take issue with inconsistent allegations, such as the alleged absence of the disclosure of automatic gratuities alongside allegations regarding reference to notice of the automatic charges appearing in \"small, difficult to read type,\" \"found on one page of a multi-page menu.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted) (quoting Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 58(b)-(c) ) ). Defendants also fault Plaintiff for not including images of the menus or receipts he describes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.203\">\n    14-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This Order has already addressed the imprecision resulting from Plaintiff lumping all Defendants indiscriminately together with factual allegations that in many instances do not support treating all Defendants collectively. Given Plaintiff is allowed to amend if he wishes to proceed, he is to eliminate the inconsistencies noted. He does not have to, however, include images of the menus or receipts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Count II: Violations of the FDUTPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In his Response, Plaintiff clarifies the Count II FDUTPA violation is broader than the one stated in Count I, the latter alleging no notice of the automatic gratuity is given in the menu. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 13). According to Plaintiff, the theory behind Count II is \"even where a restaurant's menu contains some notice of an automatic gratuity or service charge being added to the bill, such notice is nevertheless inadequate and amounts to an unfair and deceptive practice because it is presented in a manner that is intentionally difficult to read or otherwise hidden from the customer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Given this clarification drawn in the Response, Defendants return with a new argument directed to Count II: Defendants assert Plaintiff has conceded he suffered no injury, and hence has no standing, to bring Count II because he alleges he only visited restaurants that provided no notice rather than inadequate notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 7-8 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 30 (both alleging there was no mention on the restaurant menu of the automatic gratuity or service charge) ) ). Of course, given the shotgun pleading incorporates into Count I all of the Amended Complaint's preceding allegations, Count I presumably alleges no notice as well as inadequate notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 7 n.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants' points are well-taken. Plaintiff cannot pursue in Count II, or Count I for that matter, claims of deceptive and unfair practices under the FDUTPA arising from inadequate disclosures in menus he never saw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

Once the inadequate-disclosure allegations are removed from the Count II FDUTPA claim, it is merely duplicative of the FDUTPA claim in Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When Plaintiff files his second amended complaint, he shall either eliminate Count II or clarify the basis for his claim of injury arising from inadequate disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Rule 9(b) and the FDUTPA Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants next assert the FDUTPA claims must be dismissed because they are based on false representations, yet fail to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s particularity requirements for claims sounding in fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 15; Reply 9). Certainly, \"[t]he particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) applies to all claims that sound in fraud, regardless of whether those claims are grounded in state or federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Llado-Carreno v.

Fla. Feb. 22, 2011) (alteration added; citations omitted). Defendants identify one allegation-Defendants' \"falsely representing that higher charges for food and beverages were part of the cost of the food and/or beverages ordered by Plaintiff\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 58(e) )-that requires compliance with Rule 9(b), but for which the Amended Complaint \"does not come close\" to doing so (Mot. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Paragraph 58 of the Amended Complaint lists nine ways Defendants violated Florida law and engaged in deceptive practices in failing to disclose or inadequately disclosing the practice of adding automatic gratuities to their bills. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58(a)-(i) ). The quoted section is but one of those ways. Proof of misrepresentation or deceit, as would constitute a fraud, is not a necessary element in all causes of action brought under the FDUTPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donald Frederick Evans &amp; Assocs., Inc. v.

Fla. 2013) (\"FDUTPA claims can be based on deceptive or unfair practices that do not involve fraud ... and need not be pled with particularity.\" (alteration added; citations omitted) ). Given Plaintiff adequately describes the ways in which Defendants' conduct is unfair and deceptive, hence violating the FDUTPA, the Court will not strike in line-item fashion one alleged manner in which Defendants violated the FDUTPA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holguin v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 16-18; Reply 9-10). Again, Count III alleges Defendants violated Rule 12A-1.0115 by collecting too much money as tax, as they improperly charged sales tax on the automatic gratuities; and those amounts should be refunded by Defendants to diners like Plaintiff as compensatory relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67-74). Defendants argue the claim ignores the Rule's prescription that \"service charges\" like those added to Plaintiff's bill \"are subject to tax.\" (Mot. 17 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Fla. Admin. Code r. 12 A-1.0115(7)(c) ) ). Moreover, they argue under the Federal Tax Injunction Act, \"district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In this regard, Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Penzer v.

Fla. 2004), where the court remanded the action to state court after it determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction given the suit, which alleged the defendants improperly collected state sales taxes at the end of the plaintiffs' automobile leases, implicated the State's ability to assess and collect taxes and the defendants had a remedy in state court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 17; Reply 9). The court was able to find a \"plain, speedy and efficient remedy\" in state court, because prior to removal of the action, the defendants' motion to compel arbitration was already pending in state court, and but for the defendants' removal, could have provided the defendants with the adequate arbitration remedy they were seeking.\n   <em>\n    Penzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9235634\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/319/1351/#p1354\">\n    319 F.Supp.2d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff does not address\n   <em>\n    Penzer\n   </em>\n   directly in his Response. Yet, he does argue Defendants have failed to show he may obtain the refund remedy he seeks in state court, and in fact, he plainly alleges there is no such remedy available to him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 17 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6 73) ). He also states at least one court has found a party aggrieved by a defendant restaurant's illegal application of tax to delivery fees must seek a refund directly from the restaurant, and not the Florida Department of Revenue, and therefore had no administrative remedy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Schojan v.

In\n   <em>\n    Schojan\n   </em>\n   , the court agreed with the plaintiffs there was no administrative remedy they could pursue with the Florida Department of Revenue to recover allegedly illegal sales taxes paid on delivery fees, as the refund remedy was only available to company-owned restaurants that collected the illegal tax and paid it to the Department.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327957\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/34/1206/#p1212\">\n    34 F.Supp.3d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Resp. 17 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). Rather, he is seeking a refund from Defendants for historically collecting too much, which amounts should be refunded as damages to diners.

To this, Defendants again insist Plaintiff does not make out a violation of the Rule, for while he focuses on tips and gratuities, \"service charges\" are subject to state sales tax. (Reply 10 (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court is not persuaded Defendants have shown the Federal Tax Injunction Act bars Count III's request for a refund. Count III does not seek a court order enjoining, suspending or restraining the assessment of any tax under State law, and Defendants have not shown the availability of a \"plain, speedy, and efficient remedy\" elsewhere.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
