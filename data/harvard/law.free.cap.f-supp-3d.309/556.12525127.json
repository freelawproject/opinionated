Presently before the Court is the Port District's Motion to Dismiss Counts II, III, and VIII of Clean Harbors' Third Amended Complaint. For the reasons explained below, the Port District's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves contaminated property located at 11700 and 11800 South Stony Island in Chicago, Illinois (the \"property\"). R. 108 \u00b6 1. The Port District has owned the property since 1955. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Port District began to construct piers on the property with fill materials consisting of industrial waste, construction debris, natural material, and a mixture of soil, steel industry wastes, and pea-sized gravel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also in the 1970s, the Port District leased the property to a now-dissolved company, Hyon Waste Management Services, Inc.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hyon Waste operated a series of surface impoundments\n   at the property for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes and disposed of tens of millions of gallons of waste. Clean Harbors alleges that the Port District, as the owner of the property, knew or reasonably should have known of Hyon Waste's contamination but did nothing to abate the contamination or hold Hyon Waste accountable for the contamination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in the 1980s, the Port District leased the property to two different companies, ChemClear, Inc. and CMW Chemical Services, Inc., both of which Clean Harbors later acquired. (Throughout this Order, the Court refers to Clean Harbors and these companies collectively as \"Clean Harbors.\") Clean Harbors operated a waste processing facility at the property that processed hazardous wastes for disposal or recycling at offsite locations. Clean Harbors and the Port District are co-permittees on permits issued by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (\"IEPA\"). One such permit is a RCRA Part B permit, which was originally issued on November 4, 2005 and expired on December 9, 2015 (the \"Permit\"). The IEPA renewed the Permit effective September 6, 2017. R. 108 \u00b6 197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The IEPA eventually directed the Port District and Clean Harbors to conduct a RCRA facility investigation of the property. The parties performed the investigation and discovered contamination primarily related to Hyon Waste's operations in the 1970s. R. 108 \u00b6\u00b6 89-99. Clean Harbors incurred substantial costs to conduct the investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Port District and Clean Harbors subsequently worked with the IEPA to develop a corrective action plan to address the contamination (known as the \"Cap and Drain Plan\"). IEPA gave its final approval for the plan in 2011.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The IEPA's plan required that an existing cover at the property remain in place as an engineered barrier, required the construction of a french drain, and required future groundwater monitoring at the property. The Plan is projected to cost $5.75 million in construction costs and an additional $ 2.15 million in monitoring costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, Clean Harbors provided notice of its intent to terminate its leases on the property and identified issues related to the Cap and Drain Plan that needed to be resolved as part of its winding down of operations at the property. R. 108 \u00b6\u00b6 130-131. Two weeks after Clean Harbors gave notice of its intent to terminate the leases, the Port District wrote to the IEPA stating it had not approved the Cap and Drain Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Later in 2012, the Port District demanded that Clean Harbors remove the engineered barrier discussed in the Plan, demanded it construct a truck yard on the property, and refused to grant it access to the property to remove certain improvements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 140-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, Clean Harbors alleges the Port District overcharged it quarterly rent payments from 2010 through 2012 totaling $315,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    \u00b6 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 19, 2013, Clean Harbors provided written notice to the Port District, the IEPA, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") of its intent to file a RCRA citizen suit against the Port District pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The notice letter accused the Port District of violating the parties' IEPA permit by refusing to implement the Cap and Drain Plan, refusing to take financial responsibility for its share of the clean-up under the Plan, refusing to execute documents to allow for the closure of RCRA units (through Clean Harbors) at the property, and by demanding that the engineered barrier be removed in violation of the Cap\n   and Drain Plan. R. 108-5 at 20-21. The notice letter also accused the Port District of violating the RCRA's endangerment provision (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) ) as the owner of the contaminated property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2013, the Court stayed the case to allow the IEPA to approve Phase II of the Cap and Drain Plan. R. 65. In January 2017, the Court resumed proceedings. R. 98. Clean Harbors subsequently filed its Third Amended Complaint (\"TAC\") on October 10, 2017. R. 108. At issue in this dispute are Counts II, III, and VIII. In Count II of the TAC, Clean Harbors asserts a cause of action under the endangerment citizen suit provision of the RCRA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). In Count III, Clean Harbors brings a citizen suit claim to abate RCRA permit violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Both counts allege Clean Harbors provided pre-suit notice to the Port District on February 19, 2013. R. 108 \u00b6\u00b6 186, 215. In Count VIII, Clean Harbors alleges the Port District was unjustly enriched after it refused to return rent overpayments Clean Harbors made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 \u00b6 237-244.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 31, 2017, the Port District filed a motion to dismiss Counts II, III, and VIII of the TAC under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). As to the RCRA claims, the Port District argues Clean Harbors (1) failed to allege any facts showing it has an \"injury in fact\" to demonstrate standing under Article III of the Constitution; (2) failed to provide adequate pre-suit notice; and (3) failed to sufficiently allege RCRA violations under each provision. The Port District argues that Count VIII should be dismissed because Clean Harbors improperly bases its unjust enrichment claim on an express written contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(6) motion challenges the sufficiency of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hallinan v.

But Article III does not require nor bar specific injuries. Instead, it requires only that a plaintiff show it has an injury that is \"concrete and particularized\" enough to move beyond the world of individuals with only \"generalized grievances.\" According to these standards, Clean Harbors has sufficiently alleged an injury in fact-it alleges it has incurred substantial costs due to the previous contamination of the property and continues to be injured due to the Port District's actions in violation of the Cap and Drain Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 108 \u00b6\u00b6 86, 184-185, 198-216.

In\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   , because the plaintiff no longer had an interest in the property when he brought suit, neither an injunction to abate pollution nor civil penalties to deter pollution would have redressed his injuries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951232\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/372/288/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951232\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/372/288/\">\n    at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff's only possible redress was monetary damages in the form of past cleanup costs, which are not recoverable under the RCRA. Because the plaintiff's injuries could not be redressed, he had not pled an injury to confer standing under Article III. Here, however, Clean Harbors does not seek to recover its economic damages through its RCRA claims. Instead, because it is a co-permittee who alleges it will continue to suffer injury if the Port District is not enjoined, its injuries will be redressed by injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p181\">\n    528 U.S. at 185-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p181\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It can scarcely be doubted that, for a plaintiff who is injured or faces the threat of future injury due to illegal conduct ongoing at the time of suit, a sanction that effectively abates that conduct and prevents its recurrence provides a form of redress.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Consequently, the Court concludes that Clean Harbors has established a basis for constitutional standing, and the Port District's motion to dismiss on that issue is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Port District entered into a lease with one of its tenants, Hyon Waste, in the 1970s. As the Port District's tenant, Hyon Waste received approximately 68 million gallons of chemical waste and treated the waste in the ground on the Property. The Port District also allowed Hyon Waste to deposit the byproducts of this waste treatment on other portions of the Property, thereby contributing to the pollution at the Property. Moreover, as the Port District's tenant, Hyon Waste, received \"pickle liquor\" or steel mill waste at the Property and the Port District allowed Hyon Waste to bury the \"pickle liquor\" in the ground at the Property. Further, while a tenant at the Property, Hyon Waste operated an incinerator illegally, causing the City of Chicago, Department of Environment to shut it down. The Port District benefitted financially from Hyon Waste's contamination of the Property and took no apparent action to abate the environmental contamination caused by Hyon Waste.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Through a joint RCRA facilities investigation, the Port District and Clean Harbors have demonstrated that Hyon Waste is a primary cause for the Work Plan at the Property. The Port District and Clean Harbors have identified the historical pollution at the Facility. The Port District was involved in the storage or disposal of the hazardous waste at the Property because it served as the landlord for the Property for Hyon Waste's historical pollution and contamination of the Property. The Port District failed to exercise the degree of care necessary for an owner with respect to Hyon Waste's pollution on the Property. These facts, together with the Port District's lack of cooperation with Clean Harbors and the IEPA to abate the historical contamination at the Property, its failure to implement the Work Plan and its failure to contribute its fair share of the clean-up costs presents a substantial endangerment to health and the environment.
