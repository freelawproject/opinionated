For the following reasons, this petition is transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p><p id=\"p-10\">The Clerk of Court is directed to assign this matter to my docket and to mail a copy of this order to Petitioner. The Clerk of Court is further directed to transfer this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Whether Petitioner should be permitted to proceed further without payment of fees is a determination to be made by the transferee court.
