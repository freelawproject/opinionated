Mr. Twede alleges that he \"uses a powerchair and modified van with a ramp for transportation.\" (Compl. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 10.) Mr. Long and Ms. Williams both allege that they \"use[ ] a manual wheelchair for transportation.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 17, 24.) All three Plaintiffs allege they \"require[ ] accessible parking and an accessible route to patronize places of public accommodation, such as the parking lots and facilities operated by [UW].\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15, 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 19, 17, 24.) In their complaint, Plaintiffs allege that \"the vast majority of the parking lots\" at UW \"are not in compliance with the 1991 ADA standards and 2010 ADA standards.\" (Compl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 6.) Plaintiffs' complaint attaches 60 pages of exhibits which allegedly inventory problems with nearly every parking lot, such as the number of accessible and van accessible parking spots, the size and slope of the parking spaces and access aisles, and the presence, absence, or height of parking signage. (Compl. Exs. A-E;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC Exs. A-E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC.) Plaintiffs' first amended complaint reiterates the parking lot allegations but adds new allegations that the parking lots and structures contain \"accessible routes\" to certain unidentified building entrances that \"do not comply with 1991 and 2010 ADA standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The first amended complaint also alleges that the parking lots contain \"other forms of ADA non-compliance,\" including \"inaccessible pay kiosks, insufficient/unsafe accessible routes, including ramps, curb ramps, paths of travel, and signage barriers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, the first amended complaint alleges that UW violates the ADA by not ticketing vehicles parked in accessible spots which lack a disabled parking permit, and by issuing disabled parking permits to persons who do not have \"state-issued disabled parking placards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 54-55.) Like Plaintiffs' original complaint, the first amended complaint raises claims under Title II of the ADA, the RA, and the WLAD (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-85) and seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 VII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Twede alleges that he regularly travels to UW Medical Center and \"encounter[s] a number of barriers to access\" at the \" 'Triangle' (C20 and C21) and 'Surgery\n   Pavillion' (UMSP) parking lots,\" which are located near the UW Medical Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.) He alleges that he has \"patronized these parking lots in the past and intends to do so in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) He does not allege that he has visited or attempted to visit any of the other 86 UW parking lots mentioned in the first amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) He asserts, however, that he \"has knowledge of ... accessibility barriers at each [UW] campus parking facility alleged in [the first amended] complaint and exhibits which he has either encountered personally or is specifically aware of.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Similar to Mr. Twede, Ms. Williams alleges that she \"has encountered a number of barriers to access\" at the \"N22\" and \"W35\" parking lots, which are \"popular places to park for students attending classes and civic, social, and entertainment events at UW.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.) She alleges that she has \"patronized these parking lots in the past and intends to continue to do so in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) She does not claim to have visited or attempted to visit any of the other 86 UW parking lots mentioned in the first amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Like Mr. Twede, she asserts that she \"has knowledge of ... accessibility barriers at each [UW] campus parking facility alleged in [the first amended] complaint and exhibits which she has either encountered personally or is specifically aware of.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Finally, she alleges that \"she is and will continue to be dissuaded from using these other UW parking facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Long alleges that he regularly travels to UW for Spinal Cord Injury Forum meetings, medical appointments, speaking engagements, business meetings, social activities, and sporting events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Mr. Long alleges that he has patronized 32 parking lots at UW\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and intends to do so in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21.) Unlike the other two Plaintiffs, Mr. Long does not say that he has personally encountered any barriers to access at any of UW's parking facilities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 17-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Instead, he alleges generally that he \"has knowledge of ... accessibility barriers at each [UW] parking facility alleged in [the first amended] complaint and exhibits which he has either encountered personally or of which he is specifically aware.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Finally, he claims that because of his knowledge he \"will continue to be dissuaded from using these other UW parking facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

For example, Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Twede \"regularly travels to ... the [UW] Medical Center,\" which \"is frequently visited by numerous patients annually for medical treatment,\" and that he parks in the C20 and C21 parking lots \"due to their convenient location near the ... Medical Center.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 15.) Similarly, Ms. Williams is a sophomore at UW who \"regularly travels to UW for classes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) She patronizes the N22 and W35 parking lots, which \"are popular places for students attending classes and civic, social, and entertainment events at UW.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 29.) Likewise, Mr. Long \"regularly travels to UW ... for Spinal Cord Injury Forum meetings, medical appointments, speaking engagements, business meetings, social activities, and sporting events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) He patronizes various parking lots at UW \"due to their convenient location near [UW]\" and because they \"are popular places to park for medical appointments and civic, social, business, and sporting events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Thus, even Plaintiffs' own allegations support the conclusion that they utilize the parking facilities at issue as \"incidental\" to their access of UW's various educational, medical, civic, social, sporting, and other programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149580\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/982/#p985\">\n    760 F.3d at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Nevertheless, even if UW's parking lots represent \"a service, program, or activity\" of UW,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.150\">\n    28 C.F.

Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to show that it is plausible that they have been denied \"meaningful access\" to parking at UW when UW's \"parking service\" is considered in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations relate to particular deficiencies in individual parking lots or facilities. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FAC.) There are no specific (or even general) allegations about the accessibility of UW's alleged parking services as a whole or in its entirety. Such allegations are necessary to determine if Plaintiffs have a plausible claim that UW has denied Plaintiffs meaningful access to its alleged parking services. Indeed, individual, noncompliant elements of a program or service are not necessarily relevant to whether a program-in its entirety-violates that ADA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149580\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/982/#p985\">\n    760 F.3d at 986-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (inaccessible bleachers at a football field did not render school's football program in violation of the ADA when disabled patrons could watch the game from satisfactory alternate locations). Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to show that it is plausible that they have been excluded or denied \"meaningful access\" to UW's alleged parking services when those services are viewed in their entirety. Accordingly, the court grants this aspect of UW's motion and dismisses Plaintiffs' claims for a programmatic access violation of the ADA for parking facilities built before and not modified since January 26, 1992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Parking Facilities Built after January 26, 1992\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiffs allege \"[o]n information and belief\" that \"the parking facilities operated by ... UW were either constructed or altered after January 26, 1992.\" (FAC \u00b6 40.) Facilities newly built or altered after January 26, 1992, are subject to more specific requirements, but the requirements for facilities constructed or altered after January 26, 1992, differ \"depending on the date each facility was last altered.\" (MTD at 10.) For example, physical construction or alterations commenced after July 26, 1992, but prior to September 15, 2010, must comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (\"UFAS\") or the 1991 Standards for Accessible Design (\"1991 Standards\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.151\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Physical construction or alterations commenced after September 15, 2010, but before March 15, 2012, must meet either the 1991 Standards, the UFAS, or the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (\"2010 Standards\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.151\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

The information that UW argues that Plaintiffs must plead concerning the dates of construction or alteration to UW's parking facilities is likely to be in UW's possession. \"Where a plaintiff is at an informational disadvantage-where the information necessary to plead with greater specificity is in the possession of the defendant-courts give plaintiffs 'some benefit of the doubt to go along with the\n   specific facts it has pled.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hamblen v.

Thus, to the extent these allegedly noncompliant features and their locations are identified in the exhibits to Plaintiffs' first amended complaint, UW's motion is denied. However, the court grants UW's motion and dismisses Plaintiffs' claims concerning the allegedly noncompliant features that are not identified in the first amended complaint's exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Leave to Amend the First Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs ask the court for leave to amend their first amended complaint. (Resp. at 23-24.) The standard for granting leave to amend is generous-the court \"should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). In determining whether leave to amend is appropriate, a court must consider the following five factors: (1) bad faith, (2) undue delay, (3) whether the plaintiff previously amended the complaint, (4) prejudice to the opposing party, and (5) futility of amendment.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Corinthian Colleges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829163\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/984/#p995\">\n    655 F.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 995 (9th Cir. 2011). Here, the court denies Plaintiffs leave to amend their first amended complaint for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, granting leave to amend would cause undue delay in the proceedings and would be prejudicial. The discovery cutoff in this case was February 6, 2018. (12/15/17 Order (Dkt. # 43) (extending discovery cutoff from 1/22/2018 to 2/6/18).) Dispositive motions are presently due on February 20, 2018, and trial will commence on May 21, 2018. (Sched. Order (Dkt. # 15) at 1.) The court previously granted Plaintiffs leave to amend their allegations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTA (Dkt. # 20); Min. Entry (Dkt. # 29) (granting motion to amend).) Allowing Plaintiffs to further amend their first amended complaint at this late date and on the eve of the dispositive motions deadline would force the court to delay these proceedings. To avoid prejudice, the court would be required to reopen discovery and postpone both the dispositive motions deadline and trial. Accordingly, the court is disinclined to grant leave to amend under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solomon v. N. Am. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715749\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1132/#p1139\">\n    151 F.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (9th Cir. 1998) (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend where allowing the amendment \"would have required re-opening\n   discovery, thus delaying the proceedings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In addition, it would be futile for the court to grant Plaintiffs leave to amend their claims concerning the 51 parking facilities that they have not visited. The court has ruled as a matter of law that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert ADA violations with respect to these parking lots. The court's ruling rests on the absence of allegations suggesting that Plaintiffs are likely to visit, have any intention or desire to visit, or will incur harm at any of the 51 parking facilities that they have not visited.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.2. Allowing Plaintiffs to amend to so allege now would be inconsistent with both Plaintiffs' original and first amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reddy v. Litton Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044909\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/912/291/#p296\">\n    912 F.2d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296-97 (9th Cir. 1990) (\"Although leave to amend should be liberally granted, the amended complaint may only allege 'other facts consistent with the challenged pleading.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schreiber Distrib.

The court has ruled as a matter of law that these facilities do not constitute a service or program that falls within the confines of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.150\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.2.

Thus, the court denies leave to amend these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, the court also denies Plaintiffs leave to amend the new allegations added to their first amended complaint concerning accessibility routes, entrances, kiosks, and signage.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.4. Plaintiffs added these allegations after the court granted their motion to amend their original complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTA; Min. Entry.) With their original complaint, Plaintiffs filed five exhibits providing descriptions and pictures of alleged ADA violations throughout the UW parking lots at issue in their complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Exs. A-E.) Plaintiffs did not amend these exhibits when they amended their complaint, but rather attached the same exhibits to their first amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC Exs. A-E.) As Plaintiffs acknowledge in their response to UW's motion to dismiss, these exhibits \"identify accessible route, signage, and kiosk violations.\" (Resp. at 23.) Plaintiffs had the opportunity to amend these exhibits to identify additional alleged violations with respect to these issues when they filed their first amended complaint, but they chose not to do so. Because Plaintiffs have already had the opportunity to amend their complaint concerning these claims, the court declines to grant them an additional opportunity now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cafasso, U.S. ex rel. v.
