(ECF No. 112, 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 3, 2015, the San Diego Unified Port District (\"Port District\") filed a First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") against Defendants Monsanto Company, Pharmacia Corporation, and Solutia, Inc. (\"Monsanto\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 25). The Port District alleged causes of action for public nuisance, equitable indemnity, and purpresture against Monsanto relating to PCB contamination of the San Diego Bay (\"the Bay\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Port District seeks to recover compensatory damages for \"past and future costs and expenses related to the investigation, remediation, and removal of PCBs from in and around the Bay, loss of the use of portions of the Bay, and diminution in value of real property in and around the Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. The Port District also seeks a judicial determination that Monsanto is liable for any and all future costs related to the investigation, remediation, and removal of PCBs from in and around the Bay, \"[a]n order that Defendants pay for establishment of a fund used by Plaintiff Port District to abate the public nuisance created by the presence of PCBs in and around the Bay,\" \"[a]n order that Defendants abate the purpresture created by the presence of PCBs in the Bay,\" and \"[c]ompensatory damages to Plaintiff Port District for the injury to and loss of use of natural resources deriving from the presence of PCBs in and around the Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. The Port District further requests punitive and exemplary damages, litigation costs and attorney's fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and any other relief deemed proper by the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 28, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss the FAC filed by Monsanto. The Court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to equitable indemnity and denied the motion to dismiss with respect to public nuisance and purpresture. (ECF No. 81). The Court denied the motion to dismiss the public nuisance claim based on the Port District's allegations that Monsanto had, despite knowing the health and environmental risks associated with PCBs, continued to promote the use and sale of PCBs and had instructed its users to dispose of PCB in landfills, knowing that landfills were not suitable for PCB contaminated waste.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 14, 2017, Monsanto filed a First Amended Answer and Counterclaim. (ECF No. 110). Monsanto asserts that it is not responsible for costs of remediating PCB contamination in the Bay and that the Port District should instead bear the responsibility for \"taking and funding the actions necessary to address\" PCB contamination of the Bay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Monsanto seeks to\n   hold the Port District liable for allegedly discharging and failing to prevent the discharge of PCBs into the Bay. The First Amended Answer and Counterclaim raises 85 affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-47. The First Amended Answer and Counterclaim brings the following causes of action against the Port District: (1) cost recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"); (2) federal declaratory relief under CERCLA and the Declaratory Judgment Act; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) contribution under state law; (5) violations of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") and the Port District's NPDES Permit; (6) contribution and/or indemnity under the California Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substances Account Act (\"HSAA\"); (7) declaratory relief under the HSAA; (8) negligence; (9) negligence per se; (10) purpresture; and (11) violations of the public trust doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 12, 2017, the Port District filed a motion to strike affirmative defenses and a motion to dismiss the counterclaims. (ECF Nos. 112, 113). On June 12, 2017, Monsanto filed responses in opposition. (ECF Nos. 122, 123). On June 23, 2017, the Port District filed replies. (ECF Nos. 125, 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 23, 2017, the Port District filed a request for judicial notice in support of the motion to dismiss the counterclaims. (ECF No. 127). The Port District requests that the Court take judicial notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 201 of an \"Excerpt from Monsanto Company's Form 10-K Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act for the fiscal year ended on August 31, 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 19, 2017, Monsanto filed an objection to the request for judicial notice on the grounds that the document has \"no bearing on the resolution\" of the motion to dismiss or the First Amended Answer and Counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 129 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ALLEGATIONS OF THE FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[T]he Port District holds the state-owned tidelands in trust for the people of the State of California for approximately one-third of the Bay.\" (Counterclaim, ECF No. 110 at \u00b6 33). \"The Port District has, from 1962 through the present, discharged or caused to be discharged, a variety of pollutants into the Bay, including PCBs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. \"[S]ources of the Port District's discharges include its (1) inadequate maintenance of sites under its control, (2) inadequate supervision of its lessees, (3) use of PCB containing products, (4) failure to follow best management practices with regard to construction and demolition activities, and (5) storm water discharges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The Port District leases tidelands to \"industrial dischargers ... despite its awareness of the lessees' discharges to the entire Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. \"The Port District has at all relevant times had the obligation and ability under its lease agreements to impose controls that could prevent or reduce such discharges, but it failed to do so....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The Regional Board\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   has repeatedly held that the Port District has caused or permitted wastes to be discharged or deposited where they were discharged into the Bay through its trusteeship of the tidelands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. \"The Port\n   District has ... contributed to contamination in the Bay during periods where its tenants were insolvent or abandoned operations on the tidelands, and the Port District permitted the properties to fall into disrepair. By neglecting maintenance of those buildings, the Port District caused extensive discharges of pollutants into the Bay....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. \"In addition to discharging contaminated wastewater and storm water that contain pollutants, including PCBs, the Port District and its tenants at all relevant times through today have purchased, used, and disposed of various PCB-containing products....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Port District's discharges of PCBs and other pollutants have caused Defendants/Counter-Claimants to incur response and defense costs and have also created significant contingent liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. This contingent liability \"may arise\" from the instant lawsuit, including the complaint by the City of San Diego, and \"potential future, federal, state or local regulatory actions that could impose costs on Defendants/Counter-Claimants to clean up the Port District's discharges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"This contingent liability continually expands with every discharge of PCBs by the Port District-which continues to the present day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"As a result of the Port District's discharges\" Monsanto has incurred and \"will continue to incur response costs as the investigation proceeds, including potentially regulatory, litigation, and other response costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Monsanto's \"response costs in connection with the investigation and cleanup processes for San Diego Bay\" include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) identification and analysis of historic and current sources of potential contamination and potentially responsible parties (including in particular the Port District) (\"PRPs\") for the Bay, including public records review, analysis of existing data, research on the conveyance and drainage systems, assessment of current and historic source control efforts at various Bay site locations, and investigatory costs to identify the volume and location of the PCBs discharged by the Port District; (2) analysis of the potential impacts on the Bay from Non-Monsanto Produced PCBs, and potential sources of those Non-Monsanto Produced PCBs; (3) review and analysis of sampling and investigation data from the Bay, and investigation of potential data gaps; (4) investigation and analysis of the contaminated sediments at certain locations in the Bay; (5) analysis of the potential source control and remediation options for the Bay; (6) analysis of PCBs in the Bay to assist with identification of the sources of current and historic PCB contamination; and (7) numerous other activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. These costs are \"directed to assessing, evaluating and monitoring releases of hazardous substances, including PCBs, in the Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101. Monsanto has \"incurred response costs that would be necessary even in the absence of the present suit\" and are \"a necessary predicate for cleanup efforts, since identifying sources of PCB discharges and the locations of the resulting PCB deposits are requisite first steps to any cleanup.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102. \"Additionally, the Port District's discharges and releases made incurrence of response costs necessary both due to the Port District's lawsuit and also to address other potential sources of contingent liability created by the Port District's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Monsanto has \"incurred costs in defending the instant lawsuit\" because this lawsuit \"likely would never have been brought but for the Port District's discharges of PCBs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. The Port District's actions have caused Monsanto \"to expend additional costs as a result of this increased\n   exposure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106. Monsanto has \"incurred legal and other costs pertaining to the present suit as well as the consolidated suit filed by the City of San Diego, which are actually attributable to and caused by the Port District's own discharges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Monsanto seeks in part \"a judicial determination under CERCLA and the federal Declaratory Judgment Act that the Port District is liable for past and future response costs and damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness' fees, oversight costs, and interest incurred by Defendants/Counter-Claimants to investigate, remediate, and/or restore the Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. MOTION TO STRIKE (ECF No. 112)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its First Amended Answer and Counterclaim, Monsanto pleads 85 affirmative defenses. The Port District contends that the Court should dismiss a number of these defenses pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) because they are immaterial, redundant, or not affirmative defenses. The Port District contends that the CERCLA and HSAA affirmative defenses are immaterial because no party has brought a CERCLA or HSAA claim against Monsanto. The Port District contends that a number of the defenses raised are non-affirmative defenses because they attack elements of prima facie claims or assert a lack of standing. The Port District contends that other defenses should be stricken as redundant. The Port District contends that it will be prejudiced if the Court does not grant this motion because the challenged defenses complicate discovery, confuse the jury as to the legal issues at stake, and result in a waste of judicial resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Monsanto contends that its CERCLA and HSAA defenses are material because they are related to the Port District's \"repeated demands for Natural Resources Damages ('NRD') and cleanup costs.\" (ECF No. 122 at 6). Monsanto contends that the response costs the Port District asserts as damages in this action \"squarely implicate cost allocation and contribution concerns typically reserved for CERCLA and HSAA actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Monsanto contends that any damages awarded to the Port District must account for the Port District's responsibility for contaminating the Bay through its storm water and sewer conveyance system discharges. Monsanto contends that the Port District's demands for recovery are available only to the extent authorized by CERCLA and HSAA. Monsanto asserts that its 64th affirmative defense is unrelated to CERCLA or the HSAA. Monsanto contends that its defenses are not redundant and that the Port District mischaracterizes the defenses as non-affirmative. Further, Monsanto contends that the Court should treat any non-affirmative defense as a specific denial rather than strike the defense. Monsanto contends that the Port District cannot demonstrate that any prejudice would result from allowing the challenged affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A motion to strike an affirmative defense is allowable under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). Rule 12(f) provides that \"a court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). \"The function of a 12(f) motion to strike is to avoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial....\"\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone, Inc. v.

Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Port District contends that Monsanto fails to establish standing under Article III with respect to any of its counterclaims and the Court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaims. The Port District contends that Monsanto's \" 'response costs' resulting from its defense-minded investigations and analyses of contamination in the Bay and its efforts to identify other parties who may be held responsible for the eventual cleanup\" are litigation costs that cannot establish Article III injury-in-fact. (ECF No. 113-1 at 17). The Port District contends that Monsanto launched its own investigations and analyses for the purpose of defending itself in this litigation. The Port District contends that Monsanto's legal expenses in this suit are not recoverable under the American Rule. The Port District contends that Monsanto cannot satisfy Article III standing requirements through its allegations of contingent liability because Monsanto had not established a genuine threat of future harm at the time the counterclaims were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Monsanto asserts that as a result of the Port District's discharges into the Bay, Monsanto has \"incurred multiple forms of economic harm sufficient to confer standing, including past, present, and future response costs in connection with, among other things, investigating San Diego Bay.\" (ECF No. 123 at 19-20). Monsanto contends that its defense and litigation costs constitute an injury-in-fact because the Port District's discharges are a \"substantial cause of contamination in the Bay, and therefore a cause of this litigation and defense costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Monsanto contends that a party may rely on litigation-related costs to establish injury-in-fact for purposes of a counterclaim because \"defendants are hauled into court against their will and suffer involuntary, concrete economic\n   harm as a result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Monsanto contends that it may recover litigation costs in connection with the CWA claim. Further, Monsanto contends that its contingent liability satisfies Article III standing requirements. Monsanto contends that contingent liability exists because the Port District continues to discharge PCBs into the Bay, while seeking to hold Monsanto legally responsible for the presence of PCBs in the Bay. Monsanto contends that this potential liability constitutes \"a present or threatened harm that is not speculative\" due to the City's separate claim seeking damages related to the Bay and further litigation by other San Diego Bay dischargers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Article III standing doctrine limits federal court jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v.
