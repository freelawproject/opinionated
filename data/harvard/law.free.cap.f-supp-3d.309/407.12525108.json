Based on the undisputed facts, and for the reasons stated below, the emails at issue were not \"in electronic storage\" for the purposes of the Stored Communications Act and defendant's accessing those emails did not therefore violate the Stored Communications Act as a matter of law. Accordingly, plaintiff Hately's Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 66] is DENIED, defendant Watts' Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc.

By contrast, the SCA provides that a \"remote computing service,\" or \"RCS,\" is \"the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system.\" \u00a7 2711(2).

Once opened, and thereby downloaded, they are no longer in \"temporary, intermediate storage ... incidental to the[ir] electronic transmission[.]\" Instead, their transmission is complete and only copies stored by the \"electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection\" under paragraph (B) are \"in electronic storage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The only evidence in the record of what Watts accessed is that Watts did not open or view any email from the Email Account that was unopened, marked as unread, previously deleted, or in the Email Account's \"trash\" folder, and that Watts did not change the status of, or modify, any email from the Email Account in any way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp., SOF \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43. Although he has not produced any contrary evidence, Hately contends that these assertions are based solely on Watts' \"self-serving statements and characterizations,\" which cannot constitute undisputed evidence of what Watts did or did not access for the purposes of summary judgment. He also contends that, in any event, \"the status of Plaintiffs' emails\" and \"whether or not defendant changed any emails [are] immaterial.\" Pl.'s Resp. 11-12. But as discussed above, the status of Hately's emails at the time they were accessed by Watts is central to determining whether they were \"in electronic storage.\" Nor is Hately's evidentiary challenge sufficient to defeat Watts' summary judgment motion. Once Watts challenged the factual basis for Hately's SCA claim, Hately had the affirmative burden to produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Watts opened a previously unopened or unread email or one that had not been previously downloaded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"... Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment ... against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"). Hately has proffered only speculation and not any facts that would allow a reasonable fact finder to make the required findings. Based on this record, Hately has failed to establish as a matter of law that Watts accessed emails \"in electronic storage\" under \u00a7 2510(17)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23. Based on these undisputed facts, the emails Watts accessed were \"service copies,\" that is, copies of an email immediately accessible to the user by logging in to the email client, rather than the backup \"storage copies\" maintained by VCCS, which are available only upon special request. The issue therefore reduces to whether these service copies of delivered and previously opened emails are \"in electronic storage\" under \u00a7 2510(17)(B).

Rev. 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1217 (2004) (\"[T]he Ninth Circuit's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Theofel\n   </em>\n   is quite implausible and hard to square with the statutory text.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The SCA does not define when an email is \"stored for the purposes of backup protection.\" Nor has the Fourth Circuit or Supreme Court explained what it means. The Court must therefore undertake that task based on standard rules of construction. Based on the plain and ordinary meaning of the text and also the structure of the SCA, the Court concludes that the \"backups\" in paragraph (B) are most logically and reasonably read as referring only to backups of the transitory communications described in paragraph (A), created\n   and stored separate and apart from the copies maintained to facilitate continuing access by the user through his account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court of South Carolina summarized the scope of \u00a7 2510(17), \"electronic storage refers only to temporary storage, made in the course of transmission, by an ECS provider [per paragraph (A) ], and to backups of such intermediate communications[,]\" per paragraph (B).\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885670\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/401/1/\">\n    401 S.C. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885670\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/401/1/\">\n    736 S.E.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (2012) (Toal, C.J., concurring in the result) (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Read this way, \"such communication\" in \u00a7 2510(17)(B) refers to communication \"temporar[ily and] intermediate[ly]\" stored \"incidental to the electronic transmission thereof,\" as described in (A). Under this view of the SCA, once an email has been delivered and opened, its transmission is complete, the ECS is no longer storing it \"incident to transmission\" and therefore it is not in \"electronic storage\" for the purposes of \u00a7 2510(17)(A). A service copy maintained to be available to the user until the user deletes the message is neither a \"copy of\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   \" communication, nor is it maintained by the ECS for backup protection. Instead, paragraph (B) refers to a copy of a communication, made by the ECS while the communication was in transit, and stored by the ECS for its own backup or administrative purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even if the service copies at issue here were copies of temporary versions of the emails stored by VCCS \"for the purposes of backup protection,\" they would still not be \"in electronic storage\" under \u00a7 2510(17)(B) because VCCS was not acting as an ECS with respect to those service copies. VCCS was maintaining those service copies of delivered and opened email for the purposes of transmitting them to a single user's account upon that user's command. In doing so, VCCS was not at that point in time acting as an ECS since it was not \"provid[ing] to users ... the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications.\" \u00a7 2510(15). Instead, it was providing \"computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system,\" \u00a7 2711(2), and therefore was acting as an RCS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DoubleClick Inc.

Because paragraph (B)'s definition is limited to \"storage of ... communication by an electronic communication service,\" it cannot reach the service copies at issue here because they were being stored by VCCS acting as an RCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As courts and commentators have noted, the statutory definition of \"electronic storage\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   is much narrower than the name suggests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anzaldua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277796\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/822/#p839\">\n    793 F.3d at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The SCA is not a catch-all statute designed to protect the privacy of stored communications; instead, it is narrowly tailored to provide a set of Fourth Amendment-like protections for computer networks.\" Kerr,\n   <em>\n    A User's Guide\n   </em>\n   , at 1214,\n   <em>\n    quoted in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anzaldua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277796\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/822/#p839\">\n    793 F.3d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the above reasons, Hately has also failed to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Watts' access to the Email Account involved emails that were \"in electronic storage\" under \u00a7 2510(17)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the above reasons, there are no genuine issue of material facts; and based on those undisputed facts, plaintiff Hately is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and defendant Watts is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to plaintiff's claim in Count II for a violation of the Stored Communications Act.
