The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the motion, oral argument heard on 8 February 2018, and the file herein.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  The Plaintiff, Union Pacific Railroad Company (\"Union Pacific\"), filed this case to determine whether the portions of Washington law that purport to regulate hours of service, rest periods and/or other breaks apply to railroad employees (collectively referred to as \"breaks\" for purposes of this order). Dkt. 1. The Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries (\"Department\"), through its director, Defendant Joel Sacks, has now filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that Union Pacific lacks standing to bring this case and the Department has taken no enforcement action against Union Pacific and has no past or pending complaints against it (or any other railroad) regarding breaks and so, the questions raised in this case are not ripe for judicial review. Dkt. 8. For the reasons provided below, the motion (Dkt. 8) should be granted.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

On May 9, 2017, BNSF Railway Company, with Union Pacific's \"cooperation and approval\" (Dkt. 24, at 2), sent the Department a Washington Public Records Act request, seeking documents, advice, opinions, and correspondence \"as to the applicability of Washington meal break or rest break time rules to railroads or railroad employees,\" regarding the \"applicability of Washington meal break or rest break time rules to railroads or railroad employees who have entered into a collective bargaining agreement,\" \"non-privileged internal memoranda or opinions as to the relationship between the federal Hours of Service Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2021101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 21101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 21109, and Washington maximum hours of work, overtime, rest break time, or meal time rules,\" and \"[a]ny documents relating to investigations or enforcement actions against interstate railroads related to Washington meal break or rest break time rules to railroads or railroad employees\" (Dkt. 24-1, at 2-3). Union Pacific states that the Department \"produced a number of responsive documents,\" including the above November 2, 2016 email from a Union Pacific employee and the Department's response. Dkt. 24, at 2. The Department has also produced an August 1, 2017 email to the Department from attorney India Bodien which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I was hoping you might provide some guidance regarding L &amp; I's authority to promulgate and enforce regulations that cover railroad employees. Specifically, I am trying to figure out whether WAC 296-126-092 (4) would apply to railroad employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   From what I have found so far, it looks like railroads are not excluded from L &amp; I's rule making power. RCW 43.22.270 (4) states that: \"The director of Labor and Industries shall have the power, and it shall be the director's duty ... to, with the assistance of the supervisor of employment standards, supervise the administration and enforcement of all laws respecting the employment and relating to the health, sanitary conditions, surroundings, hours of labor, and wages of employees employed in business and industry in accordance with the provisions of chapter 49.12 RCW.\" There is no exclusion here for railroads (or railroad employees), nor is there an exclusion under RCW 49.12 (in fact 49.12's\n   declaration states that it pertains to \"all employees,\" RCW 49.12.010 ). The title of Chapter 296-126 is \"Standards of Labor for the Protection of Safety, Health, and Welfare for all Employees in All Occupations Subject to Chapter 49.12 RCW.\" For these reasons, [i]t would seem that WAC 296-126-092 (4), which was issued by L &amp; I, would protect railroad employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   However, I am a little confused about the railroad exclusion in RCW 43.22.050 (1). That law states that: \"The Director of [L]abor and [I]ndustries shall ... exercise all the power and perform all the duties prescribed by law in relation to the inspection of factories, mills, workshops, warerooms, stores and buildings, and the machinery and apparatus therein contained, and steam vessels and other vessels operated by machinery, and in relation to the administration and enforcement of all laws and safety standards providing for the protection of employees in mills, factories, workshops, and in employments subject to the provisions of Title 51 RCW, and in relation to the enforcement, inspection, certification, and promulgation of safe places and safety device standards in all industries: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, this section does not apply to railroads.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   On its face, this particular RCW seems to be less about overall rulemaking authority and more about inspection authority and rulemaking authority with regard to safe places and \"safety standards,\" i.e. the standards of the physical work environment. However, because the law describes \"safety standards,\" an argument could be made that it encompasses WAC 296-126-092 (4), which is a rule issued under the heading \"Standards of Labor for the Protection of Safety, Health and Welfare.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Any guidance on these RCWs and whether they exclude or include railroad employees with regard to Chapter 296-126 WAC, and, specifically WAC 296-126-092 (4) would be greatly appreciated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dkt. 9, at 3-4. On August 10, 2017, Mr. DeBeaumont responded with:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   My name is Brent DeBeaumont, and I am the Wage and Hour Technical Specialist with the Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries. I provide guidance on wage and hour laws and regulation in my role with the department. Maggie Leland forwarded me your inquiry, directly below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   WAC 296-126-092 was promulgated pursuant to the rulemaking directive in the Industrial Welfare Act (\"IWA\"). To my knowledge, neither the IWA nor the rules promulgated pursuant to the IWA (Chapter 296-126) contain a specific exemption for railroad workers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A plain reading of the regulation, and the lack of a specific exemption for railroad workers, does indeed contemplate that Washington railroad workers are covered by WAC 296-126-092.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Unfortunately, in my role with the department, I am not familiar with the history or interpretations of RCW 43.22.050.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Thank you again for your inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dkt. 9, at 3.

Plaintiff has failed to show that there is an existing substantial controversy between it and the Department. The Department clearly states that will not enforce Washington's break laws against the Plaintiff, unless a \"final appellate court\" finds that federal law does not preempt Washington law, thus eliminating the need for injunctive relief. Further, the Department states that it takes \"no position\" on whether federal law preempts Washington law regarding breaks.

In Count Seven, the Plaintiff maintains that the law that gives the Defendant the power to enforce Washington law on breaks, RCW 43.22.050 (1), specifically exempts railroads and so the Defendant \"lacks the authority to apply WAC 296-126-092 (4) to railroads.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 17. Plaintiff fails to explain, or make any showing, that this claim somehow creates a \"substantial controversy\" between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The Plaintiff also asserted at oral argument that the class action lawsuit deals with only a subset of workers, and that a ruling in this case would deal with all railroad workers. The Plaintiff does not show how the fact that there is a \"substantial controversy\" over whether federal preemption applies to some of its workers in the Eastern District of Washington case, in any manner creates a \"substantial controversy\" in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, \"[r]ipeness has both constitutional and prudential components.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfson\n   </em>\n   , at 1058.

Future Enforcement by the Department\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   An issue to be addressed is whether Union Pacific has identified a \"legally protected interest\" that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent regarding the Department's enforcement of Washington law on breaks and meal periods against it. Union Pacific is not now subject to an enforcement action by the Department, so, it raises a pre-enforcement challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Neither the \"mere existence of a proscriptive statute\" nor a \"generalized threat of prosecution\" satisfies the \"case or controversy\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    Wolfson,\n   </em>\n   at 1058.

It also clarifies in a second declaration filed with the reply: \"This means that the Department will not enforce its break rule ... against any interstate railroad. It may change its position if a final appellate court decision provides that federal law does not preempt WAC 296-126-092.\" Dkt. 32, at 1-2. The prosecuting authorities, then, have not \"communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings\" and have now disavowed any intention of enforcing the statutes against the Plaintiff. Plaintiff's argument, that the Defendant has left the door open for some kind of future enforcement, is speculative, at best, and depends on possible actions by third parties that could result in a change in the law. The Plaintiff has failed to make a showing as to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The final factor to be considered as to whether this case is constitutionally ripe also cuts against Plaintiff: the Defendant has never prosecuted a railroad under the relevant statutes or regulations.

Plaintiff misapplies the case. The private litigants in the\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   putative class action are in the same position as Mr. Park-they have an active interest in whether the Washington statutes are preempted by federal law. The Department has specifically stated that it \"takes no position\" on the preemption issue.

In examining whether the plaintiff had standing in\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit noted that just because private litigation was possible to redress an injury did not mean that standing did not lie against the government to challenge the statute that could be enforced in private litigation.

It has failed to show an injury in fact as to either of these \"injuries.\" Even if the money spent to defend the class action lawsuit was a sufficient injury, Plaintiff still does not have standing, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The causation \"requirement is only implicated where the concern is that an injury caused by a third party is too tenuously connected to the acts of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Better Forestry v.

To the extent that Plaintiff asserts that the Department's employee's statement that \"[a] plain reading of the regulation, and the lack of a specific exemption for railroad workers, does indeed contemplate that Washington railroad workers are covered by WAC 296-126-092,\" coupled with his failure to include language regarding the possibility of federal preemption in the email to the attorney, caused Plaintiff to get sued, it has not established causation. The injury complained\n   of-having to defend a class action law suit-is only tenuously connected to the acts of the Department, particularly in light of Mr. DeBeaumont's later statement that he was \"not familiar with the history or interpretations of RCW 43.22.050,\" a statute which may prevent the Department from enforcing the regulation against railroads (although that is not clear), and in light of the Department's clearer position now. Plaintiff's economic injury from having to defend itself in the class action \"does not satisfy the requirements of Article III because it is the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    San Diego Cty. Gun Rights Comm.,\n   </em>\n   at 1130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Plaintiff has failed to make a showing on the first two requirements. There is no injury for the Court to redress, and no cause by the Defendant shown. The third requirement of standing, redressability, is moot without an injury to redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    D. ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiff argues that further discovery is warranted into the following: \"(a) whether the Defendant has taken a position on the issue of preemption, (b) whether the Defendant has taken a position on the issue of whether WAC 296-126-092 applies to railroads and (c) whether Defendant maintains that it may enforce the regulation against railroads in the future.\" Dkt. 23. Included with the Department's reply, is a second declaration from Mr. Johnson, who states that the Department \"takes no position\" on preemption. Dkt. 32, at 2. The original declaration from Mr. Johnson states that Mr. DeBeaumont's email was not official policy or departmental order. Dkt. 10, at 2. As to the final issue on which Plaintiff seeks discovery, Mr. Johnson's supplemental declaration states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   In my previous declaration, I stated the Department has not threatened to enforce its break rule to BNSF or any railroad and has no plans to do so. This means that the Department will not enforce its break rule, Washington Administrative Code \u00a7 296-126-092, against any interstate railroad. It may change its position if a final appellate court decision provides that federal law does not preempt WAC 296-126-092. It is speculative to think this would occur and whether the Department would allocate its limited resources to an enforcement action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Dkt. 32, at 2. Plaintiff provides no reason that it should not give full credit to defendants' declaration. No further discovery is warranted and the case should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    E. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   There is no case or controversy between the Defendant and the Plaintiff. The Court does not issue advisory opinions. The motion to dismiss should be granted and the case closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Therefore, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \u2022 The Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed.
