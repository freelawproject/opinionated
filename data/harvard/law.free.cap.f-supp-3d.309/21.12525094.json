Green (\"Plaintiff\"), a prisoner previously confined at the Erie\n   County Holding Center (\"ECHC\"), filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint asserting claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 1). The operative complaint in this action is Plaintiff's third amended complaint, filed on October 3, 2016. (Dkt. 29). Presently before the Court is a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) by Defendant Sergeant Carney (\"Defendant\"). (Dkt. 37). For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted and Defendant is dismissed from this action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss on July 24, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), along with a memorandum in support of the motion (Dkt. 39). Plaintiff was\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at the time the motion was filed. The Court issued a motion scheduling order on July 24, 2017, which set a deadline of August 21, 2017, for Plaintiff to respond in opposition to the motion and informed Plaintiff that the \"claims Plaintiff asserts in his complaint may be dismissed as against Defendant without a trial if he does not respond to this motion.\" (Dkt. 40). Plaintiff did not file papers opposing the motion to dismiss. On October 24, 2017, Attorney Matthew A. Albert entered a notice of appearance on behalf of Plaintiff. (Dkt. 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court generally may only consider \"facts stated in the complaint or documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated by reference.\"\n   <em>\n    Nechis v.

(Dkt. 39 at 2). Plaintiff names Defendant in the caption of his complaint and in the list of defendants. (Dkt. 29 at 1, 5). Defendant is not otherwise mentioned by name in the complaint. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged Defendant's personal involvement in the alleged constitutional deprivations. (Dkt. 39 at 2);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colon v. Coughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412071\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/865/#p873\">\n    58 F.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 873 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"It is well settled in this Circuit that personal involvement of defendants in alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under \u00a7 1983.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant requests that the Court dismiss him as a defendant in this action with prejudice because \"Plaintiff has[ already] received much guidance from the Court.\" (Dkt. 39 at 3). In its initial screening order regarding Plaintiff's original complaint, the Court explained that some of Plaintiff's claims would be dismissed unless Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. (Dkt. 4). With respect to Plaintiff's conditions of confinement claim, for example, the Court explained that Plaintiff had failed to state facts showing the personal involvement of the defendant he sought to hold responsible for that claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). After Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, the Court issued an order directing Plaintiff to file a second amended complaint and providing specific instructions as to how Plaintiff should proceed. (Dkt. 13). Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (Dkt. 17), which the Court reviewed. The Court dismissed some of Plaintiff's claims, found that others could proceed, and then directed Plaintiff to file a third amended complaint incorporating only those claims that the Court found were permitted to proceed to service. (Dkt. 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Defendant Sergeant Carney on which relief may be granted because Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant was personally involved in any of the alleged constitutional violations. Defendant will be\n   dismissed from this action with prejudice. Plaintiff has had three opportunities to amend his complaint. Furthermore, there is no indication from the face of the third amended complaint that a valid claim might be stated against Defendant, given that Defendant is not mentioned other than in the caption and the list of defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuoco v. Moritsugu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239681\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/99/#p112\">\n    222 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (2d Cir. 2000) (\"A\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint is to be read liberally. Certainly the court should not dismiss without granting leave to amend\n   <em>\n    at least once\n   </em>\n   when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.\" (emphasis added) ). In fact, in his counseled motion to amend the complaint that is currently pending before United States Magistrate Judge Jonathan W. Feldman, Plaintiff seeks to remove Sergeant Carney as a defendant. (Dkt. 63). That motion further supports Defendant's argument that he should not be named as a defendant in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because Plaintiff has failed to allege personal involvement, Defendant's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 37) is granted for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Defendant is dismissed from this action with prejudice. The Clerk of Court is directed to dismiss Defendant Carney as a defendant in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
