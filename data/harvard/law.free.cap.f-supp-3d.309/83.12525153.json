(Brooks Aff. \u00b6 15; Govt. Mem. 2.) In his memorandum, Bocanegra states that he was apprehended\n   <em>\n    26\n   </em>\n   nautical miles\n   off the coast of Maleplo Island. (Bocanegra Mem. 2.) However, this apparent dispute is immaterial for purposes of this motion because both parties agree that defendants were interdicted outside of Colombia's \"territorial waters,\" the twelve miles of water surrounding a coastal nation over which that country possesses sovereignty,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
