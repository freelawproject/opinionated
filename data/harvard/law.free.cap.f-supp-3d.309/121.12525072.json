(\"BBB\"), and\n   their employer, BBB, the defendant. Plaintiffs bring claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and New York Labor Law. The motions turn on whether BBB paid a subset of employees, its Department Managers (\"DMs\"), in conformity with the \"Fluctuating Work Week\" method (\"FWW\")-a method for calculating overtime compensation which the FLSA permits under certain circumstances and which BBB used until March 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court, finding that BBB properly implemented this method of compensation, grants BBB's summary judgment motion on plaintiffs' overtime compensation claims (Counts I and II of the Second Amended Complaint) and denies the DMs' motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

JSF \u00b6 5. Plaintiffs' claims relate solely to the period when BBB used the FWW method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As to that period, BBB's employees, upon being hired or promoted to the DM position, received several documents explaining their compensation and the operation at BBB of the FWW method for calculating overtime pay. JSF \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, each DM received a Department Manager Compensation Acknowledgement form. JSF \u00b6 9. It explained BBB's compensation methodology. The form stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   At the time I was hired, I was told what my anticipated weekly compensation will be and how it will be calculated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I understand that my weekly compensation consists of two components: (1) a base weekly salary; and (2) an additional amount for all hours above 40 that I work during a week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I understand that my base weekly salary is compensation for all hours I work in a week. I will get paid this base salary for each week I work, whether or not I work 40 hours in that week, subject to the Company's sick day and leave policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I further understand that I will be scheduled for no less than 47 hours per week, but that my actual hours worked will fluctuate depending on the needs of my store.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, each DM received documents setting out what the DM's base annual salary would be if he or she worked 40 (or fewer) hours per week. JSF \u00b6 6. These documents also set out what the DM's expected total earnings would be for a week in which he or she worked 47 hours (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   7 overtime hours).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Each DM also received documents explaining that the dollar value (per overtime hour) for hours worked above 40 hours would vary due to BBB's use of the FWW method. JSF \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Third, all DMs received annual notice and acknowledgment of pay rate forms.

You will also be paid an additional amount for any hours worked over 40 in one week. Please refer to the attached Department Manager's Bi-Weekly Pay Stub for a detailed explanation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fourth, plaintiffs received pay stubs from BBB each pay period setting forth their pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   BBB's compensation practices for DMs as to overtime are helpfully illustrated by examples drawn from the pay records of named plaintiff Rashaun Frazer. As of January 21, 2014, Frazer's base weekly salary was $1,034.22-he was paid that sum regardless whether he worked overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSF \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 6. Frazer's weekly hours, however, like those of the other DMs, varied. JSF \u00b6 23. His pay stubs reflected how the additional pay-on top of the base pay of $1,034.22-was tabulated for weeks in which Frazer worked more than 40 hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSF, Ex. 6; Alvarez Decl., Ex. 1. For example, for a week in which Frazer worked 47 hours, BBB, to calculate his additional compensation for overtime, would divide his base compensation figure ($1,034.22) by the total number of hours he worked that week (47).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Alvarez Decl., Ex. 1. This would yield the hourly rate that BBB would pay\n   Frazer for his overtime hours for that week ($21.79 per hour). Thus, for the 7 hours of overtime Frazer worked, he would be paid $152.53 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   $21.79/hour x 7 hours).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In a week in which Frazer worked more overtime hours, this formula would result in Frazer's being paid a higher absolute overtime wage but a smaller rate per overtime hour. So, for example, had Frazer worked 54 hours in particular week, BBB would calculate his overtime hourly rate by dividing his weekly compensation ($1,034.22) by the total number of hours worked in the week (54). This would yield an overtime hourly rate of $18.97; and for his 14 hours of overtime work, Frazer would be paid $265.58 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   $18.97/hour x 14 hours).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The DMs were scheduled to work 47.5 hours per week. BBB's Response to Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 1. The parties agree that, in almost every week at issue, the plaintiff DMs in fact either worked 40 or more hours, or, when annual or sick leave time taken that week was added to their actual hours worked, were credited with having worked 40 or more hours.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, as discussed below, on several occasions, three plaintiff DMs-Reynosa, Frazer, and Thomas-worked fewer than 40 hours in a given week, as a result of having taken unpaid leave.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.A.2. For these weeks, Reynosa, Frazer, and Thomas did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   receive their base salary, but instead, a lesser figure.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' argument that BBB misapplied the FWW method relies heavily on these DMs' receipt for those several weeks of lower-than-usual base pay. Based on this alleged misapplication of FWW, plaintiffs argue that BBB is precluded from using that method to calculate the overtime pay of these employees and the other plaintiff DMs. Plaintiffs contend instead that BBB is obliged to calculate overtime pay by using the more generous \"time and a half\" method that the FLSA prescribes for workers paid a regular hourly rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 18, 2016, plaintiffs filed this action, bringing claims on behalf of DMs and AMs under the FLSA and NYLL. Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 18, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Dkt. 11. On December 16, 2016, BBB answered the amended complaint. Dkt. 14. On June 16, 2017, after plaintiffs had moved for collective certification under the FLSA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 28, the Court granted plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint and denied as moot the motion for conditional class certification,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 28, 2017, plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, the operative pleading before the Court. Dkt. 90 (the \"SAC\"). On July 12, 2017, plaintiffs moved again to certify a collective action under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 105-07. On August 9, 2017, that motion became fully briefed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 112 (Def. Op. Br.), 134 (Pl. Reply Br.). On August 25, 2017, however, plaintiffs informed the Court that they intended to move for summary judgment on the DMs' FWW claim and to move for class certification of their NYLL claims under Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 141. On September 13, 2017, at a pre-motion conference, the Court set a briefing schedule for the cross-motions for partial summary judgment; held in abeyance, pending resolution of the summary judgment motions, plaintiffs' motion for collective certification under the FLSA; and directed that plaintiffs defer filing any motion for class certification under Rule 23 until after the summary judgment motions were resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On October 27, 2017, BBB filed its motion for partial summary judgment and supporting documents, including its Rule 56.1 Statement. Dkts. 152-56. On November\n   21, 2017, plaintiffs filed their brief in opposition and in support of their cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Dkts. 159-61. On December 15, 2017, BBB filed its brief in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion and in further support of its own, Dkt. 166, and, on January 5, 2018, a revised brief in opposition, Dkt. 171, and a counterstatement of facts in response to plaintiffs' 56.1 statement, Dkt. 172.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 19, 2018, plaintiffs filed their brief in reply.

There, an employee sued under \u00a7 207 of the FLSA for overtime back pay. His employer had paid him a flat weekly rate, regardless of the number of hours he worked, but had not paid him anything extra for weeks in which he had worked more than 40 hours. The Supreme Court first considered whether the employee's flat weekly wage could be used as the basis for calculating overtime pay under the FLSA. Section 207 requires that overtime pay be based upon the employee's \"regular rate,\" but does not specify how that rate is to be calculated. The Court held that an employer could, under the FLSA, calculate an employee's regular rate by dividing a fixed weekly salary by fluctuating hours, and then use that rate as the basis for calculating overtime pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368141\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/572/#p578\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368141\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/572/#p578\">\n    at 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368141\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/572/#p578\">\n    62 S.Ct. 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"No problem is presented in assimilating the computation of overtime for employees under contract for a fixed weekly wage for regular contract hours which are the actual hours worked, to similar computations for employees on hourly rates.

And that makes sense: an employee's pay, whether for hours worked or for compensable time off, is clearly compensation. Thus, if BBB had rewarded those DMs who worked longer hours with extra compensable vacation days or hours, BBB could be said to have paid bonuses for extra hours worked, disentitling it to use of the FWW.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wills,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025453\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/245/#p253\">\n    981 F.Supp.2d at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The DMs, however, do not argue that BBB engaged in this practice here, and the factual record would not support such a claim. Instead, the DMs seize on a different, undisputed fact: that BBB allowed DMs who worked on a holiday (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Labor Day)-when other DMs enjoyed paid time off-to take an alternative paid day off later (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   to \"bank\" the holiday for future use).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

But allowing a worker who is obliged to work on a paid holiday, or on a scheduled day off, an alternative paid day off is not inconsistent with the FWW's fixed-weekly-salary requirement. It does not lead to such an employee's receipt of any\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   compensation for hours worked-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   an hours-based bonus. Rather, it guards against inequitable treatment of such an employee, by assuring that each employee is given the same number of paid days off, and that an employee who is obliged to work on a holiday or scheduled day off does not forfeit a paid day off. Plaintiffs have not identified any case law or DOL regulation supporting the claim that the FWW is breached by this practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Docked\" Base Pay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs next assert that several DMs had their pay \"docked\" in a manner they claim is inconsistent with the FWW method's requirement of fixed base pay.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the fact that DMs Thomas, Frazer, and Reynosa were paid less than their base salary during the six weeks at issue amounts to a \"docking\" of base pay inconsistent with the FWW's requirement of a fixed weekly salary. They argue that the reasons for any shortfall in base pay, even an inadvertent payroll error, are irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. at 16; Pl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Reply Br. at 2. Because these six weeks present distinct issues, the Court addresses them separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To begin with, the \"docking\" of Thomas's salary for one week is of no legal significance. It is undisputed that Thomas was underpaid by $50 due to a single payroll error, since rectified. Plaintiffs do not argue-and the record would not permit them to argue-that this underpayment reflects a policy or practice of any kind, including of \"docking\" base salary. And plaintiffs have not supplied any authority to the effect that an inadvertent payroll glitch or lapse disqualifies an employer from using the FWW. For the same reasons, the two weeks in which BBB initially underpaid Reynosa but promptly made her whole do not jeopardize its use of the FWW method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To the extent plaintiffs rely on Reynosa's pay during the week ending February 7, 2014, that claim is also easily put to rest. For that week, as noted, Reynosa received less than her full weekly base salary; she was paid\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   for her work through February 5, 2014, her last day of employment. JSF \u00b6 100. But DOL regulations governing the FWW method condone BBB paying her for less than a full week. They provide that an employee may \"be paid a pro rata share of [her] salary in the initial or terminal week of [her] employment when [she] is not in payroll status for the entire week.\" U.S. Department of Labor Field Operations Handbook \u00a7 32b04b(c),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.dol.gov/whd/FOH/index.htm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The remaining two weeks at issue require more extended discussion. These are BBB's (1) reduction of Reynosa's base pay for the week ending June 30, 2013, to reflect that she took some time off that week on an unpaid vacation that she had negotiated with BBB at the start of her employment; and (2) reduction of Frazer's base pay for the week ending November 10, 2013, to reflect that he took a day's unpaid leave. With respect to both weeks, plaintiffs rely on DOL opinion letters, which, they argue, provide that to comply with the FWW, an employer may not permit an employee to take unpaid leave time. Specifically, in 1991, the DOL advised that an employer \"may substitute paid leave for employee absences provided the total compensation in any week when the absences occur equals the employee's guaranteed fixed salary\" but that, \"[w]here there is no paid leave to substitute for employee absences, the employer may not make deductions from the employee's guaranteed fixed salary under the fluctuating workweek method of compensation.\" U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter on Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (August 20, 1991),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%2011648489\">\n    1991 WL 11648489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. And, in 2006, the DOL advised that the FWW regulation \"does not authorize\" an employer that otherwise provides paid sick leave to \"take full day deductions from the salary of an employee paid on the fluctuating workweek method after the employee has exhausted the employee's sick leave bank, or before he or she has earned enough sick leave to cover the absence.\" U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter on Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (May 12, 2006),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201488849\">\n    2006 WL 1488849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Based on these DOL letters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiffs argue that the FWW method\n   required that BBB pay its employees their fixed weekly salary, even with respect to days or weeks in which they took unpaid leave, and that BBB's failure to do so requires that all plaintiff DMs be retroactively paid \"time and a half\" pay for their overtime hours. Pl. Br. at 13-16; Pl. Reply Br. at 2. Defendants counter that the DOL regulations speak to corporate\n   <em>\n    policies\n   </em>\n   , not isolated incidents, and that BBB's limited failure to comply with DOL regulations does not evince an intention by BBB to compensate its employees on a basis other than FWW.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BBB Reply Br. at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Of the two weeks at issue-Reynosa's and Frazer's-in which BBB paid a DM less than his or her base weekly salary, Frazer's presents the more substantial issue. BBB's negotiated agreement with Reynosa, reached at the outset of her employment, to accommodate and permit her to take three previously scheduled vacations (one of which occurred during the week of June 30), without pay, during her first summer at BBB,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Alvarez Decl. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201488849\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 22, is fairly squared with the FWW. The DOL's opinion letters simply do not speak to the idiosyncratic circumstance of an employee who takes a position paid under the FWW and negotiates a one-time leave arrangement to cover previously scheduled holidays. And there is no policy reason under the FLSA why an employer's agreement to accommodate a prospective employee in this fashion should block it from using the FWW as a matter of course going forward, whether for that employee or others. Revealingly, too, plaintiffs have withdrawn their claim that the FWW method was breached by BBB's non-payment to Reynosa of her base salary during two later weeks the same summer (in late July and late August,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   &amp; Alvarez Exs. 10-11) when, pursuant to the same negotiated arrangement with BBB, Reynosa took unpaid vacation. But there is no clear basis for distinguishing between those vacation weeks and the partial vacation week of June 30, 2013: If to comply with the FWW an employer must pay an employee her base pay for negotiated unpaid leave, the same should presumably apply to a day's unpaid leave and a week's unpaid leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In contrast, Frazer's pay for the week ending November 10, 2013, in which he worked 39.75 hours but took Monday off on unpaid leave, presents a difficult question of compliance with the FWW. Read literally, the language of the 1991 and 2006 DOL opinion letters are difficult to square with BBB's denial to Frazer of his full pay for that week based on one day's unpaid leave. A federal district court for the District of Columbia, in the most thoroughgoing treatment of the DOL's opinion letters, has construed these to require an employer to pay the employee his or her full base salary under such circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The Department's opinion, which the Court finds persuasive, is unambiguous on this point: employers who use the FWW method of compensation must compensate their employees in full, notwithstanding absences for personal reasons, even if the employee has not accrued sufficient leave time to cover the absence.... The only recognized exception is for disciplinary actions where the employee's misconduct resulted in missed work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. Sprint Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450985\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/453/44/#p60\">\n    453 F.Supp.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60-61 (D.D.C. 2006). To be sure, there are\n   sound policy reasons that could have led the DOL to the opposite result. Applied literally, the DOL's policy might discourage employers from granting extended unpaid time off from work (above and beyond the employee's allocated leave) to attend to personal circumstances, lest doing so jeopardize the employer's right to pay overtime under the FWW method. But that policy judgment is for the DOL, not this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Even assuming, however, that BBB's withholding of some Frazer's base pay for the week of November 10, 2013 was inconsistent with the FWW, on the summary judgment record, that was the lone occasion in which the evidence supports that BBB failed to pay him a fixed weekly salary. As Judge Oetken has explained, the fact that a lapse was anomalous as opposed to more systematic is relevant to whether the employee is disentitled to use the FWW method. As he emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Stein,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n    2013 WL 3809463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5, the DOL's \"regulations that define what it means to be paid on a 'salary basis' are instructive.\" They define an employee paid on a \"salary basis\" as one who:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.602\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted in\n   <em>\n    Stein,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n    2013 WL 3809463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ). As Judge Oetken also noted, \"DOL regulations further provide that '[a]n employer who makes improper deductions from salary shall lose [the right to invoke certain FLSA exemptions]\n   <em>\n    if the facts demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.603\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ) (emphasis added).

The record reflects only six weeks-out of more than 1,000-in which a DM was paid less than his or her full weekly base salary. And of those six weeks, only one week (Frazer's) is indicative of a failure to pay a fixed weekly salary to DMs, and only one other week (Reynosa's, under the arrangement she negotiated attendant to joining BBB) is arguably\n   so. Whether measured by raw number or duration, the infraction(s) here, as a matter of law, are far too few and isolated to establish that either Frazer or Reynosa, let alone their fellow DMs, were not paid a fixed weekly salary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n    2013 WL 3809463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. And the record as to such infractions is now closed, with discovery in this case complete and with BBB having moved in 2015 to a new method for overtime compensation. Accordingly, to the extent plaintiffs' claim is based on BBB's alleged noncompliance with this element of the FWW method, plaintiffs' attack fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fluctuating Hours\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The parties agree that whether the DMs' hours \"fluctuated\" within the meaning of the FLSA is a question of law as to which the relevant facts are undisputed. Rather, the parties dispute whether an employee's schedule can be said to \"fluctuate\" if the employee's weekly hours, in practice, never or rarely fell below a 40-hour workweek, but did vary above that threshold. The DMs argue that only if their hours regularly fell below 40 hours per week can the FWW requirement of fluctuation be met. BBB counters that employees' schedules \"fluctuated\" within the meaning of the FLSA because their workweeks varied, although these hours almost always were at or over 40 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The governing regulation states, in pertinent part, that an employee whose \"hours of work ... fluctuate from week to week\" may be paid a fixed salary \"pursuant to an understanding with his employer that he will received such fixed amount as straight time pay for\n   <em>\n    whatever hours he is called upon to work in a workweek, whether few or many.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.114\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

This interpretation is confirmed by the next sentence, which discusses a fixed salary that pays for \"hours worked each workweek,\n   <em>\n    whatever their number\n   </em>\n   , rather than for working 40 hours or some other fixed weekly work period.\" Again, the regulation does not specify that the weekly work-hour deviations must be in both directions; the phrase \"whatever the number\" plainly contemplates that an employee's work hours could be either more or less than the 40-hour or other fixed workweek, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Ramos v.

Or, as a district court in this Circuit has observed: \"For a fluctuating work week arrangement to make sense to both parties, employees should offset their relative loss from a grueling work week far above forty hours with the benefit of full pay for weeks that clock-in at less than forty hours. Otherwise, employees have not bargained for anything but decreasing marginal pay as they work longer and longer hours at work.\"\n   <em>\n    Hasan v.

On the other hand, there is no assurance that, under a different system for overtime compensation, employees would be paid more: An employer who is required to pay employees 150% of a fixed hourly wage for overtime hours might-subject to applicable minimum wage laws-compensate by paying employees a lower hourly rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In the end, BBB was entitled to design its FWW system within the bounds authorized by DOL's regulations, and the governing regulations do not require an employment arrangement in which weekly hours necessarily fluctuate above and below 40. The regulations require simply that weekly hours fluctuate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telgian,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352881\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/176/181/#p195\">\n    176 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   195 ;\n   <em>\n    Stein,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n    2013 WL 3809463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that the DMs' hours varied. Accordingly, on this element, too, of the FWW method, plaintiffs fail to establish BBB's noncompliance and BBB has demonstrated its adherence to the FWW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mutual Understanding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs claim noncompliance by BBB with the \"mutual understanding\" element of the FWW method. This element requires that the employee and employer both understood that the employee would be paid a fixed salary regardless of the number of hours worked. Notably, it is not required that an \"employee ... actually understand the full details of how her employer's FWW program operated.\"\n   <em>\n    Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n    2013 WL 3809463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 8. Plaintiffs here deny they shared the requisite understanding with BBB. The assembled record, however-most notably the written notices given to the DMs in connection with their employment-makes clear that the DMs were apprised of the essential facts of BBB's overtime compensation system. Any misapprehension could be, at most, as to details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The DOL's regulation \"sets forth in clear terms what the parties must clearly and mutually understand: 'that the fixed salary is compensation (apart from overtime premiums) for the hours worked each workweek, whatever their number, rather than for working 40 hours or some other fixed weekly work period.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203809463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

These forms further notified the DMs that their overtime pay, measured per hour, would fluctuate depending\n   on the number of hours worked in a given week, such that the more overtime hours worked, the lower the per-hour overtime rate would be. JSF \u00b6 9. The DMs were further given documents illustrating these points. The documents explained to each DM his or her base annual salary and expected earnings for a 47-hour workweek. JSF \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In light of these written notices, plaintiffs' submissions on summary judgment focus instead on the deposition testimony of various plaintiff DMs. But this testimony at most can be invoked to support that, subjectively, certain DMs did not understand aspects of the compensation scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pl. Response to Def. 56.1 at \u00b6 3. It does not, however, permit a finding that the DM plaintiffs lacked an understanding that their \"employer [would] pay the employee[s] a fixed salary regardless of the number of hours worked.\"\n   <em>\n    Ayers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203171342\">\n    2007 WL 3171342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Quite the contrary, as the DM plaintiffs each have acknowledged, they received Department Manager Compensation Acknowledgement forms, which stated, in relevant part, \"I understand that my base weekly salary is compensation for all hours I work in a week.
