HERNANDEZ COVINGTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court pursuant to Defendants the Florida State Fair Authority's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 13), Sheriff Chad Chronister's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 17), and Deputies Henry Echenique, Mark Clark, Stephen Jones, and Adrian Chester's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 16), filed on February 23 and\n   March 6, 2018. Plaintiff Yvonne Thornton, as guardian and natural parent of C.T., a minor, responded on March 30, 2018. (Doc. ## 45-46, 48). The Motions are granted as set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For many years, \"students of Hillsborough County schools have been given a day off from school and provided with free admission to an event current[ly] known as 'Student Day' at the Florida State Fairgrounds.\" (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 17). On February 7, 2014, C.T., the minor son of Thornton, attended Student Day with his friend Andrew Joseph III. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office provides security for Student Day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). Sheriff Chronister was \"aware based on the large number of juveniles expected to attend, that specific definitions and standards of conduct needed to be established so that deputies and other security personnel at Student Day would know what conduct was prohibited.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). He \"was further aware and on notice due to the large numbers of juveniles expected to attend and due to [ ] past experiences in previous years' Student Day events, that specific, uniform procedures needed to be established for the 2014 Student Day for the deputies to employ in the process of conducting arrests, detentions, ejectments and trespasses of juveniles.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite that knowledge, deputies were simply advised \"to be alert for 'unruly' behavior\" and \"that they had the option, at their discretion, to eject or trespass students if the deputies felt it was warranted in his or her individual discretion, or that they could place the student under arrest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35). Thornton alleges that such discretion was wrongfully exercised on C.T. and Andrew. Around eight that night, C.T. \"was detained and placed in custody by [Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office] deputies for alleged 'disorderly conduct' without cause or legal justification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). \"At the time of his de facto arrest, C.T. [ ] was not disorderly, was in violation of no law, and was not smoking or drinking alcohol or using any other intoxicant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   C.T. \"was then taken into custody and was then taken or transported by deputies to the processing area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46). At no point during his detention, transport, or ejection were C.T.'s parents notified and C.T. \"was given no assistance or opportunity to make a phone call.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). Unfortunately, C.T. had been relying on Andrew's cell phone, which was either taken away or broken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46). And, \"[o]nce [ ] student detainees [like C.T.] had been transported to the processing area by whatever means, they were dropped off there and the deputies returned to the Fairgrounds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). \"Deputies who escorted students to the temporary processing area were not instructed to stay with their detainees or supervise their processing, detention or release\"-instead deputies were free to leave after filling out paperwork for their detainees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). Furthermore, \"the temporary processing area was understaffed and unable to efficiently process the student detainees brought there by deputies from the event.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Like other minors to be ejected but not arrested, C.T. and Andrew were transported after processing to Gate 4 where they were \"simply shown to the door and told to exit the facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48). Gate 4 is a gate adjacent to the busy Interstate 4, and was not the gate at which C.T. and Andrew had been dropped off or were scheduled to be picked up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 49). \"[B]ecause of fencing and other barriers on and around the Fairgrounds, there was no clear path or area that could be safely traversed on foot from outside Gate\n   4 back to the US [Highway] 301 side\"-where C.T. and Andrew, like most other attendees, had been dropped off and entered the fair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). \"The only direct route, as well as the safest route to return to the parking lots and adjacent entrance Gates from outside Gate 4 was to return into the Fair through Gate 4 and walk east back through the Fair itself.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Making matters worse, \"[v]ehicular access from outside the Fairgrounds to that portion of the Fairgrounds property where the boys were located was prohibited that night,\" so the boys could not be picked up at Gate 4. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At first, C.T. and Andrew waited around the area outside of Gate 4, but \"a deputy in a patrol car drove up and told the boys that they could not stay where they were.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51). In the hope of getting back to the gate at which they would be picked up, C.T. and Andrew asked the deputy at Gate 4 to let them travel back through the fair or to give them a ride to the gate they needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). The deputy refused the request, but gave C.T. and Andrew directions on how to walk back to the gate they needed on the other side of the fairgrounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, 54). The route the deputy described would cover 2 to 3 miles and required the boys to cross Interstate 4, \"then walk in an easterly direction generally following the direction of I-4 until they reached U.S. [Highway] 301, at which point they could head south following 301 back to the entrance area of the Fairgrounds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Feeling out of options, C.T. and Andrew took the deputy's advice. They crossed Interstate 4 and walked towards the entrance gates of the Fairgrounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56). When C.T. and Andrew attempted to cross Interstate 4 back to the Fairgrounds, \"Andrew was struck and killed by a passing motorist,\" as twelve-year-old C.T. watched. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). As a result, Thornton alleges C.T. suffered the \"infliction of emotional distress\" as well as \"pain and suffering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thornton initiated this action on C.T.'s behalf on January 31, 2018, asserting negligence claims against the Hillsborough County School Board, the Florida State Fair Authority, Sheriff Chronister, and four Defendant Deputies, as well as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims against the Defendant Deputies and Sheriff Chronister. (Doc. # 1). Thornton alleges that, because of Defendants' negligence and allegedly insufficient policies or lack thereof regarding the detention and ejectment of minors, C.T. was \"improperly detained, taken into custody and transported off the Fairgrounds property to a location in the immediate vicinity of Interstate 4,\" where C.T. watched his friend be struck and killed by a motorist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Each Defendant moved to dismiss. (Doc. ## 13-14, 16-17). Subsequently, Thornton voluntarily dismissed the claim against the Hillsborough County School Board. (Doc. # 47). Thornton responded in opposition to the Motions from the State Fair Authority, Sheriff Chronister, and the Deputy Defendants. (Doc. ## 45-46, 48). The Motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court accepts as true all the allegations in the complaint and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The State Fair Authority notes that Thornton did not send it a notice of intent to sue until January 22, 2018-after the three-year deadline. (Doc. # 13 at 4, 7-10). Thus, the State Fair Authority argues Count III must be dismissed with prejudice because Thornton cannot cure the late notice. (Doc. # 13 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response, Thornton first argues that sufficient notice of intent to sue was given to the State Fair Authority in December of 2014. (Doc. # 46 at 2). Yet, a review of the notice attached to Thornton's response reveals that it was not sent by Thornton\n   regarding Thornton's claims. (Doc. # 46-1). Rather, the notice was sent by the friend Andrew Joseph's estate to the State Fair Authority. Although the notice generally says it is notifying the State Fair Authority of \"any and all other available causes of action arising from the death of Andrew Joseph III,\" the notice states that it is alerting the State Fair Authority \"of the intent of the Estate of Andrew Joseph, III, to file a tort claims action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thornton is not mentioned as a claimant, nor are her specific claims related to C.T. Section 768.28(6)(a) requires that \"the claimant\" must present his or her claim to the appropriate state agency. Thus, Thornton was required to present her claim to the State Fair Authority. She cannot piggy-back on the timely notice sent by a different claimant regarding different claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, Thornton argues that the three-year time limit to give notice does not apply to her claim. Rather, she argues the exception for contribution claims applies because she is suing multiple Defendants as joint tortfeasors. (Doc. # 46 at 3-4). Thornton misunderstands the statute. There is a six-month deadline for a joint tortfeasor to bring a claim for contribution against the state agency tortfeasor \"after the judgement against the tortfeasor seeking contribution has become final.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20768.28\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6)(a). Here, there is no judgment upon which a joint tortfeasor is seeking contribution from the State Fair Authority. Rather, Thornton is a claimant seeking damages for negligence from the State Fair Authority-a fact unchanged by the existence of multiple other Defendants. Thus, she had to give notice of her intent to sue to the State Fair Authority and the Florida Department of Financial Services within three years after the accrual of the claim. The negligence claim accrued on February 7, 2014, so Thornton had until February 8, 2017, to give notice. She failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Consequently, the Court agrees with the State Fair Authority that Thornton's negligence claim against it must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tozier v.

Just as she did for the State Fair Authority, Thornton sent Sheriff Chronister the Section 768.28 notice on January 22, 2018. (Doc. # 17-1).

(Doc. # 17 at 18-20). True, the Complaint does not clearly state which of C.T.'s constitutional rights were violated. Nor does the Complaint identify a specific policy or practice of Sheriff Chronister's. Rather, the apparent basis for this claim is Sheriff Chronister's \"failure [ ] to develop, implement, and administer such policies and procedures as set forth\" in the Complaint regarding how minors should be detained and ejected from the fair on Student Day. (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 138). As a result of this failure, C.T. \"was improperly detained,\n   taken into custody and transported off the Fairgrounds property to a location in the immediate vicinity of Interstate 4.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thornton argues that there is no \"outright requirement that Plaintiff plead exactly what constitutional right was violated.\" (Doc. # 48 at 8-9). Still, she highlights the allegations that C.T. was improperly detained, a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Also, Thornton notes her allegation that the failure to adopt specific policies and procedures to deal with detaining or ejecting minors from Student Day constituted \"a deliberate indifference to the safety of the children in the custody of the [Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office] deputies and security personnel and a deliberate indifference to their constitutional rights.\" (Doc. # 48 at 11)(quoting (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 137) ). Specifically, she argues Sheriff Chronister should have implemented \"specific policies and procedures ... to govern the taking of children into custody by deputies providing security\" at Student Day, \"specific policies, procedures and safeguards ... governing the transport, release and ejection of children who had been taken into custody for the purposes of arrest, temporary detention, trespass or eviction,\" and a \"parental notification policy and procedure.\" (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 135-36). According to Thornton, there was an \"obvious need to implement appropriate policies and procedures to address the likelihood and foreseeability of danger to children\" at Student Day, which the Sheriff's Office ignored. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   These allegations fail to state a claim against Sheriff Chronister. Although the Complaint contains conclusory allegations that there was an \"obvious need\" for certain procedures at Student Day and that ignoring such need constituted \"deliberate indifference\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ), the Court is not bound to accept those allegations.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , 556 U.S. at 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    478 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No other similar incidents at past Student Days have been alleged, nor have facts been alleged to support that such danger was obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As they stand, the well-pled allegations show only-albeit unfortunately-that two minor friends were wrongly detained and ejected from the fair for disorderly conduct, were refused a ride (or other passage through the fair) back to the gate through which they had entered, and instead were instructed that they could walk to the desired gate by crossing a busy interstate, during which crossing one minor was struck and killed by a passing motorist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191531\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/1283/#p1289\">\n    392 F.3d at 1290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While McDowell's case is tragic, he cannot point to another occasion when the Jail's understaffing, and resulting inability to transport, contributed to or exacerbated an inmate's medical condition.

And, importantly, \u00a7 1983 requires more than mere negligence.\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

But he cites no case law applying the \"impact rule\" to a \u00a7 1983 claim. Therefore, the Court is not persuaded that the impact rule limits the damages Thornton may seek in Count VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Count VIII is dismissed for failure to state a claim.

(Doc. # 1 at 25-33). The Defendant Deputies contend they are entitled to sovereign immunity for the negligence claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20768.28\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9)(a). (Doc. # 16 at 5-7). Section 768.28(9)(a) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   No officer, employee, or agent of the state or of any of its subdivisions shall be held personally liable in tort or named as a party defendant in any action for any injury or damage suffered as a result of any act, event, or omission of action in the scope of her or his employment or function, unless such officer, employee, or agent acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20768.28\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9)(a). As the Defendant Deputies note, the Complaint alleges that they were \"negligent with respect to their treatment of C.T.\" and were \"working within the course and scope of their employment as law enforcement officers.\" (Doc. # 16 at 7; Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 96, 98, 108, 110, 120, 122, 132).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Complaint does not allege that Defendant Deputies \"acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.\" Instead, Thornton points out her allegations in the \u00a7 1983 claims that each Defendant Deputy acted with \"deliberate indifference\" to the safety of children in their custody and those children's constitutional rights, which Thornton contends is sufficient to avoid sovereign immunity for the negligence claims. (Doc. # 45 at 3). Alternatively, Thornton \"is agreeable to dismissing [the negligence counts] without prejudice should discovery later afford [her] to establish the extent of this behavior so that [Thornton] may move to amend the Complaint to add same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   All the allegations against the Defendant Deputies are conclusory. Even if Thornton had actually alleged that the Defendant Deputies acted with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights and safety, the Court need not have accepted such conclusory allegations.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , 556 U.S. at 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    478 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Complaint does not contain individualized allegations about each Defendant Deputy's conduct in the factual allegations. Rather, the negligence counts merely state (in identical language) that each Defendant Deputy detained C.T. in custody, decided to eject C.T. from the fair, and refused to let C.T. re-enter the fair to get to the regular entrance or to give C.T. a ride to the regular entrance. (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 87-90, 99-102, 111-114, 123-126). So, for example, it is unclear which Defendant Deputy actually declined C.T.'s request to walk back through the fair or to get a ride. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-55). Such unspecific allegations do not support the inference that the Defendant Deputies acted with wanton and willful disregard for C.T.'s rights and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court dismisses the negligence claims against the Defendant Deputies without prejudice, so that Thornton may amend these claims in her amended complaint if she chooses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the negligence\n   claims must be repled, the Court need not address whether the \"impact rule\" bars recovery of mental or emotional damages based on the allegations as pled in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Section 1983 Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In Counts IX to XII, Thornton asserts \u00a7 1983 claims against the Defendant Deputies in their individual capacities. (Doc. # 1 at 35-43). Thornton has labelled these counts as \"Custom, Practice &amp; Policy\" claims against each Defendant Deputy in his individual capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And the Complaint does not contain individualized allegations about the Defendant Deputies' allegedly unconstitutional conduct. Instead, the allegations under each count-largely cut-and-pasted from the \u00a7 1983 claim against Sheriff Chronister-assert that each Defendant Deputy was aware of the need for policies and procedures for Student Day to protect students' rights and safety. But, despite this knowledge, the individual Deputies \"fail[ed] and refus[ed] to implement those practices and policies that were obviously necessary for the protection and safety of children such as C.T.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 146, 153, 160, 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant Deputies that Thornton has merely \"assert[ed] conclusory and vague 'custom and policy' allegations that can only be made against the Sheriff's Office, not the Deputy Defendants in their 'individual capacities.' \" (Doc. # 16 at 8). The allegations that the Defendant Deputies, who are not alleged to be policymakers for the Sheriff's Office, violated C.T.'s constitutional rights by failing to implement certain practices and policies for Student Day does not state a claim. Nor does the Complaint contain other non-conclusory allegations that the Defendant Deputies personally violated C.T.'s constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Counts IX to XII are dismissed for failure to state a claim.
