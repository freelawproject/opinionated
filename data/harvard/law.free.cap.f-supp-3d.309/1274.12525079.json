Plaintiffs-nine Bolivian residents and citizens-are the relatives of eight Bolivian civilians who, it is alleged, were deliberately killed by the Bolivian military.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  The crux of Plaintiffs' claims is that two former high-ranking Bolivian government officials-the former President, Gonzalo Daniel S\u00e1nchez de Lozada S\u00e1nchez Bustamante (\"Defendant Lozada\"), and the former Minister of Defense, Jos\u00e9 Carlos S\u00e1nchez Berza\u00edn (\"Defendant Berza\u00edn\")-masterminded a violent military campaign that led to Plaintiffs' relatives' deaths, all in an effort to quell public opposition to their unpopular political agenda. Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendants personally liable for\n  compensatory and punitive damages under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (\"TVPA\"), Pub. L. No. 102-256,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Stat.%2073\">\n   106 Stat. 73\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (codified at\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n  </extracted-citation>\n  note), and state law.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  Defendants now move for summary judgment. First, Defendants argue that there is no evidence that any of Plaintiffs' relatives were intentionally killed by the Bolivian military. Second, Defendants contend that even if there were evidence that members of the Bolivian military intentionally targeted and killed the decedents, there is no evidence supporting Defendants' indirect liability for those deaths. Third, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' state-law claims fail as a matter of law. Fourth and finally, Defendants say that the claims of two Plaintiffs cannot proceed due to individual deficiencies.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Many of the filings in these cases are redacted versions that were also filed unredacted and under seal.

Plaintiffs' Counterstatement of Material Facts (\"CSMF\") [DE 375-1] \u00b6 205. Less than a week later, on August 14, Commander Herrera approved the \"Manual on the Use of Force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    \u00b6 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Plaintiffs' Ex. BBBB (Resolution 11/02). Among other things, the \"Manual on the Use of Force\" characterized \"roadblocks, marches, [and] demonstrations\" as subversive acts and authorized the use of military force against \"subversive elements trying to prevent Army Units from accomplishing their constitutional missions and the orders received.\" Plaintiffs' Ex. YYY (Manual on the Use of Force at 13-14). It specified, though, that \"[t]he use of legal violence is only justified in situations of extreme necessity, and as a last resort when all appropriate methods of persuasion have failed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Five months later, on January 12, 2003, Commander Herrera released the \"Republic Plan.\" CSMF \u00b6 207. Under this plan, the Bolivian National Army was to \"apply the Principles of Mass and Shock\" to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , remove roadblocks and control civil disturbances. Plaintiffs' Ex. ZZZ (Republic Plan at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   One of Defendant Lozada's policy aims in his second term was to raise domestic revenue by exporting Bolivia's natural gas reserves.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' Ex. BB (Bedoya Dep. Tr. 75:22-78:10). This plan had been initiated by the prior administration. Defendants' Ex. 48 (Berindoague Dep. Tr. 76:22-77:5). The parties dispute whether a decision was ever finalized to export natural gas through Chile. Nevertheless, Defendants concede that \"some members of the public believed that Bolivia was going to sell gas through Chile, and, indeed, to Chile itself.\" SMF \u00b6 16. The plan to export Bolivia's natural gas reserves, and a number of other issues, led to protests in Bolivia in 2003.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' Ex. L (del Granado Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11, 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Peaceful, negotiated solutions to these protests were unsuccessful. Instead, Defendants employed military force on multiple occasions, leading to civilian deaths. For instance, in January 2003, Defendant Lozada participated in negotiations in Cochabamba aimed at addressing rising tensions between coca farmers in the Chapare region of Bolivia and the Bolivian military. Plaintiffs' Ex. B (Albarrac\u00edn Decl. \u00b6 16). The negotiations were initially successful and a tentative agreement was reached; however, after Defendant Berza\u00edn entered the room and indicated his opposition to the tentative agreement, Defendant Lozada changed his position and the deal fell apart.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Bolivian government ultimately employed military force in Chapare, resulting in four deaths and dozens of injuries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In February 2003, the government again employed military force against protesters, this time in Bolivia's capital, La Paz, resulting in 33 deaths, including civilians.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    \u00b6 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Plaintiffs' Ex. L (del Granado Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the mayor of La Paz called Defendant Berza\u00edn to express concern about the violence and the need to pacify the city, Defendant Berza\u00edn said: \"Mayor, if there are 5 dead, it doesn't matter if there are 50 more, as long as we solve the problem.\" Plaintiffs' Ex. L (del Granado Decl. \u00b6 9). Shortly after the events of February 2003, Defendant Berza\u00edn left the government-though he maintains that his resignation was unconnected to the violence. Plaintiffs' Ex. VV (Berza\u00edn Dep. Tr. 106-108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March 2003, in response to the violence of February, the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights of Bolivia-a nongovernmental human rights organization-sought to address the rising tensions in Bolivia by inviting all of the country's political parties and social organizations to a meeting to discuss an agreement to promote national unity. Plaintiffs' Ex. B (Albarrac\u00edn Decl. \u00b6 21). The only political party that did not attend was Defendants' party, the National Revolutionary Movement, which had sent an observer without authority to participate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The meeting failed to produce an agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Events of September 2003 in Sorata and Warisata\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The most significant protests began in September 2003, and by the second week of September, peasant leaders went on a hunger strike in El Alto, Bolivia and began a blockade of roads in the high plateau region (the \"\n   <em>\n    altiplano\n   </em>\n   \"). Plaintiffs' Ex. L (del Granado Decl. \u00b6 11). These roadblocks led to approximately 1,000 tourists in Sorata, Bolivia-there to celebrate a popular annual religious festival-becoming stranded in the town.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 11 (Three Prosecutors' Rep. at 454);\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' Ex. 61 (Ramirez Dep. Tr. 50:8-51:18, 129:18-23). The parties dispute how dire the situation in Sorata became as the blockade continued for over a week, but there is evidence that food supplies were running low and that, while some tourists were able to leave, others were unable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' Ex. 61 (Ramirez Dep.

There is also evidence that diplomatic representatives, concerned for the safety and security of their citizens, demanded that Bolivia's government intervene. Defendants' Ex. 11 (Three Prosecutors' Rep. at 454).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Amidst these rising tensions, Defendant Berza\u00edn had returned to the cabinet as Minister of Defense sometime in August 2003.

Defendants' Ex. 11 (Three Prosecutors' Rep. at 455). Defendant Berza\u00edn also arrived in Sorata on September 20-with Defendant Lozada's authorization-and local community leaders spoke with Defendant Berza\u00edn to discuss a plan to transport people through the roadblocks, including those in Warisata, without military interference.

Defendant Berza\u00edn, who was in ongoing contact with Defendant Lozada, rejected the non-military alternative, stating to the community leaders that there were orders from the government to remove the tourists \"the good way or the bad way\" and that \"if you oppose this, you will face consequences.\" Plaintiffs' Ex.

Plaintiffs originally filed two separate suits on the same day in September 2007. Defendant Berza\u00edn was sued in this Court, while Defendant Lozada was sued in the District of Maryland. The District of Maryland eventually transferred Defendant Lozada's case to this Court, where it was consolidated with Defendant Berza\u00edn's case. Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against both Defendants stating claims under the TVPA, the Alien Tort Statute (\"ATS\"), and state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants moved for dismissal, and this Court disposed of that motion by way of two separate orders.

And while Plaintiffs are correct that Rule 803\"makes no exception for tentative or interim reports subject to revision and review,\" CSMF \u00b6 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Toole v.

Thus, the Three Prosecutors' Report is unlike the FDA report that was excluded in\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   , as that FDA report contained only \" 'proposed' findings\" and specifically \"invited public comment and forecasted the issuance of a 'final' document after more study.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11964808\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/1430/#p1434\">\n    999 F.2d at 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Additionally, the fact that the Three Prosecutors' Report was subsequently disregarded\n   by different prosecutors who were appointed-seemingly for political reasons-to replace its authors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Ex. SSS (Resolution No. 091/04, Revocation of Rejection Resolution 16/04), is no reason to find that the Report falls outside the Rule 803(8)(A)(iii) exception. Plaintiffs offer no support for the proposition that a final investigatory report is outside of this exception merely because subsequent litigation occurs. In any event, the Court does not accord great weight to the Bolivian government's decision to disregard the Three Prosecutors' Report, as that decision appears to have been politically motivated to support the popular view that members of Defendant Lozada's Military High Command should be tried for their role in the events of September and October 2003, despite the recommendation to the contrary contained in the Three Prosecutors' Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 102 (Ltr. from Three Pros. to Inter-American Commission on Human Rights at 524-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs are simply incorrect that the Three Prosecutors' Report fails to explain the evidentiary basis for its conclusions or the investigative efforts involved in the production of the Report. The Report describes how its conclusions are the product of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , field work performed at over 17 locations, witness interviews, the collection of physical evidence and written statements, and ballistics analyses. Defendants' Ex. 11 (Three Prosecutors' Rep. at 468-473). In sum, the Court finds that the Three Prosecutors' Report falls under the Rule 803(8)(A)(iii) exception and that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that it is not trustworthy. Not only do Plaintiffs fail to offer any valid reasons as to why the Three Prosecutors' Report is untrustworthy, but the fact that the prosecutors affirmed their findings, even after they were subject to \"all manner of intimidation, threats, insults, and attacks on [their] dignity and [their] lives\" for \"fail[ing] to present the conclusions that would have been politically expedient for the government,\" suggests that the Report is the product of an impartial investigation and sufficiently trustworthy.

In contrast with the Three Prosecutors' Report discussed above, none of the military and police reports relied upon by Defendants appear to set out \"factual findings from a legally authorized investigation\" as required for admissibility under Rule 803(8)(A)(iii). Defendants argue, however, that the authors of these reports were legally bound to report the matters described therein, and that the reports are therefore admissible under Rule 803(8)(A)(ii).

Rather, the report repeatedly and expressly conveys what has been reported by third-parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 15 (Police Intelligence Rep. at 797) (\"[R]ight now, clashes are being reported.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 806 (stating that after soldiers intervened in an incident, \"[o]ne person was reported injured\n   as a result\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 807 (Stating that a military contingent \"continue[s] to be attacked with dynamite and gunfire, allegedly from Mauser rifles.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 821 (Stating that \"[t]here are reportedly four people ... who have been wounded as a result of all the clashes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The other police report relied upon by Defendants (Defendants' Ex. 35) fares no better. Like the Police Intelligence Report, it is clearly based not on the preparer's personal observations, but on the hearsay statements of others. It also describes an encounter between the military-not the police-and civilians, and is expressly based upon the statements of third-party witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 35 (Police Rep. at 9747) (noting that the report is based in part on \"a statement made by Mr. Agust\u00edn Sirpa Ortiz, (witness),\" that \"it was reported that ... Captain Belmonte declared ...,\" and noting the existence of statements from five additional witnesses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, the military reports-Defendants' Exhibit 32 (Social Conflict Field Diary) and Defendants' Exhibit 33 (Military Intelligence Rep.)-do not fall under the Rule 803(8) public records exception either. The \"Social Conflict Field Diary\" describes in detail-over the course of approximately forty pages-military operations from September 11, 2003 to October 21, 2003 in a multitude of different locations in Bolivia, yet it is only signed by one person: Brigadier General Miguel Angel Vidaurre Noriega.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 32 (Social Conflict Field Diary at 5354). It is unclear whether Brigadier General Noriega is the sole preparer of the Social Conflict Field Diary, but regardless, the observations contained therein could not conceivably have been obtained without the statements of third-parties who were actually on the ground in the numerous encounters described. Similarly, the Military Intelligence Report (Defendants' Ex. 33) is only signed by one person and describes a number of clashes in different areas of Bolivia in October 2003. There is no attribution as to the source of any of the information described in the Military Intelligence Report, but again, it is safe to say that the this information is not based on the knowledge or observations of the preparer of the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As indicated above, Defendants argue that if the Court refuses to admit the military and police reports under Rules 803(6) or 803(8), the Court should admit these exhibits under the Rule 807 residual exception. Rule 807 provides that, even if a statement fails to fall under an exception in Rule 803 or 804, it is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (1) the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (3) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (4) admitting it will best serve the purposes of these rules and the interests of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Fed. R. Evid. 807(a). \"Congress intended the residual hearsay exception to be used very rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances, and it applies only when certain exceptional guarantees of trustworthiness exist and when high degrees of probativeness and necessity are present.\"\n   <em>\n    United Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3332347\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/1260/#p1278\">\n    556 F.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court cannot find that \"equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\" exist with respect to the military and police reports. Defendants argue that the military reports bear \"reliability indicia\" because they \"are signed by their authors and bear the seal of the Bolivian military.\" Reply SMF \u00b6 45. But\n   that is far from enough for the Court to find that \"exceptional guarantees of trustworthiness exist\" with respect to reports prepared by the military concerning highly controversial and highly publicized clashes between the military and civilians that resulted in numerous civilian deaths and led to criminal charges in Bolivia against many former military officers. The same is true with respect to the police reports. While Defendants argue that \"the police officers had no incentive to provide false information,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83, the fact remains that the police reports concern an exceptionally fraught time in Bolivia with respect to relations between the government and its citizens in general. Moreover, much of the information in the police reports appears to have originated from the military.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that if the Court refuses to admit the military and police records under a hearsay exception, it should consider these reports for the non-hearsay purpose of the effect they had on Defendant Lozada and his decision to order military involvement in September and October 2003. Reply SMF \u00b6 45. The Court agrees that this is a potentially proper non-hearsay purpose for admission of the military and police reports. But at least at the summary judgment stage, the Court cannot consider the military and police reports for this purpose because there is no evidence in the record showing that Defendant Lozada specifically relied upon any of the military and police reports being offered by Defendants prior to making any of the decisions at issue in these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    U.S. State Department Cables\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs object to Defendants' reliance on five U.S. State Department cables (Defendants' Exs. 1-5) and argue that the cables are hearsay. CSMF \u00b6 38. Defendants counter that the cables are admissible under either the Rule 803(6) business records exception, the Rule 803(8) public records exception, or the Rule 807 residual exception. Reply SMF \u00b6 38. For many of the same reasons discussed above in connection with the Bolivian military and police reports, the Court finds that the State Department cables are hearsay and are not admissible under the exceptions listed in Rules 803 or 807.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Starting with the business records exception, Defendants have failed to lay a foundation for admission of the State Department cables under Rule 803(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section V.B.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , The cables also do not fall under the Rule 803(8) public records exception because, like the police and military reports, they are clearly based not on the preparer's personal observations, but on the statements of others. For instance, with respect to the shootings in Warisata in September 2003, the cables do not appear to relay what an embassy official actually observed on the ground, but they simply report the Bolivian military's position-that the military convoy was ambushed-and then note that the \"Campesino version is that the security forces fire[d] first at llabaya, outside Warisata ....\" Defendants Ex. 1 (State Department Cable at 27). Many of the cables are also based on media reports, which are obviously themselves hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants Ex. 2 (State Department Cable at 32-34). While the Court does not rule out the possibility that some portions of the State Department cables are based on the observations of the (unidentified) preparer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   these statements are immaterial to the Court's analysis and are substantially\n   duplicative of other evidence that the Court has considered, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Three Prosecutors' Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the statements contained in the State Department cables may not be admitted under the Rule 807 residual exception, albeit for a different reason than the Bolivian military and police records fail to qualify for admission under Rule 807. Specifically, the Court finds that while the cables do bear exceptional guarantees of trustworthiness, they still may not be admitted under the residual exception because they are not \"more probative on the point for which [they are] offered than any other evidence that the [Defendants] can obtain through reasonable efforts.\" Fed. R. Evid. 807(a)(3). With respect to trustworthiness, the Court finds it sufficient that the cables are signed by the then-U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia and identified as Department of State materials, as the Court agrees with Defendants that the State Department had no incentive to do anything but report the situation in Bolivia fairly and accurately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, as noted above, Rule 807 still requires that, in addition to a showing of trustworthiness, the proponent show that the document offered is more probative than any other evidence on the point for which it is offered than the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts. Defendants only argue that this is true with respect to the State Department cables \"because the U.S. government denied Defendants' request to depose the Ambassador.\" Reply SMF \u00b6 38. But Defendants' inability to depose the Ambassador does not preclude Defendants from attempting to obtain other evidence concerning the events described in the State Department cables, and indeed, Defendants have done so in many cases. Moreover, Defendants have failed to show an inability to reasonably obtain other evidence with respect to any specific point for which they offer a State Department cable, though the Court does not rule out the possibility that Defendants may be able to make such a showing at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Hayden's Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court briefly notes that Defendants have moved to exclude the testimony of a number of Plaintiffs' experts, including, most relevant to the instant Motion, Phillip P. Hayden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 337. Mr. Hayden reviewed ballistics evidence of the shootings at issue in these cases, conducted witness interviews and site visits, and opines that the decedents in these cases were intentionally shot and killed by members of the Bolivian military.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 337-4 (Report of Phillip P. Hayden). Defendants contend that Mr. Hayden's testimony is inadmissible, and even if it were admissible, it \"cannot alone defeat summary judgment.\" DE 342-1 at 23. The Court will address Defendants' motion to exclude Mr. Hayden's testimony in a separate order, because as explained below, Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence to raise genuine disputes of material fact even without consideration of Mr. Hayden's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court will now address the merits of Defendants' summary judgment Motion. As noted above, Defendants make four main challenges to Plaintiffs' claims. First, Defendants assert that, based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable jury could not conclude that any of the eight decedents' deaths meet the TVPA's definition of an extrajudicial killing. Second, Defendants say that there is no evidence by which they could be held indirectly liable for decedents' deaths. Third, Defendants raise an assortment of challenges to the legal viability of Plaintiffs' wrongful death claims. And fourth, Defendants assert that the claims of Plaintiffs Sonia Espejo Villalobos and Gonzalo Mamani Aguilar contain\n   various deficiencies. The Court will consider each point in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Extrajudicial Killings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   1. Legal Principals\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The TVPA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   An individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or color of foreign nation ... subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to the individual's legal representative, or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   TVPA \u00a7 2(a)(2). The statute goes on to define the term \"extrajudicial killing\" to mean \"a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(a). Excluded from the statute's coverage is \"any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   A deliberated killing, the Eleventh Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Mamani III\n   </em>\n   , is one that is \"undertaken with studied consideration and purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825383\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1148/\">\n    654 F.3d at 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liability does not attach, however, if the deaths \"could plausibly have been the result of precipitate shootings during an ongoing civil uprising.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825383\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1148/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nor does liability exist if the deaths \"are compatible with accidental or negligent shooting (including mistakenly identifying a target as a person who did pose a threat to others), individual motivations (personal reasons) not linked to defendants, and so on.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825383\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1148/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   2. Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   With the principles set out above in view, the Court now considers whether a reasonable jury could conclude that decedents were victims of extrajudicial killings, as that term is defined by the TVPA. Defendants argue that the record evidence does not support a finding that each of the deaths at issue here were deliberated because there is no evidence of the specific individual who shot each decedent, much less evidence concerning the shooter's intent. Defendants also contend that TVPA liability does not attach because each shooting is compatible with an accidental or negligent shooting. Plaintiffs dispute that evidence identifying the shooter and his state of mind is required, and assert that the deliberated nature of each killing is shown by the evidence that the deaths at issue resulted from implementation of Defendants' plan to use military force to kill civilians. Plaintiffs also say that the circumstances of each death at least raise a genuine dispute about whether each killing was intentional, as opposed to accidental or negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to raise a jury question as to whether decedents' deaths were extrajudicial killings under the TVPA. First, a reasonable jury, considering the evidence of Defendants' plan to kill civilians to quash public opposition to their policies, could find that decedents' deaths were deliberated because they were the expected and desired outcome of this plan. Given the totality of the evidence in this case, this is not, as Defendants\n   contend, a speculative inference. Rather, it is a reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence of: (1) changes in Bolivian military doctrine during Defendant Lozada's administration to define protesters as subversives who could be targeted with military force; (2) a pattern of soldiers being ordered to shoot unarmed civilians in multiple different locations, including each location where decedents were killed, on multiple different dates; (3) a pattern of soldiers shooting indiscriminately at civilians at times when witnesses saw no armed protesters or anything indicating that the soldiers were firing defensively; (4) Defendants' repeated refusal to seriously commit to achieving peaceful, negotiated solutions to protests; and (5) consistent with Defendants' plan, the utilization of troops from eastern Bolivia. From this evidence, the Court must, at the summary judgment stage, draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. And in so doing, the Court finds that there is a genuine dispute as to whether the deaths at issue here resulted from the implementation of Defendants' plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court is satisfied that a showing that decedents' deaths resulted from implementation of Defendants' plan is sufficient to show that these were deliberated killings under the TVPA. Plaintiffs need not, as Defendants argue, identify the specific soldier who fired each lethal shot and introduce evidence regarding what that soldier was \"doing, seeing, hearing, ... processing,\" or thinking at the time of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 342-1 at 18. As Plaintiffs note, superior officers are consistently held liable under the TVPA for the acts of their subordinates, whether the subordinates can be identified or not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hilao v.

But that intent need not necessarily be shown with evidence regarding each individual shooter's state of mind.

Even though there is evidence in this case that, in certain of the areas where decedents were killed, there was an isolated shot at the military or, in other locations, a more substantial clash between the military and armed protesters, this does not foreclose a jury from reasonably finding that decedents were intentionally killed by the military-as opposed to by an armed protester, a member of the military who believed he was shooting at an armed protester, or a member of the military who was shooting at an armed protester but accidentally or negligently struck one of the decedents. A jury could reasonably make this determination by weighing the evidence of, on the one hand, the proximity of decedents' deaths to any armed conflict and the nature of same and, on the other hand, the evidence of the location and actions of troops in relation to where decedents were shot. For instance, a jury could reasonably find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a decedent was intentionally killed by the military-notwithstanding evidence showing an isolated shot at the military a significant distance away from the killing and at an earlier point in time-because of evidence that troops were ordered to shoot, and did shoot, indiscriminately at civilians in the immediate vicinity of the decedent at the time of his or her death and an absence of evidence of armed protesters in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Sufficient evidence to make such a finding exists with respect to each decedent. For instance, while there is evidence that the military convoy in Warisata was fired upon from the hills on September 20, 2003, there is also evidence that troops indiscriminately shot at civilians, into houses, and at windows in this area when they were no longer facing any armed opposition. A jury could certainly consider this evidence, the evidence of the distance between Decedent Marlene Mamani's home and the location of the earlier clash between the military and armed protesters, and the evidence of troop movement outside of Decedent Marlene Mamani's home at the time of her death, and reasonably conclude that she was intentionally killed by the Bolivian military while looking out the window of her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Similarly, with respect to the decedents killed in El Alto on October 12, 2003, while there is some evidence of violent acts committed by protesters on this day, there is also evidence that troops indiscriminately shot at unarmed civilians-and were not being fired upon by armed protesters when doing so-in the locations where Decedent Ayala, Decedent Teodosia Mamani, Decedent Lucero, and Decedent Cutipa\n   were killed. Additionally, for Decedent Ayala, a jury could also find that he was intentionally killed by the military based on the evidence that a witness saw a man dressed similar to Decedent Ayala shot near several soldiers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although Decedent Teodosia Mamani was shot through the wall of her home, a jury could still find that this was not an accidental or negligent shooting because it resulted from the implementation of Defendants' plan to kill civilians. There is evidence that this plan was implemented by soldiers shooting indiscriminately in areas with high concentrations of civilians, and a jury could reasonably find that the death of a civilian due to a shot fired through the wall of a home was the expected and desired outcome of this plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Finally, there is also sufficient evidence that the decedents killed on October 13, 2003 in the Southern Zone of La Paz-Decedent Arturo Mamani, Decedent Roque, and Decedent Marquez-were intentionally killed by the Bolivian military. Plaintiff Gonzalo Mamani Aguilar was present at the location where his father, Decedent Arturo Mamani, and Decedent Roque were shot. Mr. Mamani Aguilar testified that the military was firing towards him and shooting in different directions when Decedent Arturo Mamani and Decedent Roque were shot and killed. While Defendants have submitted evidence that a soldier was shot on October 13 in a different location, there is no evidence that there were armed protesters in the location where Decedent Arturo Mamani and Decedent Roque were at the time they were shot. The same is true with respect to the shooting of Decedent Marquez in Ovejuyo on October 13. Defendants' evidence of violence in other locations on this day does not create a genuine dispute that soldiers were indiscriminately shooting at unarmed civilians in Ovejuyo. Moreover, an eyewitness places several soldiers-shooting \"in all directions\"-in the immediate vicinity of Decedent Marquez when he was shot, and Defendants have introduced no evidence of armed protesters in Ovejuyo at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In sum, based on the evidence regarding the facts and circumstances of each shooting, a jury could reasonably conclude that each decedent was killed by a member of the Bolivian military and that the shootings were not accidental or negligent, \"precipitate shootings during an ongoing civil uprising,\" or shootings based on \"individual motivations ... not linked to defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Mamani III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825383\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1148/\">\n    654 F.3d at 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Secondary Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   It is firmly established that the TVPA \"contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing.\"\n   <em>\n    Mohamad v.

Defendant Lozada\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As President, Defendant Lozada was Captain General of the Armed Forces. The Bolivian Constitution in effect in 2003 provided that \"[t]he Armed Forces are subordinate to the President of the Republic and receive their orders administratively through the Minister of Defense, and in technical matters, from the Commander in Chief.\" Defendants' Ex. 10 (Bol. Const. art. 210) ). The Organic Law vested in the President the power to address domestic unrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 36 (Organic Law art. 8). Operational coordination of the military was accomplished by the Commander in Chief, an entity defined by the Organic Law as \"the highest Command and Decision-making body of a technical/operating nature, for the permanent coordination and direction of the Armed Forces.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437505\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/1283/#p1286\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art 36. One member of that body-also given the title Commander in Chief-received his orders directly from the President.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437505\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/1283/#p1286\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   According to Defendants, the Bolivian Constitution and the Organic Law's textual commitments of power to the President were all form but little substance. The President, Defendants say, could only issue\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   orders. Because the operationalization of the President's orders could only be achieved by the Commander in Chief, it follows (as Defendants would have it) that the President lacked effective control over the soldiers on the ground during the events at issue in these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Court disagrees. A reasonable jury could conclude, based on Defendant Lozada's legal powers as President and the\n   manner in which he exercised those powers, that he had effective control over the Armed Forces. As detailed above, the orders issued by Defendant Lozada to the Commander in Chief-namely, the September 20, 2003 decree directing the military into Warisata and Supreme Decree 27209 issued on September 11, 2003-led directly to orders by the Commander in Chief-specifically, Directive 27/03 on September 20 and Directives 33/03 and 34/03 on October 12-that in turn produced the military action resulting in the alleged extrajudicial killings of Plaintiffs' decedents. This action aligned closely with Defendants' previously-formulated plan to violently suppress opposition to their political agenda. Thus, especially when considered in connection with the other evidence in this case suggesting that Defendants deliberately put their plan in motion once in power, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the changes in military policy relating to civil disobedience (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"Manual on Use of Force\" and the Republic Plan), a reasonable inference can be drawn that Defendant Lozada used his authority as President to direct the Armed Forces to implement the military operations that led to decedents' deaths. And because such an inference can made with regard to Defendant Lozada's orders, it follows that he could have taken similar actions to prevent the alleged criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   While Defendant Lozada's ability to prevent the military's criminal conduct is enough on its own to establish a superior-subordinate relationship,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court is of the view that Plaintiffs have also created a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant Lozada had the ability to punish guilty troops. Defendants insist that \"any investigation or prosecution of guilty troops would have occurred through the military justice process, or in civilian courts, at the request of the Office of the Chief Prosecutor,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Attorney General, which is independent from the executive branch.\" DE 342-1 at 28. But Defendants cite no Bolivian legal sources for this proposition. Instead, they point to a May 2003 report by the Organization of American States and a 2003 U.S. State Department report on human rights practices in Bolivia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SMF \u00b6 184 (citing Defendants' Ex. 7 (OAS Rep. at 90) and Defendants' Ex. 16 (U.S. State Dep't Rep. on Human Rights Practices-2003 at 3432, 3425). Neither report says anything about the President's independence from the Office of the Chief Prosecutor. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, note that Defendant Lozada testified in his deposition that, on several occasions in September and October 2003, he appointed special prosecutors to investigate reports of unarmed civilians being shot by the military.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   b. Defendant Berza\u00edn\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As noted above, under the Bolivian Constitution in force in 2003, the Armed Forces \"receive[d] their orders administratively through the Minister of Defense.\" Defendants' Ex. 10 (Bol. Const. art. 210).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Additionally, the Organic Law vested the Minister of Defense with authority to \"plan, organize, direct and supervise Civil Defense in the National Territory.\" Defendants' Ex. 36 (Organic Law, Article 22). Defendants describe the Minister of Defense as little more than an administrative figurehead, lacking any meaningful authority-legal or otherwise-to control military operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The record evidence tells a different story. As detailed above, Defendant Berza\u00edn played a hands-on role in the planning and implementation of the events of September 20, 2003 and October 12 and 13, 2003. With regard to the September 20 events, it was Defendant Berza\u00edn who-having traveled to Sorata with Defendant Lozada's authorization-rejected a compromise with community leaders in favor of a military alternative, saying that he would remove the tourists from Sorata \"the good way or the bad way.\" Plaintiffs' Ex. N (Garcia Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10); Plaintiffs' Ex. RR (Lozada Dep. Tr. 216:7-18); Plaintiffs' Ex. W (Berza\u00edn Dep. Tr. 122:11-13). Defendant Berza\u00edn then ordered military officers to look for bus drivers to transport the tourists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Later, as the military convoy escorted the tourists from Sorata to La Paz, by way of Warisata, Defendant Berza\u00edn spoke on the phone with Defendant Lozada just before Defendant Lozada issued an order to the acting Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces directing the use of \"necessary force\" to restore order in Warisata.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   And with regard to the events of October 12 and 13, Defendant Berza\u00edn played a key role in organizing the operation to use the military to transport gas from the Senkata gas plant to La Paz. On the evening of October 10, Defendant Berza\u00edn held a meeting at the Ministry of Defense with top military officers and leaders from the La Paz Gas Stations Association. Plaintiffs' Ex. O (Loza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 15-16). It was at that meeting that Defendant Berza\u00edn not only nodded in response to-and, a jury could reasonably conclude, approved-a general's proposal to use the military to transport gasoline, but also was present as the operation was planned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. And the following day, Supreme Decree 27209 directed Defendant Berza\u00edn to \"establish the mechanisms necessary\" for the Armed Forces to execute its mission to transport gas from Senkata to La Paz. Defendants' Ex. 6 (Supreme Decree No. 27209 at 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Although Defendant Berza\u00edn's actions are open to some interpretation, Plaintiffs have adduced sufficient evidence by which a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Berza\u00edn exercised such control over the Bolivian Armed Forces that he was complicit in the extrajudicial killings of decedents. Defendant Berza\u00edn's role in planning and executing the operations of September 20 and October 12 and 13 indicate that he could have prevented the actions of any guilty troops.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   That a reasonably jury could hold Defendants liable under the doctrine of command responsibility will not result in \"strict liability akin to respondeat superior for national leaders at the top of the long chain of command in a case like this one.\"\n   <em>\n    Mamani III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825383\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1148/\">\n    654 F.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Now, after a new round of pleading and nearly a year of discovery, Plaintiffs have adduced evidence showing that-even before taking office-Defendants formulated a plan to use lethal force to kill civilians in an effort to quell opposition to their political agenda. Based on the alignment of Defendants' plan with the events of September 20, 2003 and October 12 and 13, 2003-together with other evidence detailed above-a reasonable jury could conclude the Bolivian military committed extrajudicial killings under the TVPA and that Defendants, having a superior relationship to the soldiers who committed those killings, should be held liable under the doctrine of command responsibility.

Early in this litigation, the Court invited the Departments of Justice and State to file briefs expressing the views of the United States on \"the interpretation and application of the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act, and the possible foreign policy repercussions\" of these cases. DE 60. On October 21, 2008, the United States filed a Notice informing the Court that it took \"no position on those issues at this time,\" but that it would \"continue to monitor this litigation.\" DE 107 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Attached to the Notice was a letter from the Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture notifying the Secretary of State that \"the fact that a Court of the United States of America is adjudicating a complaint against [Defendant Lozada and Defendant Berza\u00edn] does not cause any disruption or change in the diplomatic relations between Bolivia and the United States of America.\" DE 107-1 at 4. The United States and the Bolivian government have not, to date, indicated any change in their respective positions on this litigation. Given those positions, even assuming the foreign affairs doctrine applied here, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' wrongful death suits are not preempted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   2. Indirect Liability Under Bolivian Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' wrongful death claims fail because Bolivian law does not recognize a civil claim for those\n   injured by criminal conduct based on indirect liability. Specifically, Defendants assert that, while the Bolivian Penal Code imposes criminal liability upon \"mediate perpetrators\"-\"person[s] who use[ ] another as an instrument,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a person who uses an agent to commit an aspect of the crime\"-mediate perpetrator liability is not available for Bolivian civil liability. DE 342-1 at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   This argument warrants little discussion. It is based solely on the fact that one article of the Bolivian Penal Code uses the term \"perpetrator\" but does not also specifically mention \"mediate perpetrators\" as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 75 (Bol. Penal Code art. 273) (\"A person who, with the intent of causing bodily damage or damage to health, causes the death of a person unintended by the perpetrator but which could have been foreseen shall be punished by imprisonment of from THREE to EIGHT years.\"). But Defendants concede that, under Bolivian law, the criminal code informs civil liability. And Article 14 of the Bolivian Code of Criminal Procedure establishes that a civil action arises \"from the commission\n   <em>\n    of every crime\n   </em>\n   .\" Plaintiffs' Ex. AAA (Bol. Code Crim. P. art. 14 (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Ex. 75 (Bol. Penal Code art. 87) (\"Any person criminally liable is also civilly liable and is obligated to pay reparations for the material and non-material damages caused by the crime.\"). Moreover, the Bolivian Code of Criminal Procedure specifies that a civil action \"for the reparations or compensation for damages and injuries caused by [a] crime, may be initiated by the injured party, against the perpetrator\n   <em>\n    and the participants\n   </em>\n   of the crime.\" Plaintiffs' Ex. AAA (Bol. Code Crim. P. art. 36 (emphasis added) ). Based on this authority, the Court concludes that Defendants have failed to show that Bolivian law does not recognize a civil claim based on indirect liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   3. Preclusion Based on Pendency of Criminal Charges\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs' wrongful death claims are precluded because when Defendants brought these claims in 2007, a criminal case-the Trial of Responsibilities-was pending against Defendants in Bolivia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, Defendants cite to Article 37 of Bolivia's Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that \"[a] civil action can be pursued in the criminal proceedings under special rules or may be filed with the civil courts, but cannot be pursued simultaneously in both jurisdictions.\" Defendants' Ex. 76 (Bol. Code Crim. P. art. 37). Defendants further note that Bolivian law prohibits the resolution of civil cases based on criminal conduct \"while the pending criminal proceedings have not been resolved,\" except in certain enumerated circumstances, including when \"the criminal proceedings have been ordered suspended due to default.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20Fed.%20Appx.%207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 38.

While this rule would seem to have prohibited Plaintiffs from, for example, simultaneously pursuing their civil claims \"under special rules\" as part of the Trial of Responsibilities and in a separate civil case, that is irrelevant because there\n   is no indication that Plaintiffs have pursued their civil claims anywhere but in this Court. Article 38 of the Bolivian Code of Criminal Procedure does not support Defendants' argument either. While it is somewhat ambiguous, the rule seems to only preclude a court from finally disposing of a civil case prior to the resolution of the pending criminal proceedings-it does not seem to bar the assertion of a civil claim prior to the resolution of the criminal proceeding, so long as the criminal proceeding is resolved first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20Fed.%20Appx.%207\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 38) (\"When the action for reparations is initiated in the civil courts, a sentence cannot be handed down in this jurisdiction while the pending criminal proceedings have not been resolved ....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, Defendants have failed to show that Plaintiffs' wrongful death claims are barred because of the fact that, when they were initially asserted in 2007, the criminal proceedings against Defendants were still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Individual Deficiencies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Defendants take the position that various individual deficiencies preclude the claims of Plaintiffs Sonia Espejo Villalobos and Gonzalo Mamani Aguilar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   1.

Thus, even assuming that Ms. Espejo's common-law marriage to Decedent Gandarilla would not be recognized under Florida law, because she would be a proper representative for Decedent Gandarilla in a civil action brought under Bolivian law, she may serve as a TVPA plaintiff here.
