Petitioners registered the default judgment in the Southern District of New York and petitioned for an order requiring various banks to turnover blocked EFTs in which the Republic of Sudan, its agencies, or its instrumentalities had an interest. (Dkt. 1 at 70-72; Dkt. 39; Dkt. 138). The petition identified BNYM as the holder of an EFT originated by, and believed to belong to, the Central Bank, an agency or instrumentality of the Republic of Sudan. (Dkt. 138-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BNYM filed an interpleader petition and provided notice to the Central Bank. (Dkt. 217; Dkt. 368). After the time to respond to the interpleader petition had expired without the Central Bank appearing, BNYM and petitioners entered into a stipulation of facts establishing that the blocked EFT was subject to turnover. (Dkt. 506). The Court accepted the stipulated facts and ordered BNYM to turnover the EFT to petitioners pursuant to section 201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (\"TRIA\"), Pub. L.

(Dkt. 535). Rather, the Central Bank, in a payment order, instructed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\"FRBNY\") to route the EFT through BNYM, which was to then transfer the EFT to Al Shamal Khartoum, a bank where the Sudanese Libyan Investment and Development Company (the intended beneficiary) held an account. (Dkt. 533 at 4; Dkt. 535-6). Once BNYM received the EFT, it did not execute the order because the Libyan Sanction Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 550, precluded it from doing so. (Dkt. 533 at 5). BNYM subsequently placed the EFT in a new blocked account pursuant to the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 538, where the EFT now rests. (Dkt. 138 \u00b6 45; Dkt. 533 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This evidence, however, does not establish that the Court lacked jurisdiction to order the turnover of the EFT. If the EFT is not a blocked asset of the Central Bank\n   under the TRIA, then it is also not \"property in the United States of a foreign state\" that is \"immune from attachment[,] arrest[,] and execution.\" In\n   <em>\n    Calderon-Cardona v. Bank of N.Y.

It follows that the EFT would also not be \"property in the United States of a foreign state\" entitled to immunity under the FSIA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201609\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as \"words repeated in different parts of the same statute generally have the same meaning,\"\n   <em>\n    Law v.

Thus, if the Court accepts the Central Bank's argument, then the EFT would not be immune from execution under the FSIA, and the execution of the judgment against the EFT would implicate concerns only on the merits of the turnover order-not the jurisdictional concerns necessary to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(4), Fed. R. Civ. P.-because the EFT would not fall within the strictures of section 1609.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FSIA also affords foreign states, their agencies, and their instrumentalities immunity \"from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States,\" but the Court did not need jurisdiction over the Central Bank to order BNYM to turnover the EFT.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the normal course, a cancellation obligates the receiving bank to refund the bank from which it received the EFT, and the originator may collect only from the bank it initially sent the EFT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20Law%20%C2%A7%204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4-A-402(4);\n   <em>\n    Grain Traders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11666756\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/97/#p101\">\n    160 F.3d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, generally, the U.C.C. requires an \"orderly unraveling of a funds transfer\" when a cancellation occurs, meaning that each entity involved in the transfer can recover only from the entity to which it directly passed the EFT). To place this in more concrete terms, FRBNY would normally be the only entity that could recover from BNYM, and the Central Bank would generally be allowed to recover only from FRBNY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But that is not the case when the originator directs the bank that receives the payment order to route the EFT through a specific intermediary bank. If that occurs, and the intermediary bank \"is obliged to refund payment\" because the transfer is canceled \"but is unable to do so because [a refund is] not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments,\" then the bank that transferred the funds to the intermediary bank in compliance with the payment order \"is entitled to receive or retain payment from the [originator],\" and the originator \"is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund,\" shifting the risk of loss to the originator.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20Law%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    N.Y.

In other words, the originator is substituted for the transferring bank and becomes the only entity with a property interest in the held EFT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, the Central Bank instructed FRBNY to transfer the EFT to BNYM. Although FRBNY, as the entity that directly transferred the EFT to the intermediary bank that now holds the EFT, would normally be the only entity with a property interest in the EFT, the Central Bank is subrogated to that right because it directed FRBNY to route the EFT through BNYM, leaving the Central Bank as \"the only entity with a property interest in the stopped EFT.\"\n   <em>\n    Hausler\n   </em>\n   , 770 F.3d at 212 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Calderon-Cardona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267839\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/993/#p1002\">\n    770 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1002 ).

Subrogation of an originator under New\n   York law applies only when the originator specifies the use of the intermediary bank that cancels the EFT, and it applies only when the intermediary bank is precluded from refunding the payment. Of course, an erroneous attachment might occur, which would operate to cancel the EFT and give rise to a right to refund, but the Second Circuit has made clear that the cancellation of an EFT through an erroneous attachment order does not allow a creditor to attach a property interest that exists solely through mistake.\n   <em>\n    Allied Mar., Inc. v.
