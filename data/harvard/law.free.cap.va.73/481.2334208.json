Ordinarily a partnership estate is liable to the payment of the debts of the firm in preference of the individual debts of the partners. This is the right of the partners <em>inter se. </em>The creditors of the partnership have no such right of priority over the creditor of the partners individually; but only by substitution to the rights of the partners <em>inter se. </em>The partners may release this right, and the creditors of the partnership can not complain ; for it is not their right, except subject to the disposition and control of the partners themselves, to whom it belongs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-12\">2. When one partner sells out to another the former's interest in the partnership, the question, whether the former has a right after the sale to require the partnership estate to be applied to the partnership debts in his exoneration, depends upon the true meaning of the contract of sale in this respect. Under the contract in this case, the vendor has a right to have all the assets of the partnership so applied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-13\">3. S, the partner who purchased the assets, and bound himself to pay the debts of the partnership, dies, leaving debts unpaid, and leaving assets of the former partnership, which go into the hands of his administrator c. t. a.; and this administrator files his bill against the widow and children to have a construction of the will, and to administer the estate under the control of the court. The outgoing partner may file his petition in the cause, to have the assets of the partnership which have gone into the hands of said administrator, applied to the payment of the partnership debts; and for this purpose to have an account of said assets.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-14\">4. The security of the said administrator not being sufficient, the court may appoint a receiver to receive from said administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>tor the partnership assets in his hands, and to proceed to collect the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b506-12\">5. If the security of the receiver is not sufficient, the court may make a rule upon him to show cause why he should not give other sureties, and upon his failure to show cause, may remove him. And it must very plainly appear that the court below erred before the appellate court will reverse its action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b506-14\">6. An account of the assets collected by the receiver having been \"ordered and taken, showing the amount collected, after deducting an amount claimed by the receiver for fees as counsel in collecting the assets, the court, without deciding on his right to a credit for the fees, directs him to pay the amount after deducting the fees into bank. Another account is taken showing a further amount collected by him. And it appearing that he had not complied with the previous decree, the court may set aside that decree, remove him from his office of receiver, and appoint another in his place, and direct him to pay to the second receiver the amount he has collected, and to deliver to the second receiver all partnership assets in his hands. And may further direct that if he does not so pay over the funds in his hands, counsel named shall proceed to bring a suit against him and his sureties on his bond as receiver.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b506-16\">7.

Catlett Gibson, administrator d. b. n. w. w. a. of B. H. Shackelford; deceased, in which it is stated, in substance, among other things, that said B. H. Shackelford died on the 18th of May, 1870, leaving a widow, Rebecca B. Shackelford, and six infant children surviving him\u2014the names of the children being J. Green, Howard (over fourteen years of age), George S., Lucy, Annie and Muscoe G. Shackelford (the last four under fourteen years of age); that by the will of said B. H. Shackelford, which was duly admitted to probate in the county court of said county on the 23d of May, 1870, and of which an office copy, marked A, is filed with the bill, the said Rebecca B. was appointed sole executrix, and qualified as such at the May term of said court in 1870; that said Rebecca B. renounced her position as executrix at the February term of said court in 1871, and said plaintiff was appointed by said court administrator d. b. n. w. w. a. of said B. H. Shackelford, deceased, and qualified as such on the 27th day of February, 1871; that the plaintiff submits the construction of said will and all questions which may arise under it to the court; that at the time of the testator\u2019s death he was seized and possessed of a considerable estate, real and personal, but the same is greatly encumbered with debt\u2014:the real estate, though valuable, if sold in the then condition of the land market, would entail great loss on those interested in it. And the personal estate consisted mainly of choses in action, which required time and good management for collection, but which the plaintiff considered would be amply sufficient to discharge the debts of the estate in five years; and that for the protection of said plaintiff and the best inlerests of said estate, he desired that the assets and liabilities of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>estate should be ascertained and reported to the court, and the said estate administered under its decree. He therefore prayed that the said widow and children should be made defendants to the said bill; that the said will should be construed ; that the creditors of said estate should be summoned, and the debts due to them, with their respective amounts and priorities, and the assets of said estate, should be ascertained and reported; that the said estate should be administered under the decrees of the court, and that such other and further relief might be granted as justice and equity might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-12\">The will, of which a copy is filed with the bill, is dated on the 18th day of February, 1860, and is very brief.

Spilman, by leave of the court, filed his petition and an exhibit in the cause, and J. C. Gibson, administrator d. b. n. w. w. a., as aforesaid, filed his answer thereto; and the cause came on again to be heard on the papers formerly read and said petition and answer, when the court decreed that one of its commissioners should take an account of the liabilities and of the assets, real and personal, of the late law firm of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman, on the 21st day of December, 1869, the date of the contract between B.

The petitioner further stated that since the death of said ford judgments and decrees had been rendered against him as surviving partner of said firm, and the collection thereof is sought to be enforced against him, whilst the only means of payment of the same have passed, by said contract, beyond his control into the hands of said Shackelford\u2019s legal representatives. And he averred that the assets of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman, which consist of both real and personal estate, are amply sufficient to pay all the debts of said firm, and should, in pursuance of said contract, be first applied to that purpose. And he therefore prayed that J. C. Gibson, administrator d. b. n. w. w. a. of B. H.

Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, answered the said petition at or about the time it was filed, simply saying in his answer: \u201cRespondent is willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>do what is legal and equitable in the premises, and submits his interests and duties to. the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">On the 9th of April, 1873, the defendant, Rebecca B. Shackelford, filed her answer to the said bill, stating, in substance, among other things, that although she qualified as executrix as aforesaid, she trusted the entire settlement of said estate to her attorney at law, H. R. Garden, and only knows of his acts and doings from the account which he rendered her, and which she has laid before the commissioner appointed to take the accounts herein ordered ; that before her intermarriage with her said husband, they entered into a marriage settlement, whereby he settled upon her and the issue of the marriage two lots and houses in the town of Warrenton, and several slaves, and whereby it was provided that all property to which she might become entitled by devise or descent should be subject to the provisions and conditions of said marriage settlement. She charged that under the will of her/ather, Jones Green, she became entitled to a number of slaves and a large and valuable personalty and realty; that her husband collected moneys due her as a portion of this estate, and used the same for his own purposes, sold a number of slaves and other personalty devised as aforesaid, and converted the proceeds of such sales to his own use; and that her husband collected certain moneys devised to her from the estate of her grandfather, John Scott, under his will, and converted the same to his own use. She claims that her husband, by collecting the aforesaid funds embraced in their marriage settlement, became her trustee as to such, and that his estate is liable to her trustee and children for such debts as fiduciary debts of the first character, and prayed that an account might be taken of the acts and doings of her said husband in regard to the said funds. She expressed her willingness that the court should construe the said will, but thought it too plain to require the aid of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>court equity to construe it, and insisted that it vests all the estate of her husband in her in fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Abr\">On the 22d of April, 1873, the cause came on to be again heard on the papers formerly read, the report of Commissioner Shepperd, returned 20th September, 1872, 1\u00b0 which there were sundry exceptions, and the answer of Shackelford; when the court, without passing on the said exceptions, recommitted the said report to the same commissioner to enquire further into the matters of said report, and also to enquire whether B. H. Shackelford, in his lifetime, collected any money belonging to R. B. Shackelford as her separate estate, and the amount thereof; whether said Shackelford sold any, and if any, what property belonging to her as her separate estate, and if so, what became of the money so received by said Shackelford\u2014whether it was invested, and if so, in what property and in whose name. And the court further decreed that J. C. Gibson, Eppa Hunton and H. R. Garden, who were appointed special commissioners for the purpose, should sell the real estate of which said B. H. Shackelford died seized, consisting of many tracts of land described in the decree, containing together 942 acres, on the terms therein mentioned. Said commissioners were required to give bond, with good security, before receiving any money as such, conditioned for the faithful performance of their duty as such, and to report their proceedings to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">On the 15th of April, 1874, Edward M. Spilman, by leave of the court, filed his supplemental petition in the cause, and it was ordered that R. B. Shackelford, in her own right and as administratrix of her husband and guardian of her children aforesaid, and the said children and the said Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, and the said Eppa Hunton, H. R. Garden and J. C. Gibson, commissioners in Gibson v. Shackelford as aforesaid, and Micajah Woods, H. R. Garden and J. C. Gibson, commissioners in Shackelford, guardian, v. Shackelford, be summoned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>appear on the 22d of April, 1874, and answer said petitiou, and show cause why the prayers thereof and restraining orders therein specified should not be granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-4\">In the said supplemental petition of said E. M. Spilman, after setting out the substance of the original petition and the proceedings had under it, the said petitioner stated in substance, among other things, as follows: that the commissioner had not completed the account he had been ordered to take. Since the filing of said petition, facts have come to the knowledge of said petitioner, which he is advised it is important to present to the court, in order to protect him and the creditors of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilmau in their just and legal rights. He is advised that by the terms of said contract, it was contemplated, that as surviving partner, in case of the death of said Shackelford, the duty of settling the affairs of said firm might devolve on him, and that even if no such provision had been inserted therein, he is advised that no arrangement made between him and his co-partner would bar the rights of the creditors of said firm to be paid out of the social assets, nor relieve said petitioner from any individual liability or duty to such social creditors. He therefore asks leave to file this supplemental petition, in which he avers that the administrator aforesaid, of said Shackelford, denies the right of the creditors of Shackelford &amp; Spilman to any priority in payment of their debts over the individual creditors of said Shackelford out of these said assets and the property of said firm, and refuses to apply them to the payment of the partnership debts, and claims that by said contract they have passed to said Shackelford as his individual property, exclusive of all rights of the social creditors and of any rights of this petitioner as surviving partner to have them thus applied. He further avers that Mrs. R. B. Shackelford has filed a claim against her said husband\u2019s estate, which claim the administrator aforesaid maintains to be the first lien on said es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tate, including the assets of said Shackelford &amp; Spilman, which, if allowed,- will absorb the greater part or all thereof. In pursuance of this idea bills have been filed in the circuit courts of Albemarle and Fauquier counties to sell all the real estate belonging to said Shackelford at the time of his death, including certain real estate owned by the late firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilman, thus ignoring the partnership and treating the social property as the individual property of said Shackelford. In the suit in Albemarle, styled Shackelford, guardian, v. 'Shackelford (which has been removed to the circuit court of Fauquier), a lot belonging to B. H. Shackelford individually has been sold, and realty owned by Shackelford &amp; Spilman has been decreed to be sold in the suit in Fauquier county, as the individual property of said Shackelford. The proceeds'of the sale of the lot in Charlottesvile have been treated as a fund to be invested for the benefit of Mrs. Shackelford and her children, and have been decreed to be paid to said Gibson, as receiver in said suit of Shackelford, guardian, v. Shackelford. In the original bill filed in the circuit court of Albemarle county as aforesaid, it is averred that the personalty of said B. H. Shackelford, deceased, is totally insufficient to pay his debts, which averment is admitted to be true in the answer of J. C. Gibson, administrator as aforesaid. In the said supplemental petition the petitioner further avers that by the accounts settled before Commissioner Shepperd, by R. B. Shackelford, executrix of B. H. Shackelford, it appears that she is credited to her testator\u2019s estate in a balance of $3,199.31, with interest from 27th February, 1872, and by the account of J. C. Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, settled before said commissioner, he is charged with $897.67, as balance due the estate by him, after turning over to the widow and children of said B. H. Shackelford about $2,000 as advancements to them. In addition to this, the said administrator has collected of the assets of said Shacbel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ford &amp; Spilman about $2,500, of which petitioner has knowledge and of which no account has as yet been taken as far as he has seen, though he does not doubt that administrator intends to credit the same in his accounts. , Petitioner avers that all these sums were mainly derived from the assets of Shackelford &amp; Spilman, amounting in round numbers to $8,000, which have been collected by <em>' \" </em>* the representatives of the estate of B. H. Shackelford and not applied, as the law requires, to the payment of the partnership debts. He further avers that the security in the official bond of the said Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, is wholly insufficient, the sole security being Mrs. B. B. Shackelford, who has only a life estate in the property settled on her by her husband, as petitioner is advised; and that she qualified as his executrix without giving security as such. Under these circumstances, petitioner is advised that he has a right in protection of his own interest and those of the creditors of said firm, to have a receiver appointed to take charge of the uncollected assets of said firm, and collect and apply them to the discharge of its debts, someof the creditors of which aresuing said petitioner and the sureties of himself and his late partner to enforce against them the liabilities of said firm. The petitioner therefore prayed, that the persons named as defendants in the said decree of the 15th April, 1874, be made defendants accordingly; that certain specific relief might be given by injunction, the appointment of a receiver, &amp;c., as set out in said petition, and that he might have general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-14\">On the 25th of April,. 1874, the said J. C. Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, filed his answer to the said supplemental petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-15\">On the same day\u2014to wit: the 25th of April, 1874\u2014the cause came on to be again heard on the papers formerly read, the original and supplemental petitions of E. M. Spilman and exhibits filed therewith, and upon the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of said J. O. Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, and exhibits filed therewith (though none are copied in the record \u25a0in this case), when the court, being of opinion that the social assets of the late firm of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman should be first applied to the discharge of the debts of said firm, and that the petitioner hath a right to have them so applied, and that the same are not protected by the surety of said J. C. Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, in his bond as such, administrator, the said surety having only a life estate, as it appears to the court, in any property owned and held by her, and that the petitioner hath a right to have said assets secured for the purpose of discharging the debts and liabilities of said firm, decreed that said J. C.

C. Gibson as receiver aforesaid to be $5,384.84 on the 26th March, 1876, with interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from that day, be confirmed. And the court having, by 'decree theretofore entered, ordered said Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, to pay into bank to the credit of said causes the sum of $2,768.75, and other moneys in sard decree specified, and to file among the papers in said causes certificates of such deposits, with which order he hath failed to comply, and as the said sum of $2,768.75 is part of said amount of $5,384.84, the order directing said deposits was thereby rescinded, and it was decreed that said Gibson, receiver, do pay unto A. D. Payne (appointed receiver by a subsequent provision of said decree), the said sum of $5,384.84, with interest as aforesaid. And said Gibson, having failed to execute a new bond as receiver, as required as aforesaid, it was thereby decreed that he be removed as receiver, and his powers as such be annulled. And it was thereby further decreed that said A. D. Payne be appointed receiver instead of said Gibson, and that said Gibson deliver to said Payne the assets, papers and books relating to the business of such receivership. But said Payne, before acting as such receiver, was required to execute a bond, with approved security, as mentioned in said decree.

And unless said Gibson, receiver, should, within sixty days from the rising of the court, pay to said Payne as aforesaid, then the court appointed John M. Forbes a commissioner, who was ordered to withdraw the bond executed by said Gibson as receiver, and proceed to enforce the same against said receiver and his sureties, and make report to the court. But said Forbes, before receiving any money under said decree, was required to execute bond, with good security as therein mentioned, conditioned- for the faithful performance of his duties under said decree.

C.'Gibson be appointed a receiver of the social assets and property of S\u00a3hd firm \u00b0f Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman; and that said Gibson, administrator as aforesaid, forthwith deliver to said receiver \u201call the choses in action, evidences of debt, moneys in his hands, property and assets, written papers or memoranda belonging to said firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilman, and all the account books and other books,\u201d &amp;c.,. \u201c kept by or belonging <em>to </em>said firm and pertaining to their business, whether kept during the existence of said firm,, or by B. H. Shackelford since its dissolution, or by his personal representatives since his death.\u201d But said receiver,, before receiving any thing as such, was required by said decree to execute bond, with surety as therein mentioned, for the faithful discharge of his duties as such; and he was directed to file among the papers in the cause a statement of all the assets he might receive under said decree,, and to proceed to make collections, &amp;c., and to present an account thereof to a commissioner of the court. And the court further ordered that a commissioner should take an account, as therein directed, of the debts due by said firm and the priorities thereof; that reports should be made to-the court by said receiver and commissioner respectively,, and that no payments of any funds, &amp;c., be made by said receiver, except under the order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The main question presented by or raised upon the said decree is, whether that part of the estate of B. H. Shackelford, deceased, which was a part of the partnership estate of the late firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilman, is first liable to the payment of the debts of the said firm before it is liable to the payment of the individual debts of the said B. H. Shackelford.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>We know that, ordinarily, a partnership estate <em>is </em>liable to the payment of the debts of the firm in preference of the individual debts of the partners. This is the right the partners <em>inter se. </em>The creditors of the partnership have no such right of priority over the creditors of the partners individually, but only by substitution to the rights of the partners <em>inter se. </em>The partners may release this right, and the creditors of the partnership cannot complain, for it is not their right, except subject to the disposition and control of the partners theipselves, to whom it belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">When one partner sells to another the former\u2019s interest in the partnership estate, the question whether the former has a right, after the sale, to require the partnership estate to be applied to the payment of the partnership debts in his exoneration, depends upon the true intent and meaning of the contract of sale in that respect. It is competent, of course, for a vendor in such a case to release the partnership estate from such a continuing liability. But whether he did so in fact or not is a question which depends upon the intention of the parties in the contract of sale in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Whether, in the case of such a sale, where there is a total absence of anything in the contract of sale to indicate the intention of the parties on the subject, the presumption of law is in favor of or against such continuing liability, is a question which need not be decided in this case, if it appear by the terms of the contract of sale in the case that such a continuing liability was actually intended by the parties. If so, it will certainly continue to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Let us now therefore enquire : whether, by the terms of the contract of sale in this case, such a continuing liability was actually intended by the parties ?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The said contract of sale by Spilman to Shackelford was by deed executed by the parties on the 21st day of Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>her, 1869, only a few months before the death of the ven- <em>' ' ^ </em>dee, Shackelford; the vendor, Spilman, being his survivor, then still living. The only clauses of the contract wbich seem to be material to the question we are now considering are the following :</p>\n<p id=\"A3C\"><em>\u201c </em>That the said Shackelford agrees to take the entire asS6^S ^aw \u00aerm Shackelford &amp; Spilman, except the real estate belonging to said firm in the state of Arkansas, and pay off and discharge all the debts of said firm of every nature and deseription, upon the following terms, stipulations and agreements : The said Shackelford agrees to wind up all the' business of said firm, applying the assets, as fast as realized, to the payment of its debts, all of .which he assumes to pay, hereby discharging said Spilman from all liability for the same; the surplus remaining, after the payment of said debts, to belong exclusively to the said Shackelford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The said Shackelford will keep au account of all receipts and disbursements by him on the books of the late firm; so that the said Spilman may, at any time, know the condition of said business, should its settlement be, by any accident, devolved on him ; and the said Shackelford has the right to call on said Spilman for assistance and explanation in regard to any of the business of said firm that he may find himself unable to settle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Thus we see, the contract of said Shackelford was to discharge all the debts of said firm, of every nature and description, upon the following terms: <em>\u201c </em>The said Shackelford agrees to wind up all the business of said firm, applying the assets, as fast as realized, to the payment of its debts, all of which he assumes to pay, hereby discharging said Spilman from all liability for the same; the surplus remaining, after, the payment of said debts, to belong exclusively to the said Shackelford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The said Shackelford was thus declared to be a trustee of the partnership estate, which is of course a trust, estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>for the payment of the debts of the partnership, the assets of which, as fast as realized, were to be applied by said trustee to such payment; and only <em>\u201c </em>the surplus remaining, after the payment of said debts, to belong exclusively to the said Shackelford.\u201d And it was expressly agreed that <em>\u201c </em>the said Shackelford will keep an account of all receipts and disbursements by him, on the books of the late firm; so that the said Spilman may, at any time, know the condition of said business, should its settlement be, by any accident, devolved on him; and the said Shackelford has the right to call on said Spilman for assistance and explanation in regard to any of the business of said firm that he may find himself unable to settle.\u201d . The partnership was thus, in effect, continued until, and for the purpose of, the winding up of the concern. And the lien of the vendor, Spilman, on the partnership estate, for the payment of the debts of the partnershiD, which lien resulted from the existence of the partnership, was continued and preserved to him until the business of the firm should be fully settled; until which event and for which purpose the partnership will, in effect, continue in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">It follows, therefore, from what has been said, that that part of the estate of B. H. Shackelford, deceased, which was a part of the partnership estate of the late firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilmau, is first liable to the payment of the debts of said firm, before it is liable to the individual debts of said B. H. Shackelford.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The court, without considering in detail the other objections taken to the said decree of the 25th day of April, 1874, in the appellant\u2019s assignment of errors, is of opin- \u25a0 ion and doth determine that the said objections are groundless and be overruled, and that there is no error in the said decree, and, therefore, that the said decree be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The second decree complained of in the first of the said two appeals is, the decree of December term of said court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>whereby the petition of the appellant, J. C. Gibson, administrator d. b. n. w. w. a. of B. H. Shackelford, of Rebecca B. Shackelford, widow of said B. EL Shackelford, for the review and reversal of the said decree of 7 the 25th of Aprd, 1874, was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"A8T\">The court is of opinion, that for the same reasons for which the said circuit court did not err in making the said decree of the 25th day of April, 1874, as aforesaid, it did not err in dismissing the said petition for the review and reversal of the said decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The third decree complained of is, <em>that </em>of the 24th day of December, 1875; by which sundry exceptions taken to the report of Commissioner Shepperd, filed in the case of \u201cGibson v. Shackelford,\u201d on the24th of August, 1875, were overruled. Sundry other exceptions taken to said report were recommitted to said commissioner, who was directed also to make certain enquiries; but as those portions of the decree decide nothing, it will be unnecessary to notice them here, and only necessary to notice so much of said decree as overrules exceptions to said report. The said overruled exceptions are the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, the 5th in part, the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 14th, taken to the said report by the appellant, and the 1st taken thereto by Thos. N. Latham. The said exceptions taken by the appellants are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">\u201c 1st. Said commissioner in said report undertakes to sever what were. formerly the assets of the late firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilman, from the assets of the estate of the testator, and to hold the same liable to the creditors of said late firm, to the exclusion of the creditors of said B. H. Shackelford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The court did not err in overruling this exception, for the plain reason that the partnership estate of Shackelford &amp; Spilman was liable to the payment of the' partnership debts of that firm, before it was liable to the payment of the individual debts of said Shackelford, as has already been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201c 2d. Said commissioner reports that in all cases in which debts and liabilities incurred and contracted by E. M. Spilman, a former member of the firm of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman, and the consideration for said debts and liabilities, were charged upon the books of said late firm to the said <em>firm; </em>that such entries converted said debts and liabilities into firm debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The court did not err in overruling this exception. The books of the firm were evidence against the firm; and were conclusive, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u201c 3d. Because said commissioner reports, that the estate of B. H. Shackelford, deceased, is debtor to the late firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilman for the amount of all assets of said late firm collected by the said B. H. Shackelford during his lifetime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The court plainly did not err in overruling this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u201c 4th. Because said commissioner reports that the social creditors of the late firm of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman have a lien on what were formerly the social assets of said late firm, to the exclusion of the individual creditors of B. H. Shackelford, deceased, notwithstanding E. M. Spilman, one of the members of said firm, for valuable consideration already received in full, sold and assigned to B. H. Shackelford, deceased, the other member of the firm, during his lifetime, all the assets of said late firm, except the Arkansas land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The correctness of the decision of the court in overruling this exception is conclusively sustained by the reasons already assigned in support of the correctness of the decree of the 25th day of April, 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u201c 5th. Because said commissioner, in said report, insists upon charging the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of B. H. Shackelford with all sums received by H. B. Garden, the attorney at law of said administrator, whether the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>were paid over to said administrator by his said attorney at law or not, and insists upon crediting said administrator with all payments and disbursements made by the said attorney, whether made with or without the authority of the said administrator. This exceptant denies that he is liable for any money collected by his said attorney at law, unless the same was paid over to him, or that he is liable or responsible for any payments or disbursements made by his said attorney at law, unless the same was made by his express authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">The decree of the court in regard to this exception is plainly right. It is, \u201c that the 5th of said exceptions last named be overruled, so far as the same pertains to the collections made by the attorney of said administrator, and so far as the same pertains to the disbursements made by said attorney, were made by authority or approval or were properly made, they shall be allowed, and when made without such authority or approval, or were improper to be made, they should be disallowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">\u201c6th. Because said commissioner recites in said report (page 6) that H. R. Garden paid this exceptant $875 this year, meaning apparently 1875, when it appears from the stated account of said Garden with this exceptant that the said attorney has paid over to him nothing this year, and only the sum of $217 during the year 1874.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">\u201c7th. Because the said commissioner reports the debt of $8,331.67, in favor of Thos. N. Latham, as due in the aggregate and not in detail, and there is not sufficient evidence to sustain said charge, and especially no evidence to sustain the charge of $3,500 as of the 30th November, 1862, as contained in a memorandum filed herein as of the 1st January, 1875.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">There is nothing in the record before the court to show that the circuit court committed any error in overruling the said 6th and 7th exceptions, or either of them. In regard to the remaining exceptions, referred to in the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>decree of the 24th of December, 1875\u2014to wit: the 8th, , 9th, 10th and 14th, which were overruled by the said decree, and the l-2th, 13th and 15th, which were to said commissioner by said decree\u2014it is unnecessary to insert them here, or to say more than that it does not appear from the record that the circuit court erred in regard to them or any of them. <em>J</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The fourth and last decree complained of in the first of the said two appeals is the decree of the 31st of December, 1875, whereby the said J. C. Gibson was required to deposit in the First National Bank of Alexandria, to the credit of these causes, the sum of $2,768.51, being the amount appearing to be in his hands as receiver of the assets of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman in the said causes, after deducting the amount claimed by said receiver, J. C. Gibson, for his fees, &amp;cq the amount so claimed being a matter reserved for future consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">It is unnecessary here to take any further notice of the said decree, or of the assignment of errors therein in the petition of appeal therefrom, as the said decree requiring the said sum of $2,768.51 to be deposited in bank as aforesaid, with which the said receiver had failed to comply, was rescinded by the decree made in these causes on the 22d of April, 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Having sufficiently noticed the assignments of error in the petition for the first appeal obtained in these cases, we will now notice those contained in the petition for the latter of the two appeals obtained in the said cases\u2014to wit: the appeal from the two decrees of the 17th and 22d days of April, 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">In the petition for the last mentioned appeal there are seven assignments of error by the appellant, J. C. Gibson, which will be briefly noticed in the order in which they are made. They are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">1st. In overruling his exceptions to Commissioner Shepperd\u2019s report, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"AYnc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>2. In requiring him to give a new bond as receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">3. In removing him as receiver as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"AbB\">4. In appointing A. D. Payne as a receiver in his stead</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">5. In requiring him to pay to said Payne, receiver as aforesaid, the sum of $5,384.84, with interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from 26th March, 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">6. In appointing John M. Forbes a commissioner to sue for and collect said last mentioned sum of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">7. In refusing to allow him any fees, &amp;c., whatever, for his professional services as an attorney and counsellor at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">1. As to the first of these assignments of error: \u201cIn overruling his exceptions to Commissioner Shepperd\u2019s report, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\u201d It is sufficient to say that there is nothing in the record before the court to show that the circuit court erred in overruling the said exceptions or any or either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">2. As to the second of these assignments: \u201cIn requiring him to give a new bond as receiver.\u201d We think that the security on the old bond was insufficient, and the circuit court did not err in this respect. If this court would reverse a decree of an inferior court for. requiring a new bond in such a case, it would only be done where there was palpable error in making such requisition. Certainly there was no such error in this case if it were not perfectly proper to make the requisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">3. As to the third of these assignments : \u201cIn removing him as receiver as aforesaid.\u201d If it was proper in the circuit court to require him to give a new bond as receiver, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that it was proper for said court to remove him as receiver in the event of his failure to comply with such a requisition. As the propriety of the former act will be inferred, at least in the absence of palpable evidence to the contrary, it follows, necessarily, that the propriety of the. latter act will be also inferred in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>4. As to the fourth of these assignments: \u201c In appointing A. D. Payne as a receiver in his stead.\u201d There is nothing in the record tending to show the impropriety of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">5. As to the fifth of these assignments: \u201cIn requiring him to pay to said Payne, receiver as aforesaid, the sum of $5,384.84, with interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from 26th March, 1876.\u201d When the said requisition was made, the said sum of $5,384.84 was the amount of the partnership fund of Shackelford &amp; Spilman then in the hands of the receiver, J. C. Gibson; and A. D. Payne being appointed receiver in the place of J. C. Gibson, who was removed from the said office, the fund of the partnership then in the hands of the old receiver was ordered to be paid by him to the new receiver. This transfer of the partnership fund from the hands of the old to those of the new receiver was a proper act, and the legitimate, if not necessary, consequence of the change of the receivership. The old receiver, J. C. Gibson, had a large claim against the fund in his hands, as such, for professional services claimed to have been rendered by him in regard to the partnership fund during the existence of his receivership. It was decreed by the circuit court in these two causes, on the 31st of December, 1875, that said J. C. Gibson, theretofore appointed receiver in the first of said two causes\u2014 to wit: that of <em>B. H. Shackelford\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>R. B. Shackelford &amp; </em>al.\u2014\u201cdo pay into the First National Bank of Alexandria, to the credit of said two causes, the sum of $2,768.51, being the amount appearing in his hands by the supplemental report of Commissioner Shepperd, filed on 16th September, 1875, after deducting the amount claimed by said receiver, J. C. Gibson, for his fees, &amp;c., reserving for future consideration the amount so claimed, and that said receiver do also pay into said bank any moneys received by him as such receiver since the period embraced in the said report of Commissioner Shepperd, and also any \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>moneys he may hereafter collect as such receiver, and file , , among the papers in this cause the certificate of said bank of such deposits, and that said J. C. Gibson do settle be-^\u00b0re ^-as*er Commissioner Shepperd a further account of his actings and doings as receiver aforesaid, and that said commissi\u00b0ner do ascertain and make report, whether the bond of said receiver, filed in said first named cause, is a good and sufficient bond to protect the interests of the parties who may be entitled to the funds that have come or may come into the hands of said receiver, and that said J. C. Gibson be summoned to appear here on the 2d day of the next term of this court, to show cause why he should not be required to execute a new bond, with good and sufficient sureties therein, as receiver in said cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On the 17th of April, 1876, the said two causes came on to be further heard, upon the papers formerly read and sundry other papers, and the exceptions therein named, and upon the rule against said J. C. Gibson, receiver of the assets of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman, &amp;c., to show cause why he should not be required to execute a new bond as such receiver: on consideration whereof the court overruled several of the said exceptions, and recomniitted others to said commissioner for further enquiry and investigation, and further decreed that J. C. Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, be required, on or before the 22d of April, 1876, that being the last day of the then present term of the said circuit court, \u201c to execute a new bond as such receiver, with good and sufficient surety, in the penalty of $20,000, with cbnditions as are in his former bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">On the 22d of April, 1876, the said two causes came on to be further heard upon the papers formerly read: on consideration whereof the court confirmed <em>\u201c </em>so much of the report of Commissioner Shepperd, filed on the 1st of April, 1876, in the first named cause, as ascertains the total amount due by J. C. Gibson as receiver of the assets of .the firm of Shackelford &amp; Spilman to be $5,384.84 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>26th of March, 1876, with interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from 26th March, 1876; and the court, having by a decree entered on the \u2014 day of--, ordered said J. C. Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, to pay into the First National Bank at Alexandria, to the credit of these causes, the sum of $2,768.75, and other moneys in said decree specified, and to file among the papers in these causes certificates of said bank of said deposits, with which said order said Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, hath failed to comply, and as the said sum of $2,768.75 is part of the said amount of $5,384.84, the order directing said payments into said bank is hereby rescinded; and the court\u201d decreed \u201c that said J. C. Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, do pay unto A. D. Payne, who is appointed receiver of said assets of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman by a subsequent provision in this decree, the aforesaid sum of $5,834.84, with interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from 26th March, 1876, until paid ; and the said J. C. Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, having been required by the decree entered on the \u2014 day of this term of the court, to execute a new bond as such receiver, on or before this day, and having failed so to do, the court\u201d decreed that the said J. C. Gibson be removed and displaced as receiver aforesaid, and his powers as such be annulled and revoked. And the court further decreed that Alexander D. Payne be appointed in the stead of said J. C. Gibson, receiver of the assets of said firm of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman, and of the amount decreed above to be paid by said Gibson, receiver, to him; and that said Gibson, heretofore receiver as aforesaid, do deliver to said Payne, \u201creceiver hereby appointed, all the choses in action, &amp;c., belonging to said firm and pertaining to their business, &amp;c. But before said Payne, receiver as aforesaid, should discharge any duties as such, he was required by said decree to execute bond, with good security, payable to the commonwealth of Virginia, in the penalty of $15,000, conditioned for the faithful discharge of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>duties as such receiver. And said A. 1). Payne was directed to file among the papers in said two causes a state-? - ment of assets he may receive under said decree, and to ' proceed to collect, with reasonable diligence, all debts due to said firm, and was authorized to employ counsel to aid him therein, &amp;c., and to present an account of his doings as receiver to a master commissioner of the court in said causes. And unless the said Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, should within 60 days from the rising of the said circuit court, pay to said Payne, appointed receiver in the stead of said Gibson, then the said court by said decree, appointed John M. Forbes a commissioner, who was ordered to withdraw the receiver\u2019s bond executed by said Gibson and his sureties therein, and filed in said causes, and proceed to collect the said sum and interest above decreed to be paid by said Gibson, heretofore receiver, by such legal proceedings as he may deem proper, and by suit upon his bond as receiver, and report to the court. But before said Forbes shall receive any money under said decree, he was required to execute bond, with good security, in the penalty of $6,000, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties under said decree; and leave was reserved to any party interested to apply for such further relief by way of the enforcement of said decree as may be determined to be proper and lawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Thus it appears that the said 5th assignment of error is mot well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">6. As to the sixth of the said assignments: \u201cIn appointing John M. Forbes a commissioner to sue for and collect said last mentioned sum of him,\u201d said Gibson. There is no good ground of objection to this part of the \u2022decree aforesaid. If the former receiver shall fail to make payment of the fund with which he is chargeable as such to the present receiver, then an action at law will no doubt become necessary against the former receiver and his sureties on his bond as such, and that action must be brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>by an attorney at law. The commissioner appointed in this case to sue for and collect the amount of said bond is such an attorney, and the presumption is (what we all in fact know as a matter <em>dehors </em>the record) that he is well qualified to perform that duty and trustworthy in every respect. Besides, he is required by the decree appointing him commissioner as aforesaid, before receiving any money under said decree, to execute bond, with good security, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties under the said decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">7. As to the seventh and last of the said assignments : In refusing to allow him any fees, &amp;e., whatever for his (J. C. Gibson\u2019s) professional services as an attorney and counsellor at law.\u201d Now, this matter was expressly reserved for future consideration by the said circuit court in the said decree of the 31st of December, 1875, and there is nothing in the record to show that it has since been so considered. Whatever he may be entitled to on account of said claim may be asserted hereafter against the assets of the said partnership of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman. It was proper for the circuit court to take care of those assets, and keep them in the hands of a receiver bound by bond, with good security, until it can be ascertained who are entitled to them, and in what proportions, and to distribute and apply them accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Upon the whole, the court is of opinion that there is no error in the decrees appealed from, and that the same ought therefore to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The decree was as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that there is no error in any of the decrees appealed from in this case, to wit: the decrees of the 25th day of April, 1874; the 22d day of Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>]jer 1875: the 24th day of December, 1875, and the 31st day of December, 1875; to which four decrees an appeal allowed by a judge of this court on the 26th day of 1877; and the 17th day of April, 1876, and the 22d day of April, 1876; to which last named two decrees an aPPea^ was allowed by a judge of this court on the 5th day of March, 1878\u2014which two appeals are embraced in and constitute this case. But the court is of opinion that there is not in the said decrees, or any of them, any decision of the said circuit court in regard to the claim of the receiver, J. C. Gibson, for his fees, &amp;c.; the said court having, by its said decree of the 31st day of December, 1875, reserved for future consideration the amount so claimed; which question remains undecided and subject to the decision of the said circuit court, notwithstanding the said decree of the 22d day of April, 1876, whereby the said court confirmed so much of the report of Commissioner Shepperd, filed on the 1st of April, 1876, as ascertains the total amount due by J. C. Gibson as receiver of the assets of the firm of Shackelford <em>&amp; </em>Spilman, to be $5,384.84 on 26th March, 1876, with interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from 26th March, 1876; and decreed that said J. C. Gibson, receiver as aforesaid, do pay unto A. D. Payne, who is appointed receiver of said assets of Shackelford &amp; Spilman by a subsequent provision in said decree, the aforesaid sum of $5,384.84, with .interest on $4,685.82, part thereof, from 26th March, 1876, until paid; the said sum of $5,-384.84 being the whole amount then due by said Receiver Gibson, without making any deduction for his fees, &amp;c., as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Therefore, it is decreed and ordered that the said decrees appealed from in this case, subject to the explanation aforesaid, and without prejudice to the right of the said J. C. Gibson to recover any amount to which he may hereafter be held to be entitled for his fees, &amp;c., as aforesaid, be af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>firmed, and that the appellant J. C. Gibson pay to the appellee E. M. Spilman thirty dollars damages and his costs by him about his defence in this court expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">Which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Decrees affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
