Isaacs &lt;&amp; Co., and three other execution creditors, for themselves and all other creditors of The Insurance Company of the Valley of Virginia, instituted their suit in equity in the county court of Frederick, which was afterwards removed to the circuit court of the county, against the said insurance company and William L. Brent, the secretary and treasurer of the company, praying the court to appoint a receiver to collect the debts due the company, sufficient to pay the claims of the plaintiffs, and such other claims as may be outstanding against the company, that the plaintiffs might be satisfied from the said assets so collected, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-10\">In September, 1871, the said insurance company instituted their suit in equity in the circuit court of Frederick connty against the plaintiffs in the first suit and the stockholders and board of directors of the company, praying that the debtors to and the creditors of the company might be convened, that accounts might be taken of all the assets and liabilities of the company, their priorities adjudicated, and the assets properly distributed among the creditors and stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-11\">These causes were heard together, decrees were made directing accounts and a receiver was appointed, with directions to proceed forthwith to collect the debts and realize the assets of the company, and for this purpose to bring suits either at law or equity as might.be necessary; and there were reports by the commissioner and receiver; from which it appeared that the debts of the company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00aeXGePt a amount, had been paid, prior to March, 1876. The only parties interested in the cause after this were the stockholders of the company, and it apPeare&lt;^ from the report of the commissioner, that some of these had paid up the full amount of their stock, before the war&gt; in good money, some had paid in part before the War, and the balance in Confederate money during the war; and both these classes had received their certificates of stock; others, at the end of the war, had paid nothing; and some owed the company for money borrowed; and for the amounts due from these stockholders, bond, negotiable notes and simple promisory notes were taken; and they of course had not received their certificates of stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">The cause came on again to be heard the 27th of March, 1877, when the court made a decree, which, reciting that from the report of the receiver and the report of the chancery commissioner that all the debts of company, except a trifling amount, had been paid, and that the balance in the hands of the receiver or of his attorneys will be sufficient to pay the same, together with any costs and expenses which have been incurred in discharging his duties as such receiver, and that the remainder of the assets of the company should now be collected, and the surplus thereof left after the payment of all costs and expenses, and other costs and expenses which may be hereafter incurred by the said receiver in obeying the provisions of this decree, distributed ratably among all the stockholders, decreed that the receiver should proceed to collect, by execution or otherwise, the entire assets, consisting of judgments, bonds, notes or other obligations due the said insurance company, except that until the further order of the court he shall permit a stay of execution upon judgments against parties who are also holders of stock in said insurance company, to an amount of said judgments equal to twelve <em>per cent, </em>of the face value of the stock held by said parties ; and shall leave a similar amount in the hands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>those stockholders who are debtors, and against whom judgments have not been obtained. From this decree Lewis P. Hartman and three others, in behalf of selves and of other stockholders who have not paid their stock indebtedness, applied to this court for an appeal; which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-6\"><em>Richard Parker </em>and <em>Holmes Conrad, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-9\"><em>Williams &amp; Williams, </em>and <em>Wm.

N. Huck, filed October 15th, 1875, to which there was no exception, and which was subsequently confirmed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>courb that the available assets consists of certain notes and obligations given by the stockholders for their unpaid of stock, and that there are no other available assets, and it would seem inequitable that those who . . 1 . , are m arrear should be required to pay up m good money t\u00b0 create a fund for distribution upon terms of equality amongst those stockholders who paid their subscription in Confederate money, which was greatly depreciated. There are three classes of stockholders: 1st, those who have paid up their stock, in whole or in part, before the war in good money; 2d, those who have paid up, in whole or in part, during the war in Confederate money; 3d, those who, at the end of the war, had paid nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">Upon what principle shall the stockholders\u2019 accounts be settled, the amount of assets for distribution be ascertained, and division be made amongst them?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">The court is of opinion that in the statement of the account of the stockholders with the company and ascertaining the assets, we cannot disregard payments that have been made in Confederate money.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">These must stand, and the stockholder must be credited by his payments in Confederate money, without abatement. But in the statement of the account between the stockholders to ascertain what dividend each one shall be entitled to in the distribution of the assets, the payments of stock in Confederate money, whether in whole or in part of the shares, since the 1st of January, 1862, should be scaled as of the date of payment, and each stockholder shall receive his dividend of the assets in the proportion of his input thus ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">The sum to be divided will be the aggregate of balances due from the stockholders severally, thus ascertained, including any funds in the hands of the court, in which each one will be entitled to share in proportion to his input, ascertained as hereinbefore indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-18\">By this mode of stating the account, each stockholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>gets a dividend in the precise proportion of his actual input, rating the Confederate money at its value when paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The stockholders being parties to the suit\u2014and if any of them are not they should be made parties\u2014accounts should be ordered and taken preparatory to the division upon the principle hereinbefore declared, and the stockholders in arrear should not be required to pay until the accounts are taken and the dividend of each stockholder ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Each stockholder in arrear should then be credited with his dividend, and be ordered to pay into the hands of the receiver the balance due on his stock, to be divided amongst the other stockholders in the proportion of their respective dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Upon this plan and mode of proceedure, the whole matter in controversy can be finally adjusted in this suit more to the advantage of all parties concerned and in accordance with justice, than by the institution of separate actions at law against the stockholders, which is unnecessary and would not be proper or allowable under the circumstances, a court of equity being the proper forum for the adjudication and settlement of the matters in dispute between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The court is, therefore, of opinion and doth decree and order that the decree of the 27th day of March, 1877, and the decree on which it is founded, or which it revives and puts in operation, so far as they require a further collection of money from stockholders on stock account, or is in any other respect inconsistent with this opinion and order, be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellants their costs expended in the prosecution of their appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">And this cause is remanded to the circuit court of Frederick county to be further proceeded with, in conformity with the principles herein declared, in order to final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">All of which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court of Frederick county.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>a\u00a7a^n? on *he 10th of October, 1879, on motion, the decree pronounced in this cause during the present on the 2d inst., requiring the appellees to pay the costs incurred by the appellants in the prosecution of their appeal here, is modified so as to except from the appellees hable the appellees Conway Eobinson, J. L. Bacon, the Virginia State Insurance Company, Wm. L. Brent, secretary; Vm. Byrd, special receiver; The Insurance Company of the Valley of Virginia, Eichard E. Brown; Hugh Sidwell\u2019s personal representative and Eichard Sid-well\u2019s administrator\u2014it appearing to the court that the reversal of the decree of the court below is not to their prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\"Which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court of Frederick county.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
