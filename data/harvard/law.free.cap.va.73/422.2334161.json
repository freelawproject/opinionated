In 1830, an allowance of bounty land was made to the heirs of of M, as an officer in the Virginia navy.

Upon an application by the representative of the heirs of M <em>tor a, mandamus </em>to the register of the land office to deliver to him the\u00bbe warrants, he produces from the files of his office the copy of a letter from the secretary of the commonwealth to the register of the land office, dated in September, 1833, in which he says he returns the warrants by the order of the governor, the order making the allowance of the bounty having been rescinded\u2014 Held : There being doubt upon the case, the <em>mandamus </em>will not be issued.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-12\">This was an application by Robert Milliner\u2019s administrator to the supreme court of appeals, for a rule upon Randolph Harrison, register of the land office, to show cause why a <em>mandamus </em>should not issue commanding him to deliver to the petitioner certain land warrants which had been made out in favor of the heirs of Robert Milliner, deceased, and on file in his office.

PL. Pleasants.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-19\">Appended to this paper is a certificate from S. IT. Boy-kin, former register of the land office, that \u201c the foregoing is a true copy from the records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-20\">This is the only evidence produced by the petitioner in support of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-21\">A rule was awarded upon this petition, against Col. Randolph Harrison, register of the land office, to show cause why a writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not 'be awarded by this court, commanding him to deliver to the petitioner the land warrants described in said petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">To this rule the register of the land office filed his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-23\">In that answer, while he admits that the order filed with the petition is upon the records of his office, and that there is no order revoking and annulling the order of December 7th, 1830, to be found upon the executive journal, and that the warrants still remain in his office uncancelled,, he further avers that the register of the land office was notified by the secretary of the commonwealth, that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>an order was directed to be entered, and that in consequenee of such notification said warrants were returned to the register, and have remained in the office ever a period of nearly forty years. That under these circumstances, and under the advice of the Attorney-General, he has declined to deliver said warrants to the petitioner. That he is willing to do whatever his duty and the law requires him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">He produces, to be read with his answer, a copy taken from the files of the land office, the following letter, written by the late General William H. Richardson, bearing date September 25th, 1833, at which time he was secretary of the commonwealth. That letter is addressed to Wm. Selden, Esq., register of the land office, and is in these word:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201c Executive Department,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">\u201c25th September, 1833.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201c I am instructed by the governor to transmit to the register of the land office the enclosed warrants, which were issued to the heirs of Robert Milliner, pursuant to an order of the executive of the 7th December, 1830, for the land bounty of a lieutenant in the state navy, and to inform the register that the order allowing the claim of the heirs of the said Rob. Milliner has been subsequently rescinded, and \"the claim rejected upon evidence filed in this department that the said Milliner was not entitled to land bounty. The warrants are returned to the land office at the request of the gentleman who represented the heirs, with the view, as the governor is informed, to an application on his part to have the tax refunded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">(Signed) \u201c'Wm. H. Richardson,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">\u201c <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The case is submitted to this court upon this petition and exhibit filed therewith, and the answer of the register of the land office, with the letter of Gen. Richardson, late secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of the commonwealth, produced by the respondent to be read with his answer. This is the whole record presented to \u25a0us; and upon this record, the original and extraordinary jurisdiction of this court, by way of <em>mandamus, </em>is invoked to compel the register of the land office to deliver these warrants to the petitioner, which had been returned to his office nearly forty years ago, upon notification by thesecretary of the commonwealth that the order upon which they were issued had been rescinded, and the claim rejected, upon evidence filed in the executive department. The court is of opinion that the rule must be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">The writ of <em>mandamus </em>only issues where there is a clear and specific legal right to be enforced, or a duty which ought to be and can be performed, and where there is no other specific and adequate legal remedy. The right \u2022which it is sought to protect must, therefore, be clearly established and the writ is never granted in a doubtful case. Where the law enjoins upon a public officer the performance of a specific act or duty, obedience to the law may, in the absence of other adequate remedy, be enforced by <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">But to warrant the court in granting this writ against a public officer, such a state of facts must be presented as to show that the petitioner has a clear right to the performance of the thing demanded, and that a corresponding duty rests upon the officer to perform that particular thing. See <em>Tyler, sergeant, </em>v. <em>Taylor, auditor, </em>29 Gratt. 765, and cases there cited. See also opinion of Judge <em>Burks </em>in <em>Page </em>v. <em>Clopton, judge, </em>30 Gratt. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Applying these principles to the case before us, it is plain that the record pi\u2019esents no case for the exercise of the original and extraordinary jurisdiction of this court by way of <em>mandamus. </em>On the contrary, the public officer whom we are asked to compel a performance of his duty, we think, discharged his duty in refusing to deliver the land warrants in the petition mentioned to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>We think it is clear, upon the record presented, that he was at least justified in withholding warrants which, for forty years, had remained in his office, and, though cancelled, were proven from the records of the executive department to have been rescinded and annulled, and the claim upon which they were founded rejected upon evidence filed with that department.. The court is therefore of opinion that the record presents no ease for a <em>mandamus, </em>and that the rule must be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Mandamus refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
