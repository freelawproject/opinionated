An unmarried man, who has no children or other persons dependent on him living with him, though he keeps house, and has persons hired by him living with him. is not a householder or head of a family, within the meaning of these terms as used in the constitution and laws of Virginia, and therefore is not entitled to the homestead exemption as provided by the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-8\">2.

Williams against John C. Calhoun, to subject the land of Calhoun to satisfy a judgment for $115, with interest from the 16th of November, 1874, and costs $7.20, which had been rendered in said court on the 3d of October, 1875. The only defence set up by Calhoun, was that he had by a deed dated the 6th&gt; of March, 1875, set apart his land, valued by him at $1,650, and certain personal property valued at $30, as his homestead exemption; and the only question in the ease was, as to his right to a homestead exemption. The facts seem to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-11\">John C. Calhoun was unmarried. By deed dated the 17th of February, 1858, his father, Mark S. Calhoun, conveyed to him a tract of one hundred acres of land on the consideration of the support and maintenance of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Mark S. Calhoun and Elizabeth, his wife, during their natural lives; and further that he should pay to his sister Sarah Jane, $125 on the 6th of April, 1861, and the sum in April, 1862, and support her during her single life; and he seems to have purchased a small tract of ten acres on which his house was built. His father and mother removed to his house and lived with him until their death. The father had been dead about ten years, the mother died in March, 1876. John C. Calhoun lived in his own house, and kept house, but he had no person living with him, except persons employed by him to work on his farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">The cause came on to be heard on the 3d of September, 1876, when the court held that Calhoun was not entitled to a homestead, and made a decree that the land should be rented out by a commissioner named, for the-payment of the judgment and costs of this suit. And thereupon Calhoun applied to a judge of this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-7\"><em>A. G. Pendleton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-8\"><em>Gilmore &amp; Perm, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b43-9\">Anderson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The homestead article of the constitution of Virginia has been judicially construed, both by the federal and state courts, to confer a personal privilege upon the \u201chouseholder or head of a family\u201d; and the question, and only question, in this case is, Is the appellant, who claims the benefit of this provision of the constitution, a householder or head of a family? This provision was not made for all persons who are residents of the state, but for a particular class of persons; otherwise it would not be limited to a \u201c householder or head of a family.\u201d Who are embraced in that description? Worcester gives two significations to the term householder: \u201c1st. The occupier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>a house\u201d; 2d. The master of a family.\u201d In which of these senses is it used in the constitution ? If in the second sense, it is nearly\" synonymous with the terms \u201chead of a family.\u201d And if used in that sense, then the second phrase\u2014\u201c head of a family \u201d\u2014was intended as explanatory of it. This mode of expression is not unusual in writings. When the first phrase is considered not sufficiently explicit or definite, a second is used to give the meaning with greater definiteness and clearness. And this is peculiarly appropriate when the design is to describe one particular class of persons, and not two distinct classes. If the language of the first description is not sufficiently precise or explicit, but may have two significations given to it, one of which is not descriptive of the class of persons intended, whilst the other is, the writer, in order to make his meaning certain, will use another term which shows in which sense he has employed the first phrase or term. And I think such was evidently the intention of the draughtsman of this clause of the constitution, and that the second description of the persons who were to be entitled to the privilege, was intended to be explanatory of the first, and not to constitute two classes of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">But if the term \u201chouseholder\u201d was intended to be descriptive of a different class from the \u201c head of a family,\u201d it was intended to give the privilege to two distinct classes of persons; and if so, the copulative conjunction \u201cand\u201d would have been used, instead of the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d so as to read \u201cevery householder <em>and </em>every head of a family shall be entitled,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">But we need not confine ourselves to the definition given by the lexicographers. The term was evidently employed by the framers of the constitution in the sense in which it is commonly used. The term household literally means the inmates of the house\u2014the family\u2014those whom the house holds. The term is frequently used in the sacred scriptures, especially in the epistles of the New Testament, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>which, in the English version, is probably the best standard of the meaning of our language in common use. And the term household is so used in common parlance and friendly correspondence by letter. What is more usual than to send messages of regard or affection by the writer to the household ? Such messages are universally meant for the family\u2014the inmates of the house. And if they constitute the household, who can be meant by the \u201chouseholder\u201d but the \u201chead of the family\u201d? But whilst we hold that by the \u201chouseholder\u201d is meant the head of a family, we do not mean to say that every head of a family must be, necessarily, a householder.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">But the whole scope of the article shows that the privilege was intended not so much for the benefit of the person to whom it is given, as for the benefit of his family; to enable the person to whom it is given to use it to save-his family from suffering and want. To this end, it was necessary that the head of the family should have the-power to shield a portion of his property from levy and sale under execution or distress, or other process. In <em>Shipe, Cloud &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Repas &amp; als., </em>28 Gratt. 716, 733, Judge <em>Staples </em>remarked \u201c that no one can look into-the provision of our constitution, and the adjudicated eases-of other states, and fail to see that the primary object is-to provide for the family. As was said by the supreme-court of Ohio in <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Hanks, </em>14 Ohio R. 498, 501, the humane policy of the homestead act seeks not the protection of the debtor, but its object is to protect his family from the inhumanity which would deprive its dependent members of a home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">That such was the intention of the framers of our constitution, to this end, to confer the privilege upon a person who had a family, and not upon the mere occupier of a-house, I think is further shown by the 5th section of the-article, which pi\u2019ovides that the general assembly \u201cshall prescribe in what manner, and on what conditions, the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>said householder or head of a family shall thereafter set apart and hold for himself and family,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cand may in. its discretion determine in what manner and on what conditions he may thereafter hold for the benefit of himself <em>and </em>family.\u201d I think this language plainly shows that the householder intended was one who had a family.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Indeed, the whole theory and policy of the homestead is founded upon the principle that there is a natural and moral obligation on the head of a family to provide for the support of his wife and children and other persons dependent on him, towards whom he stands almost <em>in loco parentis, </em>which is, if not paramount, equal to his obligation to pay his debts. Whether it is sound in morals or not, is not the question. It is evidently the ground upon which the homestead was made a constitutional provision, as I think the debates in the convention which framed it will show.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The family may consist of a wife and children, or of other persons, who may stand in a state of dependence in the family relation; or it may consist of persons standing in either of these relations to the head of the family, whether the father, or mother, or a brother, or a sister, or other relation, is the head; but they must be persons who are dependent, in some measure, on the head for support, and who have an interest in his holding his property, and would be prejudiced by its seziure and sale under execucution, or other process, and who would be benefitted by its exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">The foregoing view I think is supported by a fair and liberal construction of the homestead article of the constitution, according to the intent of its framers, as gathered from its language and its general scope, and the object sought to be attained. And it is in harmony with-the adjudications on thesubject. In <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>19 Wend. R. 475, the court said \u201cthe statute declares that the following property when owned by any person being a householder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u25a0shall be exempt from execution,\u201d &amp;e., and in determining what was meant by the word \u201chouseholder\u201d in that statute, \u2022said it \u201c means the head, master, or person who has \u2022charge of, and provides for a family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The terms \u201chouseholder,\u201d and master, or chief of a family, are used interchangeably, as meaning the same thing. In Thompson on Homestead, \u00a7 66, it is said \u201c If a person professes the character of a <em>householder\u2014that is, </em>if he is the <em>master </em>or <em>chief of </em>a <em>family, </em>he does not lose it by his temporarily ceasing to keep house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The constitution of Georgia, adopted in 1868, guarantees a homestead to each \u201c head of a family,\u201d or guardian, \u2022or trustee of a family of minor children. And the supreme court of the state held, that a single man, having no person dependent on him for a support, is not within the meaning of this provision \u201cthe head of a family.\u201d (Thompson on Homestead and Exemptions, citing <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>40 Georgia R. 173). What constitutes a family was considered with reference to the Texas constitution of 1845 and 1866, providing for the exempting from forced sale of property of <em>\u201c </em>all heads of families,\u201d &amp;c. It was held that the term family was used in its generic sense, embracing a household composed of parents and children, or other relatives, or domestics and servants; in short every collective body of persons, living together within the same curtilage, subsisting in common, directing their attention to a common object\u2014promotion of their mutual interests and social happiness. Id. \u00a7 44\u2014 citing <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>31 Texas R. 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The duty to support is also made the test. He upon whom the law imposes such a duty, growing out of <em>status, </em>and not out of <em>contract, </em>and the persons to whom he owes this duty, if dwelling together in a domestic establishment, constitute a family, of which he is the head. Ibid, \u2022\u00a7 45\u2014citing <em>Whaler </em>v. <em>Cadman, </em>11 Iowa R. 226; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Lazenby, </em>41 Georgia R. 153; <em>Sallee </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Alabama R. 482; <em>Sanderlin </em>v. <em>Sanderlin\u2019s adm\u2019or, 1 </em>Swan\u2019s R. 441. The writer says, the courts have adopted' more humane rule, that a <em>moral </em>duty on the managing member of the domestic association to support the others, or some of them, will be sufficient to constitute the association a family, and the manager of it the head of a family.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">There are cases which say that to constitute a family within the meaning of such statutes there must be a condition of <em>dependence, </em>and not a mere aggregation of individuals. Ib. \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The relation of master and servant, or, more properly speaking, of employer and employee, as it ordinarily exists in this country, does not constitute a <em>family. </em>And therefore a single man, who has no other persons living with him than servants and employees, is not the head of a family, within the meaning of statutes creating homestead exemptions. Ib. \u00a7 47, citing <em>Garaty </em>v. <em>Dubose, </em>5 South Car. R. 493; <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>McLinden, </em>42 Ga. R. 405. The adjudication of seven of the states of the Union, to which I have referred, are mostly taken from the citations of Mr. Thompson\u2019s works on Homesteads and Exemptions, not having access here to the books in which the cases are reported. Although I do not mean to express a concurrence in all they say, I rely upon them so far as they are in harmony with the views I have presented in relation to the Virginia constitutional homestead provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">It now only remains briefly to apply these doctrines to the case in hand. Was the appellant a <em>\u201c </em>householder\u201d or \u201c head of a family \u201d in the sense in which those terms are used in the constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">He had lived upon his own land for about eighteen years. He was never married. On the 17th of February, 1858, his father and mother conveyed to him a tract of one hundred acres of land, in consideration that he would support them during their natural lives; and they soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>after left their own house, and came to live with him. . But both of them died, and he occupied the house alone, no one living with him except his employees. He the right to hold his property as a homestead, which he values at $1,680\u2014probably all he owns\u2014and which is a very low valuation, if his estimate of the value of the land is proportioned to its real value in the same ratio of his estimate of his personal property to its real value. He, an unmarried man, without a family to provide for, and no one dependent on him for support, seeks to hold all this property under the homestead, to avoid the payment of an honest debt of the inconsiderable amount of $115, and interest on it from the 16th of November, 1874, and $7.20 costs. I agree with the judge of the circuit court of Smythe county, that it cannot be done\u2014that the homestead was not designed to enable a man who had neither-wife, nor children, nor others dependent on him, to withhold his property, on the faith of which he had contracted a debt, from its payment, which he was in common honesty bound to pay; and thus to take his neighbor\u2019s property, or services, under a promise to pay for them, and then force him to lose them, although fully able to pay for them. For such an act he cannot offer the plea, upon which the right of the homestead is claimed, that he has a wife, or children, or a family of poor and needy persons,, who are dependent on him, and have claims on him, and for whose support a moral obligation rests on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">He can make no such plea; and therefore the homestead provision was not designed for him. For the care of a widow who is childless and lives alone, whose husband died without having a homestead assigned to him in his lifetime, we refer to chap. 183 of the Code of 1873, \u00a7 10;-not intending now to indicate any opinion as to the proper construction of said section, as no question arises upon it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In reaching our conclusions, we have not been unmind\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ful of \u00a7 7 of the homestead article of the constitution, which requires that the provisions of said article \u201c shall be construed liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof maybe fully and perfectly carried out\u201d; and have endeavored to give such a liberal construction to it as will give effect to the intention of its framers.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">For the foregoing reasons, I am of opinion to affirm the decree of the circuit court, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Anderson, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Decree appirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
