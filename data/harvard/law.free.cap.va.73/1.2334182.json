P died before the bond became due, and L qualified as his administrator. In December, 1860, C sued L upon the bond ; and at the earnest solicitation of L, C accepted from him three negotiable notes, satisfactorily endorsed, payable in three, six and nine months, for the amount of the bond ; and in January, 1861, dismissed his suit. $150 was paid on the first note, and it was twice renewed ; the second was also renewed. Xo more was paid on them, and both principal and sureties on the notes had become insolvent before 1SC6, when C sued upon them. He then filed a bill to subject the estate of P to the payment of the bonds\u2014Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>1. If upon accepting the uotes the agreement was to give time upon the payment of the debt, then the surety in the bond was released, and the estate of P is not liable to pay the debt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-5\">2. Though there was no agreement to give time upon the debt, the legal effect of accepting the notes was to suspend the right of action on the bond during the period allowed for the payment of the notes; and thaboperated as a release of the surety in the bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-7\">3. Whilst the mere taking a negotiable security, payable at a future day, does not, unless so agreed, operate as a payment of an antecedent debt, it does operate to suspend the right of action on the original demand until the maturity of the bill or note. It is a conditional satisfaction with respect to the principal; and with respect to the surety it is absolute, unless it plainly appears the parties intended otherwise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-9\">4. If the parties agree that the right of action on the original debt shall not be stayed, the surety will not be released. But in the absence of such agreement, the effect of taking the notes or bill in the case of a pre-existing debt, is a suspension, and a consequent discharge of the surety. It is not for the surety to prove an agreement to stay the action, but for the creditor to show that by agreement the negotiable security does not entitle the debtor to forbearance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-11\">5. C, by his dealings with L, had produced an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of L, as an individual, and his duty as administrator of P, and it is not for C to insist that L, as administrator of P, was not prevented by the arrangement from taking the necessary steps to protect the estate of his intestate, either by giving notice to C to sue upon the bond, or by paying the debt out of the assets of P\u2019s estate, and then give a lien on his own estate to indemnify P\u2019s estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-13\">8. If L had applied the assets of P\u2019s estate to the payment of his own debt, he would have been guilty of a gross breach of trust, a <em>devastavit </em>on the part of L for which C would have been responsible. C cannot relieve himself of the effects of an improvident arrangement with his debtor by insisting that a personal representative ought to have misapplied the assets in his hands.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>7. If L, as administrator of P, might have consented to the arrangement made between himself and C, it would be necessary to show that he actively concurred and consented, as administrator, to be bound by the new arrangement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-4\">S. Any one who concerts with an executor or administrator, in any manner contrary to the duty of the latter, will himself be held answerable. If, therefore, 0 obtained the consent of L, as administrator of P, to the arrangement, the effect of which is to throw the loss upon the estate of P, the surety, he can stand on no higher ground than L himself occupies; and he is precluded from claiming any benefit from that consent, to the injury of P\u2019s estate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-13\">This case was heard in Richmond but was decided at Wytheville. It was a creditors bill in the circuit court of the county of Franklin, brought in August, 1868, by James M. Callaway and Thomas Dudley, claiming to be creditors of Marshall P. Price, deceased, the first by a bond executed to him in January, 1858, by James M. W. Leftwich and Marshall P. Price, for $925, payable in twelve months, and the other by a bond for $3,000 executed in August, 1858, to Dudley, by said Leftwich and several other persons, among whom was said Marshall P. Price. The only questions in this cause was in relation to the bond executed to Callaway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-14\">The heirs of Marshall P. Price answered the bill, and insisted that said Price was the surety in said bond; and that the estate of said Price had been released from any liability on said bond by the action of said Callaway. That said Callaway had received from said Leftwich his three negotiable notes, satisfactorily endorsed, for the amount of said bond, in satisfaction thereof. These notes were given payable in three, six and nine months <em>\u2022 </em>and if not given in satisfaction of the bond, the said Price\u2019s estate was released by Callaway\u2019s thus giving time to the principal debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>It appears that Price had died before the bond fell due, and Leftwieh qualified as his administrator. That at the \u25a0 urgent request of Leftwieh, Callaway, who had brought a suit upon the bond against him, consented to dismiss the suit, and accept the three negotiable notes of Leftwieh, with endorsers, payable in three, six and nine months, for the amount of the bond. And this arrangement was carried out, the notes were delivered and the suit dismissed. The testimony is conflicting as to whether these notes were taken in satisfaction of the bond, or as a collateral security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-12\">In the progress of the cause a commissioner was directed to take, among others, an account of the debts of Price, and he reported as one of the debts due this debt of Callaway\u2019s; and there was an exception to the report on this occount. And the cause coming on to be heard on the 18th of October, 1873, this exception, as well as others, was sustained, and the accounts were recommitted to the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-13\">After this decree had been made, Callaway died, and his administrator applied to a judge of this court for an appeal; which was allowed.

Leftwieh proves the fact, and he is not contradicted by any other witness. It is very true that upon cross-examination he says it is his impression that Price was surety merely; but I do not understand him as intending to qualify his previous positive statement to the same effect. Leftwieh of course well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>knew how the fact was, and his admission, .so manifestly against his interest, that he alone was principal, is entitled to great weight. Besides, his testimony is corrobo-rated by all the circumstances. Leftwich\u2019s appeal [to Callaway for indulgence, his proposal to give the negotiable notes, the whole tone and temper of his letter to Callaway, show that he considered the debt as his own, and the burden of discharging it as resting exclusively upon him. Callaway nowhere in the record appears as denying the fact, although an opportunity of doing so was afforded him when his deposition was given, and although it was manifestly the turning point in the case. Under all these circumstances we are bound to conclude that Leftwieh was principal and Price his surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The main question in the case to be considered is, whether Price\u2019s estate is released by the dealings between Callaway and Leftwieh.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">It appears that Callaway institued an action on the bond against Leftwieh in December, 1860, and in January, 1861, Callaway took from Leftwieh, at the earnest solicitation of the latter, three negotiable notes with responsible endorsers, for three hundred and forty dollars each, being the amount then due on the bond, and thereupon the action was dismissed-. These notes were payable three, six and nine months after date. At the maturity of the first note the sum of $&gt;150 was paid upon it; and this was all that was ever paid. The first and second notes were several times renewed. The renewed notes and the nine month\u2019s note remained in the hands of Callaway\u2019s counsel until the year 1866, when suit was brought upon them. The maker, Leftwieh, and the endorsers had in the meantime become wholly insolvent, and nothing was realized from that source.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">There is some conflict in the testimony upon the point whether these notes were taken by Callaway in discharge of the debt, or simply as collateral security. Leftwieh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>swears positively they were accepted in satisfaction: Callaway says they were taken merely as collateral security; -and his counsel agrees with him. But as the information of the latter was derived wholly from the statements of his client, it is not entitled to the weight it otherwise would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">The matter to be noted, however, is that Callaway states he did not agree to give time to Leftwich. He says that Leftwich proposed to give the notes as collateral security; that he declined to go into the arrangement until he could consult his counsel; and the latter advised him the arrangement would not in any manner impair the obligation of the bond; and upon this advice he received the notes as collateral security. Now Callaway may have believed, and his counsel may have thought, the taking the notes would not impair the obligation of the surety, or even, operate as a suspension of a right of action on the bond. The question is not what they believed, but what was the legal effect of the arrangement, in the absence of an express agreement that the acceptance of the notes should not suspend a right of action on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">The proposition with respect to the notes came from Leftwich. There is no doubt his sole object was a dismissal of the suit, and an extension of time; and Calla-way knew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-14\">Leftwich in his letter to Callaway, says: \u201cIf you prosecute this suit you will cause others to sue, and it will terminate in sacrificing my property. I say sacrifice, because no property, uuder existing circumstances, can be sold except at a sacrifice.\u201d Further on, after an earnest appeal for indulgence, he says: \u201c If you will dismiss this suit, I will give you three negotiable notes at ninety days each\u2014the first third you will get iu ninety, the second third you will get in six months, the third and last in nine months, the discount and interest to be added.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-15\">Surely, after reading this letter no one can have any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>difficulty as to Leftwich\u2019s understanding of the arrangement; and that Callaway understood it in the same way is most manifest from the fact that shortly afterwards the \u25a0 notes were given, the action upon the bond was dismissed, and no effort is ever made to collect it until all the parties to the negotiable notes, maker and endorsers, had become utterly insolvent. It is impossible to believe upon these facts, that both parties did not perfectly understand the debtor was to have further time. . To.adopt any other conclusion is to suppose that Leftwich not only gave the notes without an object, but that he was willing to subject himself to a recovery on the bond while his negotiable notes were or might be current in the hands of <em>bona fide </em>holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">I attach no sort of importance to the fact that Callaway did not surrender the bond. It was no doubt filed among the papers when the suit was brought, and there remained after the suit was dismissed. Besides, Callaway\u2019s retention of the bond is perfectly consistent with the arrangement to give time, which was all Leftwich desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">But if I am mistaken in supposing there was an express agreement for further time, there can be no doubt the legal effect of accepting the notes was to suspend the right of action on the bond during the period allowed for the payment of the notes. Whilst the mere taking a negotiable security, payable at a future day, does not, unless so agreed,, operate as a payment of an antecedent debt, it does operate to suspend the right of action on the original demand until the maturity of the bill or note, unless it is made to appear it was received simply as collateral security.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">It is a conditional satisfaction with respect to the principal ; and with respect to the surety it is absolute, unless it plainly appears the parties intended otherwise. <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Berrington, 2 </em>Lead. Cases in Equity, 1915; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Lewis, 8 </em>John. R. 389; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>5 Hill\u2019s R. 463; Brandt on Suretyship and Guaranty, \u00a7 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The reason is said to be that the creditor, by negotiating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the bill or note, and passing it into the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder, may expose the debtor to the payment of both - claims. In some of the cases it is held that taking the negotiable security creates a conclusive presumption of law of an agreement to suspend. In other cases it is held, and with better reason, it is simply a question of intention. If the parties agree that the right of an action on the original debt shall not be stayed, the surety will not be released. But in the absence of such agreement, the effect of taking the notes or bill, in the case of a pre-existing debt, is a suspension, and a consequent discharge of the surety. It is not for the surety to prove an agreement to stay the action, but for the <em>creditor to </em>show that by agreement the negotiable security does not entitle the debtor to forbearance. See <em>Armistead </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>2 Patton &amp; Heath, 816; <em>Blair &amp; Hoge </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>28 Gratt., 165, 171, 173. In the ease before us, it is not proved, there is nothing from which it may be inferred there was an agreement that Callaway might proceed on the bond notwithstanding the negotiable notes. On the contrary, all the circumstances indicate the understanding that further time was to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">The learned counsel for the appellant insists, however, that Leftwich, as the personal representative of Price, w'as not prevented by the arrangement from taking the necessary steps to protect the estate of his intestate. If, for example, he had given Callaway notice to sue, he (Leftwich) could not by plea, or by injunction, have stayed Callaway\u2019s hands. He might, if he pleased, have paid the debt out of the assets, and then given a lien on his own estate to indemnify his intestate\u2019s estate. It is a sufficient answer to say that Callaw\u2019ay, by his dealings with Leftwich, had created an irreconcilable conflict with Leftwich\u2019s interest as an individual and his duty as personal representative; and it does not lie in the mouth of Calla-w\u2019ay to say that Leftwich might or ought to have given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>such notice. If we can suppose so improbable an event as a notice by Leftwich, the personal representative, to Callaway to bring such suit, we must suppose that Left-wich, as an individual, would claim the benefit of the agreement for indulgence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The idea that Leftwich might have paid the debt out of the assets of Price\u2019s estate, and then given a lien on his own property as indemnity, is still more untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">If ive may presume he had in his hands assets available for that purpose, upon what principle, or by what right, could Leftwich, as personal representative, direct these assets to the payment of his own debts to the injury of Price\u2019s creditors and distributees? Such an act would have been a gross breach of trust, a <em>devastavit </em>on the part of Leftwich, for which Callaway himself would have been responsible. The proposition cannot for a moment be entertained that Callaway may relieve himself of the effects of an improvident arrangement with his debtor by insisting that a personal representative ought to have misapplied the assets in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">It has been further argued that an agreement to forbear will not release the surety, if made with his knowledge and consent; and in that case Leftwich, being at the time the personal representative of the surety, must as such liave consented to the arrangement with Callaway.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">It is very clear, however, that Leftwich was acting for himself only. He did not profess to represent the estate of Price in anything that was said or done. And before that estate can be held bound it ought plainly to appear that Leftwich in his character of administrator consented to the arrangement. It is not enough that he was merely passive. It would be necessary to show that he actively \u25a0concurred and consented as administrator to be bound by the new agreement. Brandt, \u00a7299. But if it be conceded that such assent was given, it was a palpable breach of 'official duty. The effect of the <em>arrangement </em>was to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>prive the representative of Price\u2019s estate of the legal right to insist upon payment of the debt by the principal, or to--pay the debt himself, and to proceed at once against the principal. It will scarcely be denied that if the personal representative of the surety agrees that the creditor may-give time to the principal debtor, and in the meantime the-principal becomes insolvent, and the estate of the surety is required to pay the debt, the personal representative-will himself be held to answer out of his own estate. 2; Lomax Exo\u2019rs, 295; mar. 471, 476, 485, top.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">It is equally clear, I take it, that any one who concerts-with an executor or administrator in any manner contrary to the duty of the latter, will himself be held answerable. <em>Graff </em>v. <em>Castleman, </em>5 Rand. 195, 203. If, therefore, the-creditor enters into an arrangement with the personal representative of the surety, the effect of which is to throw the loss upon the estate of the surety, he can stand on no-higher ground than the personal representative himself occupies. And in this case if it be conceded that Callaway obtained the consent of Leftwich as administrator to the-arrangement-, he is precluded from claiming any benefit from that consent to the injury of Price\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The learned counsel tells us, however, the arrangement, was an advantageous one for all parties, especially the-surety, inasmuch as it furnished a new and additional security for the debt. It may have so appeared at the time,, but the result has proved the very reverse. It is most apparent the indulgence extended to Leftwich is the cause-of all the difficulty in this case. If\u2019 Callaway, instead of' yielding to his solicitations for delay, had proceeded with.his suit, and obtained his judgment, he would have secured his lien, and ultimately realized his debt. His conduct with respect to the negotiable notes was equally unjust to Price\u2019s estate; for after receiving them he left therm in the hands of his counsel, without an effort to collect or-even to secure his debt by judgment until all the parties, had become insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>But if it was conceded the arrangement was an advantageous one to the estate of Price, the concession would not help the cause of the appellant. It is well settled law that if the time of payment be extended by an agreement binding on the creditor, the surety is discharged even though the extension of credit may prove to be a benefit to him. Because the question whether the alteration be beneficial or the reverse depends on circumstances that cannot always be judicially ascertained, and-the surety can no longer require the principal to fulfil the contract in its original form. <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Bowington, 2 </em>Lead. Cases in Equity, 1908; 10 John. R. 70; 7 Hill\u2019s R. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">For these reasons I think there is no error in the decree of the circuit court, and that it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Christian and Anderson, J\u2019s, concurred in the opinion of Staples, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Judge <em>Moncure </em>was not present when the opinion was delivered, but he had read the opinion and concurred in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-15\">Decree appirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
