The third and fourth paragraphs of the will read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">\u20181 THIRD: I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate of whatsoever kind, character and nature, and wherever situated, to my beloved daughters, BARBARA M.

Klein Olsen, his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cGiving and granting unto said Trustees full power and authority to manage and control said TRUST FUND: and said Trustees shall during the term of this trust, pay over and allow the said Lila M.

Klein Olsen, during the term of the TRUST herein created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u2018 \u2018 In the event that the said LILA M. KLEIN OLSEN shall become divorced, or widowed from said WILLIAM B. OLSEN, the said Trustees shall make a full and complete accounting of said TRUST FUND, and pay over and allow to the said Lila M.

Klein Olsen for any sum or sums so paid and allowed to her as aforesaid either during the existence of said TRUST or the final settlement thereof, shall be a full and sufficient release and acquittance to the said Trustees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Both daughters survived the deceased. Barbara M. Klein was born on September 3, 1914, and died on July 15, 1936, at the age of 22 years. Her death occurred after the death of her mother but prior to the distribution of her mother\u2019s estate. Said daughter had married Joseph M. Christensen after the death of her mother and had thereafter died testate. Under the decree of distribution the probate court distributed an undivided one-half interest in the residue of the mother\u2019s estate to the executors of Barbara M. Klein Christensen, deceased. The remaining undivided one-half interest was distributed to Lila M. Klein Olsen subject, however, to the terms of the trust set forth in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Appellant contends that said court erred in distributing one-half of the estate to the executors of Barbara M. Klein Christensen, deceased, but we find no merit in this contention. The situation presented here is quite similar to that presented to the court in <em>Estate of </em>Reith, 144 Cal. 314 [77 Pac. 942], and we are of the opinion that the decision in that case is controlling here. (See, also, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>73 Cal. 99 [14 Pac. 394] ; Probate Code, sec. 28.) It will be noted that the testatrix devised and bequeathed the residue of the estate \u201cto my beloved daughters, Barbara M. Klein and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Lila M. Klein Olsen, they surviving, share and share alike, in trust, as hereinafter provided\u201d. Throughout the will the testatrix referred to \u201cthe estate so bequeathed to my said daughter\u201d Barbara M. Klein and Lila M. Klein Olsen and there was no direct devise or bequest to the trustees. It will be further noted that there was no provision in the will making disposition of the estate in the event that the daughters survived the mother but did not live until the time specified for obtaining possession of the estate. Under the authorities cited, we believe that the trial court correctly concluded that the estate of the mother vested in the two daughters at the time of the mother\u2019s death subject only to the terms of the trust and that, upon the death of Barbara following the mother\u2019s death, an undivided one-half interest in the mother\u2019s estate should be distributed to the executors of Barbara\u2019s estate. All of the authorities cited by appellant are distinguishable on their facts and the language of one of the authorities so cited tends to support the views herein expressed. (See <em>Estate of Blake, </em>157 Cal. 448, at p. 464 [108 Pac. 287].)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Nourse, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on December 31, 1937, and an application by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on January 31, 1938.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
