Prom this certificate the following uncontradicted facts appear: Notice of appeal was filed on June 11, 1936. No bill of exceptions has been settled as provided by section 650 of the Code of Civil Procedure. No transcript has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure. The statutory period within which a record on appeal may be prepared and filed under either of the methods provided by law for perfecting an appeal has expired. On October 18, 1937, the trial court, on motion of respondent, made its order terminating proceedings for procuring a transcript on appeal and dismissing appellants\u2019 application for such transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The motion for dismissal is therefore proper and must be granted. <em>(Hunter </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>136 Cal.
