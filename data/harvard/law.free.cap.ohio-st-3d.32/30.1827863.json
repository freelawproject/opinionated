Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The central issue is whether the judgment of acquittal, entered by the trial court pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C), is a final verdict within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67. For the reasons which follow, we hold that it is and that, consequently, the state could not appeal therefrom. We further hold that the writ of prohibition should be granted to prevent the court of appeals from exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">R.C. 2945.67, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">\u201c(A) A prosecuting attorney, village solicitor, city director of law, or the attorney general * * * may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, <em>except the final verdict, </em>of the trial court in a criminal case or of the juvenile court in a delinquency case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">The respondent granted the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal on the basis that judgments of acquittal granted pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are not final verdicts. Respondent argues that R.C. 2945.67(A) was written broadly and designed to prevent a criminal defendant from being placed in double jeopardy. Here, a reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal would reinstate the jury verdict of guilty and, therefore, respondent states, there would be no violation of relator\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">Respondent urges us to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>holdings by the United States Supreme Court to the effect that the constitutional Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a government appeal where the successful prosecution of the appeal would not require a new trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 82; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Respondent\u2019s argument is not persuasive. R.C. 2945.67(A) has no analogous federal counterpart. The federal Criminal Appeals Act, Section 3731, Title 18, U.S. Code, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u201cIn a criminal case an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision, judgment, or order of a district court dismissing an indictment or information or granting a new trial after verdict or judgment, as to any one or more counts, except that <em>no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause </em>of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The issue under Ohio law is not one of double jeopardy but rather whether a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C) is a final verdict. This distinction was recognized by Justice Rehnquist in <em>Scott, supra, </em>who noted that in 1971 Congress adopted a new Criminal Appeals Act which shifted the focus from issues of statutory construction to issues involving the meaning and scope of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court\u2019s opinion in <em>Scott </em>acknowledges:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201cIn our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that \u2018Congress intended to remove all statutory barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 337 (1975).\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>at 85, The Ohio Legislature has not taken that step.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Keeton </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 379, 18 OBR 434, 481 N.E. 2d 629, this court had occasion to consider a judgment of acquittal gr\u00e1nted pursuant to Crim. R. 29(A). We held, at paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">\u201cA directed verdict of acquittal by the trial judge in a criminal case is a \u2018final verdict\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A) which is not ap-pealable by the state as a matter of right or by leave to appeal pursuant to that statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">Respondent would distinguish <em>Keeton </em>on the ground that acquittal pursuant to Crim. R. 29(A) leads to double jeopardy whereas acquittal pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C) does not. However, as noted, R.C. 2945.67(A) prevents an appeal of <em>any </em>final verdict and is not tied to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Moreover, our opinion in <em>Keeton </em>draws no distinction between Rules 29(A) and 29(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Respondent makes the unpersuasive argument that a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(A) is a final verdict but a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(C) is not, even if both are grounded on a determination by the trial judge that the state produced insufficient evidence to convict. We reject such an incongruous result. The judgment of acquittal in the case <em>sub judice, </em>though entered after a jury verdict and upon the authority of Crim. R. 29(C), was grounded upon insufficiency of evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>determination of innocence and as much a final verdict as any judgment of acquittal granted pursuant to Crim. R. 29(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\">Accordingly, we hold that a judgment of acquittal by a trial judge pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C) is a final verdict within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A), and is not appealable by the state as a matter of right or by leave to appeal pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We now consider whether a writ of prohibition should be allowed. This court has consistently held that in order for a writ of prohibition to issue, a relator must establish: (1) the court or officer against whom it is sought is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power; (2) the exercise of such power is unauthorized by law; and (3) it will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists. <em>Manrow </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas of Lucas Cty. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St. 3d 37, 20 OBR 285, 485 N.E. 2d 713; <em>State, ex rel. Corrigan, </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 26, 14 OBR 328, 470 N.E. 2d 894. A writ of prohibition cannot serve as a substitute for an appeal. <em>Manrow, supra; State, ex rel. Ruffin, </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 58, 75 O.O. 2d 142, 346 N.E. 2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">However, where an inferior court is without jurisdiction to act, the availability or adequacy of a remedy of appeal to prevent the resulting injustice is immaterial to the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction by a superior court to prevent usurpation of jurisdiction by the inferior court. <em>State, ex rel. Johnson, </em>v. <em>Perry County Court </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 53, 58, 25 OBR 77, 81, 495 N.E. 2d 16, 21; <em>State, ex rel. Adams, </em>v. <em>Gusweiler </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 326, 329, 59 O.O. 2d 387, 388, 285 N.E. 2d 22, 24. See, also, <em>State, ex rel.

By providing protections to criminal defendants far in excess of the Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision, the majority here has placed trial court error beyond rational appellate overview. The majority opinion significantly limits the power of the prosecution to thrash out purely legal issues which has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the prosecution to appeal, by leave of court. I, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">The United States Supreme Court has, on a number of occasions, reviewed situations \u201con all fours\u201d with the case <em>subjudice. </em>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kopp </em>(1976), 429 U.S. 121, the defendant was found guilty after trial to the court. Following the trial, but prior to sentencing, the trial court dismissed the indictment. The issue upon appeal was whether, in fact, the prosecution could appeal the case. The United States Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion, stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">\u201cIn <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332 (1975), we held that double jeopardy would not bar a * * * [prosecution] appeal <em>if success on that appeal would result in the reinstatement of a verdict of guilty. </em>The fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>dismissal of the indictment here occurred after a general finding of guilt rendered by the court in a bench trial, rather than after a return of a verdict of guilty by a jury, is immaterial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1976), 429 U.S. 1, the defendant was found guilty by the trial court. After the finding, but prior to sentencing, the trial court reconsidered its previous denial of a motion to suppress evidence and thereby overturned its own finding. The issue upon appeal, as in the case here, was whether the prosecution could appeal the trial court\u2019s decision. The United States Supreme Court stated that the prosecutor is certainly entitled to an appeal \u201csince success on that appeal would result in the reinstatement of the general finding of guilt rather than in further factual proceedings relating to guilt or innocence. As in <em>Wilson, </em>there would then remain only the imposition of sentence and the entry of a judgment of conviction * * <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. This opinion was also unanimous. See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1976), 429 U.S. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Also basing its determinations upon the landmark case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 332, was <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 358, wherein it was stated at 365 that in \u201cthe situation where the jury returns a verdict of guilt but the trial court thereafter enters a judgment of acquittal, an appeal is permitted. In that situation, a conclusion by an appellate court that the judgment of acquittal was improper does not require a criminal defendant to submit to a second trial; the error can be corrected on remand by the entry of a judgment on the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The majority opinion seeks refuge in the distinctions between R.C. 2945.67(A) and the federal Criminal Appeals Act, Section 3731, Title 18, U.S. Code. It is quite obvious that the federal statute, enacted in 1970 after years of frustrating experience with narrow statutory interpretations (see, <em>e.g., Wilson, supra), </em>contemplates a power of appeal which extends fully to the limits allowed by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Nothing about R.C. 2945.67(A) implies that it is limited by anything less than the Double Jeopardy Clause. As a matter of fact, the legislative history of this statute indicates that the General Assembly fully intended to enlarge the powers of prosecutors to seek appellate determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Under former R.C. 2945.67 through R.C. 2945.70, and indeed under their former analogues, G.C. 13681, later G.C. 13446-1, the General Assembly had attempted to allow prosecutors to bring a bill of exceptions, <em>i.e., </em>a statement of the errors about which complaint is made upon appeal, even in cases where the defendant had been finally adjudged to be innocent. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Dodge </em>(1967) , 10 Ohio App. 2d 92, 39 O.O. 2d 174, 226 N.E. 2d 156. Under these statutes, the trial court was required to appoint an attorney to represent the viewpoint objected to by the prosecutor and the decision of the appellate court above could \u201cnot affect the judgment of the trial court in said cause * * *.\u201d Former R.C. 2945.70. This, of course, created nothing less than a forbidden advisory opinion, as this court so ruled in <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Heaton </em>(1968) , 15 Ohio St. 2d 65, 44 O.O. 2d 50, 238 N.E. 2d 790. In so doing we expressly recognized that the intent of the General Assembly was solely to \u201caccommodate * * * the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 44 O.O. 2d at 56, 238 N.E. 2d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 107, 53 O.O. 2d 302, 265 N.E. 2d 261, what remained of the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>sections was further eroded. In that case, the prosecution appealed the trial court\u2019s allowance of a pretrial motion to suppress evidence. That court acknowledged that other states as well as the federal government allowed such appeals, and even cited Section 3731, Title 18, U.S. Code, as the majority in the present case has. It nevertheless, on quite narrow grounds, held that prosecutors could not so appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">Thereafter, the Ohio General Assembly acted. The analysis of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 1168, which enacted new R.C. 2945.67, by the Legislative Service Commission, expressly noted that <em>Heaton </em>and <em>Collins </em>had overturned the statute\u2019s advisory opinion provisions and, going further, had left prosecutors only with the quite meager powers \u201cto appeal, with leave, the decision of the court with respect to a motion to quash, a plea in abatement, a demurrer, a motion in arrest of judgment or an equivalent motion * * Quite obvious was that the General Assembly fully intended to expand the prosecutor\u2019s ability to appeal adverse determinations of the trial court and, as with the earlier statutes, to do so as fully as would \u201caccommodate,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>not run afoul of, the double jeopardy prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The current statute precisely implements this legislative intention by first providing for prosecution appeals from pretrial decisions and other non-verdict-related post-trial decisions. It then provides that \u201cany other decision\u201d may be appealed \u201cby leave of the court to which the appeal is taken * * * except the final verdict. * * *\u201d This would impliedly include the trial court decisions made after jeopardy had attached but which do not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause. That this is the meaning of the phrase, we have already determined. In <em>State, ex rel. Leis, </em>v. <em>Kraft </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 34, 36, 10 OBR 237, 239, 460 N.E. 2d 1372, 1374, we stated that the term \u201cfinal verdict\u201d was a limitation on appeals with leave, \u201cowing to <em>double jeopardy considerations\u201d </em>(emphasis added), and that the kind of decisions which an appeal with leave could encompass was \u201cintended in a broad sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also have determined that the verdict in a given case has neither more nor less finality than the Double Jeopardy Clause allows. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 254, 15 O.O. 3d 262, 400 N.E. 2d 897. It therefore cannot be seriously contended that the statute\u2019s use of the term final verdict is less than coextensive with the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">In relying upon our prior decision, <em>State </em>v. <em>Keeton </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 379, 18 OBR 434, 481 N.E. 2d 629, the majority admits but ignores the implications of the several distinctions from the case <em>sub judice. In Keeton, </em>we held that a Crim. R. 29(A) motion for judgment of acquittal was included within R.C. 2945.67(A)\u2019s \u201cfinal verdict.\u201d This, as pointed out in <em>Keeton, </em>comports with the double jeopardy protections which \u201cbar the retrial of the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380-381, 18 OBR at 436, 481 N.E. 2d at 631. Also, such determination is in accord with the United States Supreme Court decisions previously described.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">On the other hand, the present case involved a Crim. R. 29(C) motion after verdict or discharge of jury. As admitted by the majority, no retrial results from reversing the grant of such motion; instead, the jury verdict is reinstated with no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The majority points out that the grant of motions under both subsections (C) and (A) may be predicated upon a determination by the trial court that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction. The \u201cincongruous result\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>would be that a Crim. R. 29(A) determination creates a final verdict whereas a determination under (C) would not, yet both are factual determinations of innocence. This result is certainly no more \u201cincongruous\u201d than the difference between the trial court\u2019s finding and that of the jury in the case before us. The point to be made, however, is that the development of the double jeopardy prohibition \u201cfrom its common-law origins thus suggests that it was directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions, not at Government appeals, at least where those appeals would not require a new trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The decision to grant a writ of prohibition in a case such as the one before us is erroneous. The statute at issue provided the court of appeals with full power to grant the leave to appeal at issue. That decision is completely reviewable upon further appeal. This provides a plain and adequate remedy at law. See, <em>e.g., Manrow </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas of Lucas Cty. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St. 3d 37, 39, 20 OBR 285, 286, 485 N.E. 2d 713, 715; <em>Luchene </em>v. <em>Wagner </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St. 3d 37, 39, 12 OBR 32, 34, 465 N.E. 2d 395, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The granting of the writ in this case blurs the distinctions between cases of plain and adequate remedy where appeal is the remedy, and those which allow judicial discretion. Especially egregious is the fact that <em>all </em>appeals by the prosecutor under R.C. 2945.67(A), made by leave of court, are now subject to the writ of prohibition. This substitute for appeal could not have been intended by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-7\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b90-8\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Akc\">dissenting. Because I believe that a judgment of- acquittal granted pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C) is not a \u201cfinal verdict\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A) and, hence, is appealable by the state, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">In concluding that the trial court\u2019s judgment is a \u201cfinal verdict,\u201d the majority misses a crucial point \u2014 a point which I believe is dispositive. <em>Courts do not render verdicts. </em>Courts render judgments. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 1398, defines \u201cverdict\u201d as \u201c[t]he formal decision or finding <em>made by a jury </em>* * *.\u201d ( Emphasis added.) Nowhere in the lengthy definitions of the term \u201cverdict\u201d and of the various kinds of verdicts is a finding or decision <em>by the court </em>characterized as a \u201cverdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">In construing statutes, courts must give the words their plain, ordinary meaning unless the legislature has clearly evinced a contrary intention. <em>Coventry Towers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Strongsville </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 120, 122, 18 OBR 151, 152, 480 N.E. 2d 412, 414. In today\u2019s decision, the common, ordinary meaning of the word \u201cverdict\u201d escapes the notice of the majority, resulting in a clearly erroneous interpretation of the relevant statute. The legislature could easily have used the word \u201cjudgment\u201d in place of or in addition to the term \u201cverdict\u201d if that had been its intention. Instead, the statute refers only to verdicts, and this court may not assume that judgments are also encompassed in the statute\u2019s purview. I, therefore, take vigorous exception to this court\u2019s insertion of the term \u201cjudgment\u201d when the statute refers only to verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">The majority\u2019s confusion stems partly from the unfortunate misuse of the term \u201cdirected verdict\u201d in <em>State </em>v. <em>Keeton </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 379, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>OBR 434, 481 N.E. 2d 629. Paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Keeton </em>reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u201cA directed verdict of acquittal by the trial judge in a criminal case is a \u2018final verdict\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A) which is not ap-pealable by the state as a matter of right or by leave to appeal pursuant to that statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">This language is inaccurate. The term \u201cdirected verdict of acquittal\u201d is a misnomer. A directed verdict is properly applicable only in civil actions under Civ. R. 50(A). The .Criminal Rules make no mention of a \u201cdirected verdict.\u201d Crim. R. 29 provides only for entry of a <em>\u201cjudgment </em>of acquittal\u201d (emphasis added) in the event the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. The motion herein was made pursuant to Crim. R. 29(C), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u201c* * * If a jury returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict, <em>a motion for judgment of acquittal </em>may be made or renewed within fourteen days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during the fourteen day period. If a verdict of guilty is returned, the court may on such motion <em>set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. </em>If no verdict is returned, the court may enter <em>judgment of acquittal. * </em>* *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Setting aside the verdict and entering a contrary judgment is materially different from directing a verdict. By directing a verdict, the trial court essentially \u201cdirects\u201d the jury to render a particular verdict. This is not the procedure in a criminal case. No provision is made for \u201cdirecting a verdict\u201d in the Criminal Rules. The misuse of the term \u201cdirected verdict of acquittal\u201d in <em>Keeton </em>contributes directly to the majority\u2019s confused interpretation of the term \u201cverdict\u201d as used in R.C. 2945.67, as is evidenced by the majority\u2019s overt reliance on <em>Keeton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Thus, I would hold that a judgment of acquittal entered pursuant to a motion under Crim. R. 29(C) cannot be a \u201cfinal verdict\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A) and is therefore appealable by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">As explained by Justice Holmes in his dissent to today\u2019s decision, a holding that the judgment by the trial court granting relator\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict is appealable by the state would not offend the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 332. Where the state\u2019s success on appeal would result only in the reinstatement of the guilty verdict and not in retrial, appeal by the state does not place the defendant in jeopardy twice. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not even called into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">If the appeal by the state were allowed to proceed in this case, as clearly it should, the court of appeals <em>may agree </em>to hear the appeal but is not obliged to do so under R.C. 2945.67(A), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">\u201cA prosecuting attorney, village solicitor, city director of law, or the attorney general may appeal as a matter or [of] right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case, or any decision of a juvenile court in a delinquency case, which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or a motion for the return of seized property or grants post conviction relief pursuant to sections 2953.21 to 2953.24 of the Revised Code, and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict, of the trial court in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>criminal case or of the juvenile court in a delinquency case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Since the entry of a judgment of acquittal is not among the matters enumerated which constitute the basis for an appeal as of right, it falls in the category of \u201cany other decision\u201d and is appealable only \u201cby leave of the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d Since the exception making final verdicts unappealable does not apply to the judgment herein as discussed <em>supra, </em>I would deny the writ of prohibition and permit the court of appeals to exercise its discretion in determining whether to grant the state leave to appeal in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-7\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
