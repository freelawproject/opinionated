We find in the negative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The court of appeals found Hyatt to be covered under Coverage Part 500 of the Universal policy issued to Bob-Boyd. Coverage Part 500 is labelled \u201cGarage Insurance\u201d and provides coverage not only with respect to \u201cGarage Operations\u201d but also with respect to \u201cAuto Hazard.\u201d \u201cAuto Hazard\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u201c* * * [T]he ownership, maintenance or use of any AUTO YOU own or which is in YOUR care, custody or control and: (1) used for the purpose of GARAGE OPERATIONS or * * * (3) furnished for the use of any person or organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Coverage Part 500 defines \u201cinsured\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u201cWHO IS AN INSURED * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">\u201cWith respect to the AUTO HAZARD:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\u201c1. YOU;</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">&lt;&lt;* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">\u201c3. Any other person or organization <em>required by law to be an INSURED while using an AUTO covered by this Coverage Part within the scope of YOUR permission.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">The court of appeals held that Hyatt was required by law to be an insured at the time of the accident pursuant to R.C. 4509.51(B) and 4509.101(A)(1). Both sections are part of Ohio\u2019s current motor vehicle financial responsibility laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">R.C. 4509.51 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">\u201cEvery owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">\u201c(B) Shall insure the person named therein and any other person as insured, using any such motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such vehicles * * \u00bbt\u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">Appellants contend essentially that R.C. 4509.51(B) does not require that Hyatt be considered an insured within the meaning of Coverage Part 500. We agree. Appellants maintain that the policy would include coverage pursuant to R.C. 4509.51(B) only if the policy had been \u201ccertified\u201d as proof of financial responsibility pursuant to R.C. 4509.46. As authority for this argument, appellants rely upon our decision in <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Aron </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 490, 26 O.O. 2d 130, 196 N.E. 2d 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\"><em>Moyer </em>involves a factual scenario similar to the case at bar. Aron was given permission to test drive a 1958 Mercury automobile by an employee of the Hunter Motor Company, an automobile dealer. While operating this vehicle, Aron collided with a bicycle, killing the plaintiff\u2019s son. Aron had a policy of automobile insurance issued to him by the Travelers Insurance Company. The 1958 Mercury was covered under Hunter\u2019s insurance policy issued by Universal Underwriters Insurance Company. The plaintiff\u2019s action on a supplemental petition contended that Aron was insured under the policy issued to Hunter. This court held that Aron was not covered under Hunter\u2019s policy and provided the following syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201c1. There is no provision in the Financial Responsibility Act requiring a person to purchase an automobile \u2018owner\u2019s policy\u2019 of insurance except under circumstances set forth in Section 4509.31, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u201c2. A person is not an insured under an automobile insurance policy unless such person is defined as an insured by the terms of the policy, except where such policy has been \u2018certified\u2019 under the provision of R.C. 4509.46, Revised Code, and thereby the definition of who is an \u2018insured\u2019 under the policy has been modified to conform to the provisions of the statute. (Section 4509.51, Revised Code.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellees argue that appellants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Moyer </em>is misplaced. This was the view adopted by the court of appeals which stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>\u201cMoyer </em>* * * is not dispositive of the issues herein * * *. * * * [T]he policy in <em>Moyer </em>expressly provided that the policy would include coverage pursuant to R.C. 4509.151 [sic] only if the policy were certified pursuant to R.C. 4509.46. The <em>Moyer </em>court found that, in light of the certification provisions of the policy therein involved, a person using the insured vehicle with permission of the owner was not an insured unless the policy had been certified pursuant to R.C. 4509.46, focusing upon the language of the policy with respect to the definition of insured. The policy herein, however, expressly provides that a person using the vehicle with permission of the owner is an insured if required to do so by law. The difference in policy language between the instant policy and that involved in <em>Moyer </em>compels a different result. The policy in <em>Moyer </em>expressly provided that it would afford such coverage only if certified; whereas the policy herein contains no such limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">However, in our view, a thorough reading of the Financial Responsibility Act (R.C. 4509.01 <em>et seq.), Moyer </em>and <em>Iszczukiewicz </em>v. <em>Univeral Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(N.D. Ohio 1960), 182 F. Supp. 733, indicates that <em>Moyer </em>is directly on point with the cause <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">R.C. 4509.01(L) defines a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d as an \u201c <em>' owner\u2019s policy' </em>or an \u2018operator\u2019s policy\u2019 of liability insurance, <em>certified </em>as provided in Section 4509.46 * * * as proof of financial responsibility, * * * to or for the benefit of the person named therein as insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4509.45 provides that one way of showing proof of financial responsibility, <em>when required, </em>is by filing a certificate of insurance as provided in R.C. 4509.46 or 4509.47. R.C. 4509.46 states in pertinent part: \u201cProof of financial responsibility may be furnished by filing with the registrar of motor vehicles the written certificate of any insurance carrier authorized to do business in this state certifying that there is in effect a <em>motor-vehicle liability policy </em>for the benefit of the person to furnish proof of financial responsibility.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4509.51, as shown above, then provides what is required in an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Thus, the statutory language is clear that an insurance policy, such as the one in the case at bar, can be modified to make it comply with the Financial Responsibility Act, and specifically the provisions of R.C. 4509.51, <em>only </em>where the policy has been <em>certified </em>as proof of financial responsibility. At no time prior to Hyatt\u2019s accident was Bob-Boyd required to show proof of financial responsibility and have its insurance policy \u201ccertified.\u201d In the absence of such facts, only the terms of the policy define who is an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Moreover, following a discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>of the relevant statutes and policy provisions, <em>Moyer </em>states:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u201cThere is no provision in the Financial Responsibility Act requiring a person to purchase an \u2018owner\u2019s policy\u2019 of insurance except under certain circumstances set forth in the act (See Section 4509.31, Revised Code) which are not present in this case. The policy issued by the appellant is not such an \u2018owner\u2019s policy,\u2019 and there is no showing in the record that the policy was ever \u2018certified\u2019 to-make it comply with the Financial Responsibility Act. Until such certification, the policy remains as issued, and all terms, conditions, and definitions, including the definition of who is an \u2018insured,\u2019 remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>\u201cFurther this court disapproves of the holding in the case of Iszczukiewicz </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(D.C. Ohio), 182 F. Supp., 733, <em>cited in appellant\u2019s brief, to the extent that the holding imposed liability on the insurer with respect to an accident by applying the Financial Responsibility Act rather than the terms of the coverage stated in the policy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 493, 26 O.O. 2d at 132, 196 N.E. 2d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In <em>Iszczukiewicz, </em>a customer of a used car dealership was involved in an accident while test driving an automobile owned by the dealership. The injured party filed an action for declaratory judgment seeking to hold the defendant insurer liable under the dealership\u2019s garage liability policy. The policy contained a provision which stated that it would comply with the financial responsibility laws of any state. The customer was not defined as an insured under the terms of the policy. Additionally, the policy did not contain a provision providing for coverage only upon certification such as the provision in <em>Moyer </em>and the policy had not been certified pursuant to R.C. 4509.46. Despite these facts, the federal district court applied the statute and held that R.C. 4509.51 required the customer to be covered under the dealership\u2019s policy. In effect, the decision required all automobile owners to carry an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d as defined by R.C. 4509.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">For this court to affirm the decision of the court of appeals in the cause <em>sub judice </em>and apply the provisions of the statute instead of the terms of the policy, we would have to adopt the reasoning and holding of the court in <em>Iszczukiewicz. </em>We decline to do so as a result of our prior disapproval of the holding in <em>Iszczukiewicz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Furthermore, the soundness of the syllabus adopted in <em>Moyer, supra, </em>is reinforced by the interpretations of other courts that have construed the financial responsibility laws of Ohio prior to 1984. In <em>Duffey </em>v. <em>Dollison </em>(C.A. 6, 1984), 734 F. 2d 265, the court construed Ohio\u2019s Financial Responsibility Act to require proof of financial responsibility only when a driver had failed, within a reasonable time, to satisfy a judgment for damages arising from an automobile accident or had been convicted of certain serious traffic offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 266. <em>Duffey </em>further states: \u201cThe Ohio Act has as its object the protection of the public from financially irresponsible motorists who have proved unwilling or unable to satisfy a judgment arising from an automobile accident. <em>The statute embodies a \u2018one-bite\u2019 approach to achieving this purpose by permitting motorists the privilege of driving without any proof of financial responsibility until they incur an accident related judgment and fail to satisfy it within 80 days. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 269. We find <em>Duffey </em>to be consistent with our holding in <em>Moyer </em>to the extent that the Financial Responsibility Act did not <em>require </em>a person to purchase an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d of insurance meeting the requirements of R.C. 4509.51 except under certain circumstances when proof of financial responsibility was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">An owner of an automobile could carry voluntary automobile liability insurance which did not meet the requirements of R.C. 4509.51 for an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d of insurance. However, the law was clear that a certificate of the existence of an owner\u2019s policy or operator\u2019s policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of insurance was necessary to constitute proof of financial responsibility following an accident or conviction on certain serious traffic offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the Financial Responsibility Act, as constituted prior to 1984, may have subtly encouraged automobile owners to carry an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d of insurance pursuant to R.C. 4509.51,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it by no means required that such a policy be carried. Not until a liability policy was to be \u201ccertified\u201d as proof of financial responsibility did it have to meet the requirements of R.C. 4509.51. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. </em>(1978), 63 Ohio App. 2d 87, 17 O.O. 3d 267, 409 N.E. 2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We therefore conclude that the syllabus adopted in <em>Moyer, supra, </em>is dispositive with regard to the application of R.C. 4509.51 to the facts of the instant action. At no time prior to Hyatt\u2019s accident was Bob-Boyd required to have its Universal policy certified as proof of financial responsibility. Under those circumstances, the terms of the policy control who is an insured, not the statute. Therefore, with regard to R.C. 4509.51(B) and Coverage Part 500, Hyatt was not \u201crequired by law to be an INSURED\u201d while using the automobile owned by Bob-Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Appellees further contend that Hyatt was \u201crequired by law to be an INSURED\u201d at the time of the accident pursuant to R.C. 4509.101(A). This section was also cited by the court of appeals as its second reason for distinguishing our holding in <em>Moyer, supra. </em>R.C. 4509.101(A) provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) No person shall operate, or permit the operation of, a motor vehicle in this state, unless proof of financial responsibility is maintained with respect to that vehicle, or, in the case of a driver who is not the owner, with respect to his operation of that vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">The reliance of appellees and the court of appeals on R.C. 4509.101(A) is misplaced. R.C. 4509.101(A) does not <em>require </em>that every owner and operator of a motor vehicle in this state maintain automobile liability insurance. R.C. 4509.101(A) requires that <em>proof of financial responsibility </em>be maintained by an owner or operator. R.C. 4509.01(K) defines \u201cproof of financial responsibility\u201d as \u201cproof of ability to respond in damages' for liability, on account of accidents occurring subsequent to the effective date of such proof, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle in the amount of twelve thousand five hundred dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and in the amount of seven thousand five hundred dollars because of injuries to property of others in any one accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">R.C. 4509.45 provides in relevant part that \u201c[p]roof of financial responsibility when required under section 4507.022, <em>4509.101, </em>4509.32 * * * of the Revised Code may be given by filing <em>any </em>of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201c(A) A certificate of insurance as provided in section 4509.46 or 4509.47 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u201c(B) A bond as provided in section 4509.59 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u201c(C) A certificate of deposit of money or securities as provided in section 4509.62 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u201c(D) A certificate of self-insurance, as provided in section 4509.72 of the Revised Code * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">While an automobile insurance policy may be the simplest to obtain and the most logical way of maintaining proof of financial responsibility, it is not the <em>only </em>way to maintain proof of financial responsibility in accordance with R.C. 4509.101(A). Thus, R.C. 4509.101(A) does not mandate that Hyatt was \u201crequired by law\u201d to be an <em>insured </em>while using the automobile owned by Bob-Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Furthermore, assuming that R.C. 4509.101(A) did require that Hyatt be an insured, that section is not applicable to this action. R.C. 4509.101 did not become effective until <em>January 1, 1984. South Euclid </em>v. <em>Jemison </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 157, 28 OBR 250, 503 N.E. 2d 136.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The accident in the case at bar occurred on April 22, 1983. R.C. 4509.101 was not effective at the time Hyatt was using the automobile owned by Bob-Boyd. The relevant coverage part includes as an insured \u201c[a]ny other person or organization required by law to be an INSURED <em>while using an AUTO </em>covered by this Coverage Part * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, because the accident occurred on April 22, 1983, R.C. 4509.101(A) is not applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Based on the foregoing, Hyatt was not a person \u201crequired by law to be an INSURED\u201d while using'the covered automobile within the scope of Bob-Boyd\u2019s permission. We therefore hold that Hyatt was not an insured under Coverage Part 500 of the Universal policy issued to Bob-Boyd. As a result of our holding and the holding of the court of appeals declining to find coverage under other coverage parts of the Universal policy, we find that Hyatt was not covered under the policy issued to Bob-Boyd by Universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals with respect to Coverage Part 500 and enter final judgment for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-13\">Moyer, C.J., Locher, Holmes, Wright and H.
