Pursuant to Gov. Bar R. VI, every attorney admitted to the practice of law in Ohio is required to file biennially a Certificate of Registration, and \u201cto keep the Clerk of this Court apprised of his or her current residence address and office address, and notify the Clerk of any changes.\u201d Gov. Bar R. VI(6). Respondent has not complied with these requirements and therefore has no basis for complaint if he failed to receive any notice issued by this court. See <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 123, 10 O.O. 3d 310, 383 N.E. 2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Upon a full review of this matter, we find that the respondent\u2019s abrupt and unexplained termination of his law practice without making any provision for the legal matters entrusted to him, thereby failing to protect his clients\u2019 interests, and his failure to respond to relator\u2019s attempts to contact him in furtherance of its investigation, is conduct that adversely reflects upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>fitness to practice law in violation of DR 1-102(A)(6). Respondent\u2019s failure to acknowledge any of relator\u2019s letters and his failure to answer the complaint or appear at the hearing of this matter is sufficient proof of his disregard for his professional status. <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Talbott </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 76, 13 O.O. 3d 64, 391 N.E. 2d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Accordingly, we adopt the recommendations of the board and hereby order that respondent, Roger Allen Wood, be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. It is further ordered that the cost of these proceedings be taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
