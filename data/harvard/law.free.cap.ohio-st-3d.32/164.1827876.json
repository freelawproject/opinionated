Bar R. VI. It is also clear from the record that the panel which heard respondent\u2019s testimony fully considered his unsubstantiated testimony and gave him the chance to present supporting medical evidence which could have been considered in mitigation. For whatever reason, the respondent would not, or could not, avail himself of this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In light of respondent\u2019s own testimony that he does not want to practice law right now and his awareness of a condition that affects his professional abilities, we agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]n indefinite suspension will require the respondent to demonstrate to the Board that he is mentally fit to practice law.\u201d Therefore this court orders that the respondent, Gerald N. Mauk, be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. It is further ordered that the cost of these proceedings be taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
