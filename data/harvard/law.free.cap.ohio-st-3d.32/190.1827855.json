We refute relator\u2019s arguments based, first, on <em>State, ex rel. Clink, </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 1, 2, 45 O.O. 2d 1, 240 N.E. 2d 869, 870, in which we held that \u201cverified,\u201d as used in R.C. 305.33, \u201cmeans supported by an affidavit as to the truth of the matters set forth; sworn to.\u201d Here, the attestation of the three county commissioners, common to all resolutions and therefore to all copies of resolutions, does not satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Second, we reject relator\u2019s theory of justifiable reliance on authority of <em>State, ex rel. Svete, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1965), 4 Ohio St. 2d 16, 18, 33 O.O. 2d 139, 140, 212 N.E. 2d 420, 421, in which we held that \u201c[m]istaken advise [sic] or opinion of an agent of a governmental body as to the validity of an instrument does not create an estoppel against a public official to declare the instrument invalid.\u201d Similarly, accepting relator\u2019s version of the alleged misrepresentations of the clerk of the board of county commissioners, such misrepresentations do not estop the respondent auditor from insisting on compliance with R.C. 305.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Thus, relator having failed to demonstrate that he has a clear legal right to the relief requested and that respondents are under a clear legal duty to perform the acts, the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Looker, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
