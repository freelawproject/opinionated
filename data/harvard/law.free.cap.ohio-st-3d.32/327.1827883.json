The appellate court held that the legislature had in fact provided parties seeking access to public records with an adequate remedy at law, <em>viz., </em>R.C. \u25a0 149.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">As noted by the court of appeals below, it is well-settled that in order to entitle the relator to a writ of mandamus the relator must show, and the record must disclose affirmatively, that there is no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State, ex rel. Stanley, </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 348, 32 O.O. 419, 66 N.E. 2d 207, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Sibarco Corp., </em>v. <em>Berea </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St. 2d 85, 36 O.O. 2d 75, 218 N.E. 2d 428, certiorari denied (1967), 386 U.S. 957; <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E. 2d 631; <em>State, ex rel. Cody, </em>v. <em>Toner </em>(1983), 8 Ohio St. 3d 22, 8 OBR 255, 456 N.E. 2d 813, certiorari denied (1984), 466 U.S. 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">In our view, the language of. R.C. 149.99 envisions an action instituted in the court of common pleas for injunctive relief, forfeiture and attorney fees. However, in its present form, the precise language of R.C. 149.99 does not appear to encompass an action in mandamus. It must be emphasized that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy which is carefully and cautiously granted only when there exists no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. See <em>State, ex rel. Roth, </em>v. <em>West </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 119, 3 O.O. 146, 197 N.E. 115; and <em>Pressley, supra. </em>While it may be argued that mandamus is in fact a \u201ccivil action,\u201d R.C. 149.99 does not contemplate \u201cany\u201d civil action; rather, the very language of the statute details the form and type of civil actions permitted in order to redress alleged violations of R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Appellant contends that our recent decision in <em>State, ex rel. Harmon, </em>v. <em>Bender </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 15, 25 OBR 13, 494 N.E. 2d 1135, is controlling where it was held that mandamus was the proper mechanism for assuring disclosure of public records. However, the records sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>disclosed in <em>Harmon </em>were made in a trial occurring before the effective date of the current version of R.C. 149.99. Moreover, no discussion of R.C. 149.99 was rendered in our opinion in that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The prior version of R.C. 149.99 provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\"Whoever violates section 149.351, 149.43 or 149.431 of the Revised Code shall forfeit not more than five hundred dollars for each offense to the state. The attorney-general shall collect the same by civil action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Since the relief permitted under the prior version of R.C. 149.99 required an action instituted by the Attorney General, it was reasonable for us to apparently conclude in <em>Harmon, supra, </em>that the person seeking access to the records had no adequate remedy at law and that an action in mandamus was proper. However, under the amended version of R.C. 149.99, the General Assembly has provided an adequate remedy at law for persons seeking disclosure of public records and, thus, appellant\u2019s action in mandamus must fail on that ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of mandamus is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-9\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and H.

Because I believe that the majority decision is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law and, in addition, sets a very bad, serious and frightening policy with which I vigorously disagree, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">This court has repeatedly recognized mandamus as an appropriate means of securing access to public records under R.C. 149.43. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Harmon, </em>v. <em>Bender </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 15, 25 OBR 13, 494 N.E. 2d 1135; <em>State, ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co., </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 382, 18 OBR 437, 481 N.E. 2d 632; <em>State, ex rel. Plain Dealer Pub. Co., </em>v. <em>Lesak </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 1, 9 OBR 52, 457 N.E. 2d 821. However, the majority today decides that the recent amendment, effective July 1, 1985, to R.C. 149.99 now provides an adequate remedy at law, and that mandamus is therefore no longer available. For several reasons, this conclusion is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">The mere existence of an alternative remedy at law does not render a writ of mandamus inappropriate. The remedy at law must be \u201cadequate.\u201d See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indies. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 40 O.O. 2d 141, 228 N.E. 2d 631, paragraph one of the syllabus. This court has recently stated that a remedy at law is adequate only if the remedy is \u201ccomplete in its nature, beneficial and speedy.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Liberty Mills, Inc., </em>v. <em>Locker </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 102, 104, 22 OBR 136, 137, 488 N.E. 2d 883, 885-886.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">According to the majority, the alternative remedy at law in this case is provided by R.C. 149.99, as amended, which allows for a civil action in the common pleas court to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, the statute requiring accessibility of public records. The majority concludes that the existence of this remedy at law precludes relief in mandamus. Among other matters, what the majority does not consider is whether this remedy is \u201cadequate.\u201d The inevitable conclusion is that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, mandamus provides the <em>only </em>means of securing \u201ccomplete * * *, beneficial and speedy\u201d relief. The obvious reason that persons, particularly those in the news media, seek access to public records is to gain the information such records can impart. This information will be rendered stale, even useless, if the party seeking access is forced to pursue an ordinary civil action through the crowded dockets of the common pleas courts and then through the lengthy appellate process. The records being sought will very often contain information the public has a right and a need to know. The interests of the people of this state are clearly not served if the news media are forced to wage protracted legal battles, in the dubious hope of finally gaining access to information that will no longer be timely. This remedy can scarcely be characterized as \u201cbeneficial\u201d or \u201cspeedy.\u201d It is therefore not \u201cadequate.\u201d <em>Liberty Mills, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">In contrast, the remedy of mandamus would provide complete and expeditious relief, by virtue of the statutory provisions allowing for accelerated disposition of proceedings. See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 2311.08 and 2501.09(A). Without an action in mandamus, the news media would have no adequate alternative remedy. Thus, mandamus is available under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Next, I emphatically disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that amended R.C. 149.99 provides, or was intended to provide, a procedure or the <em>only </em>procedure to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43. It must first be noted that R.C. 149.99 is the \u201cpenalty\u201d section of the code providing the sanction for violation of R.C. 149.43. It was not designed to provide the mechanism, or at least not the <em>exclusive </em>mechanism, by which a party seeking to obtain public records must proceed. Since the majority argues that the amendment to R.C. 149.99 does provide the only method for an aggrieved party to force compliance with R.C. 149.43, that argument must be analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The majority effectively excludes from the term \u201ccivil action\u201d the statutory remedy of mandamus. By so doing, the majority manifests its absolute misunderstanding of the term. Civ. R. 2 instructs us that \u201c[t]here shall be only one form of action, and it shall be known as a civil action.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 222, defines \u201ccivil action\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201cAction brought to enforce, redress, or protect private rights. In general, <em>all types of actions </em>other than criminal proceedings. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201cThe term includes all actions, both those formerly known as equitable actions and those known as legal actions, or, in other phraseology, both suits in equity and actions at law. * * *\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Given that pursuant to R.C. 2731.04, an application for a writ of mandamus must be by petition to a court, it would seem to be indisputable that the remedy of mandamus falls within the definition of a \u201ccivil action,\u201d in that the procedure is instituted to enforce rights. Can there be any question that the appellant herein was seeking to enforce its rights under R.C. 149.43? Obviously, the answer is \u201cno\u201d!</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">It should therefore be clear that mandamus is a \u201ccivil action.\u201d This court should so hold and, in fact, has done so as recently as November 26, 1986 when we said in <em>State, ex rel. Spirko, </em>v. <em>Court of Appeals </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St. 3d 13, 15, 27 OBR 432, 433, 501 N.E. 2d 625, 626, that \u201c[a] proceeding for a writ of mandamus is a civil action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">I am also troubled by certain intimations in the majority opinion that the records in question might not be \u201cpublic records.\u201d In its statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the background of this case, the majority makes much of the fact that \u201call operating expenses [for the hospital] including insurance are undertaken by the appellee,\u201d a non-profit corporation, and that \u201cno city funds have been provided for operating expenses.\u201d.Although the majority never explicitly so states, the implication is that the records herein might not be public records subject to the compulsory disclosure requirements of R.C. 149.43. Such a conclusion would be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Fostoria City Hospital is clearly a public hospital. As acknowledged by the majority, the hospital occupies premises leased from the city without any obligation to pay rent. Furthermore, the lease specifically required appellee to submit regular written reports to the city. An increase in the city income tax was implemented to fund hospital improvements and expansion. This court has consistently favored an expansive approach to the determination of what constitutes a public record for purposes of R.C. 149.43. See, <em>e.g., Dayton Newspapers </em>v. <em>Dayton </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 107, 74 O.O. 2d 209, 341 N.E. 2d 576; <em>State, ex rel. Plain Dealer Pub. Co., </em>v. <em>Krouse </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 1, 5 O.O. 3d 1, 364 N.E. 2d 854. In light of the intimate connection between the city and the hospital, and the use of public monies to fund hospital projects, the facility is clearly a public agency subject to the disclosure requirements of R.C. 149.43. To permit an agency, with clear public roots and continuing affiliations, to wrap itself in the clothes of a \u201cprivate non-profit corporation,\u201d thereby deflecting and escaping its public responsibilities while still enjoying its public benefits, would be to sanction patent subterfuge. We should not be placing our judicial imprimatur on such shenanigans.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, address the merits of appellant\u2019s mandamus action,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and grant a writ of mandamus directing appellees to afford appellant, as required by R.C. 149.43, access to the records in question. If \u201cfreedom of the press\u201d means anything, it means the right and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ability to <em>gather </em>the news as well as to print the news.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-3\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> I am aware of the dissent filed by my valued and learned brother, Judge John Mc-Cormac. I respectfully disagree with him on the basis of a long line of cases emanating from this court and, further, because both the court of appeals and the majority herein did, in fact, address the merits of the case with regard to whether a writ of mandamus should issue. This case was not, and is not, being decided or dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. The decisions of the court of appeals and the majority herein are both predicated on the basis that relator has an adequate remedy at law. The decision of the court of appeals states: \u201cWrit of mandamus denied.\u201d The decision of this court states: \u201cJudgment affirmed.\u201d Neither court indicates a \u201c* * * lack of jurisdiction to entertain the extraordinary writ.\u201d A decision stating that there is no entitlement to a writ is a decision on the merits \u2014 not one determining \u201clack of jurisdiction\u201d of the court to entertain the cause. In fact, by issuing merit decisions, both this court and the court of appeals accepted that our respective jurisdictions had been properly invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Even if the foregoing were not so, the law itself is clear. In a long line of cases, this court has consistently stated that \u201c* * * \u2018[i]n an appeal as of right from a judgment of the court of appeals involving an extraordinary writ, this court will consider the case as if the action originally had been filed here.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middleburg Hts. </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St. 3d 66, 67, 24 OBR 215, 216, 493 N.E. 2d 547, 548; <em>In re Petition for Mallory </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St. 3d 34, 17 OBR 28, 476 N.E. 2d 1045, 1046; see, also, <em>State, ex rel. Halloran, </em>v. <em>Zapatony </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 73, 15 OBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>166, 472 N.E. 2d 357, 358, fn. 2; <em>Bobb </em>v. <em>Marchant </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 1, 2, 14 OBR 1, 2, 469 N.E. 2d 847, 848, fn. <em>1; State, ex rel. Taylor, </em>v. <em>Glosser </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 165, 166-167, 4 O.O. 3d 367, 368, 364 N.E. 2d 1, 2. Of even greater illumination are the words of Judge (later Chief Justice) O\u2019Neill who, in speaking for the court in <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 40 O.O. 2d 141, 228 N.E. 2d 631, paragraph ten of the syllabus, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals is governed by the same rules that govern the Supreme Court with regard to its original jurisdiction in mandamus actions. On appeal as a matter of right from a judgment of a Court of Appeals in such an action, the Supreme Court will review the judgment of the Court of Appeals, as if the action had been filed originally in this court, to determine the following questions: (a) Is the respondent under a clear legal duty to perform an official act? (b) Is there a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law? (c) Is the action, although labeled a proceeding in mandamus, in effect an action seeking an injunction? (d) Whether, on the question of the allowance or denial of the writ on the merits, the Court of Appeals abused its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">It would seem that these admonitions are sufficiently clear. They point out to us our duty when we review a case involving an appeal as of right from a judgment of a court of appeals involving an extraordinary writ. The case at bar falls squarely within these constraints.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b387-4\">McCormac, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeX\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority that R.C. 149.99 provides an adequate remedy at law which precludes a mandamus action in the court of appeals to attempt to obtain access to public records under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">R.C. 149.99 provides that a person may bring a civil action to compel compliance with the public records statute, R.C. 149.43, and that, ancillary to a judgment of compliance, the person may recover a penalty of $1,000 and reasonable attorney fees. The civil action referred to in R.C. 149.99, at least insofar as a common pleas court action is concerned, is a mandatory injunction action or a statutory mandamus action pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2731. Since an action to compel compliance requires an order of affirmative compliance, only those two remedies will provide the relief sought, which is to compel compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Neither statutory mandamus nor statutory mandatory injunction is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The availability of these extraordinary remedies in the common pleas court is not a ground upon which the Supreme Court or the court of appeals can deny the exercise of jurisdiction in an original mandamus action. <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 40 O.O. 2d 141, 228 N.E. 2d 631; <em>State, ex rel. Fenske, </em>v. <em>McGovern </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 129, 11 OBR 426, 464 N.E. 2d 525, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">In light of the fact that the majority has held that the court of appeals properly dismissed the mandamus action for lack of jurisdiction due to there being an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law in the common pleas court, it is inappropriate to decide or to take a position on the merits of the case. The principle relied upon by Justice Douglas, that in an appeal as of right from a judgment of the court of appeals involving an extraordinary writ this court will consider the case as if the action originally had been filed here, is inapplicable where there is an affirmance of the court of appeals based upon lack of jurisdiction to entertain the extraordinary writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
