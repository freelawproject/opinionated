The defendant, John Byrd, has asserted nineteen propositions of law. Many of these have previously been addressed in prior cases and will be disposed of accordingly-</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">In the first proposition of law, Byrd contends that the use of the same felonies to both elevate the murder to aggravated murder and to elevate the aggravated murder to a capital aggravated murder fails to genuinely narrow the class of murderers eligible for the death penalty. Byrd further contends that the use of an underlying felony as a specification unconstitutionally permits the imposition of death for felony murders upon less proof than in murder cases involving prior calculation and design. Those arguments were previously rejected in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 164, 177-178, 15 OBR 311, 322-323, 473 N.E. 2d 264, 279-280; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 124, 136-137, 22 OBR 203, 213-214, 489 N.E. 2d 795, 806-807; and <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 203, 206-207, 25 OBR 266, 269, 495 N.E. 2d 922, 924-925.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Byrd, in his second proposition of law, argues that the trial court, in its written opinion sentencing defendant to death, impermissibly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating factor rather than as a mitigating factor as required by R.C. 2929.04(B). A similar claim was rejected in <em>State </em>v. <em>Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 111, at 116-117, 31 OBR 273, at 278, 509 N.E. 2d 383, at 389-390. As this court stated in <em>Steffen:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u201c* * * Obviously, the nature and circumstances of certain offenses will be such that no mitigating feature can be extracted. By its statement on the gruesome and vicious nature of the murder, the trial court herein was merely justifying its conclusion that no mitigating factors can be gleaned from the nature and circumstances of this particular offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 31 OBR at 273, 509 N.E. 2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The trial court in this case also found that there were no mitigating factors in the nature and circumstances of the murder and robbery of Monte Tewksbury. To reach this conclusion, the court was required to review the nature and circumstances of the offense. We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that by conducting this required review the court was actually weighing these circumstances against the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Additionally, defendant contends that the trial court erred in its finding that his young age was not a mitigating factor. The trial court, in its opinion, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u201c(4) \u2018The youth of the offender.\u2019 The Court finds that the defendant was at the time of his trial [sic] 19 years of age, the oldest 19 year old this Judge has ever seen. There is no evidence to suggest that his age was a factor that should be taken into account in mitigation of the sentence of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">This is a permissible finding for the trial court to make. Although R.C. 2929.04(B) lists youth as a factor to be considered, it does not require anyone under a certain age to be absolved of culpability for his crime. As the trial court observed, there was no evidence presented to suggest that Byrd\u2019s age was of any relevance in the crime or sentence of death. Accordingly, the second proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">In his third proposition of law, Byrd claims that the argument of the prosecutor during the penalty phase, which urged the jury to impose the death sentence to satisfy public demand and to render justice to the victim and his family, is plain error requiring reversal. Defense counsel failed to object to the argument. In his fourth proposition of law, defendant urges this court to find such failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>be a violation of the right to effective counsel. The prosecutor\u2019s challenged language is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court stated \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t go back to 1776, this is within the past few years \u2014 \u2018In part, capital punishment, or the death penalty, is an expression of society\u2019s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct. This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an organized society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs. The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u201c \u2018When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they deserve, then there are sown the seeds of anarchy, of self-help, of vigilante justice and of lynch law.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201cAnd I ask you to impose upon John Byrd the penalty he deserves so that Mrs. Tewksbury and Monte Tewksbury feel that society has given them the justice which they deserve as members of this society. Don\u2019t let the memory of Monte Tewksbury feel that he would be compelled to go outside legal processes to be outside the limits of this society to find the justice to which he is entitled to [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">It is important to observe that the first two paragraphs of this argument are quoted from <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 153, at 183, which quoted partially from <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 238, 308 (Stewart, J., concurring). The state contends that, if the prosecutor improperly argued to the jury, then it would be equally improper for the United States Supreme Court to rely on the same rationale as a basis for upholding the death penalty. We disagree. The function performed by a reviewing court and the function performed by a jury are quite different. What may be proper in an appellate opinion is not necessarily appropriate argument to place before a jury. As such, we cannot accept the state\u2019s rationale for approving such argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The general rule is that some latitude is granted to both parties in closing argument. Nonetheless, a closing argument that goes beyond the record may constitute prejudicial error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Muskus </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 276, 49 O.O. 122, 109 N.E. 2d 15, paragraph two of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1954), 347 U.S. 938. This is particularly true where such argument implores the jury to return a plea of guilty to satisfy a public demand. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App. 2d 355, 14 O.O. 3d 315, 397 N.E. 2d 1215, paragraph two of the syllabus. The closing argument, however, must be reviewed in its entirety to determine if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moritz </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St. 2d 150, 157, 17 O.O. 3d 92, 97, 407 N.E. 2d 1268, 1273, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgun </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 354, 366, 10 O.O. 3d 485, 492, 384 N.E. 2d 255, 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">A review of the entire closing argument in the instant case reveals that the jury was requested to decide the penalty phase on the evidence presented and not on the grounds of retribution. Although the prosecutor did quote the Supreme Court, the emphasis in his argument was on the strength of the evidence supporting the aggravating circumstances and the tenuousness and lack of evidence in support of mitigating factors. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument also clearly stressed the evidence presented. Most importantly, the judge, in his jury instruction, explained the duty of the jury to consider the statutory factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and the evidence presented in support of those factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A review of the entire proceedings establishes that the defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. We do note, however, that such argument is not proper, and therefore caution prosecutors to avoid such arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The defendant\u2019s third and fourth propositions of law are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Byrd next contends that several jurors were improperly excused at voir dire, thus denying him a right to a fair and impartial jury. This contention is based on the claim that the excused jurors were not unequivocal in their statements as to whether they could consider imposing the death penalty. Such claim is not supported by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the exclusion of jurors for cause was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-21\">Byrd next challenges the refusal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the trial court to merge the two aggravating specifications for purposes of sentencing. Byrd contends that the aggravated robbery of Monte Tewks-bury and the aggravated robbery of the King Kwik store constitute an indivisible course of conduct and may not constitutionally form the basis of two separate aggravating circumstances. Therefore, the two aggravating factors should have been merged for sentencing purposes as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Byrd further contends that the merger doctrine should be reconsidered. R.C. 2941.25 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">\u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">Byrd relies on subsection (A) for the proposition that aggravated robbery of a store and aggravated robbery of the store\u2019s employee are allied offenses of similar import. We disagree. The facts of this case demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>R.C. 2941.25(B) is the applicable section. The robbery of the King Kwik was a separate act from the robbery of Monte Tewksbury. Each act required a separate animus. Byrd took cash from the store\u2019s cash register. He also took Monte Tewksbury\u2019s watch, ring and wallet. These were separate crimes independent of each other. We find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that the two aggravating specifications should have been merged. We thus need not reach Byrd\u2019s claim that the merger doctrine announced in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>should be reconsidered. The defendant\u2019s sixth and seventh propositions of law are not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In his eighth proposition of law, Byrd maintains that the trial court failed to give the reasons why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors in its opinion. R.C. 2929.03(F) requires the trial court to state in a separate opinion its specific findings of aggravating circumstances, statutory mitigating factors and any other mitigating factors. \u201c* * * and the reasons why the aggravating circumstances * * * were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d Byrd admits that the trial court listed its findings as to aggravating circumstances and all mitigating factors. His claim goes solely to the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s opinion in explaining the reasons the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">A reading of the trial court\u2019s opinion reveals a detailed review and evaluation of the aggravating circumstances, the nature of the offense, defendant\u2019s background and specific findings relating to the existence or nonexistence of all statutory and other mitigating factors advanced by defendant. Furthermore, a review of the opinion reveals why the trial court felt the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court found that the evidence did not support any mitigating factors. Based on this conclusion, the court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any mitigating factors, this is the only logical conclusion. We therefore overrule Byrd\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">Byrd contends, in his ninth and tenth propositions of law, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>death penalty in this case is disproportionately severe compared to penalties imposed in similar cases in the same county. Furthermore, he claims that proportionality review must encompass both cases where the death penalty was sought and cases where it could have been sought but was not. We have previously rejected these claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra. </em>Most recently in <em>State </em>v. <em>Steffen, supra, </em>we clarified what a court is required to consider in its proportionality review. Paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Steffen </em>states:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u201cThe proportionality review required by R.C. 2929.05(A) is satisfied by a review of those cases already decided by the reviewing court in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The court of appeals, in its proportionality review of the death penalty in this case, has properly complied with these requirements. Accordingly, there is no merit in Byrd\u2019s ninth or tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The defendant next urges that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated because within Hamilton County those convicted of capital murder of white people are more frequently sentenced to death than those convicted of capital murder of black people. This issue was not raised at trial and defendant\u2019s allegations are therefore not supported by the record. Furthermore, a similar claim was recently rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp </em>(1987), 481 U.S. _, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262. As this court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Steffen, supra, </em>at 124-125, 31 OBR at 284-285, 509 N.E. 2d at 395-396, stated, the United States Supreme Court held that, to sustain an equal protection claim, a defendant must show that racial considerations affected the sentencing process in his case. This court approved this test in <em>Steffen </em>in rejecting the claim. We reject Byrd\u2019s claim in the instant case for the same reason: Byrd has failed to offer any evidence that improper racial considerations prompted the jury\u2019s recommendation of death in this case. The eleventh proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Byrd, in his twelfth proposition of law, argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it is not to be bound by feelings of sympathy, pity and mercy was plain error, and the failure to object thereto constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. This argument was previously rejected in <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>,State </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 92, 108, 26 OBR 79, 93, 497 N.E. 2d 55, 68; <em>Steffen, supra, </em>at 125, 31 OBR at 285, 509 N.E. 2d at 396. The instruction was not plain error nor did the failure to object constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Byrd claims that the state failed to prove that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Byrd is essentially claiming that there was insufficient evidence presented in support of the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Additionally, Byrd\u2019s claim rests in part on his earlier arguments that the two aggravating specifications were duplicative and that his sentence is disproportionately severe. As we discussed earlier, we find no merit in either of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">A review of the record establishes that there was enough evidence presented from which the jury could find that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Byrd\u2019s thirteenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">In his fourteenth proposition of law, Byrd maintains that the Ohio death penalty statutes are unconstitutional. He raises seven specific challenges to the law, all of which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>been addressed and rejected in previous cases. See <em>Jenkins, supra; Stef-fen, supra; </em>and <em>Buell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Byrd next challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Byrd claims that the Forest Park police officer who followed the van and eventually was responsible for Byrd\u2019s and the other defendants\u2019 arrests was outside his jurisdiction at the time of the warrantless arrest and therefore lacked authority to make a valid arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">This claim was not raised in the trial court and we need not consider it here. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 112, 5 O.O. 3d 98, 364 N.E. 2d 1364; <em>State </em>v. <em>Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E. 2d 277. The application of the doctrine of waiver is particularly appropriate here as there is no record on which to determine the merits of Byrd\u2019s claim. By not raising the jurisdiction issue in the trial court, defendant failed to introduce any facts into the record to support his claim. It is not clear whether the United Dairy Farmer store where the arrest was made was in Forest Park. Testimony during the hearing on the motion to suppress supports the claim that a police officer from another jurisdiction arrived on the scene before Byrd was taken into custody. Finally, it is not clear from the record exactly who made the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">We note additionally that Officer Mast, the Forest Park officer who Byrd claims was outside his jurisdiction, testified that he asked Woodall, Brewer and Byrd what they were doing <em>in Forest Park. </em>Although this testimony is quite tenuous to establish that the officer was within his jurisdiction at the time of the arrest, without any conflicting evidence to contradict the claim, it is sufficient to meet Byrd\u2019s bald assertion that the officer was without authority to make the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Byrd next contends that Officer Mast lacked probable cause to stop and investigate the van and its occupants. Although Byrd admits that Officer Mast did not stop the van, since it stopped voluntarily, he claims that the officer fully intended to stop the van and, thus, the <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 44 O.O. 2d 383, standards must be applied to the facts of this case. In <em>Terry, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a police officer may, in appropriate circumstances, approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest. Nonetheless, the officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together, with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the intrusion. <em>Terry </em>at 21-22, 44 O.O. 2d at 393-394. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 291, 18 O.O. 3d 472, 414 N.E. 2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Byrd argues that, in this instance, there were insufficient specific ar-ticulable facts to authorize a <em>Terry </em>stop. No traffic laws had been violated nor was the officer specifically looking for Byrd or the van. The officer testified that he had a conversation with his supervisor concerning the robbery and stabbing at the King Kwik but admitted that nothing in that conversation linked Byrd or the van to the crime. Therefore, Byrd alleges that the stop and subsequent arrest were unconstitutional and, based on that claim, all evidence seized from the van should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">For the following reasons, we find no merit in this argument. During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Officer Mast explained that, at about 1:00 a.m., he was eating lunch while parked in his marked police cruiser in a K-Mart parking lot. Mast observed a red cargo van traveling westbound on Waycross at a slow rate of speed. The van pulled into the K-Mart and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>headlights were turned off. A few minutes later, the van\u2019s headlights came back on and the van left the lot and headed east on Waycross, again very slowly. About four minutes later, the van reappeared, heading west on Waycross. At that point, Mast decided to follow the van. He pulled out and called in the license plate number for a license check. After the van stopped at the United Dairy Farmer store, Mast learned that the van was registered to Harry\u2019s Corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Mast further testified to the following: (1) the area he was patrolling was a high crime area, the scene of numerous recent break-ins; (2) because of the criminal activity, there were extra officers on duty; (3) most of the businesses were closed in the area; (4) Mast knew from an earlier conversation with his supervisor that there had been a robbery and stabbing at a nearby King Kwik; and (5) Mast, a veteran police officer, believed the occupants of the van were \u201ccasing\u201d the area. These facts alone are sufficient to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>at 295, 18 O.O. 3d at 474, 414 N.E. 2d at 1047. However, we need not rely on <em>Terry </em>in this case because the officer did not stop the defendants. The defendants voluntarily stopped the van and one of the occupants, Brewer, voluntarily approached the police car. The fact that Mast testified that he intended to stop the van does not affect this fact. A police officer, when approached, cannot be reasonably requested to ignore the approach or not ask questions. Brewer offered a rather unlikely story to explain what he was doing at 1:00 a.m. on a Monday morning in a parking lot of a closed store. Brewer first stated that he had been working on a job. When the officer asked the location of the job, Brewer claimed he had been out drinking and attempting to pick up women. The officer then approached the van and Woodall offered the same conflicting story. Mast obtained identification from Woodall and Byrd, a passenger in the vehicle. The names given by the defendants were run through the computer and it was discovered that there were no current warrants pending. Byrd\u2019s and Wood-all\u2019s check did reveal criminal history. Byrd and Woodall were then asked to exit the van and were patted down. Mast, using a flashlight, looked in the van and saw coins on the floor. There were stocking masks and a knife in a tray on the dashboard. A Shell credit card in the name of Sharon Tewksbury was seen under the passenger\u2019s seat. There was also blood on the interior side of the driver\u2019s seat. Mast also looked in the back of the van for other individuals and saw a cash drawer from a cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">After observing these articles and the blood on the interior of the van, Mast had probable cause to believe a crime had been committed. The initial search of the van by Mast was proper under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 82, 9 O.O. 3d 81, 377 N.E. 2d 1013. The search of the back of the van was proper to ensure the officer\u2019s safety. <em>Terry, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The fifteenth proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Byrd next challenges the admission of hearsay testimony by Ronald Armstead. Armstead was in the workhouse with Byrd, Brewer and Woodall. He testified to statements made by these defendants while incarcerated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>based on Armstead\u2019s use of the word \u201cthey\u201d with regard to what was said to him in conversations Armstead had with all three co-defendants. Byrd claims that statements of the co-defendants were introduced which were not subject to cross-examination by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Evid. R. 801(D)(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u201cStatements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">U* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u201c(2) <em>Admission by party-opponent. </em>The statement is offered against a party and is (a) his own statement, in either his individual or representative capacity * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Much of Armstead\u2019s testimony falls within Evid. R. 801(D)(2)(a) as nonhearsay. In those portions where Armstead uses \u201che,\u201d such as \u201cHe was telling me about how he stabbed that gentleman * * *,\u201d it is clear from the context that Armstead is referring to Byrd. Thus, those statements are admissible, as they are clearly Byrd\u2019s own statements. It is also apparent from the record that these statements are the most incriminating portion of Armstead\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-25\">The more difficult problem is presented by that part of Armstead\u2019s testimony where he used the pronoun \u201cthey.\u201d The state claims that, while Armstead\u2019s language is not a model of English grammar, it is ascertainable from the context that he was testifying about Byrd\u2019s statement, not statements of the co-defendants. We disagree. It is not true that Armstead was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>only repeating Byrd\u2019s statements. In fact, it is clear in at least one point that Armstead was repeating co-defendants\u2019 statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cQ. THE COURT: Can you be more specific?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201cA. ARMSTEAD: Byrd, Brewer and Woodall, they was bragging. They felt they had went to Preliminary Hearing, they had felt that * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The problem was exacerbated by the prosecutor\u2019s framing of his questions. At more than one point, the prosecutor asked questions that contained the objectionable \u201cthey.\u201d For example, \u201cAnd what questions did they ask you, Mr. Armstead?\u201d; \u201cAnd did they start asking you some questions, some technical questions that you may know about the law?\u201d; \u201cAnd what were some of the other questions that they asked you and talked to you about?\u201d These questions, no doubt, encouraged Armstead to respond with the same pronoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">Such questions and the responses were objectionable as inadmissible hearsay. Evid. R. 801(C). A close review of those hearsay statements, however, reveals that they were not so prejudicial as to require reversal of Byrd\u2019s conviction. Two of the responses and, in fact, the two most damaging, were clearly attributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Byrd in Armstead\u2019s later testimony. These involved the questioning on cleaning the blood from the knife and the responses of the three to viewing the PM Magazine report on the Tewks-bury family. The response that included \u201c * * * all of them said, \u2018Plus the fact the Bitch can\u2019t sing\u2019 \u201d does not go to the truth of the matter asserted and is thus not hearsay. The statements that the defendants claimed the state had no case against them following a preliminary hearing also does not go to the truth of the matter asserted. Finally, the last question by the prosecutor on direct examination, \u201cDid Brewer tell you who took the money?\u201d was not objected to by defense counsel and is therefore waived. We conclude that, in light of the other proper testimony and overwhelming evidence, the admission of Armstead\u2019s response was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In addition, Byrd submits that he was denied his right to confront Arm-stead in an effective manner when the trial court limited the scope of cross-examination as it pertained to Arm-stead\u2019s prior criminal record. Byrd does not specify exactly what he was prevented from exploring.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Evid. R. 609 authorizes the admission of evidence of convictions within ten years prior to the date such evidence is sought to be introduced if punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year. Evid. R. 609(B) permits evidence of convictions more than ten years preceding, but only under special circumstances set out in the rule. In this case, Armstead admitted a 1972 \u201cescape charge\u201d which was beyond the ten-year period. Further, although defense counsel was at one point restricted from pursuing what the prior conviction within the ten years concerned, he successfully obtained the answer (a reference to robbery) at a later point.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We find no basis in the record from which to conclude that counsel\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine Armstead was impermissibly limited. Defense\u2019counsel was accorded sufficient latitude to impeach Armstead\u2019s credibility. For the foregoing reasons, Byrd\u2019s sixteenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Byrd, in his seventeenth and eighteenth propositions of law, argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Byrd claims that there was a failure of proof as to defendant\u2019s identity as the one who robbed the King Kwik and robbed and killed Monte Tewksbury. To support this claim, Byrd cites the following factors: (1) his fingerprints were not discovered on any of the recovered items, (2) the shoe prints found at the King Kwik did not match Byrd\u2019s shoes, (3) no one from the King Kwik identified Byrd, (4) following his arrest, Byrd had less that $5 on his person, and (5) no blood was found on Byrd\u2019s shirt or shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Byrd\u2019s claim ignores the evidence that was presented at trial, including: (1) Byrd\u2019s admissions to Armstead, (2) testimony placing the defendant in the red van and the murder weapon in his hand, (3) testimony placing the van at the scene, (4) items recovered from the van and where they were in relation to Byrd, and (5) blood on Byrd\u2019s pants. A review of the record establishes that the state produced some credible evidence on each element of the crimes charged and, thus, there was sufficient evidence presented for the case to be submitted to the jury. Furthermore, there was substantial evidence supporting a reasonable conclusion that all elements of the offense were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant\u2019s seventeenth and eighteenth propositions of law are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">In his final proposition of law, Byrd maintains that the trial court er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>red in admitting testimony concerning the robbery of the U-Totem store. Although Byrd was indicted for the aggravated robbery of the U-Totem store, this count was severed from the remaining counts for purposes of trial. The court did, however, allow evidence of the U-Totem robbery to be admitted at trial. Byrd maintains that this evidence of another crime for which he was not on trial was inadmissible and, further, that the prejudicial value of this evidence substantially outweighed the probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Byrd is correct in his contention that the rule is that evidence which tends to show that the accused has committed another crime wholly independent of the offense for which he is on trial is generally inadmissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curry </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 66, 72 O.O. 2d 37, 330 N.E. 2d 720; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkinson </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 308, 18 O.O. 3d 482, 415 N.E. 2d 261. Nonetheless, this evidence was properly admitted pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 and Evid. R. 404(B). Evid. R. 404(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, <em>identity, </em>or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Identity of Byrd as both a participant and as the principal offender was a contested issue at trial. The U-Totem evidence which supported the state\u2019s allegation that Byrd was the participant with the knife was highly probative on this issue. This U-Totem robbery was also very similar to the King Kwik robbery and those similarities coupled with the discovery of the U-Totem cash register drawer in the van helped establish identity of the defendant as a participant in the King Kwik robbery. Testimony of Dennis Nitz identifying the man who pushed him as having red hair, and the man who chased Henneberry as holding the knife, which Nitz also identified, was highly probative on the issue of identity of Byrd as the principal offender. A similar situation was presented in <em>State </em>v. <em>Moorehead </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 166, 53 O.O. 2d 379, 265 N.E. 2d 551, where this court held that the other acts testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Byrd\u2019s nineteenth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">We now undertake the independent weighing process required by R.C. 2929.05(A) to determine whether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The aggravating circumstances of which Byrd was found guilty were that he:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">\u201c[1] * * * as the principal offender committed the offense of the Aggravated Murder of Monte B. Tewks-bury while the defendant was committing or attempting to commit the offense of the Aggravated Robbery of the King Kwik store located at 9870 Pippin Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\"><em>\u201c[2] </em>* * * as the principal offender committed the offense of the Aggravated Murder of Monte B. Tewks-bury while the defendant was committing or attempting to commit the offense of the Aggravated Robbery of Monte B. Tewksbury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Byrd presented one witness during the penalty phase of this proceeding and one newspaper story. Byrd also addressed the jury in an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">The defense witness was Mary Lou Ray, the mother of the defendant. She testified that the defendant\u2019s father went to jail shortly after their son was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>born and that she had not seen him for eighteen years. She remarried two times and explained that both husbands abused her son, and beat her in his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The newspaper clipping referred to an incident that occurred while Byrd was attending elementary school. Mrs. Ray explained that her son and a neighbor had been responsible for saving a young child who had fallen into a frozen creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Mrs. Ray also testified that the defendant had a learning disability which required him to receive special treatment throughout his school years. According to Mrs. Ray, her son was extremely frustrated by the ridiculing he received from other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">On cross-examination, Mrs. Ray admitted that she had filed charges against her son in juvenile court. She also admitted that she had not reported any abuse of Byrd to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In Byrd\u2019s own statement, he expressed remorse for what happened. He also stated that he was drunk and using drugs at the time of the incident. He pointed out that he was only nineteen years old and he could rehabilitate himself if given a chance to live. Byrd also stated the specific charges composing his juvenile record and the convictions he had as an adult, explaining that he felt that the jury should know his record. The state presented no witnesses in the mitigation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">Of the factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we find that factors (1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) do not apply. Factor (4), the youth of the offender, has been previously discussed and we note the fact that at the time of the offense the defendant was nineteen years old. We reiterate, however, that youth, by itself, does not absolve the defendant of responsibility for this crime. Although the youth of this defendant is considered as a mitigating factor, in the absence of any evidence introduced to show why this factor should be given great weight, we grant it very little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">With regard to factor (7), we have considered defendant\u2019s childhood, his learning disability, his lifesaving experience when he was in grade school, Byrd\u2019s claim that he had been drinking and using drugs at the time of the crime and the fact that there was no evidence to support this claim. In considering the nature and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of the offense, we find nothing mitigating about the stabbing of a completely compliant victim. From this consideration, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh these mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Based upon this independent review, we uphold the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We now turn to our final responsibility in this case, which is the review of the proportionality of this death sentence. As recently clarified in <em>Stef-fen, supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, this review encompasses only those cases we have previously reviewed in which the death penalty has been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In considering those cases, we find that, compared with the death penalty cases decided by this court, the sentence here is not excessive or disproportionate. The death sentence has previously been upheld in similar cases of aggravated robbery and murder. <em>Jenkins, supra; Barnes, supra; State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 16, 23 OBR 13, 490 N.E. 2d 906; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mapes </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 108, 19 OBR 318, 484 N.E. 2d 140; and <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 122, 19 OBR 330, 483 N.E. 2d 1157. The cases are similar to the instant case in that a victim was murdered during the course of an aggravated robbery. Although this case does not involve torture or a sexual assault, it does involve a completely compliant victim who gave Byrd no reason to stab him. We find that the death penalty is not inappropriate considering the senseless nature of the murder and the similarity to other cases in which the death penalty was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">In conclusion, we affirm the appellant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death. We find that Byrd was accorded a fair trial and a complete review by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-12\">Sweeney, Lochee, Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b148-13\">H.

I believe that the majority gives insufficient stress to the fact that the defendant being sentenced to death in this case was only nineteen years old at the time of the murder. Ordinarily such a youthful age would be accorded great weight in mitigation. Execution of a teenager ought not be allowed without painstaking attention to the age factor. However, the evidence in this record demonstrates that Byrd\u2019s chronological age of nineteen does not accurately reflect his maturity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
