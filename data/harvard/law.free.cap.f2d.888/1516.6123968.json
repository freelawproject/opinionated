In 1987, they filed the complaint in the instant proceeding, seeking the turnover of certain assets from defendant-appellee, Charles Brewer, the bankruptcy trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The bankruptcy court found that the Trustee had abandoned the assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>in question, but that he should be allowed to revoke such abandonment. The district court for the Southern District of Mississippi affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings. The Debtors appeal from this holding. We affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court, but base our holding on different grounds: We find that the Trustee never abandoned the bankruptcy estate\u2019s interest in the assets in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">On February 27, 1985, plaintiff-appellants Mack L. Killebrew (\u201cKillebrew\u201d) and Delores B. Killebrew filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors filed a \u201cStatement of Financial Affairs for Debtor not Engaged in Business\u201d and schedules of property, income and expenditures, and liabilities. In the personal property schedule and the summary of debts and property, the Debtors listed an interest in a trust established under Killebrew\u2019s father\u2019s will (the \u201ctrust\u201d) as an asset, but no value was given for such interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Killebrew was one of four beneficiaries of the trust. The trust instruments appointed the First National Bank of Holmes County the testamentary trustee (hereinafter, the \u201cTestamentary Trustee\u201d). The Testamentary Trustee was to hold the corpus of the trust (farmland) and lease this land to one of Killebrew\u2019s brothers until December 1986.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Between October 1986 and the end of December 1986, the brother leasing the land was given the first option to buy the land. After this time, if he did not purchase the land, it was to be sold to an outside buyer. In either event, at the time of the sale, the proceeds and any remaining income were to be distributed equally among the four beneficiaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Approximately one year before filing bankruptcy, Killebrew obtained a $50,000 loan from Guaranty Bank and Trust Company (\u201cGuaranty\u201d). As security for this loan, he assigned his \u201cright, title and interest ..., including the right to all income\u201d in and to the trust to Guaranty. For additional security \u2014 in case he died before the trust was dissolved \u2014 Killebrew obtained a $100,000 life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">On March 12, 1985, an \u201cOrder for Meeting of Creditors and Fixing Times for Filing Objections to Discharge and for Filing Complaints to Determine Dischargeability of Certain Debts, Combined with Notice Thereof and of Automatic Stay\u201d (the \u201ccombined notice/order\u201d) was issued by the bankruptcy court. This notice set April 16, 1985 as the date of the required section 341(a) meeting of creditors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The combined notice/order also stated that the Trustee possessed the power to abandon property and that he would announce his plans in relation to the Debtors\u2019 property at the section 341(a) meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-11\">The section 341(a) meeting occurred on April 16, 1985. At the meeting, the Trustee questioned Killebrew about his understanding of the value of the trust and the nature of his interest in it. The Trustee also discussed the value of the trust with an acquaintance of his who attended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>section 341(a) meeting on behalf of another creditor. On the same date, Guaranty made a motion for relief from the automatic stay provisions of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Notice of this motion was given to creditors and a hearing on such motion was set for May 15,1985. The bankruptcy court granted the motion on May 24, 1985. Subsequently, the Testamentary Trustee paid Killebrew\u2019s share of the trust income annually to Guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">In early 1987, the Trustee learned that the land held in trust was being sold. Accordingly, he wrote to the Testamentary Trustee and claimed Killebrew\u2019s share of the proceeds. Subsequently, on June 16, 1987, the Trustee filed a complaint requesting turnover of the trust proceeds that would otherwise be given to Killebrew. In its answer to this complaint, the Testamentary Trustee stated it had received $135,-352.55 in trust proceeds from the sale of the real estate for the account of Killebrew on May 18, 1987. Pursuant to Guaranty\u2019s security agreement and following \u201cwritten authority from the Trustee herein dated May 7, 1987, [the Testamentary Trustee] paid to said secured party the sum of $48,-704.95 from the funds of the said [Kille-brew].\u201d A tax lien in the amount of $2,714.75 was also paid from the trust proceeds. This left the Testmentary Trustee holding a sum of $83,932.85. The bankruptcy court issued an order on July 31, 1987 mandating the turnover of the remaining trust proceeds to the Trustee \u2014 subject to any claims by the Debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">On October 20, 1987, the Debtors filed a complaint seeking the turnover of these funds from the Trustee. On October 28, 1987, the Debtors filed an amended complaint seeking the same. Debtors predicated their complaint on the claim that the proceeds were never property of the bankruptcy estate<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, additionally, that the Trustee had abandoned any possible interest in the trust by order of the court entered on May 24, 1985. Furthermore, they claimed that the trust did not vest in Kille-brew until early 1987. The Trustee answered by denying these allegations \u201cdue to the misrepresentations of debtor in connection with this trust.\u201d However, in his memorandum brief in response to the Debtors\u2019 complaint, the Trustee stated that he had abandoned the trust property, but claimed that he had done so based on representations by Killebrew. He argued that the abandonment should be revoked. This case was heard by the bankruptcy court on August 29, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">The bankruptcy court entered an opinion and order in favor of the Trustee on September 14, 1988. 101 B.R. 471. The bankruptcy court found that the Trustee had abandoned the estate\u2019s interest in the trust on or about May 24, 1985, \u201cpursuant to representations by the debtors that the interest in the trust was purely contingent, and that if the funds ever were received from the trust, there would be no equity in the estate,\u201d but that he should be allowed to revoke this abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">Following this order, the Debtors petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for reversal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the Debtors\u2019 request to have the remaining proceeds from the trust turned over to them. The district court held that the bankruptcy judge had committed no clear errors of fact in his opinion and adopted his legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">Debtors now appeal to this court. On appeal, the Debtors argue that the district court erred in concluding that the bankruptcy court committed no error in finding that the \u201cdebtors knew or reasonably should have known there would be equity in the trust....\u201d They also contend that the district court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that revocation of the Trustee\u2019s abandonment of the trust property was justified in the instant case. In rebuttal, the Trustee asserts that he never abandoned the trust interest, but that if he had, revocation would be appropriate. Because we agree with the Trustee\u2019s argument and find that abandonment never occurred, we do not discuss the Debtors\u2019 arguments, which assume that the issue of abandonment was conceded below and address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>issue of when abandonment may be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">Although this case has been reviewed on appeal by the district court, at this stage we engage in a review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings just as we would in an appeal coming from a trial in the district court. <em>See, e.g., In re Commercial Western Finance Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cBecause we are in as good a position as the district court to review the findings of the bankruptcy court, we independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.\u201d). Thus, we apply the clearly erroneous standard in reviewing findings of fact by the bankruptcy court, <em>In re Bleaufontaine, </em>634 F.2d 1383, 1389 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), and decide issues of law de novo. <em>In re Texas Research, Inc., </em>862 F.2d 1161, 1163 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we review a finding of abandonment. While there may be circumstances under which findings related to abandonment are reviewed \u2014 at least in part \u2014 under the clearly erroneous standard,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we think that the conclusion reached by the bankruptcy court in this case was a legal conclusion and, therefore, we review it de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">In response to the Debtors\u2019 arguments on appeal, which assume the Trustee\u2019s abandonment of the estate\u2019s interest in the trust, the Trustee maintains that he never abandoned such interest. In their reply brief, the Debtors contend that we should not consider this argument because the Trustee conceded this issue below, and, therefore, it is too late for the Trustee to make this argument. Moreover, in response to the Trustee\u2019s analysis of the components of abandonment, the Debtors argue that the combined notice/order, issued prior to the section 341(a) meeting, contained the notice requisite for the abandonment of property and that an \u201cadministrative abandonment\u201d was possible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We first address the appropriateness of our consideration of the Trustee\u2019s denial of abandonment at this point in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-12\">While we sympathize with the Debtors\u2019 frustration that the first coherent arguments against abandonment were made at the appellate level, we do not agree that the record shows concession of this point below. Rather, we find that the record\u2014 especially the Trustee\u2019s testimony \u2014 demonstrates the existence of considerable confusion on the part of all parties as to the meaning of abandonment in the context of bankruptcy proceedings. The concept of abandonment appears to have become confused with actions taken to allow Guaranty to realize on its security interest through the lifting of the automatic stay under section 362.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. Particularly notable is the following testimony by the Trustee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-13\">I do know that Mr. Killebrew told us that there was not [equity in the trust], though, and we looked after that, and in order to allow the bank [Guaranty] to get paid their security, assigned the abandonment order, which we do frequently with GMAC Ford Motor Credit and other creditors, to allow them to be paid with the understanding if there's any equity after the same is sold, they send it in, and they do send it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-14\">This is not an unusual situation where a creditor takes the property and sells it and gives the ballots [sic] to us. In this</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>particular case, Mr. Killebrew had not claimed any of this trust as exempt. His schedules reflected it appeared that he saw there was no equity in it, and he didn\u2019t claim any interest in it, so as far as we were concerned, he had no interest if it was worth something. The trust was such that it could have, it appeared to me to have been easily manipulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-4\">... The bank had assured me all along that they would notify me when something came down, and I told them to turn the money over to me. If Mr. Killebrew had any interest, then he could come to the court here, and we would determine whether it was his or the estate\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avy\">Although the Trustee\u2019s testimony uses the term \u201cabandonment,\u201d the context indicates that he is not using it in a manner consistent with the term\u2019s meaning under the Bankruptcy Code \u2014 i.e., the largely irrevocable removal of property from the estate. <em>See, e.g., In re Enriquez, </em>22 B.R. 934, 935 (Bankr.D.Neb.1982) (\u201cThe effect of abandonment by a trustee ... is to divest the trustee of control over the property because once abandoned, property is no longer a part of the bankruptcy estate.\u201d); Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 554.02[2] at 554-6 (15th ed. 1989) (\u201c[U]pon abandonment under section 554, the trustee is simply divested of control of the property because it is no longer part of the estate.\u201d). Rather, his testimony refers to an arrangement whereby a creditor is allowed to realize on its security interest and agrees to return anything above that amount to the Trustee. In contrast to abandonment, his testimony contemplates the retention of all rights to the property \u2014 beyond the secured interest \u2014 by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The notion of easily revocable abandonment is not in accord with case law on abandonment. <em>See, e.g., In re Hunter, </em>76 B.R. 117, 118 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1987) (\u201cThe general rule in this area is well settled\u2014 once a trustee abandons property, the abandonment is irrevocable.\u201d); <em>In re Enriquez, </em>22 B.R. at 935-36 (abandonment held irrevocable, even when property is subsequently found to have greater value than previously believed); <em>In re Sutton, </em>10 B.R. 737, 739-40 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1981); (abandonment irrevocable, irrespective of later discovery that property had greater value than originally realized).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, it appears that the Trustee\u2019s confusing allusion to abandonment actually refers to the lifting of the automatic stay under section 362.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. This action would allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Guaranty to realize on its security interest in the manner that it did here, but, again, under the circumstances that obtained here, any funds remaining would be the property of the estate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">As both the Trustee and the Debtors seem to have used the term abandonment in a confusing manner and in reference to documents and processes relating to the lifting of the automatic stay rather than abandonment, we cannot conclude that the Trustee should now be precluded from arguing against a finding of abandonment. A close reading of the record shows that the issue was raised, albeit in a muddled manner, and that the core of the Trustee\u2019s position below was not inconsistent with his current argument that abandonment never occurred. Thus, we believe that in arguing that he never abandoned the property, the Trustee simply offers an alternative rationale \u2014 supported in the record<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 for affirming the judgment in its favor below. <em>Cf. Jaffke v. Dunham, </em>352 U.S. 280, 281, 77 S.Ct. 307, 308, 1 L.Ed.2d 314 (1957) (\u201cA successful party in the District Court may sustain its judgment on any ground that finds support in the record.\u201d); 16 A. Miller, C. Wright, E. Cooper &amp; E. Gressman,. <em>Federal Practice And Procedure </em>\u00a7 3950 (1977) (\u201c[A]ny named party, without filing a separate or cross-appeal, may make or renew in the appellate court any available argument designed to preserve or justify that portion of the judgment favorable to him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Concluding that the Trustee is not barred from arguing that abandonment of the trust did not occur, we now turn to reviewing the legal merit of this claim. Historically, because the Code was silent as to what actions by the Trustee constituted abandonment, courts faced difficult factual determinations in this area. 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 554.01 at 554-3. However, since its passage, section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code has governed abandonment. Under section 554:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-11\">(a) After notice and hearing, the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-12\">(b) On request of a party in interest and after notice and hearing, the court may order the trustee to abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-13\">(c) Unless the court orders otherwise, any property scheduled under section 521(1) of this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of section 350 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-14\">(d) Unless the court orders otherwise, property of the estate that is not abandoned under this section and that is not administered in the case remains property of the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. This section is implemented by Bankruptcy Rule 6007, subsection (a) of which states in relevant part:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cUnless otherwise directed by the court, the trustee ... shall give notice of a proposed abandonment or disposition of property to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>creditors.... An objection may be filed and served by a party in interest within 15 days of the mailing of notice, or within the time fixed by the court.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsP\">As an initial observation, we note that the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>contains no documentation indicating the Trustee\u2019s abandonment of the trust property. The only evidence of the alleged abandonment is the imprecise language used by both parties at the hearing in the adversary proceeding on this matter and the Trustee\u2019s reference to abandonment in his brief before hearing in the bankruptcy court. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>however, this language appears to refer to Guaranty\u2019s motion to lift the automatic stay and the court order lifting such stay, rather than to abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">The Debtors, in their reply brief, argue that the notice of abandonment required under section 554(a) and Bankruptcy Rule 6007 was met by language included in the combined notice/order sent to creditors before the section 341(a) meeting and that an \u201cadministrative abandonment was possible.... \u201d We agree that property may be \u201cadministratively abandoned\u201d in certain circumstances under the current Bankruptcy Code,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but we do not believe that such an abandonment occurred in the instant case in relation to the estate\u2019s interest in the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-14\">Notice of a proposed abandonment can be incorporated in the notice for the meeting of creditors. Bankruptcy Rule 6007 advisory committee\u2019s note. Additionally, the current Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 102(1)(A) \u201cleaves wide discretion as to what notice is appropriate in particular circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Motley, </em>10 B.R. 141, 146 (Bankr.M.D.Ga.1981) (local rule providing notice in the \u00a7 341(a) meeting notice that \u201c[immediately following the 341(a) meeting of creditors, a hearing will be held regarding abandonment by the trustee of all scheduled property (\u00a7 554) and if there are no objections to the abandonment of any of the scheduled property filed with the trustee at said hearing then when the trustee files his no asset report, he may include thereon an abandonment of such property as he deems appropriate ...\u201d). However, in considering the notice given, it is important to recall the reason for such notice: \u201cThe purpose of notification to parties in interest is to provide an opportunity for potential opposition to the abandonment of such property to file objections and be heard by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>the court.\u201d <em>In re Caron, </em>50 B.R. 27, 30 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The language relied upon by the Debtors as notice appears to be the following declaration in the combined notice/order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHD\">NOTICE IS FURTHER GIVEN that the trustee of this estate is empowered to abandon .or sell, at the scheduled meeting of Creditors, movable assets of the debt- or. At the meeting, the trustee shall announce which actions he plans to take and which assets are affected thereby. Any objection to the trustee\u2019s planned action must be filed within twenty days after the date set for the meeting of creditors. If objection is filed, the matter shall be fixed for hearing by the Court. If no objection is filed, the trustee shall proceed accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">The notification provided here is not adequate as its vague terms would not have placed parties interested in a particular piece of property on notice that they would need to file objections in order to obtain a court hearing. It contains no reference to which property the Trustee intends to abandon and, furthermore, states that the Trustee will reveal his specific plans at the section 341(a) meeting. <em>Cf. In re Adkins, </em>28 B.R. 554, 557 (Bankr.N.D.Miss.1983) (abandonment upheld where notice of \u00a7 341(a) meeting stated, \u201cat the [\u00a7 341(a) ] meeting the trustee will announce which assets he plans to abandon\u201d and trustee announced abandonment of particular real estate at the meeting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">In the case at hand, assuming, without deciding, that the Trustee needed only to make a decision to abandon and announce it at the section 341(a) meeting, there is no indication that the Trustee made a statement manifesting intent to abandon the estate\u2019s interest in the trust at the section 341(a) meeting. In fact, Killebrew\u2019s testimony at the bankruptcy court hearing indicates otherwise. During direct examination, Killebrew stated that at the section 341(a) meeting a representative from Guaranty approached the Trustee and expressed interest in seeing the trust abandoned. Killebrew testified that the Trustee responded by smiling and saying, \u201cI reckon you would.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, during the Trustee\u2019s cross-examination of him, Kille-brew stated that the last thing the Trustee said about the trust was that he would take information \u2014 about the value of the trust\u2014 provided by one of the creditors at the meeting under advisement. These statements fail as notice of abandonment because they do not indicate that the Trustee intended to abandon the trust interest and, therefore, would not provide an interested creditor with notice that she or he needed to file an objection if she or he opposed such abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">For the above reasons, we do not believe that the Trustee abandoned the estate\u2019s interest in the property in question.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence shows that the only action occurring on or around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>May 24, 1985 in relation to the trust was the lifting of the automatic stay under section 362 to allow Guaranty to collect on its secured interest. The order issued in relation to this makes no reference to abandonment and we believe that none occurred. Thus, the net proceeds from the distribution of the trust remain the property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">. Although a discharge was issued to the Debtors on July 2, 1985, the case was never closed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">. Although we refer to the funds at issue in this case as the proceeds of a trust, this is a simplification. The proceeds actually come from the final distributions of two trusts, one created in the will of Killebrew's father and one established in Killebrew\u2019s mother\u2019s will. The trusts held undivided interests in real property, contained complementary terms, and shared the same testamentary trustee. Because all of the parties have treated the two trusts as one, references in this opinion to \"the trust\" are to the combined trusts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1146-12\">.

Documentation in the record shows that on May 24, 1985 (the day \u201con or about\u201d which the bankruptcy court found that the Trustee abandoned the estate\u2019s interest in the property), the automatic stay was lifted in relation to Guaranty\u2019s secured interest in the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AUND\">. Limited exceptions, allowing revocation, exist where the property was \"concealed or where the trustee lacks \u2018knowledge, or sufficient means of knowledge, of its existence.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Tarpley, </em>4 B.R. 145, 146 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1980) (quoting <em>Dushane v. Beall, </em>161 U.S. 513, 518, 16 S.Ct. 637, 639, 40 L.Ed. 791 (1896)). Fortunately, however, because we find that no abandonment occurred, we need not decide the difficult question of whether an abandonment could be revoked under the facts of the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">The exceptions are narrowly construed. For example, in <em>Enriquez, supra, </em>the trustee abandoned all property, including an employment discrimination claim shown as a contingent, unliquidated asset. 22 B.R. at 935. When the debtor later received a $6,250 settlement of this claim, the trustee tried to revoke abandonment. <em>Id. </em>The bankruptcy court denied revocation because the \u201ccreditors and representatives of the estate were put on notice of [the claim\u2019s] existence\u201d and, therefore, the abandonment was \"knowingly\u201d made. <em>Id. </em>at 936; <em>see also In re Tarpley, </em>4 B.R. at 146 (where \"the trustee has knowledge that is 'certainly sufficient to put him upon diligent inquiry as to the transaction\u2019, [sic] the abandonment is held to have been knowingly made and hence irrevocable\u201d (quoting <em>In re Webb, </em>54 F.2d 1065, 1067 (4th Cir.1932)). The absence of any third party whose interest would be adversely affected by revocation of an abandonment is a factor in determining whether a revocation should be permitted. <em>See, e.g., In re Lintz West Side Lumber, Inc., </em>655 F.2d 786, 791 (7th Cir.1981) (reconsideration of abandonment order and revocation may occur, <em>inter alia, </em>\"if the correction is not unfairly prejudicial to innocent parties\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">. We note that this is the only action documented in the record in relation to the trust during this time period. Moreover, this interpretation of the trustee's testimony is supported by the statements made by the Debtors at the hearing. In handing the bankruptcy judge the exhibit containing the documentation of Guaranty\u2019s security interest, counsel for the Debtors stated, \"It [the documents establishing Guaranty\u2019s security interest] is an attachment to exhibit 9. Exhibit 9 is the motion for abandonment.\u201d In fact, exhibit 9 is Guaranty\u2019s motion requesting that the court lift the section 362 automatic stay in order to allow it to enforce its security interest and assignment in the trust. The exhibit never mentions abandonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">. We assume, without deciding, that the Debtors\u2019 interests in the trust income and corpus were originally property of the estate since no party argues to the contrary on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">. Although we note that the trustee also referred to abandonment in his pre-hearing brief, we do not find this reference dispositive. Focusing on the trustee\u2019s testimony, we note his considerable confusion about this concept and believe that he used the word abandonment in a manner inconsistent with the definition of abandonment under the Bankruptcy Code. In his terms, abandonment in relation to the trust seems only to be used to mean that he acquiesced to allowing a secured creditor to collect on its interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1150-17\">.The text of Bankruptcy Rule 6007(b) and (c) state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-18\">(b) Motion by party in interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-19\">A party in interest may file and serve a motion requiring the trustee or debtor in possession to abandon property of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-20\">(c) Hearing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-21\">If a timely objection is made as prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule, or if a motion is made as prescribed by subdivision (b), the court shall set a hearing on notice to the entities as the court may direct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">.

Although section 554(a) contains reference to abandonment occurring \"after notice and hearing\" and, thus, implies judicial involvement, section 102 of the Bankruptcy Code is employed in construing this condition. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102. Section 102(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-7\">In this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-8\">(1) \"after notice and a hearing\", (sic) or a similar phrase\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-9\">(A) means after such notice as is appropriate in the particular circumstances, and such opportunity for a hearing as is appropriate in the particular circumstances; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-10\">(B) authorizes an act without an actual hearing if such notice is given properly and if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-11\">(i) such a hearing is not requested timely by a party in interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-12\">(ii) there is insufficient time for a hearing to be commenced before such act must be done, and the court authorizes such act.... 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(1).

He would like to have abandoned it or whatever it was. I didn't understand all of the legal words that went on at the bankruptcy, but since then, of course, I\u2019ve studied a little bit about bankruptcy, and he asked about abandonment, and Charles Brewer, with a smile on his face, said, \"I reckon you would,\u2019\u2019 and that was the way it was left.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">. Because of the Debtors\u2019 reliance on the language in the combined notice/order of abandonment, we have focused our analysis on abandonment at the Trustee\u2019s impetus, under section 554(a). Abandonment could not have occurred under section 554(c), however, because, as the parties acknowledge, this bankruptcy case was never closed. Furthermore, although Killebrew testified that Guaranty's representative made a request that the estate\u2019s interest in the trust be abandoned <em>{see, supra, </em>note 17), there is no evidence in the record to show that the court ordered the Trustee to take such action. Section 554(b), which governs requests by interested parties for abandonment, \u201cspecifically calls for an \u2018order\u2019 by the court.\u201d <em>In re Trim-X, Inc., </em>695 F.2d at 300 n. 6; <em>see also In re Wideman, </em>84 B.R. at 99 (\"an interested party may seek a court order to compel the trustee to abandon property\u201d); Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice, <em>Bankruptcy Rules </em>346 (Editors\u2019 Comment) (1989-90 ed.)
