The pre-sentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d) computed Carrillo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>initial base offense level as 36, reduced it by two points in recognition of his acceptance of responsibility, but increased it by two points because of his role as a \u201csupervisor\u201d or \u201corganizer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In reviewing a sentence imposed under the guidelines, the factual findings of the sentencing court are entitled to great deference and must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Spraggins, </em>868 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356-57 (11th Cir.1989). In examining the sentencing court\u2019s determination that a defendant was a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d participant, we have used the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Erves, </em>880 F.2d 376, 380-81 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Davis, </em>878 F.2d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir.1989). Similarly, in reviewing a finding that the defendant was an \u201corganizer\u201d or \u201csupervisor\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), the factual conclusion of the sentencing court should be reversed only if clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>873 F.2d 437, 444 (1st Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>867 F.2d 216 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Carrillo argues that the findings <em>were </em>clearly erroneous, that he was a fisherman with a fourth grade education, a warehouseman who was himself a subordinate of others, a \u201csupervisor\u201d only \u201cover other similar low level employees in a narcotics distribution ring.\u201d That there were bigger fish in the larger scheme does not, however, absolve Carrillo of the supervisory role he played in managing the \u201cstash house.\u201d There was sufficient evidence regarding Carrillo\u2019s management of the stash house, receipt of cocaine, and distribution of various allotments of cocaine to others to support a finding that he was an \u201corganizer\u201d or \u201csupervisor.\u201d Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
