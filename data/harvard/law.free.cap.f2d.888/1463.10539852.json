Our review of the record demonstrates that the Secretary committed no error in failing to obtain an updated opinion from a medical advisor following the introduction of new evidence post-hearing or in not making more explicit credibility findings. In addition, we hold that the new evidence the plaintiff-appellant seeks to introduce, concerning her mental impairments, does not meet the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) standards for remand. Therefore, we affirm, and deny the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion to admit new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-19\">Plaintiff-appellant Louise Haywood (\u201cHaywood\u201d), born on August 10, 1936, has a sixth grade education. She has worked as a kitchen aide and as a launderer. In her most recent job, from 1983 till 1986, she worked as a \u201cshirt presser\u201d for a dry cleaner. Haywood\u2019s work involved placing shirts in washing and drying machines and removing and pressing them. This work routinely involved lifting 20 to 25 pounds, standing for relatively long periods of time, and lifting her arms frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-20\">Until May 1, 1986, Haywood worked full-time. For the month of May 1986, allegedly because of an increase in chest pains, Haywood worked only part-time. Thereafter, she quit work, claiming that chest pains rendered her unable to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-21\">In June 1986, Haywood applied for disability benefits and supplementary security income (\u201cSSI\u201d). She listed \u201cheart condition\u201d as the basis of her disability. Haywood was denied such benefits on July 31, 1986. After reconsideration, in November 1986, benefits were again denied. Hay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>wood then requested and received a de novo administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-4\">Medical records before the administrative law judge (\u201cAU\u201d) show that since at least 1981, Haywood has frequently gone to hospitals complaining of \u201cchest pains.\u201d She has also taken medication for such pains for a number of years. A brief summary of much of the medical record before the AU follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1587-5\">On October 20, 1982, Haywood was admitted to the Walker Olin Moss Regional Hospital because of chest pains. After admission, her chest pains ceased and, ultimately, after a number of tests, a doctor in the hospital\u2019s cardiology clinic concluded that she did not suffer \u2014 as previously thought \u2014 from atypical angina. He recommended that she discontinue heart medication and be treated for anxiety. All cardiac medication was stopped; she did not complain of chest pains and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-6\">Haywood was rehospitalized in both March and May of 1986. During her hospitalization in May 1986 her final diagnosis was listed as \u201cunstable angina.\u201d However, she was noted to be in \u201capparent emotional distress\u201d and in several instances the medical records linked her angina to anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-7\">Haywood also underwent two \u201cstress tests\u201d (on February 21, 1985 and June 19, 1986) in relation to her complaints about chest pain. Although she experienced no chest pain during these, the results were inconclusive because she did not continue the required exercise for long enough to permit valid evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-8\">Dr. Young Hee Kang saw Haywood twice in August and at least once in September 1986. Dr. Kang diagnosed her as having unstable angina and anxiety disorder. He continued her heart medication and prescribed medication for her nerves. He further advised her to receive monthly check-ups.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-9\">Haywood was again hospitalized because of chest pains at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in May 1987. In June of 1987, she visited the hospital\u2019s cardiology clinic. At that time, doctors in the cardiology unit evaluated Haywood as having atypical chest pain secondary to either \u201cGI [gastrointestinal problems] or anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-13\">During her administrative hearing on June 2, 1987, Haywood described her chest pains as \u201ca squeeze\u201d that \u201ccuts\u201d her breath. She noted that the pains were not necessarily related to activity and that she took medication to stop the pain (although it did not always work). She also testified that she suffered from \u201cbad nerves\u201d and experienced periods of depression. Haywood described her condition of nervousness as remaining constant, but noted that she took medication for her nerves on an on-going basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-14\">A medical witness, Dr. George Anderson, a specialist in cardiovascular diseases, appeared at the administrative hearing at the AU\u2019s request. He testified that there was no electrocardiac evidence of angina or ichemia (i.e., the heart muscle not receiving enough blood) in the medical records presented (these did not include the May 1987 hospitalization) and found that there was no solid clinical evidence of Haywood suffering cardiovascular problems. Based on the evidence before him, Dr. Anderson testified that he did not believe that Haywood met or had established the equivalence any of the listed disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-15\">At the end of the hearing Haywood requested a psychological review at government expense. The AU denied such request. The AU noted Haywood\u2019s anxiety, but \u2014 in passing \u2014 said that he did not believe Haywood had an \u201cemotional problem.\u201d Subsequent to the hearing, Haywood herself obtained a psychological evaluation from Charles Downing (\u201cDowning\u201d), a psychologist. Downing administered the Mill\u00f3n Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (the \u201cMill\u00f3n\u201d) and interviewed Haywood. He submitted a letter for post-hearing consideration to the AU. Downing stated that the Millon showed \u201cgeneralized anxiety dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>order,\u201d \u201cdysthymic disorder,\u201d and a \u201cborderline personality\u201d with \u201cprominent dependent and passive-aggressive traits.\u201d He further stated that the data indicated \u201csevere mental disorder.\u201d In Downing\u2019s opinion, Haywood was incapable of working. However, in reaching this conclusion, he took physical health and other factors into account, as well as mental health.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1588-4\">On August 28, 1987 \u2014 after considering all of the documents on record, hearing testimony, and all of the arguments presented \u2014 the AU, on behalf of the Secretary for Health and Human Services (the \u201cSecretary\u201d), found that Haywood has \u201ca medically severe combination of impairments whose combined impact causes significant limitation in her capacity for handling more than 30 pounds, she has a slight restriction of activities of daily living, and slight to moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning.\u201d He found she did not have a disabling heart condition and that her chest pains were \u201csporadic and mild to moderate\u201d in character. The AU ruled that her combined impairments, though severe, did not meet or equal the required impairments for disability and he found her residual functional capacity allowed her to perform her past job as a shirt presser \u2014 an unskilled, repetitive light job. Thus, he denied her disability benefits and SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-5\">Following the AU\u2019s decision, Haywood exhausted her administrative remedies and, subsequently, filed this suit against the Secretary in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. Upon order of the presiding magistrate, both parties filed summary judgment motions and supporting memoranda. The magistrate recommended that the Secretary\u2019s motion be granted. Haywood filed objections to his report in a timely manner. Subsequently, the district court adopted the magistrate's recommendations and granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-10\">Haywood timely appealed to this court. She argues that (1) because neither the AU nor the Appeals Council submitted her post-hearing mental impairment evidence to a medical advisor, it was not properly evaluated and, hence, the AU did not have sufficient facts before him upon which to make an informed decision and (2) remand should be granted because the AU failed to make credibility findings. In addition, since the filing of the Haywood\u2019s original brief on this matter, new evidence in the form of a report and evaluation by the Lake Charles Mental Health Center (\u201cLake Charles\u201d) has come into existence. She moves to submit this report for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-12\">In reviewing the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny disability insurance benefits and SSI, this court is limited to a determination of whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, <em>Hollis v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1378, 1382 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Neal v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 528, 530 (5th Cir.1987) (per curiam), and whether any errors of law were made. <em>Hollis, </em>837 F.2d at 1382; <em>Neal, </em>829 F.2d at 530. In applying the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, we scrutinize the record to determine if, in fact, such evidence is present. However, we may not reweigh the evidence, try the issues de novo, or substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary. <em>Abshire v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 638, 640 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam). Substantial evidence means more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance and is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1588-13\">[S]uch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>fact to be established, but \u201cno substantial evidence\u201d will be found only where there is a \u201cconspicuous absence of credible choices\u201d or \u201cno contrary medical evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1589-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 164 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-5\">The law and regulations governing the determination of disability are the same for both disability insurance benefits and SSI. <em>Hollis, </em>837 F.2d at 1382-83 n. 3. In both cases, \u201cdisability\u201d means an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in death or last for twelve or more months. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (Supp.1989). An individual applying for disability insurance benefits and SSI bears the initial burden of proving that she or he is disabled. <em>Abshire, </em>848 F.2d at 640. Once this initial burden is satisfied, the Secretary bears the burden of \u201cestablish[ing] that the claimant is capable of performing substantial gainful activity and therefore, not disabled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-6\">In determining whether or not a claimant is capable of performing substantial gainful activity, the Secretary utilizes the five-step sequential procedure set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b)-(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-7\">1. An individual who is working and engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be found disabled regardless of the medical findings, age, education and work experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-8\">2. An individual who does not have a \u201csevere impairment\u201d will not be found to be disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-9\">3. An individual who meets or equals a listed impairment in Appendix 1 of the regulations will be considered disabled without consideration of vocational factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-10\">4. If an individual is capable of performing the work he has done in the past, a finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d will be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-13\">5.If an individual\u2019s impairment precludes him from performing his past work, other factors including age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity will be considered to determine if other work can be performed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1589-14\">\u201cIf the Secretary adequately points to potential alternative employment, the burden then shifts back to the claimant to prove that he is unable to perform the alternate work.\u201d <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1302 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-15\">III. HAYWOOD\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-16\">Haywood appeals the Secretary\u2019s holding that she is not disabled on two grounds. We consider these in sequence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-17\">A. The Fact that a Medical Advisor did not Consider Post-Hearing Psychological Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-18\">Haywood argues that because the AU heard testimony from a medical advis- or (\u201cMA\u201d) at her hearing, he and the Appeals Council committed reversible error by not submitting her additional, post-hearing evidence to the MA for review. She asserts that reconsideration by a MA was necessary for the full and fair development of her case. Her claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-19\">An AU requests a MA to testify when she or he feels it necessary. A MA is a board-certified specialist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-20\">He is used primarily in complex cases for explanation of medical problems in terms understandable to the layman-examiner. He is a neutral adviser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1589-21\"><em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 408, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1431, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). The AU requested a MA to appear at the hearing in this case. But nothing indicates that a MA\u2019s evaluation of the post-hearing evidence was required for the discharge of the AU\u2019s duty to conduct a full inquiry into the claimant\u2019s allegations. <em>See </em>20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1444. The AU presumably called Dr. Anderson because Haywood had a long history of chest pains and the record contained conflicting medical diagnoses. There was no reason to recall him to consider the report of a psychologist. Moreover, simply because the AU utilized the services of a MA in relation to questions about Haywood\u2019s heart condition, there is no need to call a MA specializing in psychology to review Downing\u2019s report. Though the AU may ask an appearing MA\u2019s opinion, the AU \u2014 not the MA \u2014 rules on whether a claimant is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">Haywood further argues that because the opinion of a physician \u201cdesignated\u201d by the Secretary is required in deciding whether a claimant\u2019s impairments meet or equal listed impairments, an updated medical opinion on the equivalence of her impairments should have been sought following submission of Downing\u2019s report. In Haywood\u2019s case, State agency staff physicians considered whether her impairments met or equaled listed impairments at both the initial and the reconsideration stages of her application. While it is true that such consideration occurred prior to the existence of Downing\u2019s report, we note the options available to an AU in evaluating the severity of a claimant\u2019s mental impairments: (1) he \u201cmay complete the document<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> without the assistance of a medical advisor;\u201d or (2) he may request the assistance of an MA in \u201cpreparing the document;\u201d or (3) \u201c[w]here the issue of a mental impairment arises for the first time at the [AU] hearing level, the [AU] <em>may </em>decide to remand the case to the State agency for completion of the document and a new determination.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(d)(l)(i)-(iii) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>SSR 83-19 reprinted in <em>Social Security Reporting Serv. Rulings </em>93 (West Supp.1989) (AU need only obtain updated medical equivalency opinion \u201cwhen additional medical evidence is received which, <em>in the opinion of the ALJ, </em>may change the determination ... that the impairments) does not equal the listing.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-8\">In the instant case, the AU did not believe Downing\u2019s report would alter the previous medical recommendations rendered<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, thus, he did not feel it necessary to either call an MA <em>or </em>remand to the state agency for a new determination. However, the AU considered and incorporated the post-hearing evidence in his determination about Haywood\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-9\">Overall, contrary to Haywood\u2019s assertion, the fact that neither the AU nor the Appeals Council obtained a new medical opinion in light of Downing\u2019s report did not deprive her of a full and fair inquiry into her combined impairments. At the hearing, the extant evidence on Haywood\u2019s \u201cheart condition\u201d and the varying diagnoses were explored. The AU also asked Haywood and the MA a number of questions about her condition and allowed her representative to question her extensively for the record. While at the hearing the AU did state that he did not think Haywood had a \u201cpsychological\u201d problem, even then he recognized her anxiety (indeed, at the hearing, he mentioned that she might suffer from \u201ccardioneurosis\u201d). More importantly, he accepted and obviously con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>sidered her post-hearing evidence \u2014 Downing\u2019s psychological report \u2014 in his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-4\">The AU\u2019s evaluation of the evidence specifically mentions Downing\u2019s diagnosis of Haywood\u2019s mental impairments. He also relied on the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder in concluding that Haywood\u2019s combination of impairments (chest pain of gastrointestinal or anxious origin as well as generalized anxiety disorder) is \u201cmedically severe.\u201d Moreover, due to her combined impairments, the AU found her incapable of performing \u201cwork involving handling more than 30 pounds and work which is complex, non routine, requires constant contact with other [sic] and involves constant decision making; because she has a slight restriction of activities of daily living, [and] slight to moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning.\u201d Although the AU still concluded that Haywood had the residual capacity to perform her former work as a shirt presser (as this job did not require any of the restricted activities), these findings clearly indicate consideration of the record as a whole \u2014 including post-hearing evidence. Thus, we believe that Haywood was given a full and fair consideration of her combined impairments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Kane v. Heckler, </em>731 F.2d 1216 (5th Cir.1984) (AU failed to develop the record adequately where unrepresented claimant\u2019s hearing lasted five minutes and AU did not probe sufficiently into claimant\u2019s allegations of pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-7\">B. Credibility Findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-8\">Haywood asserts that the AU did not make a credibility finding about her pain and that this led him to conclude erroneously that she could return to past relevant work. She argues remand is necessary for the establishment of credibility findings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-9\">While it is true that in <em>Scharlow v. Schweiker </em>we held that the \u201c[fjailure to indicate the credibility choices made and the basis for those choices in resolving the crucial subsidiary fact of the truthfulness of subjective symptoms and complaints requires reversal and remand,\u201d 655 F.2d 645, 649 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981), we did so in a situation in which the presiding AU based his decision solely on the medical evidence presented and excluded all consideration of the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 648-49. In the case at hand, Haywood\u2019s allegations of pain were considered and accepted. As Haywood herself points out, Dr. Armstrong\u2019s testimony and the AU\u2019s comments at the hearing both indicate that they believed Haywood felt chest pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-10\">The AU concluded that Haywood\u2019s pain did not emanate from a disabling cardiac condition,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but he credited her testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>and specifically recognized that she felt some pain. He determined that Haywood\u2019s pain was sporadic and mild to moderate in character.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, he did not believe that such pain would prevent her from performing her past job. We will not disturb this finding unless it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., James v. Bowen, </em>793 F.2d 702, 706 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201cAU\u2019s findings regarding the debilitating effect of the subjective complaints are entitled to considerable judicial deference.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">It is well settled in this circuit that pain itself may be disabling or prevent the performance of certain jobs. <em>Ware v. Schweiker, </em>651 F.2d 408, 412 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981) (\u201cpain resulting from a \u2018medically determinable impairment/ even when its existence is unsupported by objective medical evidence, may of itself be so intense as to cause disability[ ]\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 912, 102 S.Ct. 1263, 71 L.Ed.2d 452 (1982). In the case at hand, Downing\u2019s report presented evidence of a medically determinable mental impairment. However, not all pain rises to the level of disabling. To be \u201ca disabling condition under the [Social Security] Act pain must be \u201c \u2018constant, unremitting and wholly unresponsive to therapeutic treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrell v. Bowen, </em>862 F.2d 471, 480 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 166 (5th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\">By Haywood\u2019s own allegations, her chest pain fails to meet this standard. At the hearing, she only described the pain as a \u201csqueezing\u201d and stated that it was accompanied by a numbness in her left arm and exhaustion. At the time Haywood requested an ALJ hearing, she claimed that she suffered severe chest pains \u201capproximately every week.\u201d Haywood also said that these episodes last thirty minutes to an hour and that \u2014 although it was not always effective \u2014 she took medication to relieve the pain. Thus, substantial evidence, including Haywood\u2019s own description of her pain, indicates that her pain does not equal the settled requirements for establishing disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-9\">Not only does substantial evidence exist to show that \u2014 despite her pain \u2014 Haywood is not disabled, it also supports the AU\u2019s finding that Haywood could perform her relevant past work. Haywood\u2019s job as a shirt presser routinely required her to carry 20 to 25 pounds, walk a bit, stand, and raise her arms. Haywood\u2019s sporadic pain itself would not appear to prevent her from performing those functions. Moreover, the record shows that during the entire period in which she worked at the dry cleaners, she suffered from chest pains and was seen by hospitals on account of such pains. Although she alleged that such pains became more frequent in 1986, by her own reckoning, she only experienced \u201csevere\u201d pain approximately once per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-10\">Furthermore, nothing in the record, indicates that Haywood is otherwise physically unable to perform this job. Based on the evidence before him, the ALJ judged that Haywood could not perform work requiring her to lift more than 30 pounds. Her job as a shirt presser, however, only required her to lift 20 to 25 pounds. While some of the forms she filled out applying for benefits state that doctors told her not to \u201clift,\u201d the record does not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-11\">Her job also required a little walking and a lot of standing. The record does not indicate that she cannot do either of these. Though at the hearing she stated, that she does not do housework or shop, some of her written disability and SSI applications indicate otherwise. For instance, at vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>ous points, she stated that she is able to care for her own personal needs, sometimes shops, and that the chest pain may come on when she engages in activities such as sweeping her house. In addition, although she apparently told Downing that her doctors told her not to walk and some of her applications state that doctors told her not to work, none of the evidence before the AU confirms this.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Haywood\u2019s own statement at the hearing only indicated that her doctors told her not to do much walking until they completed their tests and, generally, not to get exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-4\">Given the lack of evidence to the contrary and Haywood\u2019s prior work under what appear to be substantially the same health conditions and cognizant of the heavy burden on a claimant in proving disability, we conclude that the AU\u2019s finding that Haywood is capable of performing her past job as a shirt presser is substantially supported by the record as a whole. <em>See Kane, </em>731 F.2d at 1219 (claimant bears burden of showing disability and inability to perform past work).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\">Haywood also argues that because of a lack of credibility findings, the AU could not reject her opinion that she could not return to her prior job \u2014 even part-time. This contention is spurious. Implicit credibility findings were made on the truth and reliability of her complaints of pain. The determination of a claimant\u2019s ability to perform a past job, however, is a decision made by the Secretary based on all of the evidence before him. In the case at hand, it is apparent that the AU considered Haywood\u2019s complaints of pain and claimed restrictions of activity, but did not believe that such complaints would prevent her from performing her prior job as a shirt presser. Substantial evidence supports his finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">IV. HAYWOOD\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-7\">Haywood seeks to introduce additional medical evidence in the form of an evaluation by social workers at Lake Charles in June and July 1989. She requests that, in light of the evidence on the record and this new evidence, we reverse and award her benefits. In the alternative, Haywood requests that we remand this case for consideration of the new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-10\">We do not issue factual findings on new medical evidence. <em>See Chaney v. Schweiker, </em>659 F.2d 676, 679 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam) (\u201cit is not our job as an appellate court to examine new evidentiary materials and find issues of fact[]\u201d). Thus, our review in this situation is limited to determining whether to remand for the consideration of the newly presented evidence. <em>Ellis v. Bowen, </em>820 F.2d 682, 684 (5th Cir.1987). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which controls the scope of our review, we may remand to the Secretary \u201cupon a showing that there is <em>new </em>evidence which is <em>material </em>and that there is <em>good cause </em>for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding_\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See also Bradley v. Bowen, </em>809 F.2d 1054, 1058 (5th Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-13\">The Lake Charles report and the accompanying \u201cmental status functional capacity\u201d checklist diagnose Haywood as suffering from an \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood.\u201d This evidence, not in existence at the time of the administrative and district court proceedings, meets the \u201cnew\u201d requirement for remand to the Secretary, but runs into problems on the \u201cmateriality\u201d and \u201cgood cause\u201d prongs of the conditions for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-14\">First, in applying the test for remand, we have held that it is \u201c[ijmplicit in the materiality requirement\u201d that \u201c \u2018the new evidence relate to the time period for which benefits were denied, and that it not concern evidence of a later-acquired disability or of the subsequent deterioration of the previously non-disabling condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Szubak v. Secretary of Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number><em>and Human Serv., </em>745 F.2d 831, 833 (3rd Cir.1984) (per curiam)); <em>Bradley v. Bowen, </em>809 F.2d at 1058. In this case, the report offers insight into Haywood\u2019s recent mental health and offers a social worker\u2019s assessment of Haywood\u2019s current functional status; it does not address Haywood\u2019s condition at the time of her disability application (June 1986) or at the time of her hearing (June 1987). In fact, the report quotes Haywood as saying that her condition has deteriorated in the last six months to one year \u2014 at least two years after her alleged disability began. Thus, the recently submitted report is \u2014 at best \u2014 evidence of the deterioration of her non-disabling condition. We are constrained by <em>Johnson </em>to hold that this evidence does not meet the materiality requirement for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-15\">Second, Haywood\u2019s submission of this evidence as grounds for remand also falters on the \u201cgood cause\u201d prong. Haywood argues that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for not presenting this evidence previously because the AU refused her request for a psychological review at government expense. This argument is not convincing. It is well settled that the claimant bears an initial heavy burden of proving his or her disability. <em>See Scharlow, </em>655 F.2d at 649 (request for psychological or psychiatric evaluation rejected; \u201cburden of proving disability is upon the claimant.\u201d). A consultative examination at government expense may be required if the record establishes that such an examination is <em>necessary </em>to enable the [AU] to make the disability decision.\u201d <em>Turner v. Califano, </em>563 F.2d 669, 671 (5th Cir.1977) (per curiam) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Jones v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 524, 526 (5th Cir.1987) (per curiam). \u201cThe decision to require such an examination is discretionary[ ],\u201d <em>Jones, </em>829 F.2d at 526, but limited where the claimant \u201craises the requisite suspicion\u201d that such an examination is <em>necessary </em>for the AU to discharge his duty of full inquiry. <em>Pearson v. Bowen, </em>866 F.2d 809, 812 (5th Cir.1989) (remand for pulmonary function study found necessary on basis of claimant\u2019s testimony and doctor's recommendation); <em>see also Jones, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1594-11\">Haywood failed to raise the necessary suspicion. Although Haywood requested a psychological examination at the end of her hearing, to that point she had based her disability claim only on a \u201cheart condition\u201d and offered evidence focused on this claim. While evidence of Haywood\u2019s anxiety was recognized at the hearing, unlike the situation in <em>Pearson, </em>Haywood\u2019s testimony did not indicate <em>necessity </em>for psychological review, nor did any doctors on record at that time recommend such a review. Moreover, Haywood herself ultimately procured a psychological review and placed a report of the findings in the record. As has been discussed, <em>supra, </em>the AU explicitly considered these findings. Thus, we deny Haywood\u2019s motion to admit the new evidence and refuse remand for the consideration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED and Haywood\u2019s motion requesting remand for the consideration of new evidence is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1587-10\">. In addition to the medical treatment summarized, the records show Haywood visiting the emergency room of the Walter Olin Moss Regional Hospital on a number of occasions between 1981 and the time of her administrative hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1588-6\">.

Although Downing indicated that he did not believe Haywood could hold a job, he took factors other than his own diagnosis of her anxiety and depression into account. Downing noted that the various medications Haywood took suggested that she had a heart problem; he then went on to state that if her doctor \"told her not to walk at all ...,\u201d he did not see how she could perform her prior job. Downing also considered Haywood\u2019s age, lack of educational in training, concluding that she needed help. While Downing offers some evidence of Haywood's psychological status, his opinion as to her ability to perform her past job seems to turn on his understanding of Haywood\u2019s heart condition and her rendition of her physician's advice. Much evidence concerning Haywood\u2019s heart condition \u2014 of a more first hand nature \u2014 was already before the AU. Moreover, nothing in the record shows that Haywood\u2019s physicians felt her unable to walk. While Downing\u2019s letter could arguably be construed in such a manner that a different medical determination could possibly have been reached, the AU determines the credibility he accords evidence and resolves conflicts therein. <em>Allen v. Schweiker, </em>642 F.2d 799, 801 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1591-5\">. In connection with this claim, Haywood also asserts that the magistrate reviewing the case at the district court level overstepped his role in the review process by independently assessing the post-hearing evidence of Haywood\u2019s mental health impairments under sections 12.04 and 12.08 of the form entitled \"Psychiatric Review Technique.\" While it is true that the reviewing court\u2019s role is \u201cnot reweigh[ing] the evidence or try[ing] the issues de novo[ ],\u201d <em>Deters v. Secretary of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, </em>789 F.2d 1181, 1185 (5th Cir.1986), we note that the record shows that the magistrate only looked into those issues because Haywood \u2014 in her summary judgment motion below \u2014 asserted that the ALJ failed to consider them. While the magistrate\u2019s language may have implied that he was engaging in initial, substantive evaluation of medical evidence, from the context, we believe that the magistrate\u2019s only purpose in considering the evidence was to determine whether the ALJ had committed error in not making findings under sections 12.04 and 12.08. Thus, we reject Haywood\u2019s contention that the instant case should be remanded either because the magistrate acted improperly or the AU erroneously failed to make findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1591-12\">. Haywood applied for disability because of an alleged \u201cheart condition.\u201d At the hearing, much evidence was heard concerning her chest pain. The record also contains extensive medical records relating to this complaint. Although there were conflicting opinions on whether Haywood\u2019s heart condition was cardiac in origin (with several diagnoses of angina), many doctors noted her anxiety, and the electrocardiograms and x-rays on record show no abnormality or evidence of angina or ichemia. Moreover, doctors at the Cardiology Clinic at Louisiana State University Medical Center, who evaluated her at the time closest to the hearing, believed that her chest pains were due to anxiety or a gastrointestinal problem. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Secretary's determination that Haywood does not have a disabling heart condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1592-7\">. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ did not give an explanation of why he believed Haywood's pain to be \"mild to moderate.\" While an explicit statement on this point would have been helpful, <em>see, e.g., Carry v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 479, 485 n. 14 (5th Cir.1985), we do not conclude that this failure rises to the level of reversible error. Contrary to <em>Scharlow, supra, </em>in this case the AU concluded that Haywood felt pain, but that such pain was non-disabling and would not prevent her from performing her past work. <em>Scharlow, </em>655 F.2d at 648-49 (in remanding for lack of credibility findings the court noted that the AU had failed to determine that Scharlow suffered pain, but that such pain was not disabling); <em>Benson v. Schweiker, </em>652 F.2d 406, 409 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (where the claimant would have prevailed had all her evidence been believed, \"it was clear error for the [AU] to disregard completely the subjective evidence developed at the hearing.\u201d); <em>see also </em>discussion <em>infra </em>of the debilitating effects of her pain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1593-8\">. In fact, Dr. Kang, who she claimed told her not to work, made no such assertion in his report in the record. Rather, he diagnosed her as suffering from unstable angina and anxiety disorder. He noted the severity of her chest pain and simply stated that she \u201cneed[s] medical attention regularly.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
