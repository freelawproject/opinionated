He maintains that his plea of guilty in state court to two armed robberies was involuntary and unknowing because it was predicated on a statement by his attorney that led him to believe his sentence would be no more than fifteen years, when in fact he received an eighteen-year sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-19\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-20\">On March 22, 1983, Harmason pleaded guilty in Louisiana state court to two counts of armed robbery committed in March 1982. On June 15, 1983, the court, following receipt of the presentence investigation report from the probation department, sentenced Harmason to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, with the terms to run concurrently. Harmason appealed the conviction and sentence to the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the First Circuit, contending that the sentence was excessive and that the plea was unknowing and involuntary because his attorney gave him to understand that the sentence following a guilty plea would be no more than fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. That court affirmed the trial court, finding that it had not abused its discretion in sentencing Har-mason and that Harmason had tendered no showing that \u201ca clear and definite promise had been given.\u201d <em>State v. Harmason, </em>No. 83 KA 0930 (La.Ct.App. 1st Cir. Apr. 3, 1984). The Louisiana Supreme Court denied his application for writ of certiorari, <em>State v. Harmason, </em>450 So.2d 965 (La. 1984), and later rejected his reapplication for writ of certiorari as well as his applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>tion for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Harmason v. Blackburn, </em>512 So.2d 858-59 (La.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-4\">After exhausting his state court remedies, Harmason filed an application for writ of habeas corpus <em>in forma pauperis, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, essentially raising the same grounds for relief as he did in the state courts. On April 27,1988, the district court, acting upon the recommendation of the magistrate, denied Harmason\u2019s application. The court reasoned that because the alleged representation by Harmason\u2019s attorney of a fifteen-year sentence following a guilty plea was contingent on the favorable findings of the presentence report, it could not have been breached as a result of the imposition of an eighteen-year sentence, for the report indicated that Harma-son\u2019s past offenses had been severe. <em>Harmason v. Butler, </em>No. 88-69-A (M.D.La. May 4, 1988). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-6\">On appeal, Harmason seeks a reversal of the denial of his application for writ of habeas corpus or, in the alternative, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his attorney made a promise to him that was unkept about the sentence Harmason would receive following a guilty plea. As Harmason notes, for a guilty plea to be constitutionally valid, it must be voluntary and knowing. <em>Smith v. McCotter, </em>786 F.2d 697, 701 (5th Cir.1986). However, his \u201cmere \u2018understanding\u2019 \u201d that he would receive a lesser sentence in exchange for a guilty plea will not abrogate that plea should a heavier sentence actually be imposed. <em>See Davis v. Butler, </em>825 F.2d 892, 894 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Smith, </em>786 F.2d at 701; <em>Self v. Blackburn, </em>751 F.2d 789, 792-93 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Bradbury v. Wainwright, </em>658 F.2d 1083, 1087 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 992, 102 S.Ct. 2275, 73 L.Ed.2d 1288 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-7\">In order for a prisoner to receive federal habeas relief on the basis of alleged promises that are inconsistent with representations made in open court when his guilty plea was accepted, he must \u201c \u2018prove (1) exactly what the terms of the alleged promise were; (2) exactly when, where, and by whom such a promise was made; and (3) the precise identity of an eyewitness to the promise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>825 F.2d at 894 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>786 F.2d at 701). For Harma-son to prevail on his request for an eviden-tiary hearing, he must present the court with \u201c \u2018independent indicia of the likely merit of [his] contentions....\u2019\u201d <em>Davis, </em>825 F.2d at 894 (quoting <em>United States v. Raetzsch, </em>781 F.2d 1149, 1151 (5th Cir.1986)). Such indicia may include an affidavit from a reliable third party. <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>769 F.2d 1095, 1099 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-9\">As support for his contention that his plea was involuntary and unknowing, Harmason proffered a copy of the October 14, 1983 affidavit of his attorney, Leo J. Berggreen (Berggreen), which had been filed in the Louisiana Court of Appeal in aid of Harmason\u2019s appeal. This affidavit recites that the case had been set for trial on the merits for March 21, 1983, when the jury was selected, and that the following morning, before trial commenced that day, there was an in-chambers, unrecorded conference between the judge, the Honorable Carl J. Guidry, the prosecutor (Mr. Roy), counsel for co-defendant Davis (Mr. Smith), and Berggreen. A third co-defendant, Taylor, had previously pleaded guilty and been sentenced to fifteen years. The affidavit further states that at this conference there took place \u201ca conversation with words of similar import\u201d that the affidavit purports to paraphrase in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atc\">\u201cMr. Berggreen: \u2018If we enter a plea on behalf of our respective clients what kind of time are we looking at?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-10\">\u201cMr. Roy: T don\u2019t think it will make any difference if you plead to two or three counts. The sentence should be the same.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-11\">\u201cJudge Guidry: T gave the other defendant, Tyrone Taylor, fifteen years and that was after a full blown trial.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-12\">\u201cMr. Smith: \u2018We are looking at something less than fifteen?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1530\">*1530</page-number>\u201cJudge Guidry: T have to have a pre-sentence report on both of them first. But I think that\u2019s right.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-4\">\u201cMr. Roy: T will accept a plea on two counts from Harmason and three counts from Davis.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-5\">\u201cMr. Berggreen: \u2018Can we tell our clients that they can expect less than fifteen years?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-6\">\u201cMr. Roy: \u2018The Court usually considers the fact that a plea was made.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-7\">\u201cMr. Smith: \u2018What can we tell our clients?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-8\">\u201cJudge Guidry: \u2018Unless the pre-sentence is extraordinarily bad, I think what I gave Taylor is the outside limit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-9\">\u201cBased upon this conversation, affiant talked to his client and convinced him that less than fifteen (15) years as compared to ninety-nine (99) years on each count was a good plea bargain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1652-10\">In his brief on direct appeal to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Harmason\u2019s counsel asserted that \u201cHarmason agreed to plead guilty based upon counsel\u2019s representations that he was going to probably receive less than fifteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-11\">Following the conference, a lengthy hearing (some twenty pages of the transcript) was held in open court with reference to the knowing and voluntary nature of the pleas, and the factual basis for them, and the pleas were accepted. Among other things, the record of this hearing reflects the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-12\">\u201cQ [Judge Guidry]. And you understand your exposure as far as the penalty is concerned? You\u2019re looking at a minimum of five years without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-13\">\u201cA [Harmason]. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-15\">\u201cQ. And a maximum of ninety-nine and as to each count; count two and count three?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-17\">\u201cQ. All right. Is this a free and voluntary plea on your part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-18\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-19\">\u201cQ. Is anyone forcing, threatening or coercing you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-20\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-21\">\u201cThe Court: Is this a negotiated plea of any type?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-22\">\u201cMr. Roy: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-23\">\u201cMr. Berggreen: Not with Mr. Roy, Your Honor. Uh, I led my client to believe there were certain perimeters as far as what would probably be the sentence but I mean there\u2019s no deal with anybody as to specific sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-24\">\u201cBy the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-25\">\u201cQ. Well, have any promises been made to you to plead guilty, Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-26\">\u201cA. No, sir, no promises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-27\">\u201cQ. All right. And you \u2014 you understand the minimum is five and the maximum is ninety-nine\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-28\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-29\">\u201cQ. \u2014without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-30\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1652-31\">After the guilty pleas were accepted, the trial court ordered a presentence investigation report, and, following its receipt, the sentencing hearing was held on June 15, 1983. At the sentencing, Judge Guidry questioned Harmason about the fact that the \u201cpre-sentence investigation\u201d reflected he had been arrested as a juvenile in October 1978 for two counts of burglary and theft for which he was \u201cplaced on supervised probation,\u201d that while on probation he was arrested for trespassing and disturbing the peace and thereafter was again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>arrested for burglary and theft in April of 1979 and in May of 1979 was committed for those offenses until June 1980, after which he was on probation until November 1980. Harmason and his counsel denied none of this, and his counsel remarked \u201cthe bad company was his ruin. I\u2019m not saying he did not commit the acts.\u201d When the court imposed sentence, counsel advised that \u201cfor the record I would like to enter an oral order of appeal with regard to the sentence\u201d but \u201c[n]ot with regard to the Boy-kin.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, as above recited, Harmason, through counsel, unsuccessfully appealed both the severity of his sentence and his guilty plea to the Louisiana Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-4\">We reject Harmason\u2019s contentions. His sworn testimony at the guilty plea hearing was that he understood that his sentence \u201cexposure\u201d was up to ninety-nine years, and that there had been, in his own words, \u201cno promises.\u201d The latter statement was in response to the court\u2019s questions posed immediately following Harmason\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cI led my client to believe there were certain perimeters as far as what would <em>probably </em>be the sentence but I mean there\u2019s no deal with anybody as to specific sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added). Counsel\u2019s affidavit insofar as it relates what the judge said at the chambers conference shows these comments to be in each instance both less than firm \u2014 \u201cI think\u201d \u2014 and conditional, <em>viz: </em>\u201cI have to have a pre-sentence report ... first\u201d and \u201cunless the pre-sentence is extraordinarily bad.\u201d This is also reflected in counsel\u2019s state appeal brief, where it is stated that he informed Harmason that he would <em>\u201cprobably </em>\u201d receive less than fifteen years. That the possibility of a greater sentence was in mind is likewise reflected by the express reservation of the right to appeal the sentence <em>(see </em>note 1, <em>supra). </em>Harmason\u2019s instant habeas petition likewise reflects that he understood at the time that whether his sentence would exceed fifteen years depended on how the judge would evaluate his record. The petition refers to counsel\u2019s affidavit as stating \u201cthat Judge Guidry said the imposition of sentences of less than fifteen (15) years would hinge upon whether the pre-sentence investigation report was <em>\u2018bad.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original). The petition goes on to state: \u201cOf course, what is \u2018bad\u2019 or good is a <em>value judgment. </em>... <em>To petitioner </em>and counsel, the presentence investigation report, reflecting utterly petty offenses, was not considered \u2018bad\u2019 <em>and thus, petitioner felt </em>that he would be entitled to a sentence of less than fifteen (15) years imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis added). This bespeaks Harmason\u2019s recognition that he might get more than fifteen years if the trial court viewed his record as being more serious than he did, a matter that he recognizes was a value judgment. Similarly, in his brief on this appeal Harmason states that the issue is whether his guilty plea was rendered invalid because based on \u201cthe stipulation that Appellant would <em>more than likely </em>receive the same sentence as his co-defendant [Taylor]\u201d (emphasis added) and further that he relied on \u201cthe <em>prognosis </em>related to him by his attorney\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-9\">Harmason\u2019s allegations, Berg-green\u2019s affidavit, and the circumstances of his case do not indicate his reliance on a specific, firm sentencing agreement or representation, but rather demonstrate no more than an understanding on Harmason\u2019s part that his sentence would probably be no more than fifteen years, but that this was not certain and was contingent on the judge\u2019s evaluation of the forthcoming presentence report. We cannot say that Harmason\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary and unknowing and that the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus should therefore follow. <em>See Smith, </em>786 F.2d at 701 (\u201cunder-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>standing\u201d there would be a lesser sentence will not undermine the voluntariness of a guilty plea; rather, there must be an \u201cactual promise\"); <em>Self, </em>751 F.2d at 793 (same). Berggreen\u2019s affidavit does <em>not </em>state that he told Harmason that the judge (or anyone else) promised to give no more than fifteen years. In light of counsel\u2019s statement in open court, and in his brief on appeal (which was based on the affidavit), that he advised Harmason as to what would <em>\u201cprobably </em>\u201d be his sentence, and in light also of the affidavit\u2019s reference to the judge\u2019s \u201cI think\u201d and \u201cunless the pre-sen-tence\u201d statements in conference, we are unable to read into Berggreen\u2019s affidavit any assertion that he conveyed to Harma-son a definite and firm assurance, as opposed to a prediction or statement of probability, that his sentence would not exceed fifteen years. A prediction, prognosis, or statement of probabilities, such as a prosecutor\u2019s leading the defendant to believe that defense counsel\u2019s statement of the \u201cprobable duration of sentence\u201d was \u201caccurate,\u201d <em>Self, </em>751 F.2d at 793, does not constitute an \u201cactual promise\u201d within <em>Smith, </em>786 F.2d at 701. Further, if there were any actual promise here, as opposed to a mere statement of probabilities, \u201cexactly what the terms of the alleged promise were,\u201d <em>id., </em>is not stated. As a result, Harmason\u2019s allegations and Berggreen's affidavit fail to surmount the \u201c \u2018formidable barrier\u2019 \u201d presented by Harmason\u2019s own open court assertions that there had been \u201cno promises\u201d about his sentence and that he understood that his sentence \u201cexposure\u201d was the statutory maximum. Therefore the granting of an evidentiary hearing was not required. <em>See Davis, </em>825 F.2d at 894-95; <em>Raetzsch, </em>781 F.2d at 1152 (defendant not entitled to evidentiary hearing when allegations are inconsistent with his conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-5\">In conclusion, we find that Harmason has failed to establish that his guilty plea was involuntary or unknowing and therefore has not satisfied the requirements for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. We also find that Harmason has not demonstrated the need for an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1652-14\">. We note that in the course of the judge\u2019s thorough explanation of the rights Harmason would be giving up by pleading guilty, when mention was made of the right to appeal, Har-mason\u2019s counsel interjected stating \"because its been one of my client's concerns, I would want to assure him that he would retain the right to appeal what he might feel would be an excessive sentence,\u201d and the court agreed that this was so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-32\">Further, at the joint hearing on Smith\u2019s and Harmason\u2019s pleas (both being present throughout), the charges and their legal and factual elements were clearly explained and the underlying facts and evidence showing Harmason's guilt were recited and the court ascertained from Harmason that that was what he was pleading guilty to.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1653-5\">. In his brief to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Harmason\u2019s counsel asserted that after sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1653-7\">\"Counsel then approached the bench and reminded the court of the conversation in chambers on the day (March 22, 1983) of the plea of guilty. The court did not recall the conversation and stuck by its sentence of eighteen years. The court did afterward speak to Ralph Roy, James Garland Smith and Leo Berggreen and based upon these conversations did not conclude that any agreement or promise had been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
