Martinez appeals on several grounds, maintaining that the prosecution improperly failed to disclose certain evidence to him before trial; that the trial judge incorrectly denied his motion for acquittal; that the prosecutor violated his due process rights by eliciting from witnesses information that was probably false and by commenting on his silence during interrogation; and that the prosecution violated the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, <em>et. seq. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-11\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-12\">At 4:45 a.m. on October 31, 1988, Martinez drove a Dina truck tractor across the bridge from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas. United States Customs Service Inspector Jose Trejo (Trejo) testified that agents ordered Martinez to drive into the secondary inspection area because the Dina, which had exceptionally long fuel tanks supported by three straps rather than the usual two, resembled a truck that had passed their outpost two days earlier, but which they had failed to inspect. At the secondary inspection area, Trejo asked Martinez for a declaration of what he was bringing from Mexico, to which Martinez replied \u201cnothing.\u201d He also requested identification from Martinez, who presented Trejo with a United States border crossing card that allowed him to enter the country and travel up to twenty-five miles from the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-14\">Trejo testified that he then examined the truck\u2019s tanks to determine if they actually contained fuel. By tapping both with a brass hammer, he sensed that a portion of each tank held something solid. Trejo also noticed that the original fuel outlets had apparently been welded closed and the nozzles had been moved to the very end of the tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-15\">At that time, agents decided to escort Martinez to their office at the bridge. Tre-jo testified that when they approached him, Martinez asked what was happening and volunteered that he was unemployed and seeking a job, even though his border entry card prohibited him from seeking employment in this country. Martinez also asserted that \u201cthey\u201d had loaned him the truck, but was unable to identify who \u201cthey\u201d were.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-16\">While agents detained Martinez, Trejo searched the interior of the truck. He noticed that the cab was very clean, which seemed unusual to him because such trucks frequently gathered dust on the Mexican roads. Trejo also observed that the cab did not contain personal effects, such as a toiletry kit, food, or a change of clothing, items truck drivers ordinarily carried when crossing the border because of the usual delays in clearing customs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-17\">As a result of their suspicions, the agents called for the Customs Service canine unit to inspect the truck. The dog alerted to the gas tanks, which were then removed and found to be tightly packed at one end with bales of marihuana. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) later determined that the total weight of marihua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>na was 306 pounds with a street value in El Paso of $240,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-4\">At this point, Trejo and fellow United States Customs Service Inspector Rodolfo Reyna (Reyna) arrested Martinez, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and searched him, finding $132. Reyna asked Martinez whether he owned the truck and Martinez responded negatively. He further denied knowing the identity of the owner and maintained that he did not recognize the names on various United States and Mexican vehicle registration and taxation forms found in the cab, all of which contained some variation of the name \u201cMartinez.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1609-5\">DEA Special Agent Felipe Garcia (Garcia) testified that he was called to the scene at 9:30 that morning to inspect the contraband and interrogate the suspect. After advising Martinez of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish, Garcia asked him to explain his situation. Martinez asserted that earlier that morning, a man had approached him in a Juarez motel and offered him $300 to drive the truck to El Paso to pick up a semitrailer. However, Martinez was unable to tell Garcia where he was to obtain the semitrailer or how long his journey was to last. When Garcia inquired about the identity of his employer, Martinez then terminated the questioning. Both Trejo and Reyna testified that in their experience drivers working along the border typically earned only between $400 to $600 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-18\">Following the conviction of Martinez on both counts, the district court sentenced him to sixty-three months in prison on each count to be served concurrently and four years of supervisory release on each count to be served concurrently as well. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-20\">Martinez raises several points on appeal, which we discuss in turn. First he contends that the prosecution deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial by failing to disclose prior to trial several matters about which Trejo and Reyna would eventually testify on the witness stand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>covery, the prosecution provided Martinez with copies of several government reports and agents\u2019 statements about the case. Martinez maintains that the agents\u2019 testimony \u201ccreat[ed] a totally different scenario\u201d from that depicted by the documents provided to him by the prosecution. He appears to assert that the prosecution thereby misrepresented its case during the discovery process and thus violated the dictates of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and the district court\u2019s discovery order, which was modeled after Fed.R.Crim.P. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-4\">The Supreme Court has declared that a \u201cgeneral constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case\u201d does not exist. <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1003, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (quoting <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 97 S.Ct. 837, 846, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977)); see <em>also United States v. Fischel, </em>686 F.2d 1082, 1091 (5th Cir.1982). The Court, however, has recognized that a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial prohibits the prosecution from suppressing evidence that is favorable to the accused and \u201cmaterial either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>83 S.Ct. at 1196-97. Evidence that impeaches the credibility of a government witness whose testimony \u201c \u2018may well be determinative of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt or innocence\u2019 \u201d is <em>Brady </em>material that the prosecution may not suppress. <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (quoting <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959)). Evidence that would exculpate the accused is such material as well. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>872 F.2d 612, 619 (5th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, because <em>Brady </em>and its progeny only serve to restrict the prosecution\u2019s ability to suppress evidence rather than to provide the accused a right to criminal discovery, the Supreme Court has asserted that the <em>Brady </em>rule was never intended \u201cto displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is uncovered....\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). <em>See also Weatherford, </em>97 S.Ct. at 846. As the evidence in question here was presented at trial, it was not suppressed, regardless of whether or not it had previously been disclosed during discovery. The substance of Martinez\u2019s complaint is not that evidence <em>was </em>suppressed, but rather that it <em>should have been </em>(but was not) suppressed because it was not disclosed in discovery pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>or to trial. This does not state a <em>Brady </em>violation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-4\">Moreover, there was no <em>Brady </em>violation for the additional reason that the allegedly suppressed material was not exculpatory and could not have served to impeach the prosecution\u2019s witnesses. The information that Martinez contends is <em>Brady </em>material consisted of what Trejo and Reyna said in their testimony about their observations and impressions of their encounter with Martinez and the truck he was driving on October 31. This testimony in no way tended to exculpate Martinez. As Martinez asserted in his brief, \u201c[h]ad it not been for those items the Government would not have had sufficient factual basis to support\u201d the inferences of knowledge and intent necessary for a conviction. Additionally, this testimony <em>itself </em>did not help to impeach the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses; rather, the omission from the agents\u2019 investigative reports of these matters related in their testimony tended to serve the impeachment function by revealing the agents\u2019 inattention to detail, which is just the use that Martinez\u2019s attorney made of these omissions at trial. Because the information omitted from the reports was not favorable to Martinez, it could not have been <em>Brady </em>material. And, the fact that the reports did not contain the information testified to was <em>not </em>suppressed, but rather was entirely disclosed at trial and there fully exploited for all its possible impeachment value by Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-11\">As this Court has observed, <em>Brady </em>does not impose a duty on the prosecutor \u201cto make a complete and detailed accounting of all police investigatory work on a case \u2014 to routinely deliver his entire file \u2014 to defense counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>628 F.2d 471, 473 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-12\">Martinez also maintains that the omission of the facts to which Trejo and Reyna would testify at trial from the investigative reports and statements provided to him by the prosecution contravened the district court\u2019s standing discovery order. That order essentially mirrored Fed.R. Crim.P. 16, which requires the prosecution to allow the accused to copy, upon request, certain information in the possession of the prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of the evidence at is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>sue in this respect was subject to discovery-under Rule 16(a)(l)(A-D) because it consisted only of testimony of the agents\u2019 own observations and impressions of events on October 31 and not of statements by Martinez, his arrest record, tangible objects, or test or experiment results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">Rule 16(a)(2) demands that the prosecution permit discovery as compelled by the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. The Jencks Act requires the prosecution to produce, upon request after direct examination, \u201cany statement ... of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b). Section 3500(e) defines a statement as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-5\">\u201c(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-6\">\u201c(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-7\">\u201c(3) a statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof, if any, made by said witness to a grand jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARP\">The Jencks Act\u2019s objective is to guarantee that defendants are furnished with statements of witnesses for impeachment use on cross-examination, but not to make such statements available during discovery. 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 19.3(g) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-10\">This Court has determined that an investigative report may well be considered a Jencks Act statement of its author so long as the report satisfies section 3500(e) and pertains to the subject matter of the agent\u2019s testimony. <em>United States v. Welch, </em>810 F.2d 485, 490 (5th Cir.1987). <em>See generally United States v. Newman, </em>849 F.2d 156, 159-60 (5th Cir.1988). However, we have never required the prosecution \u201c \u2018to develop potential Jencks Act statements\u2019 \u201d by demanding that its witnesses reduce to writing every matter about which they intend to testify at trial. <em>United States v. Rodarte, </em>596 F.2d 141, 145-46 (5th Cir.1979) (quoting <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>478 F.2d 408, 411 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Aleman et al. v. United States, </em>414 U.S. 910, 94 S.Ct. 259, 38 L.Ed.2d 148 (1973)). Consequently, the Jencks Act imposed no obligation on the prosecution to reveal to Martinez any more than what was actually embodied in the reports and written statements provided to him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the prosecution did not violate Rule 16 or the district court\u2019s discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-11\">Martinez\u2019s next complaint on appeal is that the district court incorrectly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal because it considered the testimony of the agents not disclosed to him prior to trial. Essentially, Martinez contends that, without such testimony, the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-12\">Because of our ruling, <em>supra, </em>that nondisclosure of such testimony to Martinez prior to trial did not violate his rights, we conclude that this evidence may properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>be considered in determining whether the evidence as a whole was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-4\">Conviction of possession of marihuana with the intent to distribute it requires proof that the defendant had (1) knowing (2) possession of the illicit substance (3) with intent to distribute it. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>848 F.2d 509, 511 (5th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Williams-Hendricks, </em>805 F.2d 496, 500 (5th Cir.1986). Regarding the additional charge of importation, the prosecution need only prove that Martinez played a role in bringing the marihuana into the United States from a foreign country. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Palacios, </em>838 F.2d 1346, 1349 (5th Cir.1988). The evidence is sufficient if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Palella, </em>846 F.2d 977, 981 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 162, 102 L.Ed.2d 133 (1988). In evaluating Martinez\u2019s challenge, we examine the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the verdict and afford the prosecution the benefit of all reasonable inferences and credibility choices drawn therefrom. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Kim, </em>884 F.2d 189, 192 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-7\">The jury could have reasonably determined that Martinez had possession of the marihuana because of his dominion and control over the Dina truck in which it was concealed. <em>United States v. Olivier-Becerril, </em>861 F.2d 424, 426 (5th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Kaufman, </em>858 F.2d 994, 1000 (5th Cir.1988). Likewise, the jury could have inferred Martinez\u2019s intent to distribute by virtue of the large quantity of marihuana found in his possession, 306 pounds. <em>United States v. Prieto-Tejas, </em>779 F.2d 1098, 1101 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-8\">Knowing possession can be inferred from the defendant\u2019s control over the vehicle in which the illicit substance is contained, generally along with other circumstantial evidence that is suspicious in nature or demonstrates guilty knowledge. <em>Olivier-Becerril, </em>861 F.2d at 426-27; <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>848 F.2d 509, 513 (5th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Del Aguila-Reyes, </em>722 F.2d 155, 157-58 (5th Cir.1983). In this case, other suspicious circumstantial evidence demonstrates guilty knowledge on the part of Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-10\">Martinez\u2019s explanation for the motivation behind his travel to the United States changed over the course of his detention at the border on October 31, 1988. Martinez\u2019s initial story was that an unidentified \u201cthey\u201d had loaned him the truck to cross the border to look for work, even though he had no work permit. Later that day in response to a question from Garcia, Martinez asserted that \u201cthey\u201d had paid him $300 to drive the truck to the United States to retrieve a semitrailer. Such inconsistency in explanations certainly allows for an inference of Martinez\u2019s guilty knowledge. <em>See, e.g., Richardson, </em>848 F.2d at 513. In addition, Martinez\u2019s inability to identify who provided him with the truck as well as his claim to having been paid $300, a sum which agents testified was inordinately high for a journey of that kind if it were innocent, are examples of circumstantial evidence that is unquestionably suspicious in nature. <em>Cf. Del Aguila-Reyes, </em>722 F.2d at 157-58 (the jury could infer that the defendant \u201cshould have known that his trip ... was prompted for some additional, probably illegal, reason\u201d or was deliberately ignorant). Considered with Martinez\u2019s control over the drug-laden truck of which he was the driver and sole occupant, and the fact that the unusual nature of the fuel tanks and their special fittings were observable on exterior inspection, this circumstantial evidence is considerably more than sufficient to permit a jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Martinez had knowledge of the marihuana in his possession. <em>See Olivier-Becerril, </em>861 F.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-11\">Sufficient evidence of Martinez\u2019s role in importing the marihuana exists by virtue of his crossing the international frontier with a quantity of the illicit substance sufficient for a jury to infer intent to distribute. <em>Hernandez-Palacios, </em>838 F.2d at 1349. As a result, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>was correct in ruling against Martinez on his motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">Martinez\u2019s third contention on appeal is that the prosecution violated his due process rights by eliciting testimony that was, according to Martinez, probably perjured, and by commenting on his silence during interrogation. Regarding the first assertion of prosecutorial misconduct, in order to state a due process violation, Martinez must show that the prosecution knowingly presented materially false evidence to the jury. <em>United States v. Miranne, </em>688 F.2d 980, 989 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1109, 103 S.Ct. 736, 74 L.Ed.2d 959 (1983); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>634 F.2d 819, 827 (5th Cir.1981). Martinez has wholly failed to demonstrate, and even to allege, that the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, in fact, perjured themselves. Instead, he maintains that the witness\u2019s testimony \u201cmay well have been false.\u201d The omission of certain facts from the reports and written statements of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, alone, is certainly not adequate to put the prosecution on notice of perjury on their part, much less to establish that such perjury in fact occurred. <em>See generally United States v. Viera, </em>819 F.2d 498, 502 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Brown, </em>634 F.2d at 827. If anything, the omissions merely go to the credibility of the witnesses, an area within the province of the jury (and fully disclosed to it here). <em>See Miranne, </em>688 F.2d at 989; <em>see also Viera, </em>819 F.2d at 502. In essence, Martinez\u2019s complaint amounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the verdict. That will not do. As we have held, the evidence is clearly sufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">Martinez\u2019s claims about prosecution comment on his silence during interrogation are wholly lacking in specificity. All Martinez says in this connection is that \u201cthe prosecutor used Defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent by pounding into the jury\u2019s mind the inference that the Defendant very well knew who the owner of the truck was, particularly since the last name of the owner and Defendant was the same,\u201d that \u201cthe prosecutor used Defendant\u2019s silence during the time of interrogation to assure that he would obtain a conviction,\u201d and, at least inferentially, that this violated the rule of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s allegedly offending language is not quoted or paraphrased; it is not stated at what stage of the trial this occurred; and, contrary to our local Rule 28.2.3, no record citations are furnished. Arguably, these assertions furnish nothing for review, as it is not the function of the Court of Appeals to comb the record for possible error, but rather it is counsel\u2019s responsibility to point out distinctly and specifically the precise matters complained of, with appropriate citations to the page or pages in the record where the matters appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-8\">Nevertheless, we have reviewed the record with Martinez\u2019s contentions in this respect in mind and, though we note one brief passing reference in both the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and in his closing argument, and one question by the prosecutor of Agent Garcia, that arguably were improper under <em>Doyle </em>(a matter which we do not determine), no objection whatever was ever made to any of these matters (and no Doyle-type complaint was ever raised below). Consequently, reversal is proper only if the \u201cplain error\u201d standard is met. <em>See United States v. Morales, </em>854 F.2d 61, 63 (5th Cir.1988) (applying \u201cplain error\u201d rule in declining to reverse for unob-jected-to alleged <em>Doyle </em>violation); <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>806 F.2d 566, 573 (5th Cir.1986) (same). \u201c \u2018Plain error may be recognized \u201conly if the error is so obvious that our failure to notice it would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings and result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>a miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Canales, </em>744 F.2d 413, 431 (5th Cir.1984). As we have also stated, \u201c[t]o constitute plain error, the error must have been so fundamental as to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Yamin, </em>868 F.2d 130, 132 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3258, 106 L.Ed.2d 603 (1989). <em>See also Alvarado, </em>806 F.2d at 573 (to be plain error, the error must be \u201c \u2018so great as to result in the likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d). No aspect of the plain error standard is met here, and there is clearly nothing to suggest a likely miscarriage of justice. The referenced possible <em>Doyle </em>violations did not loom large at trial. The prosecution\u2019s evidence of guilt was well more than sufficient, and there was essentially no contrary evidence. Accordingly, Martinez\u2019s <em>Doyle </em>contentions present no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\">Martinez\u2019s final contention on appeal is that the prosecution violated the terms of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, <em>et seq., </em>and that his indictment should therefore have been dismissed. Section 3161(c)(1) provides that trial shall begin within seventy days of the later of the defendant\u2019s first appearance at court or the filing and making public of the indictment or information. Martinez\u2019s trial began on February 23, 1989, ninety-nine days after his November 16, 1988 indictment, the later of the two statutory dates. However, section 3161(h)(1)(F) allows an exception to the time limitation for delay caused by the filing and the court\u2019s consideration of pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-7\">Martinez filed several pretrial motions, including a December 23, 1988 motion to dismiss the indictment that the district court denied twenty-seven days later, as well as a February 9, 1989 motion that the court denied after fourteen days of consideration on February 23. He contends that the prosecution\u2019s unreasonable delay in responding to his December motion contributed to the delay in the court\u2019s ruling on it and that such delay is therefore not excludable under section 3161(h)(1)(F) in determining whether the Act\u2019s time limitation was satisfied. He asserts that, as a result, the fifteen days between January 3, 1989, the date on which the prosecution was to have filed a response under the local rules, and January 18, 1989, the date on which it actually responded to the motion, should not be included in the forty-one days ex-cludable under section 3161(h)(1)(F). If the fifteen days are not excluded under that section, then seventy-three days of nonex-cludable time passed between Martinez\u2019s indictment and the commencement of his trial, thus contravening the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">In <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 321, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 1876, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986), the Supreme Court ruled that exclusions under section 3161(h)(1)(F) are not limited to only \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 delays ... between the time of filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing thereon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result of this decision, all forty-one of the days devoted to pretrial motions must be excluded under section 3161(h)(1)(F) and Martinez\u2019s final argument must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1609-6\">.

And the reason we had our attention to it was because two days earlier a vehicle resembling that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-10\">\"A. It came into the port of entry with extra long tanks. But before we stopped it, it went down the road. So we kept a watch out for another vehicle with long tanks....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-11\">\"And as it approached, everybody saw the truck and ran up and directed the truck into secondary inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-12\">\"A. ... I ran out in the street and directed the traffic to pull into the secondary inspection area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-14\">\"A. The original nozzle looked like it had been moved. It was welded over. You could see the weld marks. And it moved over closer to the edge of the tank so the gasoline could go straight down the tank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-15\">\"A. ... Usually you have two straps on the thing, and he had three straps.... We had never seen a trailer with a tank that long....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-21\">\"A. ... [W]e searched the truck inside and out, and it was pretty clean. It didn\u2019t have the normal stuff that a truck driver has like clothes if he\u2019s going on a trip or lunch if he\u2019s going to work here. It even looked like it had been vacuumed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-23\">\"A. [This aroused my suspicion] because of the trucks you see in Mexico, they travel over dusty roads. I don\u2019t think I ever seen a vacuumed truck before. So we thumped on the gas tank some more. We said, \u2018There\u2019s got to be something there.\u2019... The agents came down and authorized us to call the mechanics from the Union 76 station to take the tanks down. We kept the truck there until the mechanics came down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-24\">\u201cA. Well, if he was looking for a job, he had to have some kind of lunch, or if he was working, he had to have some kind of a lunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-25\">\"A. Most of the time they have a little bag with a toothbrush or shaving equipment or have an extra shirt, extra pants if they\u2019re working here because they can never tell how long they're going to stay in line for the import lot to clear a shipment. So they all carry something to tide them over until they go back to Mexico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1609-26\">\u201cA. ... I didn\u2019t see any [log books].

Okay, could you tell the jury approximately how far one could go if one was on a normal business trip with a tractor of this nature, how far would you be able to drive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZg\">\"A. About 70 miles, 80 at the most and then it would run out of gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-6\">\"A. When we got a closer look when the mechanics got there, some of the bolts holding the straps down were kind of loose. And when they took the straps off, there was hon-do on one end of the tank where it looked like \u2014 well, they painted over the bondo and made it look like part of the tank. And they dropped the tank. The first tank was kind of difficult to get off because we didn\u2019t know how it was put in, how the lid was put on there. So we hammered with a sledgehammer and screwdriver, whatever we had there and it finally came off. And there was a lid with a whole bunch of screws all the way around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-7\">\"A. ... After we realized how the cannister was put together, then all we did was go to the other side and find four screws, unscrew that and the lid just came right off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-9\">\u201cA. [H]e had $132 in his pocket plus some Mexican currency which we normally don't count because it didn\u2019t amount to that much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-10\">\"A. Well, being unemployed, having $132, no, there's no law against it, but for being unemployed and looking for a job, I thought that was quite a bit of money in his pocket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aapn\">The items of Reyna\u2019s testimony complained of in this respect are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-11\">\"A. It was a green vehicle, tractor, very nicely \u2014 it was a bright green, a canvas stake about it, nice chrome wheels on it. Our supervisor had alerted us to the vehicle, the type of vehicle and the type of tank that could possible have some kind of contraband in it. As I was working on Lane 4,1 yelled, 'I think that\u2019s our truck coming up.\u2019 The inspectors dashed across the street there, or the lane and intercepted the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-12\">\"A. ...
