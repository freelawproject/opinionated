Stat.Ann \u00a7 9:5362 does not apply to a <em>dation en paiement </em>and granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Plaintiff appeals and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-30\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-31\">The essential facts are not disputed in this case. Farmers-Merchants Bank &amp; Trust Company (Farmers) of St. Martin Parish was the last holder of a collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>chattel mortgage note dated December 3, 1984, and executed by Dugas Construction Company (Dugas), a Louisiana corporation domiciled in St. Martin Parish. The collateral mortgage note was secured by several pieces of Dugas\u2019 equipment (including a Case, 508 Front End Loader) under a collateral chattel mortgage recorded in St. Martin Parish. Dugas thereafter executed six promissory notes in favor of Farmers. In addition, Joseph Dugas (Joseph) and Genevieve Dugas (Genevieve) personally guaranteed the indebtedness of Dugas to Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-4\">On May 28, 1985, Farmers sued Dugas as well as Joseph and Genevieve. Farmers obtained judgment under the collateral chattel mortgage. After judgment became final, Joseph informed Farmers that the Case, 508 Front End Loader on which Farmers held a second mortgage had been returned to Cit Group/Equipment Financing Incorporated (Cit) \u2014 the holder of a first mortgage on the chattel \u2014 under a written voluntary surrender agreement allegedly executed in St. Martin Parish. Cit is incorporated in New York, has its principal place of business in New Jersey and its Louisiana agent for service of process is located in Orleans Parish. The agreement between Dugas and Cit contained no affidavit by Dugas that the property conveyed was free of encumbrances in favor of any other company. Cit accepted the agreement from Dugas without the affidavit and subsequently sold the property to a third party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1647-5\">Farmers brought suit against Cit in Louisiana state court seeking to recover the outstanding balance of its loan to Dugas on the theory that Cit violated La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:5362 by failing to obtain the required affidavit from Dugas. The action was removed to federal court. Cit then filed a motion to dismiss (or alternatively, for summary judgment) claiming that \u00a7 9:5362 applies only to sales and not a <em>dation en paiement </em>and that the application of \u00a7 9:5362 to a <em>dation en paiement </em>is contrary to the purposes of \u00a7 9:5362. The district court agreed, and granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-9\">At all times relevant hereto<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> La.Rev. StatAnn. \u00a7 9:5362 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1647-10\">It shall be unlawful for a resident of any parish to purchase the movable property described in R.S. 9:5351 from any nonresident of such parish, without first obtaining an affidavit from the nonresident that there is no mortgage on the property, nor any money due for the purchase price thereof, and the purchaser who shall buy the movable property without having obtained the affidavit, shall be personally liable to the creditor for the debt secured by the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1647-11\">The statute is penal in nature, and because it often generates \u201charsh results\u201d serving \u201cquestionable purposes,\u201d we have determined that it must be strictly construed \u201cso that it is effectuated only so far as is necessary to accomplish its intended purpose.\u201d <em>Marshall Nat\u2019l Bank v. Norwel Equip. Co., </em>787 F.2d 1004, 1006 (5th Cir.1986). As we stated in <em>Marshall:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1647-12\">The obvious purpose of the statute is to protect the rights of \u201cthe creditor for the debt secured by the property\u201d by forcing buyers who purchase from sellers not residing in the buyer\u2019s parish \u201cto look for outstanding debt secured by the property and thus protect lenders from losing track of their collateral.\u201d A creditor of debt secured by property cannot practically follow that property around and prevent its unauthorized transfer, especially when it is taken out of the parish wherein the mortgage is recorded. The buyer of such property, however, can easily request a \u00a7 9:5362 affidavit from the seller, and therefore is in a better position to prevent statutory viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>tions than the creditor who will find out about the transfer after the fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1648-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1006-07 (citations omitted); see also, Note, <em>Security Devices-Personal Liability of Third Party Purchasers Under Revised Statutes 9:5362, </em>12 La.L.Rev. 516, 518 (1952) (\u201cOne of the means for achieving [this] purpose is the requirement of an affidavit and the imposition of personal liability on those who fail to obtain it.\u201d). Section 9:5362, by its terms, addresses sales\u2014 the question presented is whether \u00a7 9:5362 is also applicable to a <em>dation en paiement.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court held that \u00a7 9:5362 does not apply to a <em>dation en paiement </em>and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-6\">The parties do not dispute the existence of a <em>dation en paiement </em>in the case at bar. A <em>dation en paiement </em>or \u201cgiving in payment\u201d is defined as \u201can act by which a debtor gives a thing to a creditor, who is willing to receive it, in payment of a sum which is due.\u201d 11 La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 2655. The <em>dation en paiement </em>is the civil law counterpart of \u201caccord and satisfaction\u201d in common law. Comment, <em>The Contract of Dation En Paiement, </em>14 Tulane L.Rev. 263, 265 (1940).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1648-7\">The famous French jurist Pothier drew an analogy between a <em>dation en paiement </em>and a contract of sale \u2014 viewing the thing which is given in payment as akin to the thing sold, and the sum in payment of which the thing is given as the price. <em>Id. </em>at 268. Thus, with limited exceptions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Louisiana Civil Code provides that \u201cthe giving in payment is subject to <em>all the rules </em>which govern the ordinary contract of sale.\u201d 11 La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 2659 (emphasis added). <em>See also Quality Fin. Co. v. Bourque, </em>315 So.2d 656, 658 (La.1975); <em>Succession of Dupre, 218 </em>La. 907, 51 So.2d 317, 320 (1951). The district court conceded that article 2659 presented a \u201cstrong[] argument\u201d for the proposition that a <em>dation en paiement </em>should be treated like sales under \u00a7 9:5362. However, applying a strict construction to \u00a7 9:5362, the district court rejected Farmers\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-11\">We reject the district court\u2019s analysis. Article 2659 clearly states that, with limited exceptions, a <em>dation en paiement </em>shall be governed by the same rules applicable to ordinary contracts of sale. Those rules include \u00a7 9:5362. Thus, \u00a7 9:5362 generally applies to a <em>dation en paiement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1648-12\">Our conclusion is reinforced by a decision of the Louisiana Court of Appeals rendered after the district court\u2019s decision in this case. In <em>City Bank and Trust Co. v. Riley, </em>544 So.2d 114 (La.Ct.App.1989), the Louisiana Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 9:5362 applied to a <em>dation en paiement. </em>The debtor-defendant in <em>Riley </em>borrowed a sum of money from the plaintiff and executed a promissory note secured by a chattel mortgage in favor of the plaintiff which was duly recorded in Natchitoches Parish, the domicile of the mortgagor and mortgagee. Subsequently, in Concordia Parish, the debtor conveyed all of the mortgaged chattel to the co-defendant Hudnall, a resident of Concordia Parish, as a <em>dation en paiement </em>for a debt owed to Hudnall. However, Hudnall failed to obtain an affidavit from the debtor pursuant to \u00a7 9:5362. The Louisiana Court of Appeals determined that Hudnall was a \u201cpurchaser of the mortgaged property\u201d despite the fact that he had obtained it through <em>dation en paiement </em>rather than sale. <em>Id. </em>at 116. Thus, the court determined that \u00a7 9:5362 \u201cclearly applie[d] to the factual situation present[ed]\u201d since \u201c[t]he statute [was] too clear in its meaning to be subject to any interpretation beyond the clear import of its wording.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing in part the trial judge\u2019s written reasons). Applying \u00a7 9:5362 to Hudnall, the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>Hudnall\u2019s failure to obtain the required affidavit from the debtor when he acquired the mortgaged property via <em>dation en \u25a0paiement </em>rendered him personally liable under the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-5\">Next, we must consider whether the application of \u00a7 9:5362 to a <em>dation en paiement </em>is contrary to its purposes. Historically, the attitude of courts toward statutory materials have differed in common law and civil law systems. Dixon, <em>Judicial Method in Interpretation of Law in Louisiana, </em>42 La.L.Rev. 1661 (1982). As 1 La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 1 explains, in Louisiana, \u201c[legislation is the solemn expression of legislative will.\u201d When applying a clear and unambiguous law, courts must remain conscious of the core notions implicated in article 1 and expanded upon by article 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ0\">When a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd consequences the law shall be applied as written and no further interpretation can be made in search of the intent of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1649-6\">1 La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 9. Thus, the Louisiana Court of Appeals in <em>Rada v. Administrator, Div. of Employment Security, </em>319 So.2d 460, 463 (La.Ct.App.), <em>writ, denied, </em>323 So.2d 128 (1975) stated that if the \u201clegislature erred in expressing its intention, it is not the function of the judicial branch to correct such an error, unless the error creates ambiguity.\u201d <em>See also Crescionne v. Louisiana State Police Retirement Bd., </em>455 So.2d 1362, 1364 (La.1984). Constrained as we are by the Louisiana rules of statutory construction, the inquiry thus turns to whether the affidavit requirement of \u00a7 9:5362, as applied generally or specifically to <em>dations en paiement, </em>yields \u201cabsurd consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-7\">We cannot say that every application of \u00a7 9:5362 to a <em>dation en paiement </em>renders absurd results. Therefore, we reject the district court\u2019s blanket holding that \u00a7 9:5362 can never be applied to a <em>dation en paiement </em>because such would run contrary to the purposes of \u00a7 9:5362. Instead, the district court must analyze the facts of this case and determine if the application of \u00a7 9:5362 to the <em>dation en paiement </em>at issue here is absurd in light of the purposes of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-11\">Having determined that \u00a7 9:5362 applies to a <em>dation en paiement, </em>we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of Cit\u2019s motion to dismiss and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1647-6\">. It is undisputed that when Cit accepted the front end loader to extinguish the loan it made to Dugas, the acceptance constituted a <em>dation en paiement </em>(giving in payment) under Louisiana law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1647-13\">. The statute was amended in 1988 by Act 731 of the Louisiana State Legislature. Those amendments have no bearing on this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1648-8\">. This is a question of law subject to de novo review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1648-9\">. It should be noted that a <em>dation en paiement, </em>unlike an accord and satisfaction, cannot be made in settlement of an unliquidated or disputed claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1648-13\">.II La.Civ.Code Ann. art 2655 <em>et seq. </em>For example, a <em>dation en paiement </em>requires actual delivery of the property, unlike a sale. <em>Slaton v. King, </em>214 La. 89, 36 So.2d 648, 650 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1649-8\">.
