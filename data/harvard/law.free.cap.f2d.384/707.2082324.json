Plaintiff has appealed. We reverse as to the claim of damages for the minor\u2019s injury, and affirm as to his claim as assignee of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The minor was injured when struck by defendant\u2019s automobile in June, 1951. He was then four years old and was seventeen years old when this suit was filed September 3, 1964. He claimed damages for his injuries and, as assignee of his parents, for recovery of amounts expended and to be expended for his injuries as well as for loss of his services. Defendant answered December 1, 1964, and, among other things, neither admitted nor denied that the suit was timely within the Illinois statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">On April 11, 1966, defendant moved to dismiss on the ground of laches by prejudicial and inexcusable thirteen year delay in bringing suit and failure of plaintiff to appear for a noticed deposition after delaying for sixteen months. The same day the suit was ordered dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d Plaintiff on April 21 moved to vacate the order. On June 24 it was ordered that the dismissal order \u201cwill stand,\u201d but on July 1 a similar motion was allowed and the cause reinstated. On August 3, 1966, defendant moved to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 22, 1966, the motion was sustained. Judgment of dismissal against plaintiff followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">A transcript of the district court\u2019s oral opinion on ruling on the motion is before us. The court was of the view that the two-year limitation on personal injury actions, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 83, \u00a7 15 (1965), applied here to bar suit because the father, as next friend, could not take advantage of the saving section which permits a minor, if the right accrued during minority, to bring suit within two years after reaching majority. Ill.Rev. Stat. ch. 83, \u00a7 22 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\"> The court\u2019s judgment is erroneous as to the minor\u2019s claim. He could not sue in his own name during his minority, Hoare v. Harris, 11 Ill. 24, 25 (1849), but, although the real party in interest, was required to bring suit by his next friend. Skaggs v. Industrial Comm., 371 Ill. 535, 21 N.E.2d 731, 734 (1939); Waechter v. Industrial Comm., 367 Ill. 256, 11 N.E.2d 378 (1937). Under Illinois law the minor\u2019s right of action lives until two years after he attains his majority, and he may assert it at any time during that period. In re Sheehan\u2019s Estate, 290 Ill.App. 551, 9 N.E.2d 63 (1937); see Desiron v. Peloza, 308 Ill.App. 582, 32 N.E.2d 316 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">We think the court properly dismissed the suit so far as it was based on the claims of the parents, purportedly assigned to the minor. The claims of the parents were subject to the five year limitation on actions contained in Ill. Rev.Stat., ch. 83, \u00a7 16 (1965), and were barred at the time of the assignments. The assignments are therefore a nullity and the claims of the parents cannot be protected under Section 22 which is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>tended to effectuate the Illinois policy of protecting rights of minors. Blanford v. Connery, 16 Ill.App.2d 544, 148 N.E. 2d 824 (1958); In re Sheehan\u2019s Estate, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The judgment is affirmed as to the claims of the parents allegedly assigned to the minor, and the judgment is reversed and remanded as to the suit for the minor\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\">. Briefs were filed for and against the motion to dismiss but plaintiff\u2019s brief was limited to IU.Rev.Stat. eh. 83, \u00a7 22 (1965) in protection of the minor\u2019s claim for personal injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
