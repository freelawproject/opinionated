A collective bargaining contract was entered into between the Company and the Union on December 27, 1962, effective until August 15, 1964, and from year to year thereafter unless either party should give notice of termination or revision. Article VI of said contract entitled \u201cSafety\u201d contained several provisions relative to safe employment practices. The Company also embodied other safety provisions in a 60-page \u201cSafe Work Practices\u201d handbook,. prepared by it and issued to all employees, which provided also for discipline or discharge of employees who violated its provisions. The most recent edition of the handbook was published and distributed on January 2, 1963, and was promulgated unilaterally as were other handbooks previously issued. On April 30, 1963, the Company unilaterally revised its safety rules. On June 3, 1963, the Union wrote the Company that it protested the Company\u2019s action in having on April 30, 1963 unilaterally placed a revised set of safety rules in operation without having bargained on this subject with the Union. The Company replied that it was required by law to provide reasonably safe and healthful places of employment for its employees, to provide compensation for workmen injured in the course of their employment; that this responsbility rested exclusively with it; and that it could not share its obligations with the Union and could not .agree that the Union \u201ctake any part in the formulation of policy in respect to safety procedures or other matters for which it bears no responsibility under the law.\u201d The Union accordingly filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Company which it withdrew shortly thereafter. On June 15, 1964, the Company and the Union notified each other of intention to revise the contract between them. In the Union\u2019s request, \u201cGeneral Asking\u201d No. 8, it sought a meeting to negotiate safety rules during 1964 terms of agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">A number of bargaining sessions were held at which the Union stated that it was concerned about safety and wanted some type or program of cooperation with the Company on safety. The Company replied that it would be glad to discuss safety with the Union but was of the view that it could not delegate its responsibility for promulgating and regularly revising safety rules. After six bargaining sessions the Company steadfastly declined to bargain with reference to the promulgation and revision of safe work practice rules, maintaining that this was exclusively the legal and moral nondelegable responsibility of the Company. The present complaint of unfair labor practice was accordingly filed. The Board held a hearing after which it concluded that the Company\u2019s action in declining to bargain with the Union with respect to safe work practices and/or safety rules violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act. We agree and accordingly order enforcement of the order. It is inescapable that in a public utility electric generating and transmission company the workers, through their chosen representative, should have the right to bargain with the Company in reference to safe work practices. This is not to say that there are not areas where the Company\u2019s obligations to the public are paramount and which may not properly be the subject of an agreement with the Union after a bargaining session is held. Nonetheless, the parties by their own actions in the past have clearly indicated that they consider safety rules and practices a bargainable issue by including several important provisions in Article YI of the contract already referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Mr. Justice Stewart in his concurring opinion in Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 379 U.S. 203, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">\u201cWhat one\u2019s hours are to be, what amount of work is expected during those hours, what periods of relief are available, what safety practices are observed, would all seem conditions of one\u2019s employment.\u201d (379 U.S. at 222, 85 S.Ct. at 409.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Cf. Westinghouse Electric Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 4 Cir., 1966, 369 F.2d 891; N. L. R. B. v. Washington Aluminum Company, 370 U.S. 9, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 298 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">We hold, therefore, in agreement with the Board, that the phrase \u201cother terms and conditions of employment\u201d contained in Section 8(d) of the Act is sufficiently broad to include safety rules and practices which are undoubtedly conditions of employment, and that Section 8(d) requires good faith bargaining as a mutual obligation of the employer and the Union in connection with such matters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">By its failure to bargain with the Union in connection with safety rules and practices, the Company violated the provisions of the Act. The Company\u2019s obligation is, therefore, to bargain in good faith as required by Section 8(d) of the Act. The duty to bargain in good faith requires the parties to confer and negotiate in a genuine effort to reach an agreement if it is possible to do so. N. L. R. B. v. Mayes, 5 Cir., 383 F.2d 242 August 22, 1967, No. 23,710. The Act does not compel agreement. National Labor Relations Bd. v. American Nat. Ins. Co., 343 U.S. 395, 72 S.Ct. 824, 96 L.Ed. 1027 (1952). The Board held, and we agree with its holding, that the Company refused to bargain with the Union relative to safety rules and practices ; that the Company\u2019s contention that in all matters pertaining to safety it was immune from bargaining since safety was a prerogative of management was without merit; and thus that the Company had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-11\">.
