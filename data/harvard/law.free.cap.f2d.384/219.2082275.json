Fontainebleau Hotel Corp., 273 F.2d 720, 80 A.L.R.2d 415 (5 Cir., 1959), Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. v. Crossman, 286 F.2d 926 (5 Cir., 1961), and Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. v. Crossman, 323 F.2d 927 (5 Cir., 1963). See also Crossman v. Fontainebleau Hotel Corp., 346 F.2d 152 (5 Cir., 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-22\">Reference to the opinions in the cases above cited makes a detailed statement of the factual background and the terms of the injunction unnecessary. While we agree with the appellant that the trial court was in error in concluding that Babs could not be in contempt because it was not specifically named in the injunctive decree as one of the parties enjoined,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we feel that there were other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>reasons that justified the court in refusing to hold Babs in contempt. One of them was that Lustig\u2019s conduct following an order of the same trial court in a prior proceeding of this nature refusing to hold Babs in contempt under similar circumstances for violation of this injunctive decree was such as was calculated to lead Babs to believe to its detriment that Lustig acquiesced in that court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-15\">.
