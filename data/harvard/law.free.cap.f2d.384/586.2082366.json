About two weeks later he owed the hotel $165 in room charges. The manager of the hotel called the FBI in reference to the supposed Captain Woodard and, pending arrival of the FBI agents, the manager and his assistant kept Yates preoccupied in conversation, as directed by the FBI officer with whom the manager had spoken. During the time preceding arrival of the FBI agents, Yates signed a check and a personal information questionnaire, this time using two new names.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">When the FBI agents arrived at the office of the hotel they identified themselves to Yates and showed him their credentials. Yates broke and ran to the door, running between the agents, and pulled a revolver from his belt: The two agents laid hold of him. He cried out, \u201cSomeone is going to get shot.\u201d One of the agents succeeded in forcing up Yates\u2019s gun-arm so that the weapon pointed toward the ceiling. After a struggle in which Yates bit the manager, the two agents and the manager disarmed and subdued Yates.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-19\">Yates\u2019s first contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury upon a lesser included offense. Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with [inter alia, any officer or employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation] * * * while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Whoever, in the commission of any such acts uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Yates was charged with assaulting and resisting the agents with a dangerous weapon, but was not charged with the lesser included offense \u2014 assaulting and resisting, but without any weapon. Yates argues that he did not \u201cuse\u201d a weapon; that since the agents tackled him as he pulled the gun, the jury could have found that he resisted the agents <em>without using the revolver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Supreme Court has recently spoken on the necessity of a trial court to charge a defendant with a lesser included offense. In Sansone v. United States, 1965, 380 U.S. 343, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882, the Court held that a lesser-included-offense charge must be given (1) only if the evidence justifies it and (2) only where the charged greater offense requires the jury to find a disputed factual element which is not required for conviction of the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In the present case the uncontradicted testimony of the hotel manager and both FBI agents established that Yates\u2019s only assault or resistance involved his pulling a revolver and shouting \u201cSomeone is going to get shot.\u201d There was no disputed factual element in the case, and we conclude that there is simply no evidence in the record that would support a charge on the lesser offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Parker v. United States, 1966, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 359 F.2d 1009, 1013; Williams v. United States, 1963, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 206, 328 F.2d 178, 179; MacIllrath v. United States, 1951, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 188 F.2d 1009; Burcham v. United States, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 163 F.2d 761, 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The defendant\u2019s use of the weapon started from the instant he made manifest his intention to use it. The law has been called an ass. But it is not such a long-eared equine as to allow Yates to profit from the FBI agents\u2019 success in taking hold of his gun-arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Yates next contends that admission into evidence of his utterances and the two documents he signed during his period of \u201cdetention\u201d by the manager in the hotel office constituted error because he was not properly warned of his rights as required by <em>Miranda. </em>Yates was not in custody at the time, nor was he being questioned by law enforcement officers. <em>Miranda </em>is therefore inapplicable. Evans v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">It is understandable that the defense should stretch <em>Miranda </em>to the breaking point. But even under <em>Miranda </em>a conversation in a hotel office between two unarmed private citizens and a man with a pistol under his belt is not custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">We have considered Yates\u2019s other contentions and find them to be without merit. His conviction in the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. In Broughman v. United States, 1966, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 361 F.2d 71; Hunt v. United States, 1963, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 316 F.2d 652; and Young v. United States, 1962, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 309 F.2d 662, evidence was found that would support a conviction on a lesser offense, and each case was thus reversed and remanded for a new trial with a charge on such offense. In Greenfield v. United States, 1964, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 341 F.2d 411, and Larson v. United States, 10 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 80, the cases were remanded for new trials with charges on the lesser offense because disputes over factual elements that were necessary for .convictions on the greater offenses were found.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
