Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 337 F.2d 127 (1964), the parties to that case executed a new collective bargaining agreement changing, <em>inter alia, </em>the rules with respect to employment of firemen. The 1965 agreement in effect requires Southern to place firemen on 10% of its freight and yard runs in each \u201cseniority district\u201d if such runs are designated by the union. These are referred to as \u201cvetoed jobs,\u201d since to that extent the union may veto the carrier\u2019s decision to dispense with firemen. The agreement further provides: \u201cAll agreements, rules, regulations, interpretations, and practices, however established, with respect to the employment of firemen (helpers) shall continue undisturbed except as modified by the terms of this agreement.\u201d The agreement previously existing between the parties was executed in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">On May 10, 1967, the union filed suit in the District Court alleging that the appellants had committed \u201cdeliberate, systematic and wholesale\u201d violations of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. and the 1959 and 1965 collective bargaining agreements, and seeking \u201cinjunctive and other relief.\u201d Many of the alleged violations relate to 1) the appellants\u2019 failure to place firemen on all \u201cvetoed jobs\u201d and 2) the use of personnel other than firemen for \u201chostling\u201d duties (moving engines short distances in connection with service and repair). With respect to these violations, the nub of the controversy is the union\u2019s contention that the railroad has failed to respect its obligation, under the 1959 and 1965 agreements, to hire a sufficient number of firemen to man the designated runs and to perform \u201chostling\u201d duties. The appellants admit that in about 500 instances firemen were not placed on \u201cvetoed jobs\u201d and on a number of occasions supervisors or other personnel performed \u201chostling\u201d duties. However, they point out that the 500 instances in which firemen were not placed on \u201cvetoed jobs\u201d constitute only 1% of all designated runs since the adoption of the 1965 agreement, and assert that in nearly all those instances the placing of a fireman was made impossible by the existence of an \u201cemergency,\u201d such as last-minute absence of an assigned fireman. Appellants deny that they have an obligation under the agreement to cancel a designated run when use of a fireman is made impossible by unforeseen circumstances. They advance similar arguments with respect to some of the alleged \u201chostling\u201d violations, and contend that other alleged violations did not involve \u201chostling\u201d within the meaning of the agreements. Appellants state that the latter question is now pending in a grievance proceeding before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>National Railroad Adjustment Board. And finally, appellants allege, and the union does not deny, that they hired additional firemen in response to complaints by the union on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In addition to the violations relating to \u201cvetoed jobs\u201d and \u201chostling,\u201d the union alleges that the appellants have violated the agreements by refusing to give examinations for the hiring of firemen and for the promotion of firemen to engineer, and by hiring engineers other than from the ranks of firemen. On the question of examinations, the appellants admit that the 1959 agreement requires examinations to be given to firemen to determine suitability for retention, by examinations given within a year after hiring, and for their promotion to engineer. Appellants allege, however, that no such examinations have been given since 1958, and therefore under the \u201cpractices, however established\u201d language of the 1965 agreement, examinations are no longer required. They also contend that no promotions from fireman to engineer have been made since 1966 because there were no qualified firemen to fill the positions. The union admits that under a provision of the 1959 agreement the railroad may hire engineers other than from the ranks of firemen, but alleges that the uniform practice until 1966 was to fill all engineer vacancies by promoting firemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Following a hearing, at which both parties submitted affidavits and other documentary evidence, and the union in addition called several witnesses, the District Court granted the union\u2019s motion for a Preliminary Injunction. In addition to enjoining the alleged violations discussed above, the court enjoined the appellants from \u201cfailing or refusing to meet and treat with the [plaintiff] or to exert every effort in good faith to resolve any disputes which may have arisen or which may arise with the [plaintiff].\u201d Appellants have now requested that the order of the District Court be suspended pending its appeal therefrom, under Rule 11 of the General Rules of this Court and Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">It is true, of course, that this court will not ordinarily disturb the order of the District Court granting or denying a preliminary injunction except for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d or \u201cclear error.\u201d Maas v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 251, 371 F.2d 348 (1966); Young v. Motion Picture Association of America, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 299 F.2d 119, cert. denied, 370 U.S. 922, 82 S.Ct. 1565, 8 L.Ed. 2d 504 (1962). It is also true that \u201cordinarily this court will not consider the merits of the case further than necessary to determine whether that discretion was abused.\u201d Young v. Motion Picture Association of America, Inc., supra, 112 U.S.App.D.C. at 37, 299 F.2d at 121. We must take these principles into account, of course, in determining whether appellants have made such a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that they are \u201clikely to prevail on the merits\u201d as to warrant staying the order of the District Court. Va. Petroleum Job Association v. FPC, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 106, 259 F.2d 921 (1958). Where, as here, we believe there is substantial doubt whether the District Court had jurisdiction to grant part of the relief afforded, we think that, as to that portion of its order, such a showing has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The parties seem generally agreed that the question whether the District Court had power to enjoin the alleged violations of the 1959 and 1965 agreements depends primarily on whether a \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d dispute is involved. If the controversy is a \u201cminor\u201d dispute, the District Court had jurisdiction only to the extent that injunctive relief might be required to preserve the <em>status quo </em>pending resolution of the controversy by the National Railroad Adjustment Board. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. R., 363 U.S. 528, 80 S.Ct. 1326, 4 L.Ed.2d 1379 (1960). Thus, if a \u201cminor\u201d dispute is presented the District Court exceeded its authority for two reasons: 1) rather than enjoining alteration of the <em>status quo, </em>the court\u2019s order requires the appellants to make numerous significant changes in present practices, some of which are al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>legedly of long standing; and 2) there is no proceeding pending before the National Railroad Adjustment Board, and thus no basis for the assertion of jurisdiction by the District Court. Manion v. Kansas City Terminal Ry., 353 U.S. 927, 77 S.Ct. 706, 1 L.Ed.2d 722 (1957) (per curiam); Westchester Lodge 2186 v. Railway Express Agency, 329 F.2d 748 (2d Cir. 1964); Hilbert v. Pennsylvania R. R., 290 F.2d 881 (7th Cir. 1961) cert. denied, 368 U.S. 900, 82 S.Ct. 174, 7 L.Ed. 2d 96 (1961). On the other hand, the District Court clearly had jurisdiction to enjoin unilateral attempts by the appellants to modify the existing agreement without following statutory procedures, if the dispute is \u201cmajor.\u201d Southern Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 337 F.2d 127 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The difference between \u201cminor\u201d disputes, over which the National Railroad Adjustment Board has exclusive jurisdiction, and \u201cmajor\u201d disputes, the procedures for resolution of which are prescribed in \u00a7 6 of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 156, can be set forth succinctly: \u201cMajor\u201d disputes relate to the formation of new agreements or modification of existing agreements; \u201cminor\u201d disputes relate to the interpretation or application of existing agree-</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">ments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This distinction, however, like many others in the law, is more easily stated than applied. The problem, of course, is drawing the line between disagreements over contract terms and unilateral attempts to amend the agreement. If the railroad took action which it admitted was not in conformity with the existing agreement there would be no question that a \u201cmajor dispute\u201d was involved; and the same result necessarily obtains where the railroad\u2019s claimed justification is without any reasonable basis in the contract. United Industrial Workers v. Board of Trustees, 351 F.2d 183 (5th Cir. 1965). But we think that, where the railroad asserts a defense based on the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreement, the controversy may not be termed a \u201cmajor\u201d dispute unless the claimed defense is so obviously insubstantial as to warrant the inference that it is raised with intent to circumvent the procedures prescribed by \u00a7 6 for alteration of existing agreements. Even conceding, <em>arguendo, </em>that it could be found on the record below that the railroad\u2019s contentions with respect to what is required of it under the 1959 and 1965 agreements are so inherently unreasonable as to amount to bad faith,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we entertain substantial doubt that the District Court made this essential finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the absence of such a finding, we do not think the District Court was authorized to enjoin \u201ccontract violations.\u201d The doctrine discussed above in effect elevates the concept of exhaustion of administrative remedies to a jurisdictional plane in requiring judicial abstention from labor disputes that may only involve interpretive questions reserved for the Adjustment Board. Because we think that there is a strong likelihood that appellants will successfully demonstrate on appeal that the District Court, on the basis of its findings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not have jurisdiction to restrain the alleged violations of the 1959 and 1965 agreements, and because it is claimed with some show of reason, and not seriously contested, that the court\u2019s order would subject the carriers to substantial expense and inconvenience in the interim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we suspend those portions of the District Court\u2019s order which purport to require compliance with the 1959 and 1965 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">As mentioned earlier, paragraph (i) of the District Court\u2019s order restrains the appellants from \u201cfailing or refusing to meet and treat with the [plaintiff] or to exert every effort in good faith to resolve any disputes which may have arisen or which may arise with the [plaintiff].\u201d Paragraph (h) enjoins appellants from \u201cfailing or refusing to recognize the [plaintiff] as the collective bargaining representative of all their employees in the class or craft of Firemen and from any conduct based on the assumption that any individual Fireman must or should make some request or initiate some action of his own, independent of the [plaintiff], to obtain any qualification or promotion or any other right or privilege provided or secured by the 1959 or 1965 Agreements.\u201d These paragraphs were based primarily on the court\u2019s findings to the effect that 1) Southern\u2019s Vice President for Labor Relations had shown a marked reluctance to meet and talk with the union\u2019s representatives or even to answer their letters; and 2) that the railroad had insisted on compliance with grievance procedures in situations where such compliance was impossible and inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Section 2 First of the Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 First, imposes on the carrier, its officers, agents and employees the duty \u201cto exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that a federal court may issue an injunction to compel compliance by the employer with the requirements of \u00a7 2 First. Virginian Ry. v. System Federation, No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, 57 S.Ct. 592, 81 L.Ed. 789 (1937). The language of that section (\u201call disputes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise\u201d) leaves little doubt that it applies to \u201cminor\u201d as well as \u201cmajor\u201d disputes. We therefore conclude that the appellants have not made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that they are likely to prevail, on appeal, on the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the requirements of paragraphs (h) and (i). Accordingly, we decline to suspend the operation of those two paragraphs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">. The Supreme Court has described the difference as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">The first [class of controversy] relates to disputes over the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them. They arise whenever there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one, and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy. They look to the acquisition of rights for the future, not to the assertion of rightsjelaimed to have vested in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">The second class, however, contemplates the existence of a collective bargaining agreement already concluded or, at any rate, a situation in which no effort is made to bring about a formal change in terms or to create a new one. The dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">situation or to an omitted case. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">In either case the claim is to rights accrued, not merely to have new ones created for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av-\">Elgin J. &amp; E. Ry. Co. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 723, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886 (1945).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-13\">. Amplification of the record may be necessary in order to determine whether there is any substance to appellants\u2019 contentions. We contemplate that the trial court will proceed expeditiously to a trial on the merits and that the parties will cooperate in this endeavor rather than continue their appellate contest over the preliminary injunction. At any rate, we think the District Court had an obligation to stay its hand until it had sufficient facts to warrant at least a determination that it probably had jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\">. The District Court did find that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFY\">Southern has sought, through its pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tern of violation, to change the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions of its Firemen as a class, as embodied in the 1959 and 1965 Agreements, without utilizing or initiating the procedures or following the manner prescribed in either the said Agreements or Section 6 of the Act for change or modification of such Agreements, in violation of Section 2 Seventh of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">This finding, however, amounts to little more than the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that a \u201cmajor\u201d dispute was present. (In this respect, it is significant that it is found in the Conclusions of Law rather than the court\u2019s Findings of Fact.) It provides no indication whether the judge\u2019s conclusion was erroneously based simply on his view that the contract, as interpreted by him, had been violated, or correctly premised on a finding that the railroad\u2019s claimed defenses were so utterly without substance as to warrant an inference of bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b382-11\">. The transcript of the testimony before the trial court is riot available for consideration in connection with this motion to stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b382-12\">. What the plaintiff union stresses is that the inconvenience and expense to the carriers is far outweighed by the substantial impairment, from the stay of the injunction, to the interest of the union and the class of firemen to be hired and promoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
