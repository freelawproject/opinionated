The issue was determined and decided against appellant by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in an interference proceeding, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1067<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rule 2.96 of the Trademark Rules of Practice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-26\">Appellant (referred to below as \u201cGuiding Eyes\u201d), and appellee (referred to below as \u201cGuide Dog\u201d), have used the mark in issue in connection with their respective activities relating to the training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>and use of guide dogs for the blind.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Testimony was taken by both parties and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board awarded the right to register the mark to appellee, 146 USPQ 611 (TTAB 1965). Appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Appellant concedes that appellee was the first to use the mark, but argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\"><em>* * * </em>However, as the record will show the question of first use is not, of itself, the primary issue in this case. Rather, the sole issue to be determined is whether or not Appellee, who was admittedly the first user of this term, forfeited its rights in the mark by its failure over a period of years to use the mark in a manner calculated to identify Appellee as the source of the services offered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The board held that appellee had not abandoned the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">The Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, provides, in pertinent part, that a mark shall be deemed to be \u201cabandoned\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASO4\">(a) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Non-use for two consecutive years shall be prima facie abandonment. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">No issue is raised as to appellee\u2019s exclusive and prior use of the mark for the period extending from on or about July 4, 1949 to September 1955. During this period, the record establishes that appellee used the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d and the design of a dog\u2019s head on its letterheads and promotional material, as well as on its guide dog harnesses. The mark also was shown on a sign on its training center property and on signs in its offices. The mark was being used in 1952 when a documentary film entitled \u201cSECOND SIGHT,\u201d was produced in cooperation with appellee. This picture was shown in RKO Theaters throughout the country to publicize the training and use of guide dogs for the blind. Appellee purchased six of these films for its own use in soliciting contributions from the general public. Later, a second film having the same title and showing the services of appellee was produced by Gaines Dog Research Center and this film was being shown before groups of persons throughout the country as late as 1964. Both films include pictures of the sign at appellee\u2019s training center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">The success of the films caused appellee to consider adoption of the mark \u201cSECOND SIGHT\u201d for its services. Appellee\u2019s executive committee in a meeting in September 1955 discussed this matter, for the minutes of that meeting show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVHG\">The use of \u201cSecond Sight\u201d was discussed, and it was agreed that \u201cGuiding Eyes\u201d be continued with \u201cSecond Sight\u201d interjected wherever feasible in publicity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">It is appellant\u2019s position that, following this executive committee action in September 1955, appellee abandoned the mark in issue by replacing it with the mark \u201cSECOND SIGHT.\u201d Thus, it is appellant\u2019s contention that when it adopted and began use of the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d in November 1956, it was free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">Appellant, as the junior party, had the burden of proving appellee\u2019s abandonment of the mark. Appellant\u2019s evidence consists of the testimony of various witnesses, together with some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>documentary material. In summary, this evidence is that one witness, who had voluntarily performed public relations services for appellee in connection with the mark \u201cSECOND SIGHT\u201d for several years in the late 1950\u2019s, stated that he had never seen the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d on any of appellee\u2019s literature and had no knowledge of its use of such term. Another of appellant\u2019s witnesses was a blind person who testified in effect that she was presently using one of appellee\u2019s guide dogs, and at some undisclosed time in the past, had used guide dogs procured from appellant. She then stated that she only knew of appellee by the name \u201cSECOND SIGHT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Appellant also offered documentary evidence of appellee\u2019s use of the mark \u201cSECOND SIGHT\u201d on its letterheads, news . releases, newsletters, advertisements, book marks and membership cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Appellee\u2019s evidence establishes \u2019 that during the period from 1946-1949, it maintained a training center for guide dogs at Woodside, New York, on which it placed a conspicuous sign with the wording \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d above the representation of a dog\u2019s head. In 1950, it moved its training center to Smith-town, Long Island, and this sign was moved to a location adjacent to the new training center. The sign remained in this location until the middle of 1955 when it was moved to the interior of appellee\u2019s property where the sign has remained from that time until the present. This sign is shown in the two documentary films which were being shown in 1964. In addition, appellee\u2019s testimony \u2022establishes that door placques or plastic .signs showing the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d have been used continuously on appellee\u2019s administrative offices in Forest Hills, New York, since the middle 1950\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Appellee also took the testimony of .several blind persons who have, at one time or another, used its services. These persons testified in effect that to them \u201cGUIDING EYES,\u201d \u201cSECOND SIGHT,\u201d and \u201cGuide Dog Foundation for the Blind\u201d are all terms by which appellee had been and was, at the time of the testimony, being identified. All were familiar with the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d because they had been made aware that this mark was embossed on the harnesses and used on the identification tags for their guide dogs. Throughout the entire period, the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d also was used on the identification cards supplied to blind persons using appellee\u2019s guide dogs. When Mrs. Stephens\u2019 testimony was taken in June 1964, she produced the same dog harness which had been given to her by appellee in 1955 with her guide dog \u201cDutchess.\u201d \u201cDutchess\u201d had died about a year prior to her testimony (apparently sometime in 1963) but the harness which Mrs. Stephens produced and which had been in use until the death of \u201cDutchess\u201d had the legend \u201cGuiding Eyes, Forest Hills, N.Y.\u201d embossed on the handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">The board found that the appellee had presented a prima facie showing it was the first user of the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d and that the mark had been used continuously to identify its services. It found that appellee never had intended to abandon the mark although it had used \u201cSECOND SIGHT\u201d on its letterheads and other written materials since 1956. The board particularly pointed out that <em>no period of actual non-use </em>by appellee had been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">We have considered the facts of record in the light of the foregoing portion of the statutory definition of abandonment and agree with the board that an abandonment arising from appellee\u2019s alleged <em>discontinuance </em>of the mark \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d has not been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">The Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, also recognizes that \u201cabandonment\u201d may arise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-11\">(b) When any course of conduct of the registrant, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as an indication of origin. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">As the issue is here framed, appellee\u2019s conduct is relevant to that issue only as it bears on the question of its abandonment of the mark. The board found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>appellee\u2019s use of \u201cGUIDING EYES\u201d over the years had been sufficient in nature to maintain this term as an identifying mark of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The record as a whole does not show that appellee\u2019s \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d had <em>caused </em>the mark \u201cto lose its significance as an indication of origin.\u201d This defect in the record is not cured by appellant\u2019s reliance on the equitable principles of laches, estoppel and acquiescence under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1069. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 it is necessary to establish that the conduct of appellee was such as to cause a loss in significance of its mark as an indication of origin. The present record fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Under these circumstances, we agree with the decision of the board that appellant failed to establish abandonment of the mark by appellee, and thus failed to discharge its burden of proving priority of its right to register the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">For the foregoing reasons and to the extent indicated, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1070-16\">. \u00a7 <em>1067.

The application of the appellee (senior party), Serial No. 119,125, was filed May 2, 1961 for \u201cGuilding Eyes,\u201d and asserts use since on or about July 4, 1949. The application of the appellant (junior party), Serial No. 143,228, was filed April 27, 1962 for the service mark \u201cGuilding Eyes for the Blind, Inc.\u201d and design and asserts use since November 1956. While there is a variation in the precise wording of the applications as to the nature of the services rendered, each of the parties is involved in rendering the same types of services, i. e., training guide dogs for the blind and in training blind persons in the use of such dogs. No issue has been raised by the parties concerning differenees in the marks, the parties apparently conceding that \u201cGuilding Eyes\u201d is the dominant feature of both marks. Each party is a charitable non-profit organization whose principal income is derived from tax-exempt charitable gifts,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
