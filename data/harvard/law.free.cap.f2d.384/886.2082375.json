The writ was denied without a hearing, and this appeal was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">Petitioner has alleged that an eyewitness, important to the case against him, initially had failed to identify petitioner in a police line-up, and that the State suppressed this information at the trial. He further alleged that that witness\u2019 subsequent identification of petitioner was the result of \u201cprompting\u201d from the State\u2019s attorney. The petitioner also asserted that the State had withheld tape recordings of conflicting statements made by prosecution witnesses, as well as expert opinion that would have favored the defense. There is no recorded transcript of the trial. Petitioner previously has been unsuccessful in seeking habeas corpus in the courts of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\"> The deliberate suppression by the State of evidence favorable to a defendant would constitute a denial of due process. Alcorta v. State of Texas, 1957, 355 U.S. 28, 78 S.Ct. 103, 2 L.Ed.2d 9; Ashley v. State of Texas, 5 Cir. 1963, 319 F.2d 80; United States ex rel. Thompson v. Dye, 3 Cir. 1955, 221 F.2d 763. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Similarly, the knowing use of perjured testimony would be a denial of due process. Alcorta v. State of Texas, supra; Ashley v. State of Texas, supra; United States v. Rutkin, 3 Cir. 1954, 212 F.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Petitioner\u2019s allegations, if proven, would entitle him to release from his present custody. Mooney v. Holohan, 1935, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791. He must be given the opportunity to establish the truth of the circumstances alleged. This case, therefore, must be remanded for a plenary hearing in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
