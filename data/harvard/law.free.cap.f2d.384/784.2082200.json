Although the hearing examiner recommended that the application be granted, the Appeals Council, on its own motion, reviewed the decision of the hearing examiner and determined that James was not entitled to a determination of a period of disability or to disability insurance benefits. An appeal was taken to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, which affirmed the decision of the Appeals Council. No further appeal to this court was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>At issue in those proceedings was the question of whether James was \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the then statute, on or before December 31, 1959.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was not disputed then, and it is not disputed now, that James\u2019 insured status expired December 31, 1959. The Appeals Council determined that, on or before December 31, 1959, James did not have heart disease, and that his claimed sinusitis, arthritis, gastro-intestinal problems (including an ulcer), pulmonary difficulties, psychoneurosis, and loss of vision were not sufficiently severe to render him unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity. The Appeals Council also found that James\u2019 ulcer could be remedied by surgery, and that there were no medical contraindications to ulcer surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On June 22, 1965, James filed another claim for a determination of disability and disability benefits, alleging \u201cblindness, emphysema, fibrosis of both lungs, chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, duodenal ulcer, arthritis and nervous disorder,\u201d in short, the sqine complaints that had been litigated in the earlier proceeding and decided adversely to him. After initial denial of his application, James requested a hearing and, apparently acting in accordance with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Secretary granted a reopening of the case to determine whether James was under a disability as defined in the Social Security Act, either before or after the 1965 amendment. The matter was heard by a trial examiner, who ruled that, in view of the modification of the law by Public Law 89-97, 79 Stat. 286, which amended the statutory definitions of \u201cdisability,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the only issue before him was one of the duration of James\u2019 disability. The trial examiner, whose decision became that of the Secretary, reviewed the evidence adduced at the prior hearing and three additional medical records \u2014the first, a doctor\u2019s report, dated December 14, 1965, setting forth the results of eye examinations made in 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1965; the second, another doctor\u2019s report, dated June 17, 1962, setting forth the results of eye examinations made in 1962, as well as referring to James\u2019 ulcer and certain allergic conditions; and the third, a hospital report, dated May 25, 1964, consisting of a discharge summary which reflected a severe generalized urticaria (allergic skin reaction), verified duodenal ulcer, retinopathy in the left eye and absence of the right eye. The trial examiner concluded that James was insured under the Act only until December 31, 1959, that the decision of the Appeals Council, issued April 22, 1963, was <em>res judicata </em>as to the severity of James\u2019 impairments through July 13, 1960, that James had not, prior to December 31, 1959, been disabled from engaging in substantial gainful employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ment by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which could be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration, or to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, and that James was not entitled to disability insurance benefits or a period of disability under the provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">A second appeal to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia was taken. The district judge affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision, on the grounds that the 1965 amendment to the Social Security Act did not relate to the definition of what was a disability, but only to the period of time that a disability, if established, must be likely to endure before a claimant is entitled to benefits, that James was found not to be disabled in the earlier proceeding, and there was no evidence in the second proceeding that James\u2019 condition was any worse prior to December 31, 1959 than had been earlier shown, and that the earlier decision of the district court was <em>res judicata </em>of the present proceeding. James now appeals from the district judge\u2019s second affirmance of the denial of benefits. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In Carter v. Celebrezze, 367 F.2d 382 (4 Cir. 1966), we had occasion to point out \u201c * * * that the 1965 amendments have not altered the requirement that a claimant must establish that he has become \u2018disabled\u2019 <em>prior to the expiration' of his insured status.\u201d </em>Id., p. 384. Implicit in that decision, and in Brown v. Celebrezze, 367 F.2d 455 (4 Cir. 1966), is tne holding that the 1965 amendments only altered the period of time that a disability, if established, must be likely to endure before the plaintiff was entitled to benefits; but that they did not change the required severity of the physical or mental impairments constituting \u201cdisability,\u201d as distinguished from their duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Our examination of the record of the proceedings instituted by James in 1960 satisfies us that the question of what physical or mental impairments were suffered by James prior to December 31,1959 and whether they were sufficiently severe to constitute \u201cdisability\u201d was fully litigated, and that, in 1965, his claim for a determination of disability and disability benefits was the same as his 1960 claim. Ordinarily, a final determination by the Secretary that the physical and mental impairments claimed in 1960 were not sufficiently severe to constitute \u201cdisability\u201d was, as the trial examiner and the district judge both decided, <em>res judicata </em>of the 1965 claim. Hobby v. Hodges, 215 F.2d 754 (10 Cir. 1954); Phillip v. Ribicoff, 211 F.Supp. 510 (E.D.Pa.1962), aff\u2019d sub nom., Phillip v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 530 (3 Cir. 1963); Moore v. Celebrezze, 252 F.Supp. 593 (E.D.Pa.1966). Certainly, the district judge\u2019s affirmance of the Secretary\u2019s denial of the 1960 claim was <em>res judicata </em>of a reapplication in 1965 based upon facts and matters theretofore litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\">. Sections 216(i) and 223(c) (2), as they existed prior to 1965, defined \u201cdisability\u201d to mean \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment <em>which can he expected to result in death or to he of long-continued and indefinite duration.\" </em>(emphasis supplied) 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) and 423 (c) (2). The 1965 amendment substituted the phrase \u201cwhich has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months,\u201d for the italicized phrase in the previous sections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">.
