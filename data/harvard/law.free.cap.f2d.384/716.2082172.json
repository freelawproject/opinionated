He seeks to attack a 1949 judgment of conviction for violation of the Federal Firearms Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(e), for which he served a sentence of thirty days\u2019 imprisonment, after having waived counsel and indictment and having pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-22\">On a former appeal this court remanded the matter for a hearing on the issues of whether appellant\u2019s guilty plea was induced by promises of the United States Attorney of a suspended sentence and whether he was advised by the court of the seriousness of the offense with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">Pursuant to the mandate of this court, an evidentiary hearing was held at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>appellant, assisted by counsel, testified. The former Assistant United States Attorney, who had been assigned to the matter and who was present at the arraignment and sentencing of appellant in 1949, also testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The court below found from the evidence and the record of proceedings at the 1949 sentencing that appellant\u2019s assertions were not maintained and consequently denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
