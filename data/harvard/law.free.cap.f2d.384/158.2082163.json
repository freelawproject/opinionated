He here complains that the trial court erred in permitting the Government witnesses to testify that there were no stamps on the jugs instead of producing the jugs as the best evidence. This was not error, Burney v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 339 F.2d 91; Dicks v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-24\">It is next contended that the Court should have, in effect, instructed the jury that the defendant was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>guilty by reason of entrapment, further that objections should not have been sustained to the form of some of the questions sought to be propounded on behalf of appellant with reference to alleged entrapment. We are of the view that the evidence in this case presented a typical jury issue as to entrapment and that no other reversible errors appear in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
