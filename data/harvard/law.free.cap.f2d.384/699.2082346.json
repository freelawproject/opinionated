The trial, before Judge Mansfield and a jury, did not begin until February 1967, but no complaint is made on that score. The jury found Cohen guilty on the first three counts but was unable to agree on the other four which related to occasions when, on Novak\u2019s testimony, Cohen was not present at the passing of the money although some was destined for him. The \u00a1judge imposed a concurrent six months\u2019 '\u00a1sentence on the three counts and a $5000 .fine on one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Novak testified that he first made payments to Cohen and Donahue in 1955 when, his company having received a contract for a location within Local 2\u2019s jurisdiction, he wished to cut some of the pipe at his union shop in Brooklyn rather than on the job and not to experience any \u201cdelays\u201d on that account. In 1957, having been awarded another contract within Local 2\u2019s territory, he sought the two men out to make a similar arrangement ; after some negotiation as to terms, agreement was reached on a figure of 2% of-the contract price as against 1%% on the .earlier occasion. Novak recounted that his procedure was to instruct his bookkeeper, Miss Farb, to place a certain amount of money in envelopes, marked JC and JD, which he would then give to one or the other or both. She testified she would add an appropriate amount to checks drawn for payroll and expenses, put the excess cash in the safe, and then place it in the envelopes. She kept records showing the dates on which the envelopes were prepared, the addressees, the amounts of the payments and the identity of the construction jobs to which they related. Compare United States v. Schabert, 362 F.2d 369 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 919, 87 S.Ct. 230, 17 L.Ed.2d 143 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">There is no merit to Cohen\u2019s claim that since all payments were made pursuant to a single agreement the Government should have been limited to one count. While the statute condemns the agreement, it likewise makes each receipt or acceptance a separate crime. Such is the teaching of the case law, United States v. Alaimo, 297 F.2d 604 (3 Cir. 1961) (Goodrich, J.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 817, 82 S.Ct. 829, 7 L.Ed.2d 784 (1962); United States v. Keegan, 331 F.2d 257 (7 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 828, 85 S.Ct. 57, 13 L.Ed.2d 37 (1964), and we agree with it. United States v. Universal CIT Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 73 S.Ct. 227, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1944), on which appellant relies, has received rather limited application beyond the specific situation there presented. See United States v. Guterma, 281 F.2d 742, 752-753 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 871, 81 S.Ct. 114, 5 L.Ed.2d 93 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Cohen\u2019s evidentiary objections are equally unsubstantial. The 1955 agreement was admissible as the inception of the very course of dealing pursued in the crime charged. If the Government had been forced to start with the 1957 conversation, the jury would have obtained \u201conly a truncated version of what was claimed to have occurred,\u201d United States v. Bozza, 365 F.2d 206, 213-214 (2 Cir. 1966). See also United States v. Deaton, 381 F.2d 114 (2 Cir. 1967); United States v. Johnson, 382 F.2d 280 (2 Cir. 1967). The claim that Novak\u2019s testimony as to his instructions to Miss Farb was inadmissible rests upon the strange \u201cnotion that evidentiary use of anything emerging from the mouth is banned unless it comes within an exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d United States v. Nuccio, 373 F.2d 168, 174 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 906, 87 S.Ct. 1688, 18 L.Ed.2d 623 (1967). The notion, as we there said, \u201cis as fallacious as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>durable\u201d; Novak\u2019s statement that he instructed his bookkeeper to get and give him the money is no more hearsay than testimony that he had obtained the cash without an intermediary would have been. Miss Farb\u2019s lists of payments were admissible under the Business Records Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732, see United States v. Re, 336 F.2d 306, 311-314 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 904, 85 S.Ct. 188, 13 L.Ed.2d 177 (1964); the evidence in this case as to the manner in which the lists were compiled overcomes whatever doubts were intimated about admissibility of these records in United States v. Schabert, supra, 362 F.2d at 371-372. Moreover the lists were also receivable as past recollection recorded. 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 734-755 (3 ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Appellant\u2019s criticisms of the trial judge are so unfounded that detailed comment would be misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
