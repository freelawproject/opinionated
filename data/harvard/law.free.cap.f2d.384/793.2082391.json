Gatlin et al. v. Mitchell, Secretary of Labor, 5th Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 76, cert. den. 366 U.S. 963, 81 S.Ct. 1925, 6 L.Ed.2d 1255. On application of the Secretary of Labor the district court found that the record-keeping provisions of the injunctive order had not been complied with and the appellants were found guilty of civil contempt with a fine of $500.00 being imposed. While there may be something to be desired in the findings of the district court, it clearly appears that the time records did not accurately reflect the time worked by a number of the employees and that the district court so found. This being so, it follows that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
