Named as defendants are the State of Maryland^ the Attorney General of Maryland, the Maryland State Board of Education, the National Education Association, the Maryland State Teachers\u2019 Association, and the Prince George\u2019s County Teachers\u2019 Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">The plaintiff, Ray Elbert Parker, a probationary public school teacher of psychology at the Northwestern Senior High School in Prince George\u2019s County, had previously brought an action against the County Board of Education, challenging their termination of his contract of employment. Parker v. Bd. of Educ., 237 F.Supp. 222 (D.Md.), aff\u2019d per curiam, 348 F.2d 464 (4th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1030, 86 S.Ct. 653, 15 L.Ed.2d 543 (1966). There, as in the present action, he alleged that on March 15, 1963, he was informed by the principal of Northwestern that a parent had objected to Parker\u2019s assigning to his class the book entitled Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and had demanded that the plaintiff be removed from the school. On March 26, according to plaintiff, he was advised by the principal, in the presence of members of the County Board of Education, that because of the parent\u2019s complaint, his contract would be terminated at the conclusion of the school year. The plaintiff requested a statement of the charges and a hearing with opportunity to rebut the charges, but the County Board did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">The plaintiff had been employed pursuant to a standard probationary teacher\u2019s contract, which provided that either party had the right to terminate the contract at the end of the first or second school year by giving thirty days\u2019 notice in writing during the month of June or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>July.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s contract was officially terminated by the County Board of Education on July 2, 1963 without a hearing. The plaintiff\u2019s contention in both the prior and the present action is that termination of his contract without a hearing is \u201carbitrary and capricious and in contravention of his right to free expression under the First Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The issue having once been raised and decided,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> considerations of <em>res judicata </em>would prevent us from considering these allegations on a second action against the same party. Plaintiff has brought essentially the same suit seeking the same relief <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but against <em>different </em>defendants: the State of Maryland, the Attorney General of Maryland, the State Board of Education, and three teachers\u2019 associations. The County Board of Education is not a defendant here. We need not determine, however, whether to depart from the doctrine of mutuality and hold that regardless of the lack of privity, plaintiff is barred by a plea of <em>res judicata </em>from litigating the same matters in a second suit. The District Court correctly concluded on other grounds that the plaintiff could not maintain his action against any of the present defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">With respect to the State of Maryland, the District Court found that the complaint made no allegations that plaintiff\u2019s rights have been violated by any act of the State, and that even if there were such allegations, suit would clearly be barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and by the Eleventh Amendment, citing Hans v. State of Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), which read that amendment as barring a suit by a state\u2019s own citizens as well as by citizens of another state. Nor were there any allegations of acts undertaken or threatened by the Attorney General of Maryland under the Public School Laws which would affect plaintiff. Cf. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), and Greene v. Louisville &amp; Interurban R. R., 244 U.S. 499, 37 S.Ct. 673, 61 L.Ed. 1280 (1917). There were also no allegations of any actions taken by the State Board of Education which have infringed the plaintiff\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Additionally, the complaint failed to state a claim against the teachers\u2019 associations which would entitle the plaintiff to relief. These organizations are not charged with any affirmative acts, but merely with failure to seek repeal of the Maryland laws providing for probationary status for new teachers or to aid the plaintiff in his dispute with the County School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\"><em>. </em>If a teacher is suspended or dismissed for cause at any time <em>during </em>the school year, that teacher, even if probationary, has the right to a hearing and an appeal to the State Superintendent. Md.Code Art. 77, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 102 (1965 Replacement Vol.); Parker v. Bd. of Educ., 237 F.Supp. 222 (D.Md.1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-19\">. Parker v.
