There were two jury trials. In the first, the jury rendered a verdict against appellee, awarding appellant $47,224.70. The court then denied appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict but granted its motion for a new trial on the ground that the court had misinstructed the jury on what it could consider in deciding whether or not the crossing was \u201cunusually dangerous.\u201d In the second trial the jury found for appellee. Appellant contends: (1) That it was error for the court to grant a new trial and (2) that the jury was coerced by the court into arriving at a verdict in the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The accident occurred at about 11:80 p. m. on June 8, 1963, at the point in Arkansas City where \u201cD\u201d Street crosses the Midland Valley Railroad tracks. Appellant, a three-year old boy, was riding in the back seat of a car driven by his mother and going south down \u201cD\u201d Street when it ran into appellee\u2019s train. \u201cD\u201d Street is a north-south street and the Midland Valley tracks run in a east-west direction at the crossing. The evidence indicated that at the time of the accident, appellee\u2019s engine, moving backwards, was slowly (from 1 to 4 miles an hour) pushing a box car westward across \u201cD\u201d Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">A pertinent fact here is the location of a city street light on \u201cD\u201d Street 132 feet north of the railroad tracks where the collision occurred. There are six sets of tracks at this crossing and the area is flat. A small canal bridge is located between the first two and the last four sets of tracks approaching from the north. There is another street light located south of the tracks on \u201cD\u201d Street. As approached from the north the train was on the third of the six sets of tracks, which is 35 feet south of the canal bridge. To the northeast of the crossing is one Santa Fe rail yard and to the southeast another. These yards are connected by tracks which run parallel to \u201cD\u201d Street 280 feet east of it. There are numerous tracks at each of the Santa Fe yards and the evidence established that there is a great deal of railroad activity in the whole area and that whistles had been blowing and bells ringing all evening June 8, although appellant\u2019s mother gave no testimony that she was distracted by the noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Appellant\u2019s mother, shortly after the accident and later in a deposition, said she was traveling 45 or 50 miles per hour. At the time of the trial she testified that after that deposition had been taken she had performed an experiment at the crossing with another car, that she did not know \u201cabout speeds and that she now felt she was traveling 35 miles per hour, or maybe a little more.\u201d Mrs. Adamson applied her brakes prior to the collision, left skid marks in excess of 60 feet in length and her car skidded sideways before striking the engine. At the point of impact, \u201cD\u201d Street is approximately 21 feet wide. The box car that had already passed through the intersection was 45 feet long and the engine 56 feet 9 inches long. The point of impact was approximately 32 to 44 feet from the west end of the engine. There was no flagman on the north side of the tracks at the time the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Appellant first contends that the instruction to the jury enumerating what it could consider in determining whether the crossing was unusually dangerous was proper in all respects and that the court erred in setting aside the first verdict. Appellee, in supporting the result of the trial court\u2019s action, contends that it was entitled to a directed verdict in the first trial and that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>lant thus cannot complain about the court setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial. In making this position appellee relies on Kansas\u2019 well-recognized \u201coccupied crossing\u201d rule which dictates that \u201cordinarily the presence of a train on a crossing is of itself an adequate warning to a driver of a vehicle on a highway and special safeguards need not be employed * * <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee thus contends that, as a matter of law, it was not negligent. However, excepted from this rule are those cases which involve \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d crossings; and when that is the case, consonant with the dictates of common prudence, the railroad has a duty to use reasonable means to warn highway travelers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee has suggested the rule has no application to a true \u201coccupied crossing\u201d case but applies only to \u201crace to the crossing\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">As was the experience of appellee, we have found but one Kansas case which holds under the evidence in the case that the dangerous crossing issue should go to the jury and that was the \u201crace to the crossing\u201d case of Johnson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 157 Kan. 633, 143 P.2d 630. On the other hand, we have located no ease which holds that the \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d doctrine is not to be applied in a proper \u201coccupied crossing\u201d case. Indeed, in the recent \u201coccupied crossing\u201d case of Grisamore v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., supra 403 P.2d at 98, the Kansas Supreme Court expressly said that \u201cWhere a crossing is unusually dangerous such reasonable care must be exercised by the railroad as common prudence dictates. Where a standing train is blocking a crossing it is under a duty to use reasonable means to warn and avoid injury to the traveling public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">In supporting its contention that it was entitled to a directed verdict, appellee next argues that the evidence presented in the case at bar does not support the submission of the \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d crossing issue to the jury. It is the rule that unless \u201csubstantial, competent\u201d evidence is introduced at the trial showing the dangerous character of the crossing, the question is one of law for the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Once such evidence has been introduced the question is properly submitted to the jury as one of fact. The trial court recognized its duty in this regard and in his memorandum opinion granting appellee\u2019s motion for a new trial he commented that \u201cthere was substantial, competent evidence that the crossing was unusually hazardous, requiring the question to go to the jury. * * * I remain convinced that a directed verdict for the defendant, either at the time of trial or now, would have been error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Appellee contends there was no substantial, competent evidence that the crossing was unusually hazardous. Although the case is close we think that the trial court was correct in giving the issue to the jury. In Johnson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., supra 143 P.2d at 634, the Kansas Court said that among things to be considered in determining the existence of an \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d crossing were \u201cthe noise of industry thereabout which deflected or muffled the sound of railway engine bell or whistle, * * * the many railway tracks thereabout, and the moving of switch engines and freight cars thereon\u201d. We think the evidence established enough \u201csubstantial, competent evidence\u201d of some or all of these elements to let the issue go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">At the first trial, the \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d crossing instruction given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>trial judge included the statement that<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c * * * In determining whether or not the crossing was unusually dangerous you may take into consideration any factors which you find obstructed Mrs. Adamson\u2019s view of the crossing, if any, such as the positions of the street lights and you may consider whether or not the crossing was a much traveled one, the noise if any, incident to nearby railroad operations, the location of the crossing in the city, and all surrounding facts and circumstances existing at the time of the collision.\u201d The trial judge concluded he should not have specifically told the jury it could take into consideration the position of the street lights and that he should not have permitted the jury to consider the weather conditions by permitting consideration of \u201call surrounding facts and circumstances * * As to the street lights, the trial judge concluded that Kansas had not spoken directly to this problem and that he would have to rely on \u201cthe general law,\u201d which he felt required there be \u201cactual objects\u201d preventing the driver from seeing the danger. The trial judge said: \u201cMoreover, the real substance of the plaintiff\u2019s position on the matter of the street lights was not that they obstructed the view of the driver, but that their position created a darkness, or \u2018void,\u2019 at the intersection. Plaintiff\u2019s own testimony was that there was nothing to obstruct the vision of one driving south on \u2018D\u2019 Street * * * except darkness. Kansas has considered the effect of darkness and has stated unequivocally that it does not impose a greater duty on a railroad at a highway crossing. Jones v. A. T. &amp; S. F., supra [129 Kan. 314], at 315 [282 P. 593].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Grisamore v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., supra, was decided after the trial judge sustained appellee\u2019s motion for a new trial. Grisamore arose out of a crossing accident in Wichita in which plaintiff\u2019s decedent was killed when the truck he was driving struck a railroad car which was blocking the street crossing. The appeal was from a judgment sustaining the defendant railroad\u2019s demurrer to the petition. While we are here concerned with the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a jury question rather than the sufficiency of the petition as against a demurrer, we think the recent case is helpful in setting out the relevant considerations in a railway crossing accident. Grisamore reiterates that the railroad is not considered an insurer of the safety of motorists approaching their tracks; however, the railroad must exercise due care for the safety of such travelers. This duty of the railroad is directly affected by the care required of the motorist. If the motorist could have seen a hazard, such as a railroad car blocking his path, and avoided a collision had his automobile been in good condition then the railroad has no obligation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>could result in its negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If, however, unusual conditions prevail at some crossing the railroad may be required to anticipate that the mere presence of the train will not warn the motorist and the railroad must then take steps to warn the motorist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Of particular interest to the instant case are the following paragraphs from Grisamore:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u201cWhere a crossing is unusually dangerous such reasonable care must be exercised by the railroad as common prudence dictates. Where a standing train is blocking a crossing it is under a duty to use reasonable means to warn and avoid injury to the traveling public. The character of the means will depend on the particular conditions and circumstances surrounding the crossing. A railroad may be liable for injuries received by a motorist colliding with a railroad car on a crossing where normal headlights do not reveal the obstruction or where a trap is created by an illusion of safety revealed by the headlights.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Later in the opinion the court states that \u201cIt would appear * * * that where a crossing is unusually hazardous the question of whether a driver of a motor vehicle is guilty of contributory negligence is a question of fact * * * if the vision of the motorist approaching the crossing is affected by street lights near the crossing or on opposite side of crossing * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Appellant, relying heavily on the Grisamore case, contends that the testimony of two of its witnesses \u2014 Mrs. Adamson, the driver of the car, and Roy L. Morgan, a resident of Arkansas City familiar with the crossing \u2014 \u201cclearly indicates that at this crossing normal headlights do not reveal an obstruction on the crossing; that the vision of an approaching motorist is affected by street lights near the crossing; that the street lights create a trap, an illusion of safety; that an existing obstruction is not revealed by the headlights.\u201d Mrs. Adamson testified that she did not see the train on the crossing until she \u201cgot under that light,\u201d that \u201cyou certainly couldn\u2019t see it until after you got past that light, that first light.\u201d Morgan, who had lived in the area all of his 34 years, testified that between the light post on the north of the tracks and that on the south of the tracks \u201cthere is the darkest one spot in the world. There is nothing that interferes with your line of sight. There is nothing to keep your line of sight from looking down, there is nothing to keep your headlights from shining down there if you are driving an automobile if you have got headlights that work. * * <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">We think the court correctly concluded that all that was established was the existence of a dark spot beyond the illumination of the first light. The Kansas Court has expressly said that the duty owed by a railroad is not increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>because of darkness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is nothing in the Grisamore case to indicate that this rule has been changed. We agree with the trial judge that in this case, the real substance of the plaintiff\u2019s position on the matter of street lights was not that they obstructed the view of the driver, but that their position created a darkness or \u201cvoid.\u201d Therefore, the second of the above quoted paragraphs from Grisamore is not applicable since here the question was whether the headlights could pierce the darkness beyond the street light and not whether the street light affected the vision of the motorist. We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the trial court committed no error in his decision to grant a new trial on the basis that he had improperly instructed the jury that they could consider \u201cthe position of the street lights.\u201d We are not saying that, in a proper case, the jury cannot consider the position of the street lights, such as where \u201cthe vision of the motorist approaching the crossing is affected\u201d by such lights, but only that, in this case, it was not proper to so instruct.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Aside from the noise and switching activity in the area, there was very little evidence showing an \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d crossing and unless the jury found the crossing was \u201cunusually dangerous\u201d they were bound, under the law as properly instructed by the court, to find for the appellee. Thus, injecting the issue of lighting into the ease was prejudicial error and the court was correct in granting a new trial because of it. Because the action of the court in granting a new trial is amply supported by what we have already said, we think it unnecessary for us to consider appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court was wrong in concluding that, by permitting the jury to consider \u201call the surrounding facts and circumstances\u201d he erroneously let it consider weather conditions, although we do note in passing that this seems a rather too technical distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This brings us to appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court coerced the jury in its deliberations in the second trial. After the jury had deliberated almost two and one-half days, they sent a note to the court indicating they were deadlocked. They were then returned to the courtroom and the trial judge gave them an additional \u201cAllen\u201d instruction, in which he told them that he did not want them \u201cto feel that there is any pressure being put on you by the Court either way,\u201d that it was not an easy case, that \u201cI want to emphasize the fact that I do not want the conscience of the jurors strained,\u201d that if there was any hope of their arriving at a verdict, \u201cI think everyone would want you to spend another hour and see what you can do, but I don\u2019t want you to do it on the basis of any pressure from the Court,\u201d that \u201cgetting up and moving around a little bit might make a difference,\u201d but he re-emphasized that he did not want to put any pressure on the jury. He then said: \u201cI would like to give you a chance. I am going to be here, anyway. But if you don\u2019t think there is any chance, why, then I am going to excuse you and declare \u2014 or the Court will take whatever other steps it has to take. Now, Mr. Foreman, what do you think?\u201d The foreman replied: \u201cGive us until 5:00 o\u2019clock, Your Honor, and we will try.\u201d The Judge then said, \u201cAll right. I will give you until 5:00 o\u2019clock and, as I say, I want no pressure on you, and you remember my instructions. That is the thing I remind you of all the time. I will give you until 5:00 o\u2019clock. Why don\u2019t you retire and give it further thought.\u201d The jury then retired. Appellant claims the court forced them to arrive at a verdict by 5:00 o\u2019clock. Appellant cannot complain about the instruction because he did not object to it as required by Rule 51, F.R. Civ.P.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but we note, nonetheless, that it obviously was not coercive but merely re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>quested the jury to try \u2014 without compulsion \u2014 until 5:00 o\u2019clock, the time they normally ended deliberation and the time the foreman had suggested they stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\">.
