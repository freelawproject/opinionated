City of Athens, 5 Cir., 374 F.2d 887. In that case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-20\">\u201c[W]e do not reach the merits of the case because it appears that the licensing procedures of the city of Athens are for one year at a time. The license sought was for the year 1965. In view of the fact that the year has long since ended and in view of the fact that the city has adopted a new ordinance respecting the granting of such licenses applicable to all years beginning January 1, 1966, we are constrained to hold this appeal is moot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-21\">Here, too, licenses are granted in Bibb County for one year at a time. Here, too, the record discloses that the county commissioners adopted new licensing procedures for the year 1966, undoubtedly in light of this court\u2019s decision in the case of Hornsby v. Allen, Mayor et al., 5 Cir. 1964, 330 F.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">Here, too, we are constrained to hold this appeal is moot. It is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
