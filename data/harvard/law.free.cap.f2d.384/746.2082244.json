It appears, however, that at the conclusion of the charge, in answer to a direct inquiry by the trial judge, counsel for the Government stated that he had no suggestions or corrections as to the charge. Under these circumstances, the Government is precluded from attacking in this court the portion of the trial judge\u2019s charge referred to. Arnold v. Loose, 3 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 959, 963-964. We, therefore, do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>reach and do not consider the question which the Government seeks to raise as to the right of a claimant to comment to the jury on the Government\u2019s failure to call as a valuation witness an employee who had made the initial valuation upon which was based the estimate of just compensation for the land taken which is required by 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 258a(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
