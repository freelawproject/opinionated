Baker, solely liable for the collision between that ship and the S/T Cities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Service Miami, owned by the appellee, Cities Service Oil Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The collision occurred in the early morning of November 16, 1961, in the Delaware River on a narrow channel of about 800 feet in width known as \u201cLittle Tinicum Island Range\u201d under conditions of dense fog. During the trial the principal issue was: \u201cwhich ship was in its proper lane at and immediately prior to the time of the collision- \u2014 thus which ship veered into the wrong lane and thereby caused the accident?\u201d The District Court concluded that the <em>Baker </em>crossed into the wrong side of the channel when the vessels were not more than a half mile apart and thus the collision could not be avoided by the <em>Miami.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">These appeals do not dispute the District Court\u2019s holding that the <em>Baker </em>was at fault, but rather challenge the exoneration from liability of the <em>Miami. </em>In particular, the appellant argues that the District Court erred in its conclusion that the <em>Miami </em>at all times complied with Article 16 of the Inland Rules of the Road, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 192, which requires that a vessel in fog must \u201cgo at a moderate speed.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The concept of \u201cmoderate speed\u201d is not rigid. Most cases, however, seem to require a vessel in dense fog to reduce its speed to the lowest point consistent with good steerageway. See, e. g., The Martello, 153 U.S. 64, 14 S.Ct. 723, 38 L.Ed. 637 (1894). In The Virginia and Joan, 13 F.Supp. 419, 421 (D.Mass.), aff\u2019d, 86 F.2d 259 (1 Cir. 1936), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8H\">\u201cA moderate speed means a speed slow enough to enable the vessel to stop upon sighting an approaching ship, supposing the latter also is going at a moderate speed, except that the vessel may maintain sufficient speed to enable her to remain under command.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAX_\">The District Court, after considering all of the voluminous testimony conclusively found that \u201cthe Miami proceeded at a rate of speed which permitted it to stop within the limits of visibility at all times\u201d, and that when it entered the dense fog <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and visibility suddenly closed in, it \u201cimmediately reduced speed to Dead-Slow ahead \u2014 to bare steerageway.\u201d On these facts, the District Court concluded that the <em>Miami </em>complied with the rule of moderate speed \u201cin every respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Appellant urges that the District Court erred in basing its holding that the <em>Miami </em>was going at moderate speed on cases<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which determined mutual fault upon speeds generally less than that of the <em>Miami. </em>The difference between the \u201ccircumstances and conditions\u201d in the cases to which appellant refers and the case at bar repels the attack. Indeed, the selective use of the cases by the District Court is quite obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">The rule is abundantly clear that \u201c[i]n reviewing a judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury in admiralty, the Court of Appeals may not set aside the judgment below unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d McAllister v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 8, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954); Knox v. United States Lines Co., 320 F.2d 247 (3 Cir. 1963); Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. S.S.Marie Leonhardt, 320 F.2d 262 (3 Cir. 1963). After reviewing the entire record, we have concluded that the District Court had ample evidence on which to base its decision. Certainly, it can not be said that its judgment was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The appellant raises several other issues on which it claims the District Court erred. We have reviewed these and have concluded that they are without merit. We agree with the District Court that the \u201cBaker turned a safe passage into collision by suddenly veering * * * across the Miami\u2019s bow when the vessels were a half mile or less apart.\u201d When this occurred the \u201ccollision could not be avoided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">. Hereinafter the appellant will be referred to as the <em>Baker </em>and the appellee as the <em>Miami.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-8\">. The opinion and findings of fact and conclusions of law are reported at 260 F.Supp. 244 (E.D.Pa.1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. \u201cEvery vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rainstorms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 192.
