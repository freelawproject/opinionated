In its Decision and Order, reported as Swan Super Cleaners, Inc., 152 N.L.R.B. 163 (1965), the Board found that respondent, a laundry and dry cleaning plant, had violated the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (3) and (5)); first, by coercive interrogation, threat of reprisal, and promises of benefits, in resisting a 1963 union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> organizing campaign; second, by discriminatory discharge of an employee; and third, by refusal to bargain with the union without good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>faith doubt of the union\u2019s assertion that it had signed up a majority of respondent\u2019s employees. We deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s order as to its finding of discriminatory discharge and refusal to bargain, but enforce its order relating to the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">1) Illegal resistance to union campaign. \u00a7 8(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The union\u2019s organizing campaign began early in 1963. After learning of it, the company resisted. There was evidence' from which it could be found that by interrogation, threats, and promise of benefits, the respondent violated the Act. The Board\u2019s Decision and Order with its Trial Examiner\u2019s Decision, reported at 152 N.L.R.B. 163, adequately sets out the evidence offered to support and resist the \u00a7 8(a) (1) charge; it shows the usual pattern of company and union conduct characteristic of such campaigns. The trial examiner, affirmed by the Board, resolved factual issues- against the company by crediting the General Counsel\u2019s witnesses and drawing inferences from the testimony. We are bound by such findings of fact because we cannot say they are without support by substantial evidence in the record. \u00a7 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). It would not be informative to the litigants or of any precedential importance for us to review the facts and repeat well-known principles controlling the fact-finding functions of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">2) Alleged discriminatory discharge. \u00a7 8(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">An employee, Sonjia Wade, was discharged on April 29, 1963. The trial examiner held that her discharge was not in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) and dismissed the charge. The Board reversed the examiner. As part of her work, she operated a so-called \u201ctouehup\u201d press to finish ironing shirts that could not be handled on other equipment in the laundry. In disagreement with supervision, Wade asserted that she could not iron certain kinds of shirts on her machine; her supervisor contended that it could be done and essayed to show her how. There was evidence that while he was attempting to show her how to do the work, Wade ignored him, folded her arms, and looked out the window, thus exhibiting an insubordinate and contemptuous attitude. For this, she was discharged; and there was evidence of previous insubordination on her part. Although she denied the previous insubordination, Wade\u2019s account of her conduct on the morning she was discharged cannot be read as a denial of her impudence, which was witnessed not only by her supervisor, but by another employee. She testifies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">\u201cSo, I kept on working that day. And so I was over on the press, helping to press up, and Mr. Johnson came over there, and he says, T am sorry to do this, Sonjia.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Do what, Mr. Johnson?\u2019 and he says, \u2018Let you go.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Okay.\u2019 He said, \u2018Because this morning when I showed you how to do that shirt, you acted like you didn\u2019t want to do it.\u2019 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">\u201cHe said that I was, I didn\u2019t pay no attention to him \u2014 not that I didn\u2019t pay any attention to him, but that he was sorry he had to let me go. And I said, \u2018Okay.\u2019 And he said that I didn\u2019t pay no attention to him, that I was uncooperative, and that is all that was said, and I just went in to the rest room and changed my clothes, and left.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">It is unclear whether the trial examiner accepted the company\u2019s account of Wade\u2019s discharge. He disposed of the matter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-14\">\u201cThere is no evidence in the record to support the allegation in the complaint that Sonjia Wade was discharged in violation of the Act. The complaint in that respect should be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">The Board, however, found that the company\u2019s avowed reason for Wade\u2019s discharge was a pretext and that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>was released because of her interest and activity in behalf of the union. This finding is without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">There was evidence that, prior to her discharge on April 29, Sonjia Wade had signed an authorization card for the union, had allowed a union meeting, attended by eight or nine employees, to be held in her home, and had distributed and obtained signatures on five or six union cards. However, there is no evidence that respondent or any of its executives or supervisors knew of Wade\u2019s above activity. She was not known to them as a union protagonist unless such knowledge can be inferred. All of the evidence, except for a doubtful statement of one Hall, was to the effect that the respondent- company\u2019s earliest knowledge of union activity came on May 3,1963, when management found some union pamphlets that were being distributed. Sonjia Wade had been discharged prior to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The allegedly coercive conduct upon which the Board relied for finding violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) occurred after that date. One Lillian Hall, however, testified that on April 24 \u2014 -five days before Wade\u2019s discharge on April 29 \u2014 a supervisor asked her whether she (the witness Hall) had attended a union meeting on the previous night. From this, the Board infers that the respondent company knew of the union campaign prior to Wade\u2019s discharge on April 29. Then, by some quite long, inferential steps, it concludes that the company must have known of Wade\u2019s union activity, and therefore, contrary to all the testimony, that her discharge was motivated by a company desire to get rid of a union activist.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">While it is not of controlling importance, the probative worth of the witness Hall\u2019s fixing of April 24 as the date of the company\u2019s critical inquiry concerning the union meeting is indeed thin. The following is her first fixing of this date, clearly placing the inquiry after Wade\u2019s discharge on April 29th.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cQ. Now, Miss Lillia, have you ever had any conversation with any supervisor or boss at the plant regarding the Union <em>since </em>this meeting? [a meeting of May 7, 1963] (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">\u201cA. Yes, I have. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">\u201cQ. Do you remember when it took place, what month it was in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u201cA. It was in May, I remember that. It was in May, because I remember the last \u2014 the fourth Tuesday in May I always go to the Eastern Star meeting, and it was the next day after that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">She thereafter moved the date of the inquiry into April. But even if the reported conversation between Johnson (a supervisor) and Hall took place on April 24, that fact does not provide a permissible basis for inferring that the company thereby became aware of <em>Wade\u2019s </em>activities. The meeting talked of was not a meeting at Wade\u2019s house and there is no evidence that she even attended such meeting. It should be observed that other than the witness Hall\u2019s account, there is no evidence from the General Counsel\u2019s witnesses or from those offered by respondent that before May 3rd the latter had any knowledge of union activity by <em>anyone. </em>Neither Wade nor any other witness claimed that the company knew of, and in discharging Wade was motivated by, her union adherence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">The incidents of coercive interrogation and union surveillance, referred to by the Board, which began in the middle of May, cannot be related back to demonstrate that on April 29th respondent\u2019s supervisory personnel must have known of Wade\u2019s union sympathies. The Board indeed has the right to draw inferences of fact and from there move on to infer, in proper circumstances, the discriminatory purpose necessary to strike down a particular discharge. NLRB v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 597, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368, 378 (1941); NLRB v. Power Equipment Co., 313 F.2d 438, 441 (C.A.6, 1963); NLRB v. Bendix Corp., 299 F.2d 308, 310 (C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>6, 1962), cert. den. 371 U.S. 827, 83 S.Ct. 47, 9 L.Ed.2d 65. But we still have the duty to consider whether there is substantial evidence to support such inference. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). And this meager testimony that one minor supervisor asked Hall about a meeting does not prove, or permit the inference, that such supervisor knew of the activities of Wade. Rivers Manufacturing Corp. v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 511, 515 (1967). The burden of proof was on the Board\u2019s general counsel to prove that some part of the company\u2019s motivation was discriminatory. NLRB v. Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co., 326 F.2d 509, 513 (C.A.6, 1964); NLRB v. Cleveland Trust Co., 214 F.2d 95, 99 (C.A.6, 1954). Even if the company knew that Sonjia Wade was a union activist, such knowledge by the company would not insulate her from being discharged for a nondiscriminatory, good cause. Lawson Milk Co., v. NLRB, 317 F.2d 756, 760 (C.A.6, 1963). Such discriminatory motive cannot reside entirely in a Board view that the discharge was without sufficient cause. NLRB v. Mylan-Sparta, 166 F.2d 485, 490, 491 (C.A.6, 1948); NLRB v. Houston Chronicle Pub. Co., 211 F.2d 848, 854 (C.A.5, 1954); NLRB v. Wagner Iron Works, 220 F.2d 126, 133 (C.A. 7, 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">3) Refusal to bargain. \u00a7 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On May 15, 1963, the union sent a telegram to Gelpi, president of respondent, asserting that it represented a majority of respondent\u2019s workers, demanding recognition as the employees\u2019 bargaining agent, and requesting a conference to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. The telegram further advised that if the company had doubts of the union\u2019s claims, the union was prepared to submit to a card check by an impartial, mutually agreeable person. It requested a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">President Gelpi testified that after receiving the telegram he called his lawyer who told him to \u201cjust sit tight\u201d and a union representative would either visit him or the union would petition for an election. Neither of those things occurred; Gelpi did not respond to the telegram or ever express to the union any doubt of its majority status. No other contacts were made between the company and the union and on June 1, the union filed its charge with the NLRB\u2019s Regional Director that the company had refused to bargain, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Respondent company defended its conduct, first, by claim that the union failed to establish that a majority of the employees in the plant supported it; and second, that Gelpi\u2019s \u201cwait-and-see\u201d attitude after receipt of the telegram was not an illegal refusal to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The union\u2019s majority status.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">The trial examiner found that 35 of 65 eligible plant employees had signed cards authorizing the union to represent them. By finding that two employees were supervisors, he rejected the company\u2019s claim that the proper bargaining unit consisted of 67 workers; he also rejected its claim that seven cards were void because union solicitors had represented to the signers that the cards were to be used to obtain a Board supervised election, and did not authorize the union to act as bargaining agent for the signers.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Size of bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention, the trial examiner regarded two of its employees, Isler and Johnston, as \u201csupervisors\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(11), and thus ineligible for inclusion in the bargaining unit. Without setting out the relevant proofs, we are satisfied that they permitted the trial examiner\u2019s finding in this regard. We have said that whether an employee is a supervisor is a question of fact, \u201cand the Board\u2019s resolution of the issue is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Peoples Service Drug Store, Inc. v. NLRB, 375 F.2d 551, 554 (C.A.6, 1967); NLRB v. Ertel Manufacturing Corp., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>352 F.2d 916, 918 (C.A.7, 1965); cert. den. 383 U.S. 945, 86 S.Ct. 1202, 16 L.Ed. 2d 208; see also Eastern Greyhound Lines v. NLRB, 337 F.2d 84 (C.A.6, 1964). Such evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Did the union have a majority?</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The union needed 33 adherents to constitute a majority of the 65 employees in the bargaining unit. The trial examiner and the Board found that the union had 35 validly signed membership cards. If three of such cards should not have been counted, the union did not have a majority. Respondent contends that 7 of the cards should not have been counted; it asserts that these cards were the product of fraudulent importuning by union agents which led the signers to believe that the holding of an election would be the only consequence of their signing. The representations made in the solicitations of all seven of the challenged cards raise serious doubts that they evidence a genuine desire to join the union. But, obedient to our decisions in NLRB v. Cumberland Shoe Corp., 351 F.2d 917 (C.A.6, 1965), and NLRB v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 341 F.2d 750 (C.A.6, 1965), cert. den. 382 U.S. 380, 86 S.Ct. 69, 15 L.Ed.2d 74, we limit our consideration to those which the evidence shows were the product of the signers\u2019 belief that they were to be used only to obtain an election. So tested, we find 4 of them invalid, thus destroying the majority claimed by the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Three of these invalid cards, as were others, were solicited by two men, one not otherwise identified than as <em>\u201ca </em>preacher\u201d and the other an employee of the involved union \u2014 Chester Makoski. The fourth card was obtained by another union solicitor, Charles P. Garrish, and the preacher. We set out the testimony given by the signers of these four cards as to what they were told was the purpose of the cards they signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\n<em>Shirley Green</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cQ.

See Joy Silk Mills v. NLRB, 185 F.2d 732, 743 (C.A.D.C. 1950) cert. den. 341 U.S. 914, 71 S.Ct. 734, 95 L.Ed. 1350. But it is relevant in assessing the effect of the solicitor\u2019s words, for it casts a telling reflection on the actual communication conveyed to the signer. The testimony of the signer as to his <em>expressed </em>state of mind is also relevant in determining whether his misapprehension over the purpose of the card was <em>knowingly induced </em>by the solicitor. Such inducement of an employee who openly expresses an intention not <em>to </em>join the union suggests that representations concerning an election were intended to lead to a belief that the only purpose of the card was to hold an election. In NLRB v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., supra, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZt\">\u201cThe decisions of the Board as well as the opinions of the courts place more emphasis upon the representations made to the employees at the time the cards were signed than upon the language set forth in the cards. If in fact misrepresentations are made by the union to employees <em>to the effect </em>that the only purpose of the card is to authorize the union to petition the Board for an election, the card will not be construed to authorize representation, even though it contains language to that effect. N. L. R. B. v. Koehler, 328 F.2d 770 (C.A. 7); Englewood Lumber Company, 130 N.L.R.B. 394.\u201d 341 F.2d at 754. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-23\">We emphasize that the \u201cpreacher\u201d who was present at the solicitations of the cards was not produced at the hearing; Chester Makoski was present but did not question the accuracy of the account of his representations given by the three signers solicited by him. Nor did Charles P. Garrish testify specifically as to his representations concerning any one card; he did testify as to his solicitations in general.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We read the trial examiner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>decision as \u201ccrediting\u201d the employees\u2019 testimony relevant to the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We come then to the critical question of whether our invalidating the four cards involved is inconsistent with what we said in <em>Cumberland </em>and later in Dayco Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 382 F.2d 577, (Aug. 7, 1967). In <em>Cumberland </em>we emphasized that \u201cIn no instance did any employee testify that he was told that the election was the <em>only </em>purpose of the card.\u201d 351 F.2d at 920. In <em>Dayco </em>we construed the holding of <em>Cumberland </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">\u201cTo invalidate authorization cards <em>relating solely to union representation, </em>it is necessary that there be affirmative misrepresentation that the <em>sole </em>and <em>only </em>purpose of the card is to secure an election.\u201d 382 F.2d 582 (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">But we there held that the cards involved were invalid because of the character of their solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We think it right now to say that we do not consider that we have announced a rule that only where the solicitor of a card actually employs the specified words \u201cthis card is for the <em>sole </em>and <em>only </em>purpose of having an election\u201d will a j card be invalidated. We did not intend ! such a narrow and mechanical rule. We | believe that whatever the style or actual i words of the solicitation, if it is clearly calculated to create in the mind of the one ' solicited a belief that the <em>only purpose of </em>. <em>the card is to obtain an election, </em>an invalidation of such card does not offend \u25a0 our <em>Cumberland </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In <em>Dayco </em>we were dealing with dual purpose cards, which on their face authorized the union as collective bargaining agent <em>and to hold elections. </em>We invalidated the cards because of the following representations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">\u201cOpper testified that he told employees that he needed their signatures to get a majority of cards \u2018in order to get an election.\u2019 * * * Opper admitted that he told employee Jack Frost that he needed his signature to \u2018get the majority of the votes\u2019 and told employee Ron Sober that he needed his signature to get a majority of cards \u2018in order to have an election, so that the Union could represent us.\u2019 Employee Richard Wagner stated that when Opper handed him a card Opper told him that \u2018we would have to have an election.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The statements made to Shirley Green and Viola Scroggins clearly amounted to a misrepresentation that the only purpose of the cards was to have an election. This follows from the statement to Green that other than for election, \u201cthose cards didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d and in the statement to Scroggins that \u201cit wasn\u2019t joining the union\u201d after her expressed wish that she did not want to join the union. The testimony by Clara Ann Hall and Ruth Howard does not disclose with equal clarity a representation that obtaining an election was the only purpose of the cards. This is Clara Ann Hall\u2019s account of the solicitor\u2019s remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-14\">\u201cHe told me there would be voting on the Union, there would be a machine set up and no one would know how I voted but them, and when I signed the card, no one would see the card but them, and how I voted. He told me at the time there was 20 per cent of the girls had already signed, that is what he said, sat in my living room and told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">To the above she added, \u201cThat is the only reason why I signed the card, because he said there would be voting set up by a machine and no one would know how I signed but him \u2014 but them \u2014 and no one would see the vote.\u201d She also testified that she did not intend to have the union speak for her and that she did not read the card. As to Ruth Howard, she immediately told the solicitor that she didn\u2019t wish to sign a card and she was assured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>that \u201che was trying to get a percentage of the girls to sign the cards so they could come in and vote for the union.\u201d She then said she was undecided and asked if she would have a chance to change her mind, and was assured she would. She added that \u201cright before I signed I said, \u2018If I don\u2019t want anything to do with this, what would happen\u2019 and he (the solicitor) said \u2018You will have time to think and vote\u2019 so I said, \u2018Okay * * * I\u2019ll sign.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">None of the foregoing was denied by Makoski and neither did the examiner or the Board impugn its veracity. Considering the <em>context </em>of the solicitations, we find that their clear intent and effect was to assure these women that their signing was <em>only </em>for the purpose of having an election. The trial examiner remarked that none of these women later expressed a desire to disavow the union. We do not consider that they had such a duty, since we find that their signatures did not amount to an authorization of the union in the first place. They had no chance to vote as they were promised. No election was held; neither did the union seek one. It followed a now popular procedure of filing unfair labor practice charges against the company, having its claim of a bare majority sustained, and thus obtaining bargaining rights without an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We find this case further distinguishable from <em>Cumberland </em>in the fact that there the union did seek an election and the Board indicated its lack of confidence in the probative worth of the testimony offered to sustain the claim of improper solicitation. In its footnote quoted in <em>Cumberland, </em>it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201c3. The record indicates that the testimony to this effect consisted of affirmative responses by the signatories to leading questions propounded by Respondent\u2019s counsel, upon cross-examination, as to whether they were told that the purpose of the cards was to secure an election. We do not deem such testimony sufficient to controvert the statement of the purpose and effect of such cards contained on the face thereof, nor do we consider it inconsistent with an understanding that the cards served the dual purpose of designating a representative and of securing an election.\u201d 351 F.2d at 919.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-JO\">We said, \u201cIn our present case we find no claim of outright misrepresentation on the part of any solicitor. * * * In no instance did any employee testify that he was told that the election was the only purpose of the card.\u201d 351 F.2d 920. The undenied statement of Makoski here that the cards \u201cdid not mean a thing\u201d other than for election and that the signing of the cards \u201cwasn\u2019t joining the union\u201d were clear misrepresentations, as against the union\u2019s and the NLRB\u2019s assertion that the signers voluntarily and knowledgeably joined the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In <em>Winn-Dixie </em>we affirmed a finding of the Board that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">\u201c[Ejxcept for one card, not in issue herein, the record shows that the representations made by the Union\u2019s solicitors in order to obtain employee signatures, clearly reflect and corroborate the purpose of the cards as printed thereon. The Trial Examiner\u2019s finding that no misrepresentations were made in securing employee signatures is amply supported by the record.\u201d 341 F.2d at 754, 755.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">In this case no issue was made as to the fact of the misrepresentations but the Trial Examiner found the misrepresentations not sufficient to invalidate the cards because they did not actually contain the words \u201csole\u201d or \u201conly\u201d purpose, which he construed to be required under the Board\u2019s decision in Cumberland Shoe Corporation, 144 NLRB 1268. Illustrative of this approach was his disposition of the Viola Scroggins card:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">\u201cHere, as in <em>Cumberland, </em>supra, it does not appear that she was told that the only purpose of the cards was to secure an election. <em>She was told that she was not joining the union </em>by signing the card and that he was trying to see how many he could get to campaign for the union in its organizational effort.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>As to Shirley Green, after reading her testimony that she was told that \u201cthe cards did not mean anything,\u201d he concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">\u201cI find Shirley Green\u2019s card to be valid. Nowhere does the record show that she was told that the <em>only </em>purpose of the cards was to vote in an election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">It appears that the examiner\u2019s position was, and the Board\u2019s position now is, that unless the solicitor has actually employed the words \u201csole\u201d or \u201conly\u201d in his sales talk, our opinion in <em>Cumberland </em>insulates the solicitation from condemnation, no matter what its other vices. We do not believe the language employed in <em>Cumberland </em>suggests any such mechanical interpretation. The \u201coutright misrepresentation\u201d referred to therein could certainly be accomplished by other words than \u201csole\u201d or \u201conly.\u201d A sophisticated and only modestly talented union agent could easily live with such a narrow rule and, leaving out the <em>bad words </em>\u2014 \u201csole\u201d and \u201conly\u201d \u2014 employ language clearly calculated to lead a woman laundry worker to believe that the holding of an election was all that she signed up for.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">The distinguished author of the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in NLRB v. S. E. Nichols Company, 380 F.2d 438 (C.A.2, 1967), considered that our <em>Cumberland </em>and <em>Winn-Dixie </em>decisions commit us to the narrow view that cards will not be vitiated unless the words \u201csole\u201d or \u201conly\u201d are used. We adhere to the rule of those cases and believe that we here do no violence to it by holding that the misrepresentations in this case did, in their total context, persuade the involved signers that they were not joining the union or designating it as their bargaining ag\u00e9nt. The Board\u2019s contrary finding is without support \u201cby substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Without reciting them here, we mention that the representations considered by Judge Friendly in NLRB v. S. E. Nichols, supra, bear substantial similarity to those before us in this case. Referring to one card obtained under such circumstances, Judge Friendly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">\u201cIt is quite a different matter to permit a union to attain recognition by authorization cards procured on the affirmative assurance that there would be an election without a further clear explanation that the cards can and may also be used to obtain recognition without any subsequent expression of preference by the employees; such a half-truth gives the employees the false impression that they will have an opportunity in all events to register their true preferences in the secrecy of the voting booth. As has been well said, Note, supra, 75 Yale L.J. at 826: \u2018If the employee thinks the cards will lead to a secret ballot, he can insure himself against the possibility of future retaliation and prevent harassment only by signing. Such an employee may sign a card planning to vote against the union or at least intending to reserve decision until he hears the employer\u2019s views or talks to fellow employees.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">\u201cWe decline to encourage such an impairment of employees\u2019 \u00a7 7 rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">In view of our holding that the disallowance of the four cards under discussion destroyed the union\u2019s card majority, we need not consider the issue of \u201cgood faith\u201d in the Section 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain charge. NLRB v. Kohler, 328 F.2d 770, 773 (C.A. 7, 1964); Dayco Corporation v. NLRB, 382 F.2d 577 (C.A. 6, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order as to the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violation is ordered, and otherwise it is denied enforcement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-20\">. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, AFL-CIO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-20\">. In the case of Ruth Howard, whose card was solicited by Garrish, his testimony about his solicitations in general would seem to contradict her account. But the Trial Examiner does not refer to Garrish\u2019s testimony except for the witnessing of Howard\u2019s signature. His summary of her testimony contains no indication that he does not credit it. Garrish testifled, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cQ. Now will yon relate what your conversation was with them, at this time? * * The Witness: I was attempting to explain the benefits of the Union; that was all I could do, and asked them if they would sign a card. Q. And that was the total sum and substance of the conversation? A. That, and explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>to them the benefits that we would try to get in collective bargaining. Q. And what else? A. Well, that would be about the sum of it. That is all you can do when you are organizing, explain the benefits you can, or you hope to achieve in collective bargaining with the company.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
