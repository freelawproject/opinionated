When the case was here previously,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we upheld the District Court\u2019s denial of leave to appeal in <em>forma pauperis </em>because the petition therefor was not presented within the ten-day period fixed mandatorily for the filing of a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, with an emerging claim that appellant\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had neglected to inform him either of his right to appeal or as to when that right had to be asserted, our affirmance was without prejudice to a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 seeking vacation and reentry of sentence to provide anew the opportunity for timely steps in that direction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Appellant thereafter exhibited such a motion, repeating his earlier allegations and charging ineffective assistance of counsel, and a hearing thereon was conducted. The District Judge denied the motion, finding that appellant was \"ably and conscientiously\u201d defended throughout the proceedings and, more specifically, that he was duly advised of his right to appeal but consciously decided to resort exclusively to a motion for reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-18\">In considering appellant\u2019s challenge to this disposition we must honor these findings unless they are clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we cannot say that they are. One of appellant\u2019s trial advocates testified that, to the best of his recollection, he apprised appellant, after as well as before conviction, of his right to appeal and of the ten-day period for noticing it. He stated that appellant decided to forego appellate examination of the trial proceedings and to seek a paring of his sentence instead. Appellant, while denying that at any time after the trial began was the subject mentioned, admitted that there was pretrial discussion of a possible appeal. And two letters appellant wrote to his counsel \u2014 both after conviction, and one within hours after sentencing \u2014 lend support to the finding that a motion for reduction of sentence was to be the only post-sentence effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>True it is that the evidence was not fully harmonious, and that it contributed something to appellant\u2019s side of the case. In particular, a letter from counsel to appellant, dated eight days after imposition of sentence, suggests that an appeal was not completely out of the picture, an inference other evidence did not necessarily eradicate. But it was the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to assess the conflicts, and it is now ours to abide his evaluation if not plainly wrong, however we might be inclined were we at liberty to make a <em>de novo </em>determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Adverting to what we have characterized as the \u201cclassic formulation of the test\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by which our action is to now be guided, we are not, as to the findings mentioned, \u201con the entire evidence * * * left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">There remains appellant\u2019s contention, rebutted by his counsel, that appellant was never told about the ten-day limitation on appealing \u2014 an issue, as we read the record, the judge was unable to resolve.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This question, however, is rendered academic by the finding that appellant concluded that his interests would be served better by undertaking to ameliorate the sentence without endeavoring to win reversal of the conviction. With this finding unimpeachable, any omission to inform him of the period for noting the unwanted appeal is inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">.

Appellant was represented at his trial by two attorneys, both retained, other than counsel appointed for this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b384-12\">. We said: \u201cIn the record before us there appear to be allegations that appellant\u2019s counsel, retained for his defense at the trial, never apprised him of his right to file a notice of appeal, or of the time within which that right must be exercised. If true, and if unexplained, this impresses us as such an extraordinary inattention to a client\u2019s interests as to amount to ineffective assistance of counsel cognizable under Section 2255. A motion under that statute containing such allegations, and otherwise entertain-able by the court, would entitle appellant to a hearing. If the court should find the facts to be as alleged, it should, by the expedient of vacating and resentencing, restore appellant to the status of one on whom sentence has just been imposed and who has 10 days in which to institute a direct appeal. Whether there are in fact grounds for such an appeal seems to us a subject to which appellant is entitled to address himself once he has been restored to the aforementioned status.\u201d 121 U.S.App.D.C. at 355, 350 F.2d at 733.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b384-21\">.

The trial judge made a finding that appellant \u201cwas informed of his right to appeal from his conviction <em>* * * </em>within the period of ten days from the entry of the final judgment of conviction.\u201d This could mean either that within the ten-day period appellant was informed only of his right to appeal, or that he was told that this was the period during which the appeal must be taken. We take it that the latter was not intended because the judge, at the conclusion of the hearing and prior to filing formal findings, stated that he was unable to determine whether appellant was enlightened as to the ten-day period for initiating the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
