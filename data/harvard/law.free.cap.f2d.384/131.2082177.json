Petitioner moves to dismiss on the ground of untimeliness. Appellants point to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107, which specifies a 90-day appeal period for admiralty cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">The merger of the civil and admiralty sides of the court was aeeomplishedjon Juftf .171966. As~bf~tha1rdate the revised civil rules became effective, jOrder of the Supreme Court, 383 U.S. \u00a11031 (1966), and all laws in conflict with them became ineffective, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2072, 2073. The rules were made applicable to all cases then pending \u201cexcept to the extent that in the opinion of the Court their application * * * would not be feasible or would work injustice, * * 383 U.S. 1031. In our opinion application of Rule 73(a), requiring an appeal to be taken in 30 days, transgresses neither limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">Unfortunately appellants continued to think they had 90 days in which to appeal. Even if such ignorance, 16 months after the revised rules were transmitted to Congress and almost a year after their effective date is, as appellants contend, \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d1 such neglect can extend the time only 30-mbre'days: FJLC\u00cdvJLT\u00edOj7773'C\u00e1T-\"</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">It is, perhaps, to be regretted that section .2107 was not repealed-\"in express terms. However, we cannot possibly\u2019 say that it was not inconsistent with the new rules within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2072, 2073. 7A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice ffff .02[2], .64[3].</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
