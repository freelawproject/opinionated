He was found subject to deportation under \u00a7 241(a) (11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (11), in that he had been convicted of a violation of \u00a7 11530 of the California Health and Safety Code, relating to the illicit possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">Petitioner contends that he was not \u201cconvicted\u201d since, after finding him guilty of the charged offense, the state court had suspended sentence and placed him on probation. We have consistently held to the contrary. Gutierrez v. I.N.S., 323 F.2d 593 (9th Cir.1963), cert. denied 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179 (1964); Wood v. Hoy, 266 F.2d 825 (9th Cir.1959); Arrellano-Flores v. Hoy, 262 F.2d 667 (9th Cir.1958), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 921, 80 S.Ct. 673, 4 L.Ed.2d 740 (1960). See also Kelly v. I.N.S., 349 F.2d 473 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 932, 86 S.Ct. 326, 15 L.Ed.2d 344 (1965); Garcia-Gonzales v. I.N.S., 344 F.2d 804 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 840, 86 S.Ct. 88, 15 L.Ed.2d 81 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-23\">Petitioner contends that deportation under the circumstances of this case constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Deportation is not punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, Bugajewitz v. Adams, 228 U.S. 585, 591, 33 S.Ct. 607, 57 L.Ed. 978 (1913), and is civil, not criminal, in nature. Woodby v. I.N.S., 385 U.S. 276, 285, 87 S.Ct. 483, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 594, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-24\">The order of deportation is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
