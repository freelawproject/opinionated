The interrogation was an important part of the federal criminal proceedings which had obviously then focused on the defendant. As was the case in <em>Miranda </em>this was an interrogation \u201cin a police-dominated atmosphere.\u201d Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 445, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). At a hearing conducted by the district judge on the admissibility of a statement by the defendant taken at that interrogation, the FBI agent testified that the defendant was advised that he \u201chad the right to remain silent, that he didn\u2019t have to make any statement, that if he did make any statement, it could be used against him in a court of law.\u201d Although the agent stated that he also advised the defendant that \u201che had the right to consult an attorney or anyone else before making a statement,\u201d and that \u201cif he did not have any money to obtain an attorney that the Judge, the Court, would appoint one for him when he went to court,\u201d the defendant was not advised, as <em>Miranda </em>requires, of his right to have <em>court-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number><em>appointed </em>counsel present <em>during the interrogation. </em>' Although the interrogation was made and the defendant\u2019s statement taken prior to the <em>Miranda </em>decision, the trial took place subsequent to <em>Miranda </em>and the strict standards established by that case should have been applied by the trial court to the issue of admissibility at trial. Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); Evans v. United States, 375 F.2d 355 (8th Cir. 1967). The statement having been improperly admitted, the conviction must be</p>\n<p id=\"A4Ws\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
