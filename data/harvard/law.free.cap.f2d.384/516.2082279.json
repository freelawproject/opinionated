The suit was brought by Research Products Corporation, assignee of Patents No. 3,031,827 and 3,155,560.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Patent \u2019827 is for a filter for liquids or gases, made of multiple layers of slit and expanded metal foil, in which the layers of metal forming it are bonded together by a bonding material. Patent \u2019850 is the method patent for making the filter, consisting of stacking a number of layers of the expanded metal foil, applying a settable liquid agent and distributing it through the stack, applying moderate pressure and permitting the material to set while the stack is pressed together.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Again this court considers the question of the \u00a7 103 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defense of obviousness as discussed by the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Company, 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). In <em>John Deere, </em>decided about one month after the trial of this case, the Supreme Court described the methodology for inquiry under \u00a7 103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-17\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.\u201d 383 U.S. at 17, 86 S. Ct. at 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">We have applied this method in several recent cases. Sisko v. Southern Resin &amp; Fiberglass Corp., 373 F.2d 866 (5th Cir., 1967); Up-Right, Inc. v. Safway Prods., Inc., 364 F.2d 580 (5th Cir. 1966); Zero Mfg. Co. v. Mississippi Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, 358 F.2d 853 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 841, 87 S.Ct. 93, 17 L.Ed.2d 74 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">The question of patent validity is one of law, but to be decided on the results of factual inquiries. Up-Right, Inc. v. Safway Products, Inc., supra. However, at the threshold we refer to two questions of law which must be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>plied to the facts. Conclusion of Law No. 7 of the District Court was: \u201cOne who copies the commercial structure of a patentee with full knowledge of the patent thereon, is not in a position to assert lack of patentability under 35 U.S.C. 103, in the absence of proof of independent development of the identical structure by another.\u201d Research Products, whose proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were adopted by the trial court, offers no authority to support this proposition, and we know of no such principle. However, the District Court fully considered whether the prior art made the purported invention obvious, so that appellant was not as, it claims, stripped cf its \u00a7 103 defense. The second matter is a more serious one. Conclusion of Law 13 was: \u201cThe pertinency of the prior art patents relied upon by defendant is greatly impaired by the fact that there is no evidence to the effect that any of the structures or methods disclosed in such patents was ever reduced to commercial practice or applied to the solution of the problem arising from the thousands of different filter sizes in the market, a problem which the patents in suit went a long way toward solving.\u201d Whether prior art patents have been put to use is irrelevant to the question whether the disclosures therein constitute anticipation, Mannix Company, Ltd., v. Heally, 341 F.2d 1009 (5th Cir. 1965); Tillotson Mfg. Co. v. Textron, Inc., Homelite, 337 F.2d 833 (6th Cir., 1964), Western States Mach. Co. v. S. S. Hepworth Co., 147 F.2d 345 (2d Cir. 1945), and the same principle applies to obviousness. Obviousness is measured in terms of one skilled in the art. Whether others skilled in the art, working independently, previously have arrived at the same concept is highly informative in determining obviousness, and if they did arrive at the same concept the relevancy of that fact is not destroyed by their lack of commercial success.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The facts relating to patentability are not in basic dispute. The issue in this case is almost solely one of obviousness against a background of prior art disclosures of previously issued patents, requiring application of appropriate standards of law to facts largely undisputed. In this situation we see no necessity for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We conclude that the District Court erred in not sustaining the \u00a7 103 defense, and we reverse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The testimony offered shows that the filter was developed by National Filters primarily for use in window and room type home air conditioners. Earlier filters had been made from a variety of materials, including glass fiber, slit and expanded paper, split and expanded aluminum foil and vegetable fiber. As a general practice these filters had a surrounding frame or a supporting grid (or both) which maintained the shape of the filter and held it in place. Manufacturers of air conditioning units made no attempt to achieve uniformity in the sizes of filters used. At the time of the patent over 1,000 sizes were in commercial use. Filters surrounded by a frame had to be an exact size for each unit, so that dealers were required to have access to a large variety of filters. Large stocks of the more popular sizes were maintained and others were specially ordered, often at expenditures of significant time and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The principal advantage to the filter covered by the patents at issue is its rigidity. Since it did not require a surrounding frame it could be sold in standard sizes with directions to the purchaser to trim the filter mat to the proper size for his unit. This eliminated the need to stock the numerous sizes and the cost and expense involved in special orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The \u2019827 patent itself notes that expanded metal foil is a \u201cknown material * * * long * * * used in the fabrication of filters.\u201d It also reveals that the construction of filters by combining layers of expanded metal foil was within the prior art; common practice was to hold the layers together by stitching with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sewing machine. In some instances this seems to have been only a temporary matter, serving to hold the layers together until the supporting structure, i. e., a frame or grid, was placed on the filter.</p>\n<p id=\"pAbZ\">The Walton patent, No. 2,070,073 (for a gas filter), mentions as one possible filter material \u201claminated metallic * * sheet material\u201d and notes the \u201cgreater stiffness possessed by metals.\u201d Trow-bridge, No. 2,579,984 (for an adhesive coating to be applied to filter), observes \u201cthe filtering media may comprise laminations of expanded paper, expanded metal * * * \u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1967) defines \u201claminated\u201d as \u201ccomposed of layers of firmly united materials.\u201d There is no serious dispute that filters manufactured in this manner ordinarily were insufficiently rigid to be used without a surrounding frame and thus could not be sold on a \u201ccut-to-size\u201d basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">There is convincing evidence that the use of bonding agents was known to the prior are. Walton (which is owned by the appellee) provides that the filtering fabric may be composed of woven flat strands of fibrous material. The specifications suggest that woven strands in position (when the fabric has been treated with a thermoplastic substance) \u201cmay be accomplished by heating and cooling the fabric, when the substance softens and unites the strands.\u201d Trowbridge refers to filter units composed of filter packs (preferably made from glass fibers, although expanded metal is listed as one of many alternative materials), and suggests that in constructing them they be sprayed, immediately after their formation, with resin or elastomer \u201cin an amount sufficient to bind the fibers one to another. The resin or elastomer is subsequently hardened.\u201d The specifications continue: \u201cFor example, if a thermosetting resin such as phenol formaldehyde is used, the mats or packs are passed through an oven to polymerize the resin and thereby form a semi-rigid pack.\u201d A given number of the packs are then used to build up a filter of the desired thickness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Also offered as evidence were a number of other patents not dealing specifically with gas filters. Zimarik, No. 2,-697,679, related to a pad (and the method for making it), composed of layers of wire woven mesh, designed for use on pressing boards. The process described for making the pad provided for impregnating the layers of mesh with a bonding materia], placing the mat between two platens which are pressed together, and applying heat. As a result the wire mesh was bonded together.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number> Thus it is clear that the prior art included the following: (a) the use in filters of layers of expanded foil; (b) the practice of laminating these layers together; (c) the knowledge that use of slit and expanded metal sheets rather than alternative materials resulted in a filter of increased rigidity; (d) the application of a bonding agent to filter material which, after heat had been applied, bonded the elements of the material together; (e) the knowledge that the bonding process resulted in increased rigidity (i. e., Trowbridge\u2019s \u201csemi-rigid pack\u201d). Claim 1 does not itself refer to increased rigidity, but giving it the benefit of being read together with the drawings and specifications the most that can be said is that the difference between it and the prior art is that the bonding process itself holds the layers of expanded metal together for the purpose of achieving greater rigidity, i. e., that bonding (as opposed to other methods of holding the layers together) provides the full strength potentialities of the expanded foil and the elements thereof. We conclude that this would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art and thus was not patentable. The District Court observed that a number of patents relied upon by National Filters as prior art (including Zimarik) were classified in a different main class of subject matter by the Patent Office or did not teach a filter, and concluded, \u201cThis indicates a difference in art, and while not conclusive, it at least raises a presumption that the several patents are not in an applicable art with the 827 patent.\u201d It is, of course, true that patents in \u201ca remote, non-analogous art * * * do not anticipate.\u201d Cincinnati Rubber Mfg. Co. v. Stowe-Woodward, Inc., 111 F.2d 239, 240 (6th Cir. 1940).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cA reasonable test is, whether the art from which the citations against the patents were drawn, was so remote that students of the questioned art would not naturally have looked there for help.\u201d General Metals Powder Co. v. S. K. Wellman Co., 157 F.2d 505, 510 (6th Cir. 1946). \u201c\u2018[P]rior art\u2019may include * * * similar devices whether or not in related areas to the patented device and with respect to a simple mechanical device utilizing universally known principles permits reference to the field of mechanics itself.\u201d Skee-Trainer, Inc. v. Garelick Mfg. Co., 361 F.2d 895, 898 (8th Cir. 1966). Where, as here, the question is the obviousness of a method of making a mat of a number of layers of material to be bonded together, we may properly give weight to processes used to construct similar mats, although the mats may be intended for a different use. Cf. Jiffy Enterprises, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 306 F.2d 240, 243 (3d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">It would serve no purpose to explore either the details of what earlier patents were (and were not) cited to the Patent Office, or the theory of appellant that appellee misrepresented the Walton patent to the Patent Office, or the effect on the statutory presumption of validity under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 282. Assuming there was a presumption it could not override the obviousness shown by this record. (Zero Mfg. Co. v. Mississippi Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, 358 F.2d at 857; also see footnote 4, Sisko v. Southern Resin &amp; Fiberglass Corp., supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> There is evidence that appellee\u2019s filter has enjoyed commercial success. This is a secondary index of obviousness under <em>John Deere. </em>It does not alone prove the item non-obvious but is only one factor to be considered along with other factual data and matters of which the court has judicial knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Nor can claim 1 of the method patent stand. The result is held above to be obvious. Walton and Trowbridge reveal the application of a bonding agent and heat. Zimarik suggests, and we agree, that given the desired and obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>result and the methods known to the pri- or art, the application of pressure was, if not in fact known to the prior art, obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\">. By stipulation the issues were restricted to Claim 1 of each patent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">Claim 1 of \u2019827 is: \u201cA filter comprising a plurality of layers of expanded metal foil arranged in close order with the structural elements of the several layers engaging the structural elements of adjacent layers at a multiplicity of points throughout said filter, the engaging elements being bonded together at at least a substantial proportion of said multiplicity of points by a bonding agent whereby to hold all of said layers of the filter together.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">Claim 1 of \u2019560 is: \u201cA method for making a rigid filter comprising the steps of stacking a plurality of layers of expanded malleable metal foil, applying a settable liquid bonding composition to the stack and distributing the composition throughout the thickness thereof, applying a moderate pressure to said stack to increase the number of points of engagement of adjacent layers, and causing said composition to set while said stack is so pressed together to bond engaging elements of said expanded metal foil layers togeth.er.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-21\">. 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\">. This conclusion makes unnecessary any discussion of infringement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">. Cf. Bartels, No. 2,829,733, assigned to Research Products, for air filters composed of compacted openmeshed sheet material. By compressing sheets of split and expanded metal foil this invention achieves an interlocking of the webs of the foil; as a result, the filter is relatively firm in shape and \u201cno external binding elements are required to maintain the body in the desired shape and size * * The filter body is described in the claims as \u201cself-sustaining.\u201d While this does not teach the use of a bonding agent it does indicate that the prior art contained the knowledge that constructing a filter of split and expanded metal foil in such a way that the foil interlocked would result in a relatively stable filter body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">. Holland, No. 2,860,740, describes joining or splicing two pieces of aluminum \u201choneycomb\u201d together \u201cby dipping or coating the spliced areas with a suitable liquid adliesive which can be dried or cured to provide a strong cementitious bond between the inner locked or spliced elements of the two sheets.\u201d By coating the spliced joints with various described resins, and curing, the spliced joint becomes as strong as the honeycomb pieces.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-14\">. The examiner of the \u2019827 application rejected it on the theory that Trowbridge disclosed the use of a bonding medium to secure layers of expanded metal foil comprising a filter. The Board of Appeal reversed, holding that Trowbridge described the use of a bonding medium only with reference to filters made of glass fibers. The Board of Appeal expressly noted that it was not considering \u201cwhether or not it would be obvious or patentable to use a bonding medium in lieu of other methods of securing metal foil laminations in a filter.\u201d Unfortunately the examiner- did not pursue this inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b574-4\">. One commentator has stated that the meaning of \u201cpertinent\u201d prior art, while a crucial issue before <em>John Deere </em>and more important after the decision, has barely been touched on in the cases or the secondary literature.
