The appellant had first brought a petition seeking to reach certain real property claimed by Wallace Williams, Executor of the estate of his father, Troup L. Williams. A second petition sought to require the individual members of the Williams family to file their own schedules in bankruptcy. Appellant bases his argument for summary jurisdiction on the contention that the corporation was a sham \u2014 merely a form ignored by the family \u2014 and the court should make no more distinction between them than did the family itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">The determinative question presented is whether by a summary procedure the Referee in Bankruptcy can compel the individual members of the Williams family (appellees) to file schedules in bankruptcy. We find he cannot. The appellees assert absolute title to the property sought. There is no indication that the bankrupt corporation was ever in actual possession of the property. The appellees are in possession and acquired that possession before the beginning of this proceeding in bankruptcy. The record discloses that none of the appellees participated actively in the management or operation of the corporation. The corporate affairs were managed almost entirely by the decedent, Troup L. Williams. The order of the Referee in Bankruptcy, made after a full and careful hearing, finding the appellees\u2019 claims to be more than merely colorable but substantial, and the decision of the district court which sustained that finding are amply supported by the record and should not be disturbed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">There was no consent to summary jurisdiction by the appellees. The corporation was never in possession of the property sought. The only basis for subjecting the individual assets to the debts of the corporation is on the basis of fraud. This is not a proper issue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>be decided in a summary manner under the facts disclosed by the record. We cannot accept such an abrogation of an individual\u2019s rights to a plenary proceeding. Suhl v. Bumb, 348 F.2d 869 (9 Cir. 1965); Jackson v. Sports Company of Texas, Inc., 278 F.2d 716 (5 Cir. 1960); Fox Jewelry Company v. Lee, 264 F.2d 720 (5 Cir. 1959); Nicholas v. Peter Pan Snack Shop, Inc., 256 F.2d 349 (5 Cir. 1958); Nicholas v. Cohn, 255 F.2d 301 (5 Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\">. The following is from appellant\u2019s specification of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">\u201cThe lower court erred in not taking summary jurisdiction of, the matters raised by the two petitions brought by the Trustee which sought to strike down the corporation, pierce the corporate veil and make the individual members of the Williams family parties to the cause requiring them to file their individual schedules in bankruptcy.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\">. The following finding by the Referee is amply supported by substantial evidence :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-17\">\u201cThis record does not demonstrate the absence of an arguable factual basis for the claims of these individuals. Certainly these claims have a plausable foundation in the law. It must be concluded that the claims of these individuals are bona fide.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
