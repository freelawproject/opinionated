Appellant was tried jointly with his co-defendant, Samuel Eugene Smith, and both were convicted. Smith\u2019s conviction on appeal was affirmed by this Court July 18, 1966, 363 F.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-24\">We disposed of the search question there in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-25\">\u201cThe court did not err in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>dence of whiskey seized without a warrant. The facts that had come to the attention of the arresting officers were \u2018sufficient, in the circumstances, to lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that liquor [was] illegally possessed in the automobile to be searched.\u2019 Husty v. United States, 1931, 282 U.S. 694, 701, 51 S.Ct. 240, 242, 75 L.Ed. 629, 632. The seizure of the whiskey followed a familiar pattern. An informer reported to government agents that he would drive automobiles containing untaxed liquor to a rendezvous with the arresting officers. He did. See Bruner v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 621. The trial judge had ample opportunity to affirm the informer\u2019s record of reliability; the informer testified at the trial. Cf. Bruner v. United States, supra, 293 F.2d at 622.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXq\">Nothing presented on this appeal requires or even permits a different result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUn\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">. The holding of this Court in Williams v. United States, No. 24456, decided July 31, 1967, 382 F.2d 48, is not apposite here. We view that decision (as is true of most search cases) as based on the peculiar circumstances there present, entirely different from those in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
