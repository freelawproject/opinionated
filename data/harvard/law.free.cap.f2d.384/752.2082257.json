Collins withheld certain payments from Red Top because of disputes over various delays and extras on the project. When Collins refused to pay, Red Top brought suit against the general contractor and its surety, the appellant in this case. Before trial, the surety paid the principal claim. The parties stipulated that they would \u201cproceed to judgment only on the question of the recoverability of attorneys fees and that the remainder of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action * * * be dismissed with prejudice\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>also stipulated that reasonable attorneys fees would be $1000. The court below found that under the Miller Act and \u201cthe substantive law of the State of Texas\u201d, the plaintiff was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a-270d, requires a \u201cpayment bond * * * for the protection of all persons - supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work\u201d under a government construction contract. A plaintiff suing on the bond is denied his usual option of a state forum. The Act requires him to sue in a United States district court and in the name of the United States. The surety contends that since the Miller Act is silent on the subject of liability for attorneys\u2019 fees, state law controls. We hold (1) that federal law controls; (2) that since the Miller Act is silent on the question of attorneys\u2019 fees, the purpose of the Act must be examined for guidance in the resolution of this question; and (3) that the purpose of the Act suggests incorporation of state law. State law, therefore, does not operate of its own force to determine the scope of the surety\u2019s liability on a Miller Act bond: The primary law is the Miller Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">A. We see the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees as an element of the supplier\u2019s federal statutory right to protection under the Miller Act. This right does not originate in the common law or in Texas statutes. It comes from a congressional statute providing for a \u201cpayment\u201d bond giving \u201cprotection\u201d to all persons supplying labor and materials on a government contract. It is a federally created cause of action; it must be brought in the name of the United States; and Congress has vested federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction over all suits to enforce the action. In this view of the case, the Court is not construing the subcontract between the general contractor and the supplier. The Court is construing a federal statute and the bond issued in compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">In this Court\u2019s most recent opinion in this area of the law, Judge Rives wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-14\"><em>The Miller Act bond, is not limited to the payment for labor and materials </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>* * * but is \u201cfor the protection of all persons supplying labor and material etc.\u201d 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270a (a) (2). It must be construed liberally in order to effectuate the purpose of Congress. Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co., 1917, 244 U.S. 376, 378, 37 S.Ct. 614, 61 L.Ed. 1206. Article 2226, Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes of Texas provides for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees on claims for labor done and material furnished, inter alia. <em>The Miller Act bond covers this statutory right of a person .supplying labor and materials to the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees. </em>Boyd Callan, Inc. v. United States, 1964, 5 Cir., 328 F.2d 505, 512 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">We recognize that the Court in that case looked to Texas law as governing resolution of the attorneys\u2019 fees issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> just as we do in this case. We emphasize, however, that state law \u201cgoverns\u201d only through incorporation into federal law, not through its own force.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The First Circuit, in ruling that the obligation of a surety on a bond furnished under the Act must be determined by federal law, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">The Miller Act implements a congressional policy that a bond with surety shall provide protection for persons supplying labor and materials for the construction or improvement of federal property. A suit under the Miller Act does not depend on diversity of citizenship <em>but is a special, federal right of action limited to a federal court.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>American Auto Ins. Co. v. United States for the Use and Benefit of Luce, 1959, 269 F.2d 406, 408 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has said: \u201cOn the issue of Continental\u2019s liability on the payment bond, the federal law should control because the determination of the extent of the liability involves the construction of a federal statute, the Miller Act, under which it was created.\u201d Continental Casualty Co. v. Shaefer, 1949, 9 Cir., 173 F.2d 5, cert. denied 337 U.S. 940, 69 S.Ct. 1517, 93 L.Ed. 1745 (1949). \u201cAnd even where the rights of the subcontractor against the contractor are determined by state law, the liability of the contractor\u2019s surety will be governed by federal law because the determination of the extent of the liability involves the construction of the Miller Act.\u201d 1A Moore, Federal Practice ft 0.323(16), at p. 1730. See also American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, T.D. No. 3, App.C., (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Directly in point is United States ex rel. Crowder v. Fidelity and Deposit Co., W.D.La. 1956, 144 F.Supp. 322. Subsequent to the termination of a subcontract by mutual consent of the subcontractor and the general contractor, the general contractor involved in that case wrongfully obtained an injunction restraining the subcontractor from the use of the subcontractor\u2019s equipment that was on the job at the termination of the subcontract. The question was whether a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee for dissolving that injunction was an item of damages which might be allowed. The court observed that under Louisiana law recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees would be allowed. But Judge Hunter held, after referring to the Louisiana law, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">the question as to whether or not such attorney\u2019s fees can be collected under the Miller Act in this suit must be determined by the federal law. No authorities have been cited. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>this particular portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not based on negligence or on contract, and we think that under the Miller Act they are entitled to recover not'only the fair rental value of the equipment, but also the expense to them of recouping it in cases where the recoupment is from the contractor and was made necessary by his action in retaining it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Cf. United States for Benefit and on Behalf of Sherman v. Carter, 1957, 353 U.S. 210, 77 S.Ct. 793, 1 L.Ed.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"> B. When we look to the relevant \u201cfederal law\u201d, the Miller Act, we. find that law silent on the question of attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act itself does not provide that they may or may not be allowed; neither does it specify that the question is to be determined according to state law. The purpose of the Act gives some guidance to resolution of the issue presently before this Court. Interpreting the Act in Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co., 1917, 244 U.S. 376, 380, 37 S.Ct. 614, 616, 61 L.Ed. 1206, Mr. Justice Brandeis said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">The purpose of the act was to provide security for the payment of all persons who provide labor or material on public work. This was done by giving a <em>claim under the bond in lieu of the lien upon land and buildings customary where property is owned by private persons. </em>Decisions of this court have made it clear that the statute and bonds given under it must be construed liberally, in order to effectuate the purpose of Congress as declared in the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The liens to which Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is referred in the italicized portion of the above quotation would, of course, be controlled by state law. We see no reason why a contractor whose remedy stems from a federal statute should have the question of attorneys\u2019 fees governed by a different law from that governing a contractor whose remedy arises under state law, <em>when the federal remedy was intended to be in lieu of the state </em>remedy. Persons who provide labor and material on public works have no lien rights against the United States. The Miller Act itself reflects the Nation\u2019s interest in seeing that mechanics and material-men engaged in work for the national government are protected at least as well as are those engaged in private work whom the state protects. It seems reasonable therefore to look to state policy to determine whether the \u201cprotection\u201d afforded by \u201cpayment\u201d encompasses full recoupment of all costs and damages, such as attorneys\u2019 fees. We hold, therefore, that the supplier\u2019s statutory right to \u201cpayment\u201d includes the right to attorneys\u2019 fees \u2014 if the work is performed in a state allowing a supplier on private projects to recover such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Thus, although federal law controls the determination of this case, state law is \u201cincorporated\u201d to fill the hiatus in the statute. There \u201cis a need to integrate the operation of a federal program with the daily routine activities of citizens under the laws of the several states.\u201d See Bank of America National Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n. v. Parnell, 1956, 352 U.S. 29, 77 S.Ct. 119, 1 L.Ed.2d 93; RFC v. Beaver County, 1946, 328 U.S. 204, 66 S.Ct. 992, 90 L.Ed. 1172; Mishkin, The Variousness of \u201cFederal Law\u201d: Competence and Discretion in the Choice of National and State Rules of Decision, 105 U.Pa. L.Rev. 797, 804 (1957). In the protection of materialmen and mechanics Texas uniformity seems more appropriate than federal uniformity. See Morgan, The Future of a Federal Common Law, 17 Ala. L.Rev. 10, 28 (1964). There is no overriding national interest in allowing suppliers on government contracts in Texas to recover attorneys\u2019 fees, when they would not recover such fees if they were suppliers on state public works or private contracts in Texas. There would be a national interest in allowing their recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, if the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>States should suffer because of the superior position of suppliers on state public works or private contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">We turn now to the relevant Texas law to determine whether attorneys\u2019 fees are recoverable under the local version of the Miller Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Texas cases hold that in the absence of a statute or a contractual agreement, attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable. William Cameron &amp; Co. v. American Surety Co. of New York, Tex.Com.App. 1932, 55 S.W.2d 1032. In this case before the court both a statute and a contract bear on the problem. The statute is Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes, article 2226. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">Any person having a valid claim against a person or corporation for personal services rendered, labor done, [or] material furnished * * * may present the same to such person or corporation or to any duly authorized agent thereof; and if, at the expiration of thirty (30) days thereafter, the claim has not been paid or satisfied, and he should finally obtain judgment for any amount thereof * * * he may also recover, in' addition to his claim and costs, a reasonable amount as attorney\u2019s fees, if represented by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The only language from the suretyship contract set out in the record is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">Now Therefore, if the principal shall promptly make payment to all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract, and any and all duly authorized modifications of said contract that may hereafter be made, notice of which modifications to the surety being hereby waived, then this obligation to be void; otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">The Texas courts require strong language in a suretyship contract before they will allow the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. Where the contract provides that the surety will indemnify the claimant for \u201call cost and damage\u201d arising from a breach of the contract, attorneys fees are not recoverable. William Cameron &amp; Co. v. American Surety Co. of New York, supra. Similarly, where the contract is to indemnify \u201cagainst all loss which may be incurred\u201d, attorneys\u2019 fees are not allowed. American Surety Co. of New York v. Phillips, Tex.Civ.App.1917, 198 S.W. 623. In a case construing a Miller Act bond apparently identical with the bond in question here, one Court of Civil Appeals disallowed attorneys\u2019 fees. F. &amp; C. Engineering Co. v. Moore, Tex.Civ.App.1957, 300 S.W.2d 323. Only where the contract provided for the payment of \u201call costs and expenses\u201d incurred \u201cin the prosecution of any suit * * * on account of any breaches of said contract, or of this bond * *\u201d were attorneys\u2019 fees allowed. Mundy v. Knutson Constr. Co., 1956, 156 Tex. 211, 294 S.W.2d 371. We conclude that under Texas law the suretyship contract here does not obligate the surety to pay attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">We turn, therefore, to the statute. Transamerica argues that article 2226 provides attorneys\u2019 fees only on claims for services and materials. While the claim against the contractor is for such services and materials, so the argument goes, the action against the surety is on the bond, not for labor or materials. Red Top supplied no labor or materials to Transamerica. Therefore article 2226 does not apply. Red Top counters by citing numerous cases from Texas and from this Court construing article 2226 to allow the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees from the surety. It urges that the Miller Act and article 5160 of the Texas Civil Statutes, taken from the Miller Act, give the supplier a valid claim directly against the surety for labor and materials, and that article 2226 is therefore applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Prior to April of this year considerable confusion in the Texas law existed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A melange of Court of Civil Appeals decisions, some of them conflicting, gave no clear indication of whether attorneys\u2019 fees were recoverable against a surety under article 2226, the general attorneys\u2019 fees statute. And this circuit was occasionally called upon to attempt to untangle these knotty Texas decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally April 26, in New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Texas Industries Inc., 1967, 414 S.W.2d 914, the Texas Supreme Court cut the Gordian knot. In that case Judge Steakley asserted unconditionally that \u201c[u]nder the limited coverage of its provisions, Article 2226 has no application to the claim of an unpaid materialman against the surety on an Article 5160 payment bond. The claim and ensuing suit are grounded entirely on the surety obligation. The material was furnished not to the surety but to the contractor-principal.\u201d The opinion, based on a literal reading of the relevant statutory provisions, now establishes that attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable by a materialman on a nonfederal works project in Texas. Accordingly, we hold that under federal law the materialman <em>in the present case </em>has no greater protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The plaintiff is therefore not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees, and the judgment of the district court awarding them must be</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-16\">. The surety argues' that since the demand was dismissed, leaving only the ancillary claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, there was no case before the court. For under Texas law suit may not be brought for attorneys\u2019 fees only. Huff v. Fidelity Union Life Insurance Co., 1958, 158 Tex. 433, 312 S.W.2d 493. This contention assumes that the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees is created and controlled by state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>law. The <em>surety </em>concludes <em>that the court </em>would have jurisdiction to decide this issue only by virtue of the <em>Hum </em>doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. Hurn v. Oursler, 1933, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148. But, so runs the argument, <em>Hum </em>requires no loyalty in a ease where the sole federal issue has become moot before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The <em>Hum </em>doctrine is inapplicable. The claim based on supplying labor material and the claim for attorney\u2019s fees are not separate grounds for the same cause of action; not \u201cdifferent avenues seeking to reach the same end * * * alternative theories of recovery for a single wrong\u201d. The claim for attorneys\u2019 fees is one ingredient of the supplier\u2019s claim for protection of his statutory right under the Miller Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Jurisdiction admittedly attached when suit was filed on the Miller Act bond. The district court therefore continued to have jurisdiction,- regardless of the disposition of the labor-and-material element of the claim. Even if it be assumed that the right to attorneys\u2019 fees is state-created and severable from the principal claim, the district court would have jurisdiction to decide the question. \u201cThe Federal questions * <em>* * </em>gave the circuit court jurisdiction, and, having properly obtained it, that court had the right to decide all the questions in the case, even though it decided the Federal questions adversely to the party raising them, or even if it omitted to decide them at all, but decided the case on local or state questions only.\u201d Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Rairoad Co., 1909, 213 U.S. 175, 29 S.Ct. 451, 53 L.Ed. 753. See Osborn v. Bank of United States, 1824, 9 Wheat 738, 6 L.Ed. 204. As Professor Charles Alan Wright has observed: \u201cWhen the Supreme Court is reviewing a state court decision it can and does confine its review to the federal question in the ease, but a court of original jurisdiction could not function, as Marshall recognized, unless it had power to decide all the questions which the case presents. This functional justification of the Osborn rule finds support also in the constitutional language, <em>which grants jurisdiction over \u2018cases\u2019 rather than over \u2018questions\u2019.\u2019\u2019 </em>Wright, Federal Courts, \u00a7 19, p. 55 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">.
