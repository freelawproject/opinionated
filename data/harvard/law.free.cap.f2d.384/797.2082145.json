Plaintiff seeks an injunction and damages. The district court dismissed the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction over defendants, and plaintiff has appealed. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">Shandon/London manufactures scientific equipment for biological and biochemical laboratories. Beginning in 1959 plaintiff acted as exclusive United States distributor. In May, 1963, this relationship was expressed in a written five-year contract. In September, 1965, the parties agreed to terminate the 1963 contract, and a new written contract was made on October 6, 1965, under which plaintiff was no longer exclusive distributor. In May, 1966, Shandon/Pennsylvania was incorporated. On August 6, 1966, Ernest Shandon, representing Shandon/London, wrote plaintiff terminating the agreement, and this action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">The vital questions are whether plaintiff\u2019s contract claim arises from the transaction of business in Illinois by Shandon/London within the meaning of the \u201clong arm\u201d statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Shandon/Pennsylvania, Welch, and Ernest Shandon committed tortious acts in Illinois within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">So far as pertinent here, the complaint alleges in substance that the negotiations leading to the 1963 contract with Shandon/London were carried on in Illinois and England; that plaintiff\u2019s efforts greatly expanded the United States market for Shandon products; that the products were shipped from England to Illinois and paid for in.Illinois; that following negotiations in Illinois in June and July, 1965 between plaintiff and Shandon/London, represented by Ernest Shandon, they agreed to a new contractual relationship in October, 1965, which was accepted by plaintiff in Illinois; that by the terms of this agreement plaintiff was to be appointed a major United States dealer for Shandon products by an American company to be formed as \u201cmain distributor\u201d; that after the formation of Shandon/Pennsylvania in May, 1966, it was operated not as \u201cmain distributor\u201d but as a direct seller; and that United States customers of Shandon/London, including plaintiff\u2019s, were notified of the direct sales policy in trade journals and press releases distributed in Illinois. The complaint alleges further that Shandon/London terminated and thereby breached the October 6, 1965 contract by a letter dated August 6, 1966; and that Shandon/Pennsylvania, Welch and Ernest Shandon maliciously induced the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">George Welch and Ernest Shandon filed affidavits in support of the motion to dismiss. They assert that in June, 1965, they met with plaintiff\u2019s Director, Dr. Scherr, for <em>3y2 </em>or 4 hours. Welch states that the June 23, 1965, discussion concerned the formation of Shandon/ Pennsylvania and its function as supplier of Shandon products \u201cdirectly through representatives and * * * dealers.\u201d Ernest Shandon states that the discussion was on June 28 and concerned plaintiff\u2019s failure to perform under the 1963 agreement with respect to terms of payment, failure to promote Shandon\u2019s products \u201cas such,\u201d and failure to provide growth in sales. He states that there was no subsequent meeting in Illinois regarding cancellation of the 1963 agreement and that no agreement was reached in Illinois to cancel, but that in September Scherr appeared in London to address Shandon/London\u2019s Board of Directors with respect to the 1963 agreement; that after the meeting Scherr was advised in London that the agreement was to be cancelled; that Scherr agreed but brought the \u201cMemorandum of Agreement\u201d back to Illinois, signed it there and sent it to England on October 6, 1965; and that no Shandon company has offices or bank accounts in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Dr. Scherr filed an affidavit stating that twice between October, 1959, and May, 1963, Ernest Shandon and Newman, Shandon/London\u2019s export manager, came to Illinois to discuss formalizing the distributorship relation between Shandon and plaintiff; that copies of the signed May 15, 1963, contract were mailed to Scherr in Illinois; that in May, 1964, Ernest Shandon discussed a new contract with Scherr in Illinois to \u201creduce three significant problems\u201d in the 1963 agreement: new styling of Shandon products, more expeditious shipping by Shandon/London and allocation of the credit burden between the parties; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>that the June 28, 1965, Illinois meeting between Scherr and three Shandon representatives lasted most of the business day; that they discussed the formation of Shandon/Pennsylvania and plaintiff\u2019s relationship with it; that on June 30 and July 1 a Shandon representative met again in Illinois with Scherr; that at no meeting was cancellation of the 1963 agreement discussed, although Shandon on June 28 expressed dissatisfaction with lack of growth of business but held plaintiff blameless; that plaintiff fully performed under that contract; that Scherr appeared in London to discuss a proposed \u201cjoint venture\u201d between plaintiff and the planned Shandon/Pennsylvania, but that the \u201cmain distributor\u201d idea was agreed to; that the \u201cMemorandum of Agreement\u201d was signed by him in Illinois, and mailed to England; and that four named periodicals printed the advertisement of Shandon/Pennsylvania and that Shandon/Pennsylvania solicited sales in Illinois by letter. This last statement was supported by a copy of a letter of August 17, 1966, from Welch to an Illinois hospital enclosing a catalogue of Shandon/Pennsylvania products, promising a list of prices, and offering to quote prices on products from \u201cstock\u201d in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The district court decided that Shandon/London transacted business in Illinois under the 1963 contract but that it did not do business in Illinois under the contract sued upon, the agreement of October, 1965. The district court held it had no jurisdiction over defendant Shandon/London because the claim did not <em>arise from </em>the transaction of business. With respect to the other defendants, Shandon/Pennsylvania, Welch and Shandon, the court decided that, although their alleged actions were tortious acts committed in Illinois, the exercise of jurisdiction over them would violate due process under Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958). The court distinguished McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), because defendant there actively solicited and serviced plaintiff in his home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The evidence of sufficient contacts within a state, to avoid violation of due process by substitute service on non-residents, depends upon the particular facts of each case. Gray v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., 22 Ill.2d 432, 176 N.E.2d 761, 767 (1961). The service there was sustained in a tort case, where defendants only contact in Illinois was its sale in the course of commerce there of a valve put into a water heater in Pennsylvania which exploded and injured plaintiff. This is the pioneer and leading Illinois case determining the \u201cextent to which due process permits substituted service where defendant had no agent or employee\u201d in Illinois. 176 N.E.2d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">It is needless to discuss the evolution of this idea of valid service from a forum state upon non-resident defendants, brought about by the nationalization of commerce through the use of the mails and otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Grobark v. Addo Machine Co., 16 Ill.2d 426, 158 N.E.2d 73 (1959); Gray v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., 176 N.E.2d at 765. The due process implications were settled in International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), and Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958). There must be sufficient \u201cminimum contacts\u201d to make it reasonable and just according to our traditional concepts of fair play and substantial justice to satisfy due process requirements. See also National Gas Appliance Corp. v. AB Electrolux, 270 F.2d 472, 475 (7th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 959, 80 S.Ct. 584, 4 L.Ed.2d 542 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The Illinois Supreme Court in <em>Gray </em>said that requirements for juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>diction \u201chave been further relaxed\u201d since <em>International Shoe </em>and now it is enough that the \u201cact or transaction itself\u201d has a substantial connection with the forum state. 176 N.E.2d at 764. The court also said that the relevant inquiry as to the \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d test is whether defendant engaged in an act or in conduct by which he may be said to have invoked the benefits and protections of the forum state. The trend, it is said, in defining due process is away from territorial limitations and toward emphasis on notice and opportunity 'to be heard. But \u201cprocedural rules must be designed and appraised in the light of what is fair and just to both sides\u201d. 176 N.E.2d at 766. The legislative intent of the Illinois long arm statute is to exert jurisdiction over non-residents to the extent permitted under the due process clause. Koplin v. Thomas, Haab and Botts, 73 Ill.App.2d 242, 219 N.E.2d 646, 649 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Following the <em>Gray </em>decision, the Appellate Court of Illinois in 1966 in Koplin v. Thomas, speaking through Justice Dempsey, decided that physical presence, although a factor in the jurisdictional question, is not the controlling factor. It said that in <em>Gray </em>the Supreme Court had decided effectually that physical presence was not required in personal injury cases to establish jurisdiction and that it saw no \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for distinguishing personal injury cases from business transactions. See also Ziegler v. Houghton-Mifflin Co., 80 Ill.App.2d 210, 224 N.E.2d 12 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">\n<em>Shandon/London</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The district court decision as to Shandon/London rested on the implicit finding that all that had transpired in Illinois before the making of the October, 1965, contract was irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction. We consider this a too restricted view of the facts, although it is not necessary for us to discuss transactions under the 1963 contract in isolation because of the transaction of business leading to and .pursuant to the October 1965 contract. The 1965 contract was developed from the earlier relationship beginning in 1959 and was effectually a modification thereof under which Shandon\u2019s products were shipped into Illinois, sold and paid for. Part of the negotiations for both the 1963 and 1965 contracts were carried on in Illinois with Ernest Shandon and others representing Shandon/London. The memorandum of the 1965 contract was signed by plaintiff in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">We think these activities in Illinois by and on behalf of Shandon/London bring them within the reach of the Illinois long arm statute. National Gas Appliance Corp. v. AB Electrolux, 270 F.2d at 475. The plaintiff\u2019s claim lies \u201cin the wake\u201d of defendant\u2019s Illinois business activities. Koplin v. Thomas, 219 N.E.2d at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">This court in Kokomo Opalescent Glass Co. v. Arthur W. Schmid Int\u2019l., Inc., 371 F.2d 208 (7th Cir. 1966), on authority of <em>National Gas, </em>approved an Indiana district court\u2019s decision that a Pennsylvania resident was subject to the Indiana long arm statute. There defendant in January, 1962,\" contracted to perform its contract with plaintiff within six months. It did not perform until January, 1963, and plaintiff sued for breach. The district court based its decision that service on defendant in Pennsylvania was valid, in part, upon activities of defendant\u2019s agents in Indiana after the breach in August, 1962. We think <em>Kokomo </em>confirms our view that what preceded October 6, 1965, in Illinois is relevant to whether a breach of that contract arose out of the \u201ctransaction of any business\u201d in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">The question then is whether defendant\u2019s Illinois activities constituted \u201cminimum contacts\u201d sufficient to avoid offending \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d We think they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">Starting in 1959 and until August, 1966, the English corporation shipped products into Illinois for sale and distribution in the United States. The inference from the complaint is that there was substantial use and consumption of the products in Illinois and that they en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>joyed, therefore, indirectly, benefits and protection from Illinois laws. Gray v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., 176 N.E.2d at 766. In addition, there is at least \u201ca close relationship\u201d between defendant\u2019s negotiations in and visits to Illinois and plaintiff\u2019s claim for breach of contract. Koplin v. Thomas, 219 N.E.2d at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">We are not persuaded by Shandon/London that the mechanics of its sales by use of bills of exchange transmitted from the English bank to plaintiff\u2019s Illinois bank with necessity of guarantee of payment within ninety days after acceptance, removes them from the benefits or protection of Illinois law.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\n<em>Shandon/Pennsylvania. Welch &amp; Ernest Shandon</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The tortious conduct alleged by plaintiff is that Shandon/Pennsylvania, Welch and Ernest Shandon knowingly disregarded valuable rights of plaintiff under the 1965 contract in causing the corporation to trespass on those rights by advertising.and soliciting direct sales to customers in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">We think the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>Gray, </em>and the decisions in <em>National Gas </em>and <em>MeGee, </em>are determinative of the issue here. Taken as true, the allegations of the complaint and affidavits establish a \u201ctortious act\u201d in Illinois, because the damage occurred there. Gray v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., 176 N.E.2d at 762-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">We think the service of process is not fundamentally unfair so as to affront due process. Welch and Shandon, knowing that under the 1965 agreement Shandon/Pennsylvania was to be a \u201cmain distributor\u201d with plaintiff a favored dealer and the corporation to limit sales to dealers, created the Pennsylvania, corporation, not as a main distributor limited to sales to dealers but to sell retail in competition with plaintiff. They also engaged in advertising and solicitation in Illinois in furtherance of that purpose. And, taking the allegations of the complaint as true, the visits of Ernest Shandon and Welch to Illinois were closely connected to the inducement of the breach because the formation of Shandon/Pennsylvania enabled Shandon/London to breach its contract with plaintiff while still maintaining its position in the United States market. The decisions of Illinois cases and cases of this court prior to <em>Gray </em>and <em>National Gas, </em>respectively, are of no aid to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\"> We hold that service in England on Ernest Shandon and in Pennsylvania on Welch and the Pennsylvania corporation was valid under the \u201ctortious act\u201d provision of the Illinois statute, and that the defendant\u2019s contacts were enough to satisfy due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-10\">. Shandon Scientific Industries, Ltd., was formerly named Shandon Scientific Co., Ltd. Defendant Shandon Scientific Co., Ltd., was formerly called Shandon Scientific Co. (Sales), Ltd.
