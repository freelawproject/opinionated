The defendant was indicted on October 27, 1965, together with five other individuals, under an 18-count indictment charging violation of the criminal provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331 and 333) and, in the first count, a conspiracy with the other defendants to commit offenses and to cause the commission of offenses prohibited by such Act, specifically viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>tions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a), \u00a7 331 (k), and \u00a7 333(b), such conspiracy being alleged to be in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Defendant was charged with separate crimes in the first six counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">On November 12, 1965, Norman Fischbein entered his appearance for the above defendant. On jbhe same date, the defendant, with his counsel present, entered a plea of not guilty to the above six counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Apparently between November 12, 1965, and September 1966, defendant also consulted another attorney, who was familiar with a related civil case involving the same subject matter as that contained in the indictment, and Mr. Fischbein had sent such attorney, whose office was in New York, \u201ca portion of the file.\u201d On September 13, 1966, defendant came to Mr. Fischbein\u2019s office incident to preparation for the trial and told Mr. Fischbein that \u201che could not afford to pay me.\u201d At that time, Mr. Fischbein was discharged as defendant\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The defendant went from Mr. Fischbein\u2019s office to the United States Attorney\u2019s office and asked to be brought before the court so that he could enter a plea of guilty to Count 1 of the indictment. He appeared before the court and, after extensive interrogation by the District Court Judge in full compliance with F.R.Crim.P. 11, defendant informed the court that he wanted to dispense with the services of counsel due to \u201cfinancial difficulty\u201d between counsel and himself, even though he had a drawing account of $150.00 a week, and signed a \u201cwaiver of counsel\u201d after it was read to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He asked to enter a plea of guilty to Count 1 of the indictment and was permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">Within a week of December 18, when defendant filed his written application to withdraw his plea, defendant returned to Mr. Fisehbein\u2019s office and stated that, although he had participated in some of the overt acts charged in Count 1, he did not participate in them with knowledge of the purpose of the conspiracy and that he did not intend to break the law. Defendant concedes that he waived counsel voluntarily and he voluntarily entered his plea, but contends that he decided to enter his plea \u201cin a fit of depression\u201d due to family financial difficulties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">Defendant was given a full hearing on his application to withdraw his guilty plea to Count 1 on January 20, 1967. At this hearing it was conceded that earlier in January a jury had returned a verdict of guilty as to the only co-defendant who had gone to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">After a careful review of the record, the court can find no abuse of discretion. The following language in United States v. Ptomey, 366 F.2d 759, 760 (3rd Cir. 1966), is applicable to this record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar-\">\u201cThe trial judge painstakingly reviewed the testimony and searched the record before him to see whether there was anything which would indicate that the defendants were misled or coerced or that their pleas were not freely and understandingly entered and found nothing. We find nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak1\">The sentence and commitment of the District Court and its order of January 20, 1967, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">. Mr. Fischbein informed the court on January 20, 1967:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-8\">\u201cHe said he could not afford to pay me. I told him that I was not assigned to the case, and that if he didn\u2019t want to make arrangements with me that he should make arrangements elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-9\">\u201cHe left my office and I was discharged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Defendant testified on January 20, 1967: \u201cI had faced Mr. Fischbein and had been unable to meet this request for a fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">. At this hearing he testified that he had completed about three years of college (New York University and University of Wisconsin) ; that his education included instruction in American history, with particular reference to the rights guaranteed to American citizens by the Federal Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1010-19\">. It is noted that prior to the entry of the guilty plea on September 13, 1966, the court asked defendant if he had ever had \u201cany mental trouble\u201d and he answered \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He produced no expert testimony to confirm or explain his alleged \u201cfit of depression\u201d at the hearing of January 20, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
