Mr. Cobia made application for and continues to receive compensation for injuries under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-24\">The court found that application for and the continued acceptance of compensation under the FECA foreclosed the appellants from recovering under the Federal Tort Claims Act. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-25\">Appellants argue that United States v. Udy, 381 F.2d 455 (10th Cir. 1967) determined that the collision out of which this claim arose was actionable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the claims grew out of the same collision and this court determined the remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act was available to Udy; however, Udy did not elect to proceed under the FECA and proceeded only under the Tort Claims Act, thereby giving the court an opportunity to exercise its judgment regarding the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">When application is made for FECA benefits, the determination of coverage is made by the Secretary of Labor or his designee and his finding is final and not subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8145, 8128(b). Acceptance of benefits under the FECA is an injured employee\u2019s exclusive remedy. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c); Underwood v. United States, 207 F.2d 862 (10th Cir. 1953); United States v. Browning, 359 F.2d 937 (10th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the appellants have no claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act because they have exercised a choice of procedure which denies review by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
