This court is unable to say with certainty that the trial court erred in submitting the question of the issue of negligence by the driver to the jury. It is rare indeed that the question of negligence in connection with the conduct of automobile drivers in traffic situations such as were present here can be decided as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\"> As to the admission into evidence of the testimony of a doctor concerning visits by the plaintiff on occasions prior to the accident here, it is to be noted that the trial court has a broad discretion to admit evidence that may have prejudicial overtones even when such evidence is admissible under some theory of the case. We conclude that this evidence was not irrelevant on the issue whether Mrs. Gee was in fact pregnant at the time of the injury complained of. The fact that the doctor\u2019s testimony may have had a prejudicial effect because of imputations of possible pregnancy before marriage is not a matter as to which this court can hold that the trial judge\u2019s action was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">The verdicts were small, but the jury could well have found that as to the claimed injury to the automobile, the appellants\u2019 estimate of damage was greatly inflated. The jury may well have taken this into consideration in evaluating the weight to be given to the testimony of the two plaintiffs. We cannot find as a matter of law that these verdicts are so shocking as to warrant a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">There is no evidence to support the appellants\u2019 contention that the verdict was arrived at in any manner contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
