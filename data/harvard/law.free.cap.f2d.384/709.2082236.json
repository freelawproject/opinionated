We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">The incriminating material related to a Dyer Act offense of which the defendant was tried and convicted. The arrest was for the theft of a television set. The defendant, who had engaged a room in a motel, was seen leaving it with a television set. Seen departing the motel area by a back way with his automobile lights out, he sought to flee a high speed chase. When overtaken and stopped, there appeared to be no television set in his car,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but that circumstance did not destroy the probable cause to believe that he had stolen the set. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Certainly there was probable cause for such belief when the police officer took him into custody, for he then knew, additionally, that the set was missing from the motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The testimony disclosing the defendant\u2019s alteration of title documents on another vehicle to describe the stolen one, was obviously relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-25\"> It was later found behind a bush on the motel grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
