ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">These appeals emanate from a judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on a verdict for appellee, as administrator of the estate of his wife. Beatrice H. Butler, against appellants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a hospital and a partnership of radiologists maintaining a laboratory in the hospital premises,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in an action charging negligence contributing to a fall by and resulting injuries to Mrs. Butler during the course of diagnostic X-irradiation in the laboratory shortly before her death,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYN\">Mrs. Butler, who had been receiving treatment from her personal physician for diabetes, became a patient in the hospital on March 23, 1962. The physician\u2019s admission note, entered on her hospital chart the following day, recited that she had experienced \u201crecent weakness, dizziness, and near-syncopal episodes for about 8 days.\u201d The physician ordered certain diagnostic tests, including an intravenous pyelogram \u2014 an X-ray examination of the kidneys during retention of a dye substance previously injected into the blood stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-26\">The hospital\u2019s arrangements for the pyelogram included a requisition prepared by a nurse. The requisition form contained space for a summary of the patient\u2019s history, information the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>characterized as \u201cvery essential.\u201d In that space the nurse wrote \u201cdiabetes with complications\u201d or \u201cdiabetic complications,\u201d omitting further reference to the symptoms recorded on the chart.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">On March 26, Mrs. Butler was moved by wheelchair to the radiological laboratory for the pyelogram. The requisition, but not the chart, accompanied her. She walked to a dressing room, donned a gown and walked to an X-ray table. With the assistance of a student X-ray technician, she stretched horizontally on the table, and the technician made the first picture. Shortly thereafter, a resident radiologist injected the dye substance into a vein in her arm. The technician, continuing the procedures with Mrs. Butler lying supine on the table, made a series of X-rays, the process consuming 20 to 30 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The technician then requested Mrs. Butler to slide toward the bottom end of the table and rest her feet on a foot-board there, explaining that the table would be turned upright. Asked if she could stand, Mrs. Butler replied that she could, and the turning began. Halfway through the maneuver the technician stopped the table and again inquired whether Mrs. Butler was all right and could stand; again the response was in the affirmative.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The technician then completed the rotation to a vertical position and, leaving Mrs. Butler standing without any sort of artificial support, went behind the radiation shield to take</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">the next picture. At that point, Mrs. Butler toppled forward, striking her face against equipment on the floor, and fracturing her left cheekbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">The development of the proof at trial was somewhat a departure from the more usual pattern involving the use of experts to delineate the duties owed by hospitals and radiologists to their patients and to opinionate as to whether they were honored.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The mechanical steps in the pyelogram procedure, including the upright X-ray, were competently shown, as was the fact that dizziness is sometimes but not always a by-product of a diabetic condition. But neither side adduced evidence relative to the existence or efficacy of medical practice in the community regarding the kind of information inserted in radiology requisitions or the precautions taken before vertical irradiation is attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Moreover, the liability issues were submitted for the jury\u2019s decision on a legal theory atypical of malpractice suits. The trial judge charged in substance that the hospital was accountable for a negligent omission from the requisition of data contained in the chart, and the radiologists for a negligent failure to protect the patient, if a proximate cause of the fall and the patient did not contribute to it. But the jury also was told that for purposes of ascertaining whether there was negligence, all parties\u2019 conduct was to be measured by what a reasonable person of ordinary prudence would have done under the same circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Appellants complain that the jury should not have been authorized to assess fault by application of the test these instructions supplied. They also urge that expert testimony was necessary to establish any responsibility and any breach for which they might be charged. We disagree, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">With but few exceptions, none relevant here, society demands that everyone under a duty to use care observe minimally a general standard. Familiarly expressed judicially, the yardstick is that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Beyond this, the law requires those engaging in activities requiring unique knowledge and ability to give a performance commensurate with the undertaking. We have verbalized, in terms of the skill and care customary in the community, the special noncontractual standards which hospitals,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> physicians<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and radiologists <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> must observe.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\"> Thus it is that expert testimony is usually essential in medical malpractice cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With lay jurors unlearned and inexperienced in matters of medical science and technique, there must, when the special tests are to be applied, be explanation in order that they may intelligently determine what the criterion is and whether the defendant\u2019s conduct meets it. And it goes without saying that when liability is to be gauged by special rules, juries must be properly instructed accordingly. We recognize fully these principles and the supporting con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>siderations, and we reemphasize our adherence to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"> There are, however, occasions upon which the acts or omissions of medical professionals can be found to fall below even the standard of reasonably prudent care.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that event, there is no reason, certainly if the plaintiff assents,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> why the rights and liabilities of the parties cannot be adjudicated through an application of that standard to the evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor is there peculiar need for expert testimony on any issue the resolution of which would not extend the jury beyond the range of ordinary lay knowledge and experience. Even where the special medical standard is invoked as the touchstone of liability, \u201cthe proposition that experts alone are qualified to testify as to the manner of treatment of a patient is \u2018sound only when soundly applied,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018there must be, in the nature of things, many instances where the facts alone prove the negligence, and where it is unnecessary to have the opinions of persons skillful in the particular science to show unskillful and negligent treatment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And we have differentiated situations \u201cwhere the question turns on the merits and the performance of scientific treatment,\u201d so that \u201cthe issue may not be resolved by the jury without the aid of expert opinion,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> from \u201can ordinary case of negligence, where the jury is able to solve the question by applying thereto their own experiences\u201d and \u201cthe test is: How would a reasonably prudent man have acted under the circumstances?\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">We consider the case at bar, while slightly hybrid, to be fully amenable to utilization of these principles. The testimony of experts was not indispensable to sagacious resolution of the great bulk of the factual questions, and in the few instances where it was essential it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>was supplied. With the technical aspects of the controversy thus elucidated, the jury\u2019s ultimate determinations could be fashioned on the basis of what in similar circumstances reasonably prudent men would have done.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The jury could have found that the hospital contributed to Mrs. Butler\u2019s tumble by failing to adequately inform the radiologists of the facts contained in its records suggesting a proneness to black out. While its nurse did insert in the requisition \u201cdiabetes with complications\u201d or \u201cdiabetic complications\u201d, a notation the significance of which laymen would not be expected to comprehend on their own, the jury was at liberty to resort to the uncontradicted expert view expressed at trial that not all, but only some, diabetics are predisposed to loss of consciousness. Since the requisition at most communicated to the radiologists the fact that as a diabetic Mrs. Butler might or might not be so affected, while the chart contained data denoting plainly that she was, the jury could properly conclude that a reasonably prudent person would have been more specific than the hospital,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that had it been the fall might not have occurred.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">The jury might appropriately have pursued a similar course in evaluating the conduct of the radiologists. They were on notice not only that Mrs. Butler was a diabetic but also that there were associated complications, and they should have been aware of the medical fact that some diabetics are unsteady afoot. Yet they conducted no examination of the patient on their own, and made no inquiry of the hospital or the attending physician for further information.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And there was testimony, given by experts, that anyone \u2014 even a normal person, and less dubitably a sick person\u2014 might become dizzy on rotation from a supine to an upright position. The jury was free to find that a reasonably prudent person would not have left Mrs. Butler standing alone without adequate safeguards against a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">This decisional route, then, was amply warranted by the evidence. To sustain appellee\u2019s burden,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it had to be \u201csubstantial, more than a scintilla, such as reasonable men might believe,\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>view it was sufficient.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We deem it the more so when it is recalled that appellee was litigating in an area where proof of carelessness may be hard to come by.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">And, rejecting additional contentions advanced by appellants,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>jury\u2019s disposition of the controversy must stand as to each.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We are mindful of the fact that throughout the pretrial stages of the case both appellants asserted defensively that their actions accorded with acceptable medical practice in this locality. However, as we have stated, nothing was introduced on that subject at the trial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> With a prima facie showing that each appellant failed to exercise ordinary care, it was incumbent upon them to g\u00f3 forward with evidence on that score. By this we mean that medical custom may have possessed evidentiary value, and not that conformity with it would necessarily have absolved appellants from liability.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Medical procedures involving the phe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>nomena of everyday lay experience are not immune from a community judgment, made on an informed basis, as to their virtue in terms of what bodily safety minimally entails.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUs\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-15\">.

Mrs. Butler died on May 31, 1962, of diabetic complications apparently unrelated to the fall. Appellee\u2019s complaint was in three counts. The first asserted a claim under the Wrongful Death Act, D.C.Oode \u00a7\u00a7 16-2701 to 16-2703 (1967 ed.), the second a claim under the Survival Act, D.C.Oode \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 to 12-104 (1967 ed.), and the third a claim by appellee individually for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-28\">At the trial, appellee withdrew the first count and appellants\u2019 bid for a directed verdict failed. The jury found for appellee on the second count and for appellants on the third. After the entry of judgment on the verdict, appellants moved unsuccessfully for a judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>or a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">.

In this case we delineated the principle by which the sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict is determined. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-19\">\u201cThe question arises in two phases, causation and negligence. Our function is not to weigh the evidence factually as the jury does. It is to decide whether plaintiff\u2019s case, as made, was strong enough for us to allow the jury to consider it. To do this we must apply some standard. But we cannot weigh plaintiff\u2019s case against defendants\u2019. Less than preponderance is sufficient. How much less is hard to state abstractly. Commonly the case weighed, to stand, is required to be substantial, more than a scintilla, such as a reasonable man might believe. All these are just different ways of saying that less than preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>is required, but the evidence should not be so thin that it would be dangerous for the jury to consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cThe danger to be guarded against is a too obvious and gross miscarriage of justice, a departure too far from established lines of liability. Facts are primarily within the jury\u2019s function. Hence it must be given wide latitude, or trial by jury becomes trial by court. But the jury is not absolute in the realm of fact. Like judges, jurors have weaknesses of emotion and judgment. Unlike judges, they seldom have a background of decision experience against which to check them. Our tradition supplies this through judicial controls. Exclusion of evidence is one. When one side\u2019s case is thin, determining its \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 is another. This really means weighing it factually, not for conviction, but for doubt as to the outcome. The verdict sustained therefore represents the jurors\u2019 conviction that it is right, and the judge\u2019s that it may be right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cThe boundary between substance and shadow is hard to draw. Men, including judges, differ about it, always in concrete cases. What is substance to one may be shadow to another. The line cannot be drawn by magic of word or formula. It is not susceptible of generalization. It is always relevant to the issues and the evidence in a particular case. Hence, in the end, a kind of intuitive evaluation must be made, that the verdict does not or would not shock the judicial sense of justice.\u201d (75 U.S.App.D.O. at 134-135, 124 F.2d at 826-827).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\">. This is our conclusion not only as to the findings of negligence but those as to causation as well. Mrs. Butler\u2019s personal physician testified that the fall could have oeen occasioned by (a) failing vision, (b) diseased legs, (c) weakness or dizziness related to mild anemia, or (d) dizziness upon movement from a horizontal to a vertical position. To this we may add the possibility of a voluntary movement by the patient. The physician did not equate the possibilities, and was unable to identify the actual cause here. As appellants argue, a defendant\u2019s liability is not established by evidence denoting equally probable causes of injury for one or more of which a defendant is not responsible. Kasmer v. Sternal, 83 U.S. App.D.C. 50, 52, 165 F.2d 624, 626 (1948). But \u201c[t]he law is not so exacting that it requires proof of negligence or causation by testimony so clear that it excludes every other speculative theory.\u201d Christie v. Callahan, <em>supra </em>note 12, 75 U.S.App.D.C. at 148, 124 F.2d at 840. See also the cases collected in Annot., 13 A.L.R.2d 11, 24-31 (1950). We think the jury could legitimately find on a fair preponderance of the evidence a reasonable probability that the hospital\u2019s omission of data on the requisition and the radiologists\u2019 handling of the patient in the laboratory concurred proximately in causing the fall.

He is, presumably, an expert. The patient is a layman. The physician knows what is done and what is its significance. The patient may or may not know what is done. He seldom knows its significance. He judges ehiefly by results. The physician has the patient in his confidence, disarmed against suspicion. Physicians like lawyers, are loath to testify a fellow craftsman has been negligent, especially when he is highly reputable in professional character, as are these defendants. In short, the physician has the advantage of knowledge and of proof. This increases when he is a specialist. What therefore might be slight evidence when there is no such advantage, as in ordinary negligence cases, takes on greater weight in malpractice suits.\u201d Christie v. Callahan, <em>supra </em>note 12, 75 U.S.App.D.C. at 135-136, 124 F.2d at 827-828. See also Goodwin v.
