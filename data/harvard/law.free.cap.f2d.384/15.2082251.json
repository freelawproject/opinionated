ACF Industries, Incorporated, Chrysler Corporation and General Motors Corporation. The order (1) set aside a previous stay order entered by the Honorable Dorwin W. Suttle, another Judge of the same District Court, (2) overruled ACF Industries\u2019 <em>forum non conveniens </em>motion, and (3) overruled ACF\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of venue. It was stipulated on oral argument that Respondent\u2019s brief filed April 11, 1967 should be treated as its answer to the petition for mandamus required by Fifth Circuit Rule 13a.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">ACF, on behalf of two of its employees, and Victor Hecht, each separately submitted an application for a patent on^ the same or substantially the same carburetor valve. Inadvertently overlooking ACF\u2019s pending application, the Patent Office issued a patent to Hecht. The Patent Office thereafter declared an interference to determine which applicant should be awarded the patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">While the interference proceeding was pending, Hecht filed an action in the Western District of Texas against ACF and its customers, General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Corporation, alleging infringement of his patent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Eleven days later, ACF filed a suit in the District of Kansas against Hecht, asking for a declaratory judgment that Hecht\u2019s patent was invalid and that therefore there was no infringement, and an injunction restraining Hecht and Hecht Valve Company<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from bringing infringement actions against customers of ACF. Hecht and Hecht Valve Company counterclaimed, charging infringement of the Hecht patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">ACF filed a motion to dismiss Hecht\u2019s Texas action for lack of venue and a <em>forum non conveniens </em>motion. This latter motion sought a transfer of the Texas action to the Eastern District of Missouri pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1404(a), or in the alternative a stay of the Texas action. On original hearing, Judge Suttle made no ruling on either the motion to dismiss or the motion to transfer. He did, however, stay all proceedings in the Texas action pending \u201cdetermination of the liability issue, the validity of the patent, in other words, on the issue in that Kansas case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Subsequently, the Patent Office decided the interference, awarding priority of one claim to Hecht and priority of another claim to ACF. ACF then filed a civil action in the District of Kansas against Hecht and the Hecht Valve Company to review the Patent Office\u2019s award to Hecht on one of the claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hecht and Hecht Valve Company cross-claimed, asking for review of the award to ACF. This second civil action was consolidated with the first action filed by ACF.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">After this consolidation, Hecht moved in the Texas court to vacate the stay order. Judge Suttle in denying the motion noted that Hecht had been forum shopping and there were \u201cno known witnesses in Texas in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Six months after this ruling by Judge Suttle, The Honorable Ernest Guinn took the oath of office as a United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas. Judge Guinn took over the civil docket for the district court. Hecht presented to Judge Guinn a motion to set aside Judge Suttle\u2019s stay order. After a hearing, Judge Guinn granted the motion and set aside the stay order. In a later order, Judge Guinn denied ACF\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of venue or to transfer pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Desiring to take advantage of 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1292(b), ACF requested Judge Guinn to amend his order to indicate the advisability of an immediate appeal of an otherwise nonappealable interlocutory order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Judge Guinn denied this request, and ACF filed its petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\"> A mandamus should be issued by an appellate court \u201cin the exceptional case where there is a clear abuse of discretion or \u2018usurpation of judicial power.\u2019 \u201d Bankers Life and Casualty Co. v. Holland, 1953, 346 U.S. 379, 383, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106; La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 1957, 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our primary concern, therefore, is to determine whether <em>vel non </em>Judge Guinn abused his discretion in setting aside the order staying the Texas proceedings pending the outcome of the Kansas action. We hold that he did and grant the writ.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The petition for mandamus seeks rulings on several issues. In substance, we are asked to hold either (1) that Judge Guinn abused his discretion in vacating the order entered by Judge Suttle since there was no change in circumstances warranting such vacation; or (2) that, irrespective of the propriety of one dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>trict judge vacating the order of another district judge, Judge Guinn abused his discretion in not granting the petitioner\u2019s <em>forum non conveniens </em>motion to stay proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"> A stay pending the outcome of litigation between the same parties involving the same or controlling issues is an acceptable means of avoiding unnecessary duplication of judicial machinery. Landis v. North American Co., 1936, 299 U.S. 248, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case the stay was most appropriate, since the Kansas court was considering the Patent Office decision in the interference proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further the parties and most of the principal witnesses resided in or near the Kansas district,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the Kansas proceedings seemed more likely to reach a decision before the Texas court would conclude its findings. A stay order would surely avoid an unwanted and highly undesirable race by each party to obtain a decision from the particular district court reacting most favorably to its position. Cf. General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watkins, 4 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We are not asked to order the transfer of the Texas action pursuant to 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1404(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A stay order has virtually the same effect, and is granted for practically the same reasons that motivate a court in granting a transfer motion. Some of the cases dealing with section 1404(a) are, therefore, instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">The Supreme Court in Van Dusen v. Barrack, 1964, 376 U.S. 612, 616, 84 S.Ct. 805, 809, 11 L.Ed.2d 945, stated; \u201cSection 1404(a) reflects an increased desire to have federal civil suits tried in the federal system at the place called for in the particular case by considerations of convenience and justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">In Koehring Company v. Hyde Construction Co., 5 Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 295, this Court carefully considered the criteria to be considered in a motion for change of venue. We noted the residence of the witnesses, the convenience of the parties, and the opportunity of reaching a judgment without unnecessary delay. In the \u201cinterest of justice,\u201d we concluded that the cause should be transferred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">Hecht will not lose his claim because of the stay order. He has counterclaimed in the Kansas action alleging infringement of his patent. Any relief he is entitled to can be granted by the Kansas court. See Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co. v. Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp., N.D.Ga.1955, 131 F.Supp. 21, appeal dismissed, 5 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>1955, 225 F.2d 718; Ex parte Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co., 5 Cir. 1955, 225 F.2d 720.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Judge Guinn indicated that since venue was proper in the Western District of Texas, he would not apply the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>by either staying the Texas proceedings or transferring the action to the Kansas district. That position completely overlooks the dictates of Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 1947, 330 U.S. 501, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055, the instructions of Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 1955, 349 U.S. 29, 75 S.Ct. 544, 99 L.Ed. 789, and the intent of section 1404(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The \u201cconvenience of parties\u201d and \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d are to guide courts in applying the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine. These factors also govern the use of a stay order. The fact that venue was proper in the Texas court does not permit these governing factors to be overlooked. On the contrary, section 1404(a) assumes proper venue and stay orders are permissible only when venue does exist.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We find no occasion to elaborate on the case law which has considered the problems involved when one district judge vacates or contradicts the decision of another district' judge. See United States v. Koenig, 5 Cir. 1961, 290 F.2d 166; Prack v. Weissinger, 4 Cir. 1960, 276 F.2d 446. Writs of mandamus may be issued if a judge abuses his discretion in vacating the order of another judge of the same court. Cf. Ex parte Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co., Ltd., 5 Cir. 1963, 322 F.2d 113; United States v. United States District Court, 8 Cir. 1953, 226 F.2d 238.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such an abuse of discretion occurred here. There was no sufficient basis for Judge Guinn to vacate Judge Suttle\u2019s order. The circumstances existing at the time Judge Suttle denied Hecht\u2019s first motion to vacate the stay order were the same as the circumstances when Judge Guinn granted Hecht\u2019s second motion. Judge Guinn made no finding that Judge Suttle erred in granting his stay order.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">We are further convinced that Judge Guinn erred because we find that a stay order was needed. In determining if a judge abused his discretion, we must look at the correctness of his decision and the reasons for it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In this case, we conclude that Judge Guinn\u2019s order was not proper and has no sufficient reason to support it. We hold both that Judge Guinn abused his discretion in vacating Judge Suttle\u2019s stay order, and that a stay order should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">Let a Writ of Mandamus issue directing the Respondent (1) to vacate and set aside the order of December 16,1966; and (2) to enter an order staying this cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>pending the outcome of Civil Actions No. W-3222 and No. W-3558 pending in the District Court of Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Writ granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\">. An interference is an administrative proceeding initiated by the commissioner pursuant to 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 135 to determine priority of invention as between two or more applicants. See Tennessee Valley Authority v. Monsanto Chemical Co., 5 Cir. 1967, 383 F.2d 973; 2 Walker on Patents (Deller\u2019s ed.) \u00a7 189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\">.

Hecht Valve Company, a Kansas corporation having its sole place of business in Haysville, manufactures carburetor valves as the exclusive licensee under Hecht\u2019s patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-19\">. Judge Suttle determined that the convenience of the parties, the residences of the principal witnesses, and the interest of justice suggested that the issues should be decided in Kansas. Judge Suttle was particularly impressed with the fact that Hecht, the plaintiff in the Texas action, was from Kansas. ACF, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>New Jersey corporation having its principal place of business in New York, New York, manufactures carburetors and carburetor valve assemblies solely at its Carter Carburetor Division which has its only plant and place of business in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. See 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">. The Kansas district court denied without prejudice a motion by Hecht to stay proceedings pending the outcome of the Texas action. The court also refused to dismiss the Kansas actions for lack of jurisdiction. We agree with the Kansas district court that the Kansas actions were not subject to dismissal on the ground that the claims should have been filed in the Texas infringement action as compulsory counterclaims under Kule 13(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.

We are also requested to hold that Judge Guinn abused his discretion in denying ACF\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of venue. We deny that request. The <em>forum non oonveniens </em>motion requested a transfer of the proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1404(a) or a stay pending disposition of the Kansas action.
