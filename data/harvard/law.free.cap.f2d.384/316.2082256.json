Scott. Appellant had issued an automobile liability policy insuring Scott\u2019s employer, and the award under review was predicated upon the District Court\u2019s conclusion that appellant, by unqualifiedly defending Scott in litigation arising from a vehicular accident, had waived its defense that the policy did not cover Scott\u2019s liability arising therefrom. The principal question we face is whether appellant\u2019s role in the controversy was properly assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The accident in question was an inter-sectional collision involving a truck owned and operated by American Ice, and an ambulance owned by W. W. Chambers Company and manned by Scott, the driver, and Harvey P. Walker, a fellow employee riding as an attendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both Scott and Walker suffered injuries for which appellant, which was also Chambers\u2019 workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, made compensation and medical expense payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Scott and Walker subsequently brought independent personal injury actions against American Ice and another,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in each of which appellant, as workmen\u2019s compensation subrogee, joined as co-plaintiff. American Ice was permitted to file in Scott\u2019s suit a third-party complaint seeking contribution on the theory that Scott, as operator of the ambulance, was, jointly with the driver of the truck, responsible for Walker\u2019s injuries. Walker\u2019s case eventuated in a $60,000 judgment for the plaintiffs which appellee satisfied, and Scott\u2019s in a judgment in favor of American Ice for $30,000 as contribution and $43 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">The plaintiffs in both cases were represented by E. Willard Hyde, Esquire, whose services appellant arranged, and Ernest C. Raskauskas, Esquire, an associate. The claim the District Court sustained is founded largely upon their activities. Hyde signed both complaints, and Raskauskas later entered his appearance, as counsel for the plaintiffs. Raskauskas opposed the application by American Ice to file the third-party complaint, and with Hyde filed an answer thereto in Scott\u2019s behalf as his attorneys. Raskaukas participated as Scott\u2019s lawyer at a supplemental pretrial hearing, and both Hyde and Raskauskas tried each case for the plaintiffs and actively defended the third-party action against Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The District Judge found that Hyde and Raskauskas, in defending Scott on the third-party claim, acted as appellant\u2019s representatives and conformably with its directions. Our review of the evidence upon which he relied,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and critically analyzed in his opinion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> gives us no cause for disturbing that determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus we reach the question whether appellant thereby became precluded from resisting appellee\u2019s bid on the ground that Scott\u2019s responsibility in the accident was a risk it never assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The policy in suit contains an omnibus clause defining \u201cinsured\u201d as including not only the named insured but also \u201cany person while using the automobile * * * provided the actual use of the automobile is * * * with the permission of\u201d the named insured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Scott was an employee of Chambers, the named insured, operating the vehicle in the course of Chambers\u2019 business when the accident occurred. The policy, however, specifically excluded from its protection \u201cany employee with respect to injury to * * * another employee of the same employer\u201d sustained during the course of their mutual employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Walker, for whose injury American Ice obtained its judgment for contribution, was Scott\u2019s fellow employee engaged in the same mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Had appellant refrained from entering upon Scott\u2019s defense in the third-party action, the exclusionary clause undoubtedly would have eliminated any liability it might otherwise have incurred under the policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But whatever the rule generally as to the efficacy of the doctrines of waiver and estoppel to extend an insurer\u2019s liability into an area defined by a specific exclusion, it is well settled that an insurer undertaking the defense of an insured against a litigious assertion of an unprotected liability, without a disclaimer of contractual responsibility and a suitable reservation of its rights, is foreclosed from thereafter taking refuge in the policy provisions exempting the liability from coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We consider an application of this rule abundantly justified whenever, as here, the insurer has not demonstrated affirmatively that assumption of the defense was nonprejudicial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the mere fact that the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>sistance appellant furnished was to a third-party action cannot serve to alter the result.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We are not confronted with any question concerning disclaimer or reservation of rights, for appellant concedes that it did neither.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor are we dealing with a situation in which the person whose cause the insurer championed was a complete stranger to the policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s argument that Scott was not an insured disregards what the policy very plainly says to the contrary. We reiterate that the omnibus clause broadens the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d beyond those named as such to embrace any person using the vehicle with the permission of a named insured,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and this clearly subsumes an employee fitting that description.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Prior to the third-party contest Scott, as an additional insured, was thus entitled to such protection with such limitations as the policy provided,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and in this respect he stood in a position similar to that of the named insured. So viewing the omnibus clause, we find that we, like other courts,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are unable to perceive any reason why the insurer should be barred from urging policy defenses and exclusions against a named insured but not with respect to an additional insured. We accordingly hold that since appellant, at the time it undertook Scott\u2019s defense in the third-party action, \u201cdid not then question its liability relating to employees</p>\n<p id=\"AeW\">of the insured * * * by continuing the defense to final judgment with knowledge of whatever the facts were in that respect, it became estopped to raise that issue now.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALQ\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">. Appellee, as the automobile liability insurance carrier of American Ice, and so the real party in interest on the facts hereinafter stated, was later joined in the attachment proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. The parties to this appeal have dealt with the truck and the ambulance as vehicles covered by their respective policies, which were not included in the record. We give these policies the same treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">. The co-defendant was thereafter exonerated by a directed verdict in each action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">. We agree with the District Court that the letters sent by appellant to Hyde could be considered on the question whether appellant had authorized Scott\u2019s defense on the third-party complaint. The attorney-client privilege did not prevent their use for this purpose. As the District Judge pointed out, this correspondence revealed only the fact of appellant\u2019s authorization to Hyde to proceed with the defense; in no way did it disclose the strategy, legal theory or substance of that defense.
