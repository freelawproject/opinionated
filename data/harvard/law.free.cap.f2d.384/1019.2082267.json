More specifically, the issue is whether appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal raise any issue other than the patentability of the counts. The issue arises in a contested interference action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-20\"> The jurisdiction of the Board of Patent Interferences in this proceeding was limited to a determination of the question of priority of invention, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135, and our jurisdiction is limited to a review of the decision of the Board of Patent Interferences on that issue, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141. Thus, the issue of patentability of the counts is not and cannot be before us. Glass v. De Roo, 239 F.2d 402, 44 CCPA 723 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-21\">In Glass v. De Roo, supra, the Board of Patent Interferences had awarded priority of invention to appellees. Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal failed to raise any question on which this court had jurisdiction to pass. At 239 F.2d 403, 44 CCPA 724, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-22\">Appellant bases his appeal on twelve reasons of appeal which it is unnecessary for us to set forth. Appellees, in moving to dismiss, have analyzed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>these reasons, pointing out that they all relate, directly or indirectly, to the question of patentability and to no other question. Appellant does not deny this and his lengthy brief opposing the motion is merely an extended argument as to why this court should, for various reasons, undertake to review the question of patentability. The contention, in appellant\u2019s own words, is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-5\">* * * that this court is qualified to hear and determine the instant appeal and to render a decision indicating the presence or absence of invention in the structure defined by the count of the interference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANf\">However qualified we may be, we are, unfortunately for the appellant, without jurisdiction to do so on an appeal in an interference case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">In there granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal, we added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-7\">Our jurisdiction in a patent interference is limited to a review of the decision of the Board of Patent Interferences, 35 U.S.C. 141. The jurisdiction of that board is limited to a determination of the question of priority of invention, 35 U.S.C- 135. As to both the board and this court, certain questions which are \u201cancillary\u201d to priority may also be considered. Patentability is not one of those questions. Hess v. Dreyfuss, 104 F.2d 801, 26 C.C.P.A. Patents, 1407, 1410; Kleinman v. Steinbach, 187 F.2d 743, 38 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 924, 932. See also Patent Office Rule 258, 35 U.S. C.A. Appendix. In reviewing a decision of the Board of Patent Interferences, we are obviously without jurisdiction to consider an issue which the board is not authorized to decide. Appellant availed himself of the procedures under the Patent Office Rules for attacking the patentability of the count without success. The statutes do not provide for any review by this court of rulings in the Patent Office that a claim is patentable. We consider patentability only in <em>ex parte </em>appeals from decisions holding claims unpatentable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">Other decisions of this court have reiterated this view to such an extent it is now clearly established that our jurisdiction is limited to a review of the question of priority and matters ancillary to that issue. Cf. Bac v. Loomis, 252 F.2d 571, 45 CCPA 807 (1958); Den Beste v. Martin, 252 F.2d 302, 45 CCPA 798 (1958); Wirkler v. Perkins, 245 F.2d 502, 44 CCPA 1005 (1957); Ray v. Kronmiller, 167 F.2d 518, 35 CCPA 1085 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">The appellant, Ferree, filed twenty-one reasons of appeal. Of these, twenty clearly raise no issue except as to the patentability of the counts or the exercise of discretion of the board under Rule 259. The remaining reason of appeal is couched in language which on its face is broad enough to raise directly the issue of priority of invention. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-11\">* * * the Board of Patent Interferences erred as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-13\">14. In awarding priority of the counts in interference to Shephard et al.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-14\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-15\">There is some question, however, as to what Ferree may have intended by the foregoing statement. Thus, Shephard contends that this is a \u201cnotice,\u201d not a \u201creason.\u201d We think, however, that the distinction between a \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d and a \u201creason of appeal,\u201d as used in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141-144, is quite clear. The former requirement is in the nature of an advisory communication to the Commissioner, setting forth the course of action that an appellant intends to take and further serves to bring the appeal within the jurisdiction of this court if all of the statutory requirements are met. The latter requirement, however, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 142, determines the content of the material that the Commissioner must furnish the court in ex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>parte cases, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 143,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and further determines the points to which the decision of this court shall be confined, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 enables a \u201cparty to an interference\u201d who is <em>\u201cdissatisfied with the decision </em>of the board of patent interferences <em>on the question of priori</em>ty\u201d to appeal to this court. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">While a single adequate reason of appeal would be sufficient to bring this appeal within our jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to consider Shephard\u2019s remaining arguments in light of Ferree\u2019s reply, which largely fails to controvert them. In fact, irrespective of whether Ferree\u2019s reason of appeal No. 14 is adequate under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 142 to raise an issue relating to the question of priority, Ferree\u2019s response to those arguments raises a question as to whether the purported reason of appeal is truly intended to raise an issue concerning the board\u2019s <em>decision </em>on <em>priority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">A basic consideration under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 is that an appellant must be \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the appealed decision. Ferree, in opposing Shephard\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-7\">The purpose of this Appeal is not to seek a review of the merits of the Board\u2019s decision on priority, at this time, as suggested by Appellee, since this question is not \u201cripe\u201d. Instead, it is to seek a remand of this case to the Patent Office for further proceedings on the question of patentability, which proceedings have been denied to appellant, Ferree, by the Patent Office. This Court made such remand, very recently, in a very similar case of Loshbough v. Allen 152 USPQ 812 decided March 9, 1967.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">This statement makes it quite clear that Ferree is not \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the board\u2019s decision on the issue of priority. He, instead, seeks a remand to secure further action in the Patent Office on the issue of patentability. Appellant\u2019s reliance on Loshbough v. Allen, 373 F.2d 747, 54 CCPA 1113 (1967), in support of this position, is misplaced. This case and <em>Loshbough </em>are clearly distinguishable on their facts. The issue in <em>Loshbough </em>involved a review of the determination of priority of invention where the winning junior party Allen had moved to \u201ccancel\u201d the counts, on which priority was awarded, and to substitute a new count based on Allen\u2019s expressed belief that the counts were not patentable to either party, over a certain reference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the appellant Loshbough later <em>joined </em>in Allen\u2019s request, on the belief that the reference \u201cmay amount to a bar to the grant of a patent to either of the parties * * * .\u201d <em>Id. </em>373 F.2d at 748, 54 CCPA at 1114. Allen\u2019s motion had stated that \u201cthe party Allen and his attorneys were not advised of the disclosure of the Swedish patent until after the testimony of both parties had been completed.\u201d The party Loshbough was not aware of the patent prior to the filing of Allen\u2019s motion. Thus, in <em>Loshbough, </em>the matter of the patent-ability of the counts in interference over the particular reference apparently had not been considered. The lengthy record here indicates that the substance of Ferree\u2019s arguments relating to the patent-ability of the counts and the exercise of the discretion of the board had previously been raised and decided adversely to Ferree\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">Ferree\u2019s reply to Shephard\u2019s motion to dismiss concentrates on the issue of patentability. As in Glass v. De Roo, supra, Ferree\u2019s argument raises an issue directed at the merits of the procedure before the Patent Office on the issue of patentability. In addition to Ferree\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>admission that the purpose of this appeal is not to seek a review of the merits of the board\u2019s <em>decision at this time, </em>appellant further states that \u201c * * * the issue in this case is simply and squarely as to whether the Board <em>should </em>exercise its discretion under Rule 259 to make recommendations on the question of patentability * * * He adds: \u201cWhat this case boils down to is simply that there was considerable oral testimony taken, <em>but never even considered, </em>on the question of patentability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Thus, as indicated by Ferree\u2019s argument, and, particularly by the quoted portions, supra, it seems quite clear to us that Ferree is no longer \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the decision of the Board of Patent Interferences \u201con the question of priority\u201d within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141. Appellant has extensively utilized the procedures available in the Patent Office for the repeated consideration of the patentability of the counts of the interference. Thus, under the statutes, nothing is left for us to here review. Glass v. De Roo, supra, Den Beste v. Martin, supra; and Bac v. Loomis, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1074-23\">.
