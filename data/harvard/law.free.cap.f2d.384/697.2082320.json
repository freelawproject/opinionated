(Company), reported at 157 N.L.R.B. No. 70. This court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), the alleged unfair labor practices having occurred in Jerome, Idaho, within this judicial circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">The Board found that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a) (5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5), by refusing to bargain with the union, selected by a majority of the employees as their exclusive bargaining representative. The Board also found that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by interrogating its employees about their union activities, sympathies, and the identity of the employee who lead the union movement in the plant; by unilaterally granting wage increases to two employees; by unilaterally changing employees\u2019 working rules; and by threatening to withdraw, and withdrawing, certain employee benefits because of employees\u2019 union activities. We agree and affirm the Board\u2019s decision as reported, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">Since it was not material to its decision, the Board did not consider Company\u2019s contention that, because an election held by the Commissioner of Labor of the State of Idaho was not in accordance with law and was void, it therefore had no duty to bargain with the union. This contention requires further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">On January 21, 1965, nine electricians out of the thirteen employed by the Company signed cards which designated the union as their collective-bargaining representative. The Company knew this, but refused to negotiate with the union. At the union\u2019s request an election was then held under the supervision of the Labor Commissioner of the State of Idaho. The union won by a vote of eight to five. The Company still declined to negotiate, and wrote to the Idaho Labor Commissioner protesting the legality of the election. Up to that point, the Company had never questioned nor shown any doubt that the union represented a majority of the employees. We hold that the Company\u2019s refusal to meet and bargain, after it knew the union represented a majority, against a background of other unfair labor practices reported in the N.L.R.B. opinion, constitutes a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Act. N.L.R.B. v. Security Plating Co., 356 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1966); N.L.R.B. v. Trimfit of Cal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ifornia, 211 F.2d 206 (9th Cir. 1954). Since the majority status of the union was already known, the election results were immaterial; it was not necessary to determine its legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The petition will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\">. \u201cSec. 8(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-17\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-18\">\u201c(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 159(a) * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
