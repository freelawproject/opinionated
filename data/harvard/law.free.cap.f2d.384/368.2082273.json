Apparently, in accordance with the requirements of Georgia Code Annotated \u00a7 20-506, appellant\u2019s attorney mailed a letter on June 22, 1965 to the debtor relative to the collection of attorney\u2019s fees on said note. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">The promissory note executed by PanHerk Enterprises Ltd., Inc. and Guy F. Farmer under date of July 17, 1964, and now past due, to Sam A. Pierce in the amount of $27,500 with interest from said date at 6 per cent per annum provides for the payment of 20 per cent attorney\u2019s fees if collected through law. \u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">\u201cThe Georgia law provides that the provision for attorney\u2019s fees may be enforced up to 15 per cent providing that you fail to pay the entire principal and interest due within 10 days after receipt of this note. This provision is also applicable to collection by foreclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">The next day the debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt. On December 6, 1965, appellant filed a proof of claim with the Trustee, claiming principal, interest and attorney\u2019s fees. On April 28, 1966, the Trustee paid the principal and interest on the note but declined to pay the additional 15 per cent attorney\u2019s fees. The Trustee then filed a petition to disallow attorney\u2019s fees with the Referee in Bankruptcy who held a hearing and found, as a matter of law, that the letter above referred to did not constitute sufficient notice as required by Georgia Code \u00a7 20-506, which Code provision states that the holder of the note, or his attorney at law, \u201cshall, after maturity of the obligation, notify in writing the maker, indorser or party sought to be held on said obligation that the provisions relative to payment of attorney\u2019s fees in addition to the principal and interest shall be enforced and that such maker, indorser or party sought to be held on said obligation has 10 days from the receipt of such notice to pay the principal and interest without the attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">The Referee held that the attorney\u2019s letter-notice relative to attorney\u2019s fees did not state that the provision relative to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees was to be enforced, at the most stating that such fees \u201cmay\u201d be enforced, and the letter expressed no intention to enforce payment of attorney\u2019s fees. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Court concurred and approved and confirmed the Referee\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We agree that claimant\u2019s attorney failed to give the requisite notice under Georgia Code \u00a7 20-506 and, therefore, that the proper predicate has not been laid for the collection of attorney\u2019s fees which must be denied under these circumstances.
