Defendant counterclaimed for damages and an injunction for infringement. The district court entered judgment for plaintiff. 253 F.Supp. 832 (Dist.N.J.1966), supplemental opinion, 255 F.Supp. 620 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">The district court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s patent was invalid for want of novelty under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 because it was fully anticipated by a British patent issued in 1857 to one Cowper, is alone sufficient to justify the judgment. We therefore find it unnecessary to deal with the other important issues which the district court considered, \u2014 whether file wrapper estoppel barred defendant\u2019s assertion of its patent rights, whether defendant failed to comply with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, requiring the patent to set forth the \u201cbest mode\u201d of carrying out the invention, whether defendant\u2019s patent was rendered invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 184, 185, because defendant prematurely filed foreign patent applications, and whether defendant\u2019s patent had been anticipated by a number of earlier patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Defendant\u2019s patent consists of a process for electroplating gold and of a solution, or electrolyte, used in the process. The patented process involves the combination of either potassium gold cyanide or sodium gold cyanide<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with a weak, stable organic acid, such as citric acid,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which has been partially neutralized with ammonium or alkali hydroxide. The process, which defendant marketed under the name \u201cTemperex\u201d, is used in industrial electroplating, particularly in electronic circuitry.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">The Cowper patent consisted of the combination of gold chloride with potassium cyanide to form what it designated as the \u201cdouble cyanide of gold and potassium\u201d to which was added tartaric acid. After the resulting precipitate of tartrate or bitartrate was filtered off there remained a solution ready for use as an electrolyte in plating gold. The Cowper solution is similar to that specified in an example and claim of defendant\u2019s patent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> except that in the Cowper solution there is present a chloride ion and there is no provision for a metal tartrate additive to control the acidity of the solution. The presence of the chloride ion concededly is without significance. Cowper apparently used gold chloride because potassium gold cyanide was not commercially available in his time; indeed, the purpose of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>step in his process was simply to produce potassium gold cyanide. The absence of a metal tartrate additive in Cowper\u2019s process also is without significance because in his solution the alkali potassium gold cyanide is the first ingredient used, and the organic acid is added only in an amount sufficient to make the final solution of approximately the same acidity as the \u201cTemperex\u201d bath. Moreover, the principal asserted purpose of the tartrate is to adjust the acidity to the level reached in Cowper\u2019s process without the additive. By following the teaching of the Cowper patent in the inter partes test plaintiff was able to produce a smooth, ductile plate from a solution which had approximately the same acidity as that which is specified in defendant\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Defendant argues, however, that the compound produced under the Cowper patent would be auric potassium gold cyanide and that this differs substantially from the aurous potassium gold cyanide used in its process. Auric gold cyanide, because of the nature of the electrochemical bond between the gold and the other constituents of the compound, requires three times the electrical power to cause a like weight of gold to disassociate from the solution and to be deposited on the material to be plated than does aurous potassium gold cyanide. In addition, auric potassium gold cyanide is stable at any level of acidity, whereas aurous potassium gold cyanide is stable only within the range prescribed by defendant\u2019s patent. Defendant claims that before its patent was issued, it was believed that the aurous compound was unstable and would decompose in any acid solution. Defendant\u2019s discovery was made more important by the fact that aurous potassium gold cyanide was commercially available and its auric counterpart was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Plaintiff claimed, however, that the solution in the Cowper patent also was an aurous compound. This dispute between the parties occasioned much testimony by expert witnesses, references to learned treatises, and inter partes tests whose results were presented to the district court. The district court, with the conflicting evidence before it, held that the Cowper patent completely anticipated defendant\u2019s patent, thus inherently rejecting the position which defendant took on this issue. We cannot say that it clearly erred in doing so. Since the Cowper patent anticipated defendant\u2019s patent the decision of the district court that defendant\u2019s patent was invalid and not infringed by plaintiff must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">. 28 U.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-8\">.
