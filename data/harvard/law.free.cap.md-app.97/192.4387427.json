Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d) (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), of the controlled dangerous substance laws. Appellee/cross-appellant, Ardell Orlando Polley, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County (Carr, J., presiding) of distribution of cocaine. Because he had previously been convicted of a drug offense, he was sentenced under the mandatory sentencing provisions of Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c)(1) (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) to a 20-year prison term, the first ten years being without the possibility of parole. The State of Maryland, appellant/cross-appellee, appeals on the allegation that the trial court erred when it refused to impose a mandatory sentence of twenty-five years pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d). Polley cross-appeals on the sole ground that the trial court erred by allowing the prosecutor to argue facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">According to the agreed statement of facts underlying Polley\u2019s latest conviction, while on an undercover assignment on November 21, 1991, Deputy Jack Meckley of the Harford County Sheriff\u2019s Department observed Polley standing in front of 211 Perrywood Court in Aberdeen. At approximately 8:30 p.m., Deputy Meckley walked up to Polley and asked for a twenty. Polley went to a mailbox inside 211 Perrywood Court, took out a baggy, placed it on top of the mailbox, came back outside, and told Deputy Meckley to go inside and leave his money on top of the mailbox. Deputy Meckley walked inside, picked up the baggy, put down twenty dollars, and left. The substance in the baggy field-tested positive for cocaine and subsequently tested positive in the laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">After receiving information from Deputy Meckley, Harford County Sheriffs Deputy Gary Smith went to 211 Perrywood Court and checked the identification of various people there, including Polley. Deputy Smith learned Polley\u2019s name, ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>dress, and birth date, and relayed this information to Deputy Meckley.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Polley was indicted on February 19, 1992 in Harford County and found guilty of distribution of cocaine on August 13, 1992. On October 13, 1992, the trial court sentenced him to the jurisdiction of the Division of Corrections for a period of twenty years, pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Prior to this conviction, Polley had been convicted in Harford County on January 9, 1991, for offenses committed on August 21, 1990 and September 26, 1990, and placed on probation. On September 25, 1991, Polley was arrested on drug charges in Baltimore City and found guilty of possession on January 28,1992. He was received at the Eastern Correctional Institution on February 28, 1992 to begin service of a two-year sentence on the Baltimore City conviction and credited with time served from January 30,1992. It is the sentencing of the fourth conviction, described above, that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">DISCUSSION OF THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">1. <em>Mandatory Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The State contends that the trial judge erred in refusing to impose the mandatory sentence under Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d) for subsequent offenders because Polley had two prior drug convictions and had served a term of at least 180 days, thereby satisfying the conditions precedent for the imposition of sentence under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Article 27, \u00a7 286(d), which applies to third offenses, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(d)(1) Any person who is convicted under subsection (b)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>or subsection (b)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of this section or of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years if the person previously:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">(1) Has served as least 1 term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a previous violation of this section or \u00a7 286A of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">(ii) Has been convicted twice, where the convictions do not arise from a single incident ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">(2) Neither the sentence required under paragraph (1) of this subsection nor any part of it may be suspended, and the person may not be eligible for parole except in accordance with Article 31B, \u00a7 11 of the Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">(3) A separate occasion shall be considered one in which the second or succeeding offense is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The State argues that the plain meaning of the statute permits the imposition of the enhanced sentence upon Polley. Specifically, the State contends that the statute requires only two- previous convictions of drug offenses and the serving of 180 days in confinement prior to imposing sentence on a subsequent conviction, and that that requirement was met in the instant case. The State urges that there is nothing in the statute\u2019s language requiring that the predicate convictions and the 180-day term of incarceration occur sequentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The State also argues that it is clear from the purpose of the controlled dangerous substance laws that the Legislature intended to punish both the defendant who cannot be rehabilitated and the defendant who commits more than one offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7 276(a) and (b) (1957, 1992 Repl.VoL), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">The General Assembly ... finds and declares that the illegal ... distribution ... of controlled dangerous substances ha[s] a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the people of the State of Maryland. It is the purpose of this subheading to establish a uniform law controlling the ... distribution ... of controlled dangerous substances.... (b) The provisions of this subheading shall be liberally interpreted and construed so as to effectuate its general purpose____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The State urges that a liberal interpretation would lead to the conclusion that the Legislature intended \u00a7 286(d) to punish offenders who commit more than two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Polley responds that the trial judge imposed the proper mandatory sentence under Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, because he had not served a term of confinement of 180 days when the instant offense occurred. At the time of the trial for the instant offense, Polley had served eight months of the two-year sentence imposed for the conviction of January 31, 1992. Polley further alleges that because the conviction of January 31, 1992 postdates the instant offense of November 21, 1991, this conviction does not qualify as a predicate for enhanced sentencing purposes. Finally, Polley argues that the convictions of January 9, 1991 cannot be considered as two convictions, because they were both obtained on the same day and, as a result, he did not have an opportunity to reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In his brief, Polley refers to Maryland cases interpreting other subsequent offender statutes. Polley cites <em>Montone v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>State, </em>308 Md. 599, 521 A.2d 720 (1987), for the proposition that Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(b) (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1986 Cum.Supp.),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was intended to punish offenders who do not reform their behavior after prior convictions and punishment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Polley also refers to <em>Garrett v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 97, 111-18, 474 A.2d 931 <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 483, 479 A.2d 372 (1984), in which this Court was called upon to interpret Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c) (1957, 1982 Repl.VoL, 1982 Cum.Supp.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That statute requires a mandatory minimum sentence for individuals convicted of violent crimes. The statute itself provided that a charging document for the previous offense must be filed prior to the commission of the subsequent offense. <em>Id. </em>59 Md.App. at 115, 474 A.2d 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We held in <em>Garrett </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">the two convictions serving as the predicate for the enhanced sentence must precede in time the commission of the offense upon which the instant conviction is based. Deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>renee, rather than retribution, is the legislative intent we shall infer; and that, as the cited authority makes clear, requires that the instant offense \u2014 the one for which the enhanced punishment is imposed \u2014 be committed after the two predicate convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><em>Garrett, </em>59 Md.App. at 118, 474 A.2d 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Although the cases cited by Polley are persuasive only and are not binding upon this Court, we believe that \u00a7 643B, which is narrowly directed towards repeat offenders of violent crimes who, having been exposed to the correctional system three distinct times, have nevertheless failed to rehabilitate but have instead committed a fourth violent crime, is relevant to the issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The principles underlying the creation of both \u00a7 643B and \u00a7 286(d) are similar. We interpret that the Legislature intended that the sentences available under them encompass not only punishment objectives, as in \u00a7 286(c), but be enhanced because a defendant has committed another offense <em>after </em>having served an extended period of incarceration, thereby showing that the defendant has failed to take advantage of the opportunity to reform his or her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In the area of statutory construction, we have repeatedly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">The cardinal rule in the construction of statutes is to effectuate the intent of the Legislature. In order to do so, a court should consider the object or purpose to be attained by the statute, and the evils or mischief sought to be remedied, and so construe the statute as to carry out and effectuate, or aid in, the general purposes and policies thereof, and suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. If a statute is susceptible of more than one construction, it should if possible, be given that construction which will effectuate or carry out its purpose or object, and it should not be given a construction that would do more than effect the legislative object or purpose. This is especially true when a court is construing a penal statute, which, according to well established case law, is to be strictly construed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Strict construction, relative to a penal statute, means a construction favorable to the accused, and against the State. In short, the spirit or intention of the statute should control a court\u2019s construction of that statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Collins v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 273, 288-89, 598 A.2d 8 (1991), <em>citing Johnson v. State, </em>75 Md.App. 621, 630-31, 542 A.2d 429, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 675, 561 A.2d 215 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">This Court recently focused on the construction of Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c). In doing so, we also considered what, if any, significant differences were presented as between \u00a7 286(c) and (d). We held that the Legislature, by requiring in (d) that previous convictions occur prior to the <em>commission </em>of a third offense and not adding the same language.to subsection (c), intended in (d) to punish those convicted after repeated incarcerations, and in (c) to punish the multiple offender, regardless of whether he or she had served a period of incarceration. <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 593, 622 A.2d 767 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 286 supports this position. Pri- or to 1988, all subsequent offenders were treated equally with respect to sentencing. <em>Collins v. State, </em>89 Md.App. at 292, 598 A.2d 8. In 1988, however, in response to the greatly increased number of repeat drug offenders being prosecuted in Maryland, the Legislature amended Art. 27, \u00a7 286 to provide for increased penalties for third and fourth offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 598 A.2d 8. Subsections (c), (d) and (e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were added to \u00a7 286 at that time. 1988 Md.Laws Ch. 439. Subsections (d) and (e) required the defendant to have been incarcer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ated for a previous drug-related conviction, while subsection (c) did not. <em>Gargliano, </em>95 Md.App. at 602, 622 A.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">A 1988 Bill Analysis by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee of subsections (c), (d) and (e), summarized these provisions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">1. Second conviction \u2014 imprisonment for not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">2. Third conviction \u2014 imprisonment for not less than 25 years, provided that the person has served at least one term of confinement for at least 180 days for violating either \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">3. Fourth conviction \u2014 imprisonment for not less than 40 years, provided the person has served 3 separate terms of confinement as a result of 3 separate convictions for violations involving a narcotic drug or PCP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">It is clear from the summary that the Legislature not only was well aware of the absence of any qualifications for a second offense, but of the addition of qualifications for third or fourth offenses. <em>Gargliano, </em>95 Md.App. at 603, 622 A.2d 767. Furthermore, the purpose of the 1988 Md.Laws Ch. 439 was to require:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">certain mandatory minimum penalties for subsequent convictions of violations relating to controlled dangerous substances under certain circumstances; specifying that, for the purpose of certain subsequent offender penalties, certain offenses are prior offenses; prohibiting the suspension of certain penalties; providing for the construction of this Act; and generally relating to mandatory minimum penalties for subsequent convictions concerning specific controlled dangerous substances. (Underscoring omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyN\">The statement that \u201cfor the purpose of <em>certain </em>subsequent offender penalties, certain offenses are prior offenses\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended to make a distinction between second offenses and third and fourth offenses. <em>Gargliano, </em>95 Md.App. at 603, 622 A.2d 767. This language implies that for certain subsequent offender penalties, <em>i.e., </em>third and fourth offenses, there is a specification concerning what consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tutes a prior offense, whereas there is no such specification for second offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The purpose of the 1988 Act, therefore, supports an interpretation requiring sequentiality in \u00a7 286(d) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. 32, 38, 595 A.2d 463 (1991), observed, in dicta, that \u201cby imposing the 180 day minimum, the legislature was ensuring that those who received the enhanced punishment had been accorded a fair chance at rehabilitation in the prison system and had not responded.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We believe that the Legislature intended to make a distinction between second offenses and third and fourth offenses, that distinction being to punish multiple offenders in \u00a7 286(c) and recidivist behavior in 286(d) and (e). If the Legislature intended \u00a7 286(d) and (e) merely to inflict more severe punishment upon someone who is a persistent offender, it would have enhanced an individual\u2019s sentence anytime he or she had previous convictions. Rather, in \u00a7 286(d), the Legislature not only required that before being sentenced as a subsequent offender an individual shall have received two previous convictions, it also required that the individual shall have served a term of 180 days confinement in a correctional institution before committing the third offense. We cannot conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The policy behind requiring sequentiality, which is that it is reasonable to impose a harsher sentence when a convicted person does not take advantage of the opportunity to reform, but instead commits another offense, is, in our opinion, sound. Because Polley had not served the required 180 days of incarceration for the January 31, 1992 conviction before he committed the November 21, 1991 subsequent offense, he was properly sentenced under \u00a7 286(c) rather than \u00a7 286(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">2. <em>Argument of Facts Not in Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2e\">In his cross-appeal, Polley contends that remarks made by the prosecutor during the rebuttal phase of the State\u2019s closing argument require reversal. Specifically, Polley argues that the prosecutor improperly suggested that the defendant had a prior record of drug arrests, which facts were not in evidence. As held in <em>Booth v. State, </em>327 Md. 142, 193, 608 A.2d 162 (1992), \u201c[t]he permissible scope of closing argument is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. The exercise of that discretion will not constitute reversible error unless clearly abused and prejudicial to the accused.\u201d <em>Id., citing Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 172, 210-11, 507 A.2d 1098 (1986); <em>see Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 316, 483 A.2d 6, <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985); <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 413, 326 A.2d 707 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In closing argument by the defense, counsel argued the issue of reasonable doubt by pointing to possible contamination of evidence at the police laboratory to account for positive drug test results of the substance purchased from Polley and to the possible misidentification of Polley by the undercover police officer. In attempting to demonstrate to the jury what evidence the State did not have, defense counsel stated, \u201cYou have no evidence that Mr. Polley was ever arrested with drugs on his person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The State in rebuttal said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">PROSECUTOR: I could have and I didn\u2019t object to one of the statements that Defense Attorney made, and that is she said something like and if there\u2019s a dispute we can read it back in the record, that the State didn\u2019t have any informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tion concerning any arrest that the Defendant had with regard to drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ale\">PROSECUTOR: And I\u2019m not going to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">THE COURT: Overruled, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">PROSECUTOR: I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics even though the Judge has permitted me to continue, but I would suggest to you that that is not a proper statement that the Defense Attorney made because she has to realize that whether I had information or didn\u2019t have information ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzJ\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al1\">PROSECUTOR: I wasn\u2019t allowed to get that in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">THE COURT: Approach the bench please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">At the bench, there was disagreement as to whether defense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cYou have no evidence that Mr. Polley was ever arrested with drugs on his person,\u201d referred to the fact that the police found no drugs on Polley\u2019s person when he was arrested, as the defense contended, or whether it referred to the subject of prior arrests, as the State contended. The court admitted it could not specifically recall what defense counsel had said, but warned the State that it was \u201ctreading on very dangerous ground\u201d and to \u201cexercise great caution in addressing this.\u201d The State responded that it would \u201cget off of this line of argument\u201d and was permitted to continue with its closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Ideally, the State should have objected to the mention of facts not in evidence, namely whether Polley had any prior arrests on his record, when the lack thereof was arguably alluded to by defense counsel during her closing argument. The State did not do so, whether by choice or omission, but instead raised the issue during its rebuttal. While doing so bordered on being improper, from the standpoint of substantial fairness we believe that, under the circumstances, the prejudice to the defendant was insufficient to render a mistrial appropriate. It appeared to the State that defense counsel had himself referred to facts not in evidence regarding prior arrests, and had thereby \u201copened the door\u201d on the subject. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The State was seeking to correct a possible erroneous impression created by the defense, or at least to place that evidence in perspective. \u201cSummation provides counsel with an opportunity to creatively mesh the diverse facts of trial, meld the evidence presented with plausible theories, and expose the deficiencies in [opposing counsel\u2019s] argument.\u201d <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 230, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 307 (1992). Whether a particular comment during closing argument exceeds these limits is dependent on the particular facts of a given case. <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. at 415, 326 A.2d 707. In pointing out the deficiency in defense counsel\u2019s argument, the State exercised caution and abandoned the subject when advised to do so by the court. Under the circumstances, we hold that the prosecutor did not exceed permissible limits of closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Polley further asserts that the court compounded any error by failing to take additional action after defense counsel objected to the remarks and the bench conference was held. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">While on the merits we would have no difficulty in finding no prejudicial error, <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. at 412-13, 326 A.2d 707, a more direct answer to the contention is procedural. <em>Ball v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 338, 358, 470 A.2d 361 (1984). When Polley objected to the State\u2019s argument that there may have been evidence of prior arrests that it was not permitted to introduce, the court overruled the objection. After the bench conference, nothing more was requested. Polley did not ask for a curative instruction or move for a mistrial. The trial judge certainly was not going to have declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte, </em>without knowing whether Polley wanted one or not. <em>Ball v. State, </em>57 Md.App at 359, 470 A.2d 361; <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Before this Court will decide that the trial court abused its discretion by not granting a mistrial, we would have to find clear and egregious prejudice to the defendant mandating us to reverse the conviction. <em>Leak v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 353, 358, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>579 A.2d 788 (1990). The Court in <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md 569, 580-81, 530 A.2d 743 (1987), citing <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985), noted that reversal is required only when a prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u201cfocused, unambiguous and strong, and so prejudiced a specific right that to allow them to go uncorrected would deprive the accused of fundamental fairness.\u201d As stated by this Court in <em>Leak v. State, supra, </em>any improper conduct or remarks made by the State during a prosecution would have to be a \u201cdirect and contributing factor that resulted in substantial prejudice\u201d to the defendant. 84 Md.App. at 358, 579 A.2d 788; <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. at 429, 326 A.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In the case at bar, the State\u2019s brief reference to prior arrests did not, in the lower court\u2019s opinion, prejudice Polley to the extent that any further action was called for. During the trial, there was ample evidence presented of Polley\u2019s guilt, including testimony by the undercover officer making the buy from him, testimony of the arresting officer, and the results of the laboratory tests on the drugs recovered. It can only be a matter of speculation that the jury was unduly influenced by the comments of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The prosecutor was admonished that he would be wise to avoid further mention regarding any prior arrests during his closing argument, and he did so.

In <em>Gargliano </em>v. <em>State, </em>95 Md.App. at 604 n. 10, 622 A.2d 767, Judge Bell further analysed the distinctions between subsections (c), (d) and (e) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">In <em>Collins </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Md.App. 273, 291-4 [598 A.2d 8] (1991), we noted other distinctions between subsection (c) and subsections (d) and (e) \u2014 only second offenders are eligible for drug treatment in lieu of a mandatory sentence. This distinction might explain why the Legislature sought to impose more stringent requirements for third and fourth offenses and not for second offenses. Penalties for third and fourth convictions are much harsher than for a second offense, and three- and four-time offenders are not eligible for drug treatment in lieu of a mandatory sentence. Since those second offenders who tire deemed eligible for rehabilitation may be given drug treatment in lieu of a mandatory sentence, the more stringent standard for second offenders would serve no purpose.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
