Baker, appellant, and against Roy H. Haas Associates, Inc., appellee, in the amount of $250.00. On June 24, 1991, Baker had filed suit against Haas alleging negligence, breach of contract and fraud in connection with a home inspection performed by Haas on property subsequently purchased by Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The crux of Baker\u2019s complaint was an allegation that he was forced to reduce the selling price of his house when Baker subsequently sold it (which Haas had inspected less than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>year earlier) by $2,000.00 because of a defective roof. From the Order granting judgment of $250.00 in favor of Baker (representing the home inspection fee paid by Baker to Haas), Baker asks us to resolve the following issue:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aee\">Whether a provision in a standardized home inspection report limits a home inspection corporation\u2019s liability for negligence to an amount not to exceed the fee paid by the homeowner for the home inspection?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We answer the above question in the affirmative and, therefore, affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In June, 1988, Baker entered into a contract with Haas, whereby Haas agreed to perform a home inspection (and prepare a corresponding report) on a house that Baker and his former wife<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had contracted to purchase as a personal residence, and Baker agreed to pay Haas $250.00. The inspection report prepared by Haas indicated that the roof was in satisfactory condition. The contract contained a limitation of liability provision, which provision is at the center of the parties\u2019 dispute herein:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>Limitations &amp; About Warranties</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">Although care is taken in the performance of inspections [Haas] (and/or its representatives) makes no representations regarding latent or concealed defects which may exist. Property owners should, of course, disclose known defects and deficiencies: not all defects are discoverable even in a thorough inspection of the type we conduct. Warranties may sometimes be obtained from outside insurers, service companies, or even property owners. It is understood and agreed that no warranty or guarantee is expressed or implied by [Haas] (and/or its representatives).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In the unlikely event that any significant problems or anticipated need for repairs not now foreseen should arise, Client shall contact [Haas] before undertaking any repairs; Client recognizes that without the aforesaid notice, no complaint or claim will be considered. In addition, <em>notwithstanding the provisions of any applicable statute, the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Client is damages in an amount not to exceed the fees actually paid by the Client for services, and all other remedies, statutory or otherwise, are hereby expressly waived by Client.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In May, 1989 (less than one year after the inspection), Baker entered into negotiations to sell the house. The prospective purchaser had the house inspected and learned that the roof was in substantial need of repair. Moreover, the inspection report revealed that the roof was in substantial need of repair at the time the house was purchased by Baker. Baker was forced to reduce the selling price of the house by $2,000.00 because of the defective roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On June 24, 1991, Baker filed a Complaint against Haas in the District Court of Maryland for Montgomery County alleging negligence, breach of contract, and fraud arising out of Haas\u2019s inspection of Baker\u2019s former house. Baker sought $2,000 in compensatory damages and $10,000 in punitive damages. Haas demanded a trial by jury; accordingly the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On May 29,1992, pursuant to an Order of the Circuit Court, the parties attended a mediation conference during which they agreed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">The parties agree that the sole issue to be decided concerning the relationship of the parties is the enforceability of the limitation of liability clause in the parties\u2019 contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties ask the Court to enter judgment of $250.00 for Plaintiff if it upholds said clause, or judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>$2000.00 for Plaintiff if said clause is not upheld. The parties will submit cross motions for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment; Haas filed its on June 15, 1992 and Baker filed his on July 31, 1992. Haas\u2019s motion was heard and denied on August 6, 1992<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the case was then set in for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">On August 13, 1992, Haas filed a \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Judgment and Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d Pursuant to said Motion, Judge Weinstein reversed his earlier ruling (which denied Haas\u2019s motion for summary judgment), ordered that the limitation of liability clause in the contract be upheld and granted judgment in favor of Baker in the amount of $250. Baker then filed a timely notice of Appeal on October 1, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">First, Baker asserts that the limitation of liability provision in the contract at issue does not limit Haas\u2019s liability for negligence. Rather than providing any legal or factual basis to support his argument, however, Baker merely states the following in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">This argument was made to the trial court in appellant-plaintiff\u2019s [Baker\u2019s] Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. The argument will not be repeated here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Pursuant to Md.Rule 8-504(a)(5), \u201ca brief [of a party to an appeal] shall contain ... [an a]rgument in support of the party\u2019s position.\u201d The effect of noncompliance with this rule is provided in Md.Rule 8-504(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">For noncompliance with this Rule, the appellate court may dismiss the appeal or make any other appropriate order with respect to the case[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Notwithstanding our authority to forego consideration of the merits of Baker\u2019s appeal, in the interests of justice, we will address Baker\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Baker\u2019s argument rests solely on his assertion that, while the home inspection report limited Haas\u2019s liability to \u201clatent and concealed defects,\u201d the defects on the subject property were \u201copen and obvious.\u201d Baker asserts that, at the time he attempted to sell the property, the roofer hired by Baker\u2019s purchasers informed him that the roof was defective. That same roofer, a man by the name of Smith, had previously inspected the roof at the direction of the owner from whom Baker had originally purchased the property and informed him of the defect at that time. Mr. Smith informed Baker that, in order to inspect the roof properly, one had to go onto it physically, and not just observe it from inside the house or from the ground. Consequently, Baker concludes that if Haas had physically inspected the roof, it would have discovered that the defects were \u201cpatent and obvious.\u201d Baker then concludes that the limitation of liability provision was insufficient to shield Haas from its negligent failure to uncover the defective roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Maryland law is quite clear on the matter of exculpatory clauses. \u201cIn the absence of legislation to the contrary, ... there is ordinarily no public policy which prevents the parties from contracting as they see fit.\u201d <em>Winterstein v. Wilcom, </em>16 Md.App. 130, 135, 293 A.2d 821, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 744 (1972). <em>See also Schrier v. Beltway Alarm Co., </em>73 Md.App. 281, 533 A.2d 1316 (1987). In <em>Winterstein, </em>we quoted Dean Prosser, who emphasized the responsibilities of contracting parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201cIt is quite possible for the parties expressly to agree in advance that the defendant is under no obligation of care for the benefit of the plaintiff, and shall not be liable for the consequences of conduct which would otherwise be negligent.\u201d Prosser, <em>Law of Torts, </em>3rd Ed. (1964) \u00a7 67, p. 456. In other words, the parties may agree that there shall be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>obligation to take precautions and hence no liability for negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">16 Md.App. at 135, 293 A.2d 821. In the instant case, the. parties contractually agreed to limit damages, resulting from the failure to discover any defects, solely to the amount of fees paid by Baker for the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Baker also cites <em>Boucher v. Riner, </em>68 Md.App. 539, 514 A.2d 485 (1986), for the proposition that if it could be shown that Haas had committed gross negligence, the limitation of liability provision <em>sub judice </em>would not have shi\u00e9lded Haas from liability. In <em>Boucher, </em>we stated the following in regard to the appellant\u2019s failure to prove gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">[T]he conduct alleged here reflects, at worst, poor judgment on the part of Dunker [one of the appellees] that, while perhaps amounting to ordinary negligence, does not rise to the level of gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 548, 514 A.2d 485. We also acknowledged, however, that if indeed the appellant <em>had </em>proven gross negligence, the limitation of liability provision would not have protected the appellees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">A waiver of a right to sue, such as the one executed between Boucher and Parachutes [an appellee] is ineffective to shift the risk of a party\u2019s own wilful, wanton, reckless, or gross conduct. <em>Winterstein v. Wilcom, </em>16 Md.App. 130, 134-36[, 293 A.2d 821] <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 744 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-9\"><em>Boucher, </em>68 Md.App. at 544, 514 A.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Baker correctly states that the limitation of liability clause is not an <em>absolute </em>shield to Haas. Haas could conceivably have been held liable for an amount in excess of the home inspection fee if his conduct had amounted to gross negligence. The problem with Baker\u2019s argument, however, is that he failed to allege gross negligence in his Complaint and is, therefore, and should be precluded from arguing it on appeal. Md.Rule 8-131(a). In any event, Haas\u2019 inadequate inspection is a classic example of ordinary negligence. Its conduct could not be characterized as indicating a wanton or reckless disregard for Baker\u2019s rights. <em>See Coates v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 105, 113, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>600 A.2d 856 (1992). Nor was there an implication of \u201cmalice and evil intention.\u201d <em>See Bannon v. Balto. &amp; Ohio RR Co., </em>24 Md. 108, 124 (1866).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Baker argues, alternatively, that if we hold that the limitation of liability clause indeed limits Haas\u2019s damages, we should then \u201cexpand our prior holdings and invalidate the exculpatory provision at issue.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8. The \u201cprior holding\u201d that appellant is asking us to expand is, <em>inter alia, </em>the one we restated above, articulated in <em>Winterstein v. Wilcom, supra. </em>Essentially, appellant asks us \u201cto protect the general public from home inspectors who, with standardized adhesion contracts of exculpation, put the public at the mercy of their negligence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\"><em>Winterstein </em>concerned the appeal from a judgment in favor of the defendant, William E. Wilcom T/A 75-80 Drag-A-Way (hereinafter, \u201cWilcom\u201d), who was sued by one Roland C. Winterstein and his wife for personal injuries sustained by Roland while driving in a speed contest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At issue in the case, as in the one at bar, was the validity of a \u201cRequest and Release\u201d clause, ostensibly holding Wilcom harmless for any injuries to Winterstein\u2019s person and property that may result from his participation is the contest. <em>Id. </em>16 Md.App. at 131-32, 293 A.2d 821. The lower court entered summary judgment in favor of Wilcom, and Winterstein appealed. <em>Id. </em>16 Md.App. at 134, 293 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In addition to our holding that, in the absence of legislation to the contrary, there is ordinarily no public policy that prevents the parties from contracting as they see fit, <em>Winter-stein, supra, </em>we also noted the recognized exceptions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>general rule, namely: (1) when one party is at such an obvious disadvantage in bargaining power that the effect of the contract is to put him at the mercy of the other\u2019s negligence, the agreement is void as against public policy, and; (2) it is against public policy to permit exculpatory agreements as to transactions involving the public interest <em>(e.g., </em>public utilities, common carriers, innkeepers, and public warehousemen). <em>Winterstein, </em>16 Md.App. at 135-36, 293 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In <em>Winterstein, </em>we held that (1) the exculpation clause at issue was not the product of unfair bargaining power, and (2) the business operated by Wilcom had none of the characteristics of one connected with the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 293 A.2d 821. Consequently, we held that the release was \u201cmerely an agreement between persons relating entirely to their private affairs, [and that, i]n the absence of a legislative declaration, ----w[as] not void as against public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 293 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In the case at bar, Baker rests his entire argument on the portion of our opinion in <em>Winterstein </em>where we acknowledged and discussed six factors, established in an earlier California Supreme Court case, <em>Tunkl v. Regents of The University of California, </em>60 Cal.2d 92, 32 Cal.Rptr. 33, 383 P.2d 441 (1963). We identified these six factors, collectively, as a rough outline of the type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions would be held invalid. <em>Winterstein, </em>16 Md.App. at 137, 293 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The aggregation of these six factors is effectively the substance of the second exception to the general rule regarding exculpation clauses stated above \u2014 that a business or transaction that encompasses all of these factors is deemed to be one \u201cconnected with the public interest,\u201d and may therefore constitute a reason to invalidate the limitation on liability clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Our review of the record in the instant case leads us to conclude that the limitation of liability clause at issue was valid and enforceable in limiting Haas\u2019s liability to the contract fee, for the same reasons supporting our holding in <em>Winterstein. </em>Clearly, the home inspection contract was not the product of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>unfair bargaining power. Baker presented no evidence that he was unable to solicit the services of an alternative home inspection company if he was dissatisfied with the limitation of liability provision. Moreover, the home inspection services performed by Haas do not fall under the realm of a public duty or concern the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Consequently, we hold that the limitation of liability clause in the home inspection report, limiting Haas\u2019s liability to the cost of the contractual fee, is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">. Both parties agreed that Haas was liable to Baker under the home inspection contract. The dispute was over the amount of damages. Baker sought $2,000 in damages; Haas asserted, on the other hand, that its liability was limited to $250 (the inspection fee).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">. Baker\u2019s former wife is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. The parties stipulated as to Haas's liability for failing to discover the defective roof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\">. There is no indication from the record that the court ever addressed Baker\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. Winterstein participated in a speed contest held at Drag-A-Way, for which he paid a fee. He suffered extensive injuries when, as a result of solely his own negligence, he lost control of his car and it flipped over. The court postulated that Winterstein participated in the contest either to demonstrate the superiority of his car or to win a prize, but, in any event, his participation was entirely voluntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
