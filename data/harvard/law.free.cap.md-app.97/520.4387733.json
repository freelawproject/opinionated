Otto Major and Stuart Alison, appellants, represented the plaintiff in Veta McAnulty v. First Virginia Bank \u2014 Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Maryland. The defendants in that case, First Virginia Bank, Shirley Tittle, Harco Oldsmobile, Inc., and William A. Beale, Esquire, are appellees here.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">As we have said, appellants were not parties in the underlying case but were plaintiffs attorneys. They appear here as appellants. In <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v. Farmer, </em>74 Md.App. 707, 539 A.2d 1173 (1988), Judge Wilner, for this Court, addressed the further appealability of an award for reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees after an appeal to the circuit court from a District Court. He noted that unless the circuit court judgment \u201cpursuant to Md.Rule 1-341 has some special, collateral status, it would not be reviewable by us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 539 A.2d 1173. In his discussion, Judge Wilner clarified that an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201calthough ... emanating] from an underlying civil action, ... it is not <em>necessarily </em>tied to the merits....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 539 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">[A] distinction needs to be drawn between a judgment entered against a <em>party </em>to the action and one entered against <em>counsel.... </em>We conclude that, for purposes of appellate jurisdiction, a judgment entered by the circuit court against the attorney is sufficiently collateral to the underlying action as to fall within our bailiwick.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 712, 539 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The underlying case was first filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in June 1990. Plaintiff alleged that, in repossessing her vehicle, defendants engaged in fraud, conversion, conspiracy, and violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq. </em>(RICO). The defendants removed the case to Federal District Court where the RICO count was voluntarily dismissed. The federal court remanded the remaining claims back to state court. The entire complaint was dismissed twice in the circuit court, first with leave to amend and then with prejudice. After the second dismissal the defendants filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>fees under Maryland Rule 1-341. The circuit court granted the motion, awarding total fees of $25,000 to be paid by appellants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Appellants present five questions, which we shall address in the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">I. Did the trial court err in finding that appellants lacked substantial justification for and acted in bad faith in prosecuting the RICO and fraud counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">II. Did the trial court err in not applying the doctrine of res judicata to the appellants\u2019 motion for Rule 1-341 sanctions after the federal court\u2019s denial of Rule 11 sanctions for the same costs and attorneys fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">III. Did the trial court have jurisdiction to impose Rule 1-341 sanctions for costs and fees charged by appellees while the case was pending in the federal court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">IV. Did the trial court err in awarding sanctions total-ling twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) under the facts of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">V. Assuming arguendo that an award of sanctions against Otto Major in the amount of $5,000.00 was justified, did the trial court err in imposing four times that amount against Stuart Alison?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">This case has been reviewed in varying degrees by two state circuit court judges, two Federal District Court judges, and this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Many of the facts and issues have been analyzed <em>ad nauseam. </em>As this appeal is only from the trial judge\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees, we will avoid repeating the painstaking analysis engaged in by the other judges and will, when appropriate, defer to their findings by reference to their orders and memoranda included in appellants\u2019 record extract.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Some background, however, will aid us in reviewing the circuit court\u2019s findings that this action was maintained in bad faith and without substantial justification. Veta McAnulty, plaintiff in the underlying case, entered into a marital settlement agreement with her estranged husband. Pursuant to the agreement, he bought her a new car, financing the purchase with an $11,565 loan from Commercial Bank (now First Virginia Bank). The husband executed an installment sales agreement with the bank, while plaintiff executed the sales contract with Harco Oldsmobile, Inc. (Harco). The husband eventually defaulted on the loan. While there was some dispute between the bank and Harco as to whether the security interest in the car was perfected, the bank ultimately assigned the installment sales contract to Harco, who proceeded to repossess and sell the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Based on these events, plaintiff, represented by appellants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a ten count complaint praying over one million dollars in damages. The complaint alleged violation of federal RICO and state unfair trade practices statutes, conversion, fraud, civil conspiracy, breach of contract, negligence and gross negligence. Appellees removed the case to Federal District Court based on the RICO count and moved to dismiss the entire complaint. Plaintiff was granted a time extension to answer the motion to dismiss. In the order granting that motion Judge Garbis suggested that plaintiff consider voluntarily dismissing the RICO count, and indicated the possibility of sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (Rule 11) if she chose to proceed, as he found the count frivolous. Plaintiff did not answer the motion to dismiss the RICO count.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Three weeks later plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the RICO count. Appellees requested that the federal court retain jurisdiction of the state law claims but the court declined, remanding the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. After remand, appellees moved for Rule 11 sanctions against plaintiff and appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In his December 21, 1990, letter Order Judge Garbis found that adequate grounds existed to grant Rule 11 sanctions, but that because the pleading was originally filed in state court and removed to federal court by the defendants (appellees), it should not be held to a Rule 11 standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Garbis concluded: \u201cWhether the Complaint fails to meet some applicable state court standard is a matter for consideration by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appellants then filed a motion in federal court for Rule 11 sanctions against appellees, based on the \u201cfrivolous\u201d motion for Rule 11 sanctions filed by appellees. Judge Garbis denied the motion, stating that if the Court was \u201cinclined to prolong this totally useless proceeding, it might well, <em>sua sponte,\u201d </em>impose sanctions on appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">After remand, Judge Byrnes in the circuit court held a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Judge Byrnes dismissed the entire complaint with leave to amend on certain conditions. Those conditions included that the amended pleading be factually detailed and explicit, and that the plaintiff verify the entire complaint under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation____ If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court ... shall impose ... an appropriate sanction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Plaintiff filed an amended complaint,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and appellees again moved to dismiss, on the ground, among others, that it did not comply with Judge Byrnes\u2019 order. A hearing was held before Judge Noel, in which he dismissed plaintiffs complaint with prejudice. An appeal was noted to this Court upon the complaint\u2019s dismissal. During the appeal\u2019s pendency, the motion was made for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees under Maryland Rule 1-341. Judge Noel held a two-day hearing on the motion and thereafter imposed the sanctions that are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Maryland Rule 1-341 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The Court of Appeals has expressly adopted a standard of review for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under this rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">... [B]efore imposing sanctions in the form of costs and/or attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 1-341, the judge must make two separate findings that are subject to scrutiny under two related standards of appellate review. First, the judge must find that the proceeding was maintained or defended in bad faith and/or without substantial justification. This finding will be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous or involves an erroneous application of law. Second, the judge must find that the bad faith and/or lack of substantial justification merits the assessment of costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and/or attorney\u2019s fees. This finding will be affirmed unless it was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>Inlet Associates v. Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc., </em>324 Md. 254, 267-68, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991). <em>See also Deleon Enterprises, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>92 Md.App. 399, 415, 608 A.2d 828 (1992); <em>Art Form Interiors, Inc. v.

Bell AtlanticTricon Leasing Corp., </em>323 Md. 200, 210, 592 A.2d 498 (1991)). <em>See also Talley v. Talley, </em>317 Md. 428, 436, 564 A.2d 777 (1989); <em>Beery v. Maryland Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 81, 98, 597 A.2d 516 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 329, 600 A.2d 850 (1992); <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v.

Plaza Condominium Joint Venture, </em>64 Md.App. 107, 115, 494 A.2d 713 (1985). Based on those specific findings, the court may order the offending party to reimburse the aggrieved party for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of the opprobrious behavior. This Court has emphasized that Rule 1-341 is not a sanctions rule in the same sense as Rule 11. It does not provide for a monetary award to punish a party that misbehaves. The rule\u2019s purpose is to put the wronged party in the same position as if the offending conduct had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Furthermore, awarding attorney\u2019s fees under this rule is an extraordinary remedy, and it should be used sparingly. <em>Inlet Associates, </em>324 Md. at 277, n. 4, 596 A.2d 1049 (Bell, J. dissenting); <em>Talley v. Talley, </em>317 Md. at 438, 564 A.2d 777 (rule is extraordinary remedy and should reach only intentional misconduct); <em>Art Form Interiors, Inc. v.

To show error, they ask us to revisit the statutory definitions and case law interpreting RICO, arguing that their pleadings were a good faith extension of existing case law, and to review both the original and amended complaint as to the fraud allegations. Maryland law, however, mandates that we affirm the trial judge\u2019s finding unless clearly erroneous. <em>Inlet Associates, </em>324 Md. at 267-68. \u201cUnless the factual findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous, an appellate court may not arrive at different factual conclusions. If there is any competent material evidence to support the factual findings of the trial court, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Nixon v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 485, 491-92, 625 A.2d 404 (1993) (citing <em>Fantasy Valley Resort, Inc. v. Gaylord Fuel Corp., </em>92 Md. App. 267, 275, 607 A.2d 584 (1992)). We shall not reanalyze the RICO and fraud counts based on the statutes and cases cited. We shall review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and examine the record for evidence supporting the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">According to the Court of Appeals, substantial justification is \u201ca reasonable basis for believing that a case will generate a factual issue for the fact-finder at trial[,]\u201d or a position that is \u201c \u2018fairly debatable\u2019 and \u201cwithin the realm of legitimate advocacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Inlet Associates, </em>324 Md. at 268, 596 A.2d 1049 (citing <em>Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. 364, 380-81, 550 A.2d 959 (1988), and <em>Needle v. White, Mindel, Clarke and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Hill, </em>81 Md.App. 463, 476, 568 A.2d 856, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 582, 573 A.2d 1338 (1990)). The Court also looked to the comment in the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.1, to the effect an action would be without substantial justification if \u201cthe lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 596 A.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In making a finding specific to the RICO count, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, in their attempt to satisfy [the RICO pleading] requirement, construe all of the facts relevant to this case so as to fit the defendants\u2019 actions neatly into a pattern of racketeering activity. The plaintiffs view of the facts is simply unreasonable. Rather, this court agrees with the defendants who argue that plaintiffs complaint was deficient in alleging a RICO claim based on one \u201cscheme\u201d against one victim. Th[ere] is no evidence or logic supporting the conclusion that the defendants\u2019 act constituted a \u201cscheme\u201d that could satisfy the pattern of racketeering activity necessary for a RICO violation. In fact, when the federal court considered plaintiffs arguments in support of her RICO claim, it found that the RICO claim was without merit, stating: \u201c[It] is obvious to the Court, and presumably was obvious to the Plaintiff as well, [that] the RICO claim in Count I was frivolous.\u201d Therefore, this court agrees with the defendants that the RICO claim was made solely to take advantage of the treble damages provision of the RICO statute in order to obtain an exorbitant settlement from the defendants, and as such, amounts to a claim brought in bad faith and without substantial legal or factual justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Regarding the fraud claim, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">I believe that too was brought without substantial justification. Not only did the plaintiffs complaint fail to allege the elements of fraud, but a reasonable inquiry into the law on fraud would have revealed that the plaintiffs fraud claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>failed to satisfy the five elements of fraud required under Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The trial court further found that both the complaint and amended complaint contained \u201cmisstatements of fact which amount to bad faith____ Judge Byrnes I think speaks for all those involved in judging this case that the plaintiffs claims are unfounded and made with the sole intention of harassing honest businesspeople in order to line their own pockets.\u201d For example, plaintiff alleged in her complaint that certain documents executed by the defendants were forgeries. At the motion\u2019s hearing, the trial judge elicited a concession from appellant Alison that he and Major did not know if the allegedly forged documents existed at the time the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Appellants had been warned both in federal court and in circuit court that their actions might lead to sanctions and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The trial judge followed through, finding that appellants\u2019 actions \u201cmerit the assessment of costs and attorney\u2019s fees against the plaintiffs attorneys in favor of the defendants\u2019 attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Upon review of the record, and in light of the specific findings of fact made in deciding this motion, we cannot say that the trial judge was clearly erroneous in finding that plaintiffs attorneys filed the complaint in circuit court in bad faith and without substantial justification, nor was the decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees from appellants to appellees an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Appellants claim error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to rule that the federal court\u2019s denial of Rule 11 sanctions against plaintiff was <em>res judicata </em>as to appellees\u2019 circuit court motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">Under Maryland law, the requirements of <em>res judicata </em>or claim preclusion are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">1) that the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier dispute, 2) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the claim presented in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication, and 3) that there was a valid final judgment on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aan\"><em>Esslinger v. Baltimore City, </em>95 Md.App. 607, 616-17, 622 A.2d 774 (1993) (citing <em>Cassidy v. Bd. of Educ., </em>316 Md. 50, 57, 557 A.2d 227 (1989)). <em>See also Jenkins v. Cameron &amp; Hornbostel, </em>91 Md.App. 316, 334-35, 604 A.2d 506, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 218, 608 A.2d 780 (1992); <em>Lone v. Montgomery County, </em>85 Md.App. 477, 490-91, 584 A.2d 142 (1991). All three elements must be present for the final judgment in the first claim to bar the subsequent claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">There is no dispute that the parties to both motions are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Surprisingly, appellants argue in their brief that \u201cthere is a substantive difference in [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 11 and Maryland Rule 1-341. It is the incurrence of fees and costs which give rise to sanctions under the State Rule. It is the filing of an improper pleading which gives rise to sanctions under the Federal Rule.\u201d Not surprisingly, appellees agree, albeit for a slightly different reason. Appellants make no assertion that the claims are identical and we hold that there was no final valid judgment on the merits. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Appellants argue in their brief that \u201cthe ruling on Appellees\u2019 Motion for Sanctions was an adjudication on the merits as to sanctions. As such, the adequacy of the pleading and the propriety of sanctions was considered by and decided by the Federal Court.\u201d The federal court\u2019s order belies this assertion. In denying appellees\u2019 motion for Rule 11 sanctions, Judge Garbis states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">The Court has received the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Sanctions and ... has considered it. In general, there would be a good reason presented for granting Rule 11 sanctions in a case in which a frivolous RICO claim ... was brought. However, in the case, it is the Defendants and not the Plaintiff who filed the Complaint in the United States District Court by virtue of their removal based upon the subject RICO claim____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>In this case, it is the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in which the Plaintiff filed her Complaint. <em>The Plaintiff did not file the Complaint in federal court and should not, therefore, be held to a Rule 11 standard as to the pleading. </em>Whether the Complaint fails to meet some applicable state court standard is a matter for consideration by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Appellants construe the language that \u201cPlaintiff ... should not ... be held to a Rule 11 standard as to the pleading\u201d as an adjudication on the merits of the sanctions motion. This reading of the judge\u2019s order is disingenuous at best. In their opposition to appellees\u2019 motion for Rule 11 sanctions, appellants conceded that the motion asked for sanctions based solely on the <em>filing </em>of the RICO count. The RICO count was filed in state court, not federal court. Appellants argued in federal court that, under <em>Kirby v. Allegheny Beverage Corp., </em>811 F.2d 253, 257 (4th Cir.1987), and <em>Dahnke v. Teamsters Local 695, </em>906 F.2d 1192 (7th Cir.1990), \u201cRule 11 is applicable only to Pleadings or other papers filed subsequent to or contemporaneous with the removal [to federal court] and any infirmity in the sufficiency of the [pleading] filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d Judge Garbis agreed and denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction, not on the merits. \u201cA judgment on the merits has been defined traditionally as one which rules on \u2018the real or substantial grounds of action or defense as distinguished from matters of practice, procedure, <em>jurisdiction </em>or form.\u2019 \u201d <em>Annapolis Urban Renewal Auth. v. Interlink, Inc., </em>43 Md.App. 286, 292, 405 A.2d 313 (1979) (citing <em>Clegg v. United States, </em>112 F.2d 886, 887 (10th Cir.1940)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Our reading of Judge Garbis\u2019s clear and articulate order is that he is not applying Rule 11 to the pleadings in question; he is remanding the matter to the Circuit Court where the proper state law should be applied. We note at least four separate instances in the record where the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>court describes the plaintiffs RICO claim as frivolous. Had Judge Garbis held the plaintiffs complaint to a Rule 11 standard, he would have been required to impose sanctions against plaintiff. Application of Rule 11 is mandatory; if a violation is found, sanctions must be imposed. <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The record in this case does not support the allegation that the Rule 11 motion in Federal District Court was adjudicated on the merits for the purposes of <em>res judicata. </em>We hold that appellants have not established the three required elements that would allow the Federal District Court\u2019s ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for Rule 11 sanctions to bar their motion for Maryland Rule 1-341 sanctions under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Therefore, the trial court\u2019s order was not barred under the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Next, appellants claim that the trial court cannot award attorneys\u2019 fees for work relating to any claims addressed by the federal court. It is axiomatic that the Rules should be interpreted by their plain meaning, and this issue relates directly to the scope of Rule 1-341. Rule 1-341 applies to \u201cany civil action.\u201d Maryland Rule 1-202 defines \u201caction\u201d as any steps taken to enforce rights in a \u201ccourt.\u201d \u201cCourt,\u201d for the purposes of Title I of the Rules, is a \u201ccourt of this state.\u201d We agree with appellants that the scope of Rule 1-341 does not encompass proceedings in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Appellants\u2019 argument that the language in Rule 1-341 makes it applicable only to state courts was addressed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. 364, 376-77, 550 A.2d 959 (1988). In <em>Newman, </em>the Court considered whether Rule 1-341 permitted an award of attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of Health Claims Arbitration Office [HCAO] proceedings. Dr. Newman argued that the HCAO was an \u201caction\u201d as defined by the Rule. The Court, adopting our holding from <em>Reilly v. Newman, </em>74 Md.App. 281, 536 A.2d 1230, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>modified, </em>314 Md. 364, 550 A.2d 959 (1988), held that Rule 1-341 did not empower the circuit court to sanction conduct in HCAO proceedings, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">The short answer ... is that Rule 1-341 was adopted by this Court in the exercise of its rulemaking power under Maryland Constitution art. IV, \u00a7 18(a) which concerns \u201cthe practice and procedure in and the administration of the appellate courts and in the other courts of the State[.]\u201d ... [T]he HCAO \u201cis created as a unit in the Executive Department. It is headed by a Director appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d The interpretation urged by Dr. Newman raises substantial questions concerning the constitutional power of this Court to regulate conduct before an executive agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. at 377, 550 A.2d 959 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In <em>Marquardt v. Papenfuse, 92 </em>Md.App. 683, 610 A.2d 325, <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 93, 612 A.2d 1316 (1992), we followed the same analysis. There, attorneys\u2019 fees of over $80,000 were well documented and considered reasonable. The issue was whether fees should be awarded based on work done by the attorneys in respect to proceedings before the Commissioner of Land Patents. <em>Id. </em>at 713-14, 610 A.2d 325. After citing the analysis stated above we held \u201cthat the circuit court in this case did not have the power under Maryland Rule 1-341 to include within <em>its </em>sanction order sanctions for conduct that occurred prior to ... the date the appellants\u2019 order of appeal [from the Commissioner\u2019s decision] was filed in the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 610 A.2d 325 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">These holdings also raise substantial questions concerning this Court\u2019s power to regulate conduct before federal courts. Appellees state in their brief, and we agree, that the procedural opportunity to bring a motion under Rule 1-341 is not available in federal court, as the federal court has no authority to regulate conduct before it based on Maryland rules. The Court of Appeals is authorized under the Maryland Constitution to regulate the courts of this State. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>argument was advanced, and we know of no authority that allows the Court of Appeals to regulate conduct before the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Appellees set forth an interesting argument based on judicial estoppel: \u201cHaving contended in federal court that the Circuit Court, not the federal court, had jurisdiction oyer the Defendants\u2019 motions for sanctions concerning the RICO claim, the Appellants are judicially estopped, from claiming that the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to determine the motions for sanctions.\u201d Appellees, however, miss \u00e1 subtle distinction in appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Appellees moved for Rule. 11 sanctions based <em>solely </em>on the filing of a frivolous RICO claim by appellants. Appellants answered, correctly, that under <em>Kirby v. Allegheny Beverage Corp., </em>811 F.2d 253, the federal court had no jurisdiction to impose sanctions based on the original complaint because it was filed in state court. Had appellees alleged a violation of Rule 11 based on some other paper filed by appellants in federal court, that court may have found jurisdiction. Judge Garbis alluded to this possibility in his Memorandum/Order ruling on appellants\u2019 Motion to Reconsider and for Rule 11 sanctions (filed <em>after </em>appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions). He noted that appellant \u201cdid file in this Court several documents in support of the RICO claim. Hence, he is not quite in a <em>Kirby </em>situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Judge Garbis did not, however, go on to revise the basis of. his previous order \u2014 that his court had no jurisdiction to impose sanctions. It follows that, had their motion encompassed more than the original complaint, appellees could have recovered sanctions in federal court. Based on the Rule 11 motion submitted by appellees, Judge Garbis had no option but to apply <em>Kirby </em>and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Appellants argue here (putting aside the <em>res judicata </em>claim) not that the circuit court cannot require reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees, but that it cannot require reimbursement of fees incurred in federal court. Each court has jurisdiction over these proceedings based on the scope of their sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>or reimbursement rule. The scope of Rule 11 and Rule 1-341 is different. In the case at bar, the two courts do have distinct areas of authority which do not completely overlap. Appellants address a technical distinction, but they are not playing so \u201cfast and loose\u201d as to require the application of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We agree with Judge Noel that, as clearly enunciated in <em>Kelley v. Dowell, </em>81 Md.App. 338, 342, 567 A.2d 521, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 303, 572 A.2d 182 (1990), \u201c[w]here the fding of a pleading or motion is at issue, the appropriate point of inquiry for the evidentiary finding is whether the party <em>initiated </em>the action in bad faith or without substantial justification.\u201d <em>See also Bishop\u2019s Garth, </em>75 Md.App. at 222, 540 A.2d 1175; <em>Century I Condominium </em>Assoc., 64 Md.App. at 118, 494 A.2d 713. It follows that any attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in circuit court resulting from filing the unjustified claim would properly be reimbursed under Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In the hearing on the Rule 1-341 motion and in his written opinion, Judge Noel was careful to elicit and document the facts known to appellants when the initial pleading was filed in Circuit Court. He found no evidence, facts, or logic on which appellants could have based the RICO count. He explicitly found that the fraud count was <em>brought </em>without substantial justification in that it did not allege the elements of fraud or facts sufficient to satisfy the elements. Appellant Alison testified that he made no independent investigation before drafting the complaint; he relied entirely on Major\u2019s knowledge of the case. Mr. Major had one five-minute meeting with a bank representative. Neither appellant spoke with the defendants, other than that one meeting. It is not clear whether the appellants saw the car\u2019s original title before filing the suit. In short, the judge based his decision on the facts showing that the complaint was filed in bad faith and without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We therefore hold that attorneys\u2019 fees, to the extent that they were incurred solely in federal court, cannot be reimbursed under Maryland Rule 1-341. To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>that attorneys\u2019 fees were incurred in the circuit court, they are reimbursable under Rule 1-341, even in respect to the RICO count. We add, however, that while we agree with appellants that Rule 1-341 does not reach fees incurred solely in federal court, we believe that appellees are entitled to fees for work product presented in circuit court even if that same work product was presented in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In awarding fees, the court may exercise its discretion in the light of certain factors, including: evidence submitted by counsel showing time spent defending an unjustified or bad faith claim or defense, the judge\u2019s knowledge of the case and the legal expertise required, the attorney\u2019s experience and reputation, customary fees, and affidavits submitted by counsel. <em>Deleon, </em>92 Md.App. at 419-20, 608 A.2d 828. <em>See also Cameron &amp; Hornbostel, </em>91 Md.App. at 337, 604 A.2d 506; <em>Johnson v. Baker, </em>84 Md.App. 521, 543, 581 A.2d 48 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>322 Md. 131, 586 A.2d 13 (1991); <em>Century I Condominium Assoc., Inc., </em>64 Md.App. at 121, 494 A.2d 713. There may, however, be an additional burden in cases where fees are sought for only a portion of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In <em>Beery, </em>89 Md.App. at 102, 597 A.2d 516, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJj\">From a practical standpoint, the major item of expense incurred in opposing an unjustified claim or defense will almost always be the attorney\u2019s fee, and in most cases these days that fee will be based upon \u201cbillable hours\u201d expenses by the attorney. An attorney who intends to claim compensation under Rule 1-341 for [bringing or] defending a multiple-count claim in which at least one count has color-able merit may have to keep records that accurately reflect what time is expended on specific aspects of the case, in order to meet the burden of proof on that issue. A <em>post facto </em>arbitrary apportionment of generalized time records will not suffice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The instant case presents us with a situation in which the <em>Beery </em>language applies. Therefore, Judge Noel had to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>into account the extent to which the evidence regarding billable hours would result in an \u201carbitrary apportionment of generalized time records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The facts surrounding the fee determination in <em>Beery </em>are illuminating in helping us define that phrase. There, counsel submitted only a generalized statement claiming legal fees in excess of $36,000 along with the Rule 1-341 motion. Counsel apportioned one-fourth of the fees to a count which the court considered justified and not in bad faith, and one-fourth each to three claims filed in bad faith and without substantial justification. <em>Beery, </em>89 Md.App. at 99, 597 A.2d 516. The record indicated that the three unjustified issues were not equal with respect to the time necessary to demonstrate a lack of justification. The Court stated that \u201c[w]hat appellee\u2019s counsel did to apportion the total bill for legal fees, arbitrarily assigning about one-fourth to each count, simply will not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 597 A.2d 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Conversely, in the case at bar, appellants presented voluminous, usually specifically itemized, exhibits showing billable hours at the sanctions hearing. They also offered the testimony of an expert witness who had reviewed the time records, analyzed the reasonableness of the time spent on the different issues, redacted time spent on issues which were not found to have been filed in bad faith or without substantial justification, and gave an opinion as to the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged. Appellees were given the opportunity for, and conducted, extensive cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The process used to determine the fees here should not be considered an \u201carbitrary apportionment,\u201d when applying the <em>Beery </em>holding and taking into account the factual situation in <em>Beery. </em>The Court awarded a total of $25,000 in fees out of a total of $60,652.85 requested by Mr. Beale, on behalf of Harco and himself, and by Hazel &amp; Thomas, on behalf of First Virginia Bank. Here, unlike <em>Beery, </em>there was evidence of billings from which the expert and the trial court could determine an apportionment of fees. It is evident from the amount awarded that the Court considered the facts and law and exercised proper discretion in reaching a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Both <em>Newman, </em>314 Md. 364, 550 A.2d 959, and <em>Marquardt, </em>92 Md.App. 683, 610 A.2d 325, which hold that Rule 1-341 is inapplicable to proceedings outside of Maryland courts, were the law at the time of Judge Noel\u2019s ruling. \u201cJudges are presumed to know the law. Absent an indication to the contrary, we must assume that judges apply the law correctly to the case before them.\u201d <em>Hebb v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 493, 499, 356 A.2d 583 (1976). <em>See also Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 370, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984); <em>Samson v. State, </em>27 Md.App. 326, 334, 341 A.2d 817 (1975). Judge Noel\u2019s well-reasoned opinion gives us no indication to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We hold that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $25,000 was not an abuse of discretion under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Allocating the amounts due between the offending attorneys is part and parcel of the determination regarding the award amount, which rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. The same law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Our careful review of this record does not allow us to second guess the trial court\u2019s determination that Mr. Alison \u201cled the charge\u201d in this case. Zealous advocacy of a client\u2019s position is usually to be commended. Also commendable is knowing when to redirect and modify an argument to protect a client\u2019s best interest. When three courts and at least as many judges have determined that a claim is meritless, it may be time to modify the arguments on the merits of that claim. Mr. Alison continued to make the same arguments on the merits of the claim up to and at the hearing on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. These same arguments had previously been rejected, and the claims found to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Mr. Alison was suspended from the practice of law at the time the case was filed below. The reasons for Mr. Alison\u2019s suspension are found at <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 565 A.2d 660 (1989). At 319 Md. 708, 575 A.2d 334, the Court of Appeals upheld Judge Hinkel\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that in one prior incident Alison practiced law while suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">At oral argument, Alison admitted that he had prepared the initial pleadings while he was still suspended. He implied, when arguing that his sanction was disproportionately large, that, while he prepared the pleadings, they were filed by Mr. Major because he, Alison, was suspended. He further claimed that, even though he acknowledged being the initiating person, his sanction should have been smaller because Mr. Major \u2014 not he, Alison, had officially been in the case from the beginning. In essence, in stating these grounds, he was asserting that an attorney who is in a frivolous case a shorter period should be less sanctioned than an attorney who is in the case for a longer period. In making that argument, a similar allegation is also made, <em>ie., </em>that the attorney in the case the longer period should be subject to the greater sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We note that Alison appeared in this case not only in his own behalf, but also as counsel for Mr. Major. We question his ability to avoid a conflict of interest when he argues that his sanction should be less because he is less culpable than his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We need not determine, however, whether Mr. Alison is four times more culpable than Mr. Major for the conduct that led to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees under Rule 1-341. The sanction awarded against Mr. Alison is supported by the evidence. Whether Mr. Major should have been sanctioned more heavily, as Mr. Alison seemed to suggest at oral argument, is not before us; appellees have made no such assertion. We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that Mr. Major is liable for $5,000, and that Mr. Alison is liable for $20,000, of the $25,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">1. <em>Farmer </em>also focused on the appealability of such awards after an appeal to the circuit court from a District Court judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-13\">.
