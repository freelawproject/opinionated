Grand-Pierre, was struck by a Montgomery County vehicle. On June 11, 1992, Gerald Martin, who was a passenger in appellant\u2019s car at the time of the accident, filed a complaint against Montgomery County in the circuit court. Alleging that as a passenger in the vehicle driven by Grand-Pierre he sustained injuries in the collision with the county vehicle, Martin requested a jury trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>claimed damages in the amount of $250,000. On July 6, 1992, sixteen days <em>after </em>the three year statute of limitations had expired (but before Martin\u2019s Complaint had been answered by Montgomery County) Grand-Pierre filed a motion to intervene in the Martin case. This motion was accompanied by a proposed intervenor complaint seeking $200,000 in negligence damages, or a \u201clarger amount if authorized by the Local Government Tort Claims Act.\u201d Montgomery County filed an opposition to Grand-Pierre\u2019s motion to intervene on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired. On August 27, 1992, a hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Ruben, J.), at which Grand-Pierre\u2019s motion to intervene was denied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Grand-Pierre raises a single issue: Whether, after a timely Complaint by a passenger in an automobile collision negligence case mentions the vehicle driver and potential intervenor by name, and where the defendant has otherwise received timely notice of the intervenor\u2019s claim, a statute of limitations defense may correctly be interposed to both defeat a Rule 2-214 Motion to Intervene and Amended Complaint to the timely filing date of the original Complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Grand-Pierre claims that the Maryland intervention and relation back rules must be interpreted according to precedents \u201cunder the modern Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\u201d which, he asserts, would clearly permit his intervention and allow relation back to the filing date of Martin\u2019s complaint, and so circumvent the statute of limitations bar to his claim. Grand-Pierre is correct that the Maryland and federal intervention rules are similar. <em>Compare </em>Md.Rule 2-214 <em>with </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 24. Moreover, the Court of Appeals has stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>in the absence of Maryland authority, the similarity in these rules makes the decisions of the federal courts interpreting the federal rule of considerable precedential value in construing the Maryland rule. <em>Maryland Radiological Soc\u2019y, Inc. v. Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n, </em>285 Md. 383, 388 n. 5, 402 A.2d 907 (1979). <em>See also Citizens Coord. Comm. v. TKU Assocs., </em>276 Md. 705, 712, 351 A.2d 133 (1976) (federal cases interpreting federal rule continue to serve as a guide to interpretation of Md.Rule 2-214).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">This is not, however, simply an intervention case. Rather, because the proposed amendment here would extend the statute of limitations beyond the statutory three year limit, this intervention is really an effort to seek to amend the complaint by adding a new plaintiff. Grand-Pierre fails to recognize that the Maryland and federal rules governing amendment, unlike the intervention rules, differ in a critical respect. The federal amendment rule, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(c) Relation Back of Amendments. An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In contrast, the Maryland am\u00e9ndment rule, Md.Rule 2-341, contains no equivalent \u201crelation back\u201d provision. Thus, contrary to Grand Pierre\u2019s argument, the cases interpreting the \u201cmodern\u201d federal rule as to \u201crelation back\u201d are of little assistance in interpreting the Maryland rule, which contains no express provision for \u201crelation back.\u201d This is particularly so because in fact Md.Rule 2-341 was adopted <em>more recently </em>than the federal \u201crelation back\u201d rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Maryland Rule is in fact more \u201cmodern\u201d than the \u201cmodern\u201d federal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Initially, although not directly on point, <em>Walko Corp. v. Burger Chef Syst., Inc., </em>281 Md. 207, 378 A.2d 1100 (1977), makes clear that the Court of Appeals does not favor a potential plaintiffs attempt to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations. In <em>Walko, </em>a federal court certified to the Court of Appeals the question of whether the statute of limitations was suspended during the pendency of a motion to intervene, which was ultimately denied because factually dissimilar from the original case. In holding that the limitations period was not tolled during the pendency of the motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court discussed the fact that the intervenor, who had 11 days after the motion to intervene was denied and 60 days during its pendency to file a claim and did not do so, offered no explanation for his failure to file a separate but timely motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyQ\">Arguably, appellees were on notice of Walko\u2019s claim once the motion to intervene was filed. As we have indicated, however, Walko\u2019s approach to this case was hardly one of vigilance. The statute of limitations reflects a legislative judgment of what is deemed an adequate period of time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>which \u201ca person of ordinary diligence\u201d should bring his action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 215, 378 A.2d 1100, quoting <em>Ferrucci v. Jack, </em>255 Md. 523, 526, 258 A.2d 414 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Grand-Pierre is, of course, correct that <em>Walko </em>is not controlling here. It is relevant, however, because in <em>Walko </em>the Court of Appeals found determinative the intervenor-plaintiff s diligence, rather than the prejudice that would result to the defendants. This dramatically undercuts Grand-Pierre\u2019s similar argument that his intervention should be permitted because defendant, Montgomery County, was on notice of his claim from the original complaint filed by Martin (which mentions Grand-Pierre by name) and so would not be prejudiced by permitting relation back of his claim to the original complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In Maryland, although amendments are generally freely permitted in order to promote the ends of justice, <em>Ebert v. Ritchey, 54 </em>Md.App. 388, 394, 458 A.2d 891, <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 414 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1210, 104 S.Ct. 2399, 81 L.Ed.2d 356 \u201c[n]ot every amendment, even though allowable, is given retrospective effect, especially when giving it such effect will cause prejudice to or affect the substantive rights of other parties.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 237, 251, 549 A.2d 1171 (1988). \u201c[I]f an amendment sets forth a new cause of action, then limitations is measured from the time of the accrual of the cause to the date the amended declaration is filed, but if the amendment does not state a new cause of action, then limitations is determined with reference to the date of the original filing.\u201d <em>Myers v. Aragona, </em>21 Md.App. 45, 51, 318 A.2d 263, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 746 (1974). <em>See also, Doughty v. Prettyman, </em>219 Md. 83, 88, 148 A.2d 438 (1959); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>Cline v. Fountain Rock Lime and Brick, </em>214 Md. 251, 134 A.2d 304 (1957). Merely changing the legal theory does not constitute a new and different cause of action for purposes of statute of limitations and relation back; material operative facts, not the legal theory, determine the cause of action. <em>Priddy v. Jones, </em>81 Md.App. 164, 170, 567 A.2d 154 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 72, 570 A.2d 864 (1990). The latter principle, however, applies to the amendment of a pleading between the <em>original </em>parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">When amendment is sought to add a <em>new party </em>to the proceedings, that principle is inapplicable because <em>any </em>cause of action as to that party is, of course, a new cause of action. Thus, under Maryland law, absent misnomer, <em>see, e.g., Western Union Tel. Co. of Baltimore City v. State ex rel Nelson, </em>82 Md. 293, 306-308, 33 A. 763 (1896), relation back is not permitted when an amendment is sought to add a new defendant. <em>Alexander v. Rose, </em>181 Md. 447, 30 A.2d 785 (1943) (no relation back when incompetent\u2019s administrator is sought to be substituted for incompetent\u2019s trustee); <em>Talbott v. Gegenheimer, </em>237 Md. 62, 205 A.2d 285 (1964) (no relation back when statute of limitations had expired while complainant was seeking to have wife of defendant added as driver of the car); <em>Burket v. Aldridge, </em>241 Md. 423, 431, 216 A.2d 910 (1966) (no relation back when deceased defendant\u2019s personal representative is sought to be substituted for the deceased defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Maryland case law on the specific issue presented by this appeal, <em>i.e., </em>whether an intervenor\u2019s attempt to enter a suit as an additional <em>plaintiff </em>after the statute of limitations has run on the cause of action, is sparse. Several Court of Appeals cases, considered together, however, do elucidate the relation back rule in this context. In two old cases, <em>Abrahams v. Myers, </em>40 Md. 499 (1874) and <em>McDowell v. Goldsmith, </em>2 Md. Ch. 370 (1851), creditors brought bills in their own behalf and in behalf of other creditors. In both cases, the Court held that when limitations expired before the other creditors sought to intervene they could not join the suits, <em>i.e., </em>no relation back was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>More recently, in <em>Crowe v. Houseworth, </em>272 Md. 481, 325 A.2d 592 (1974), Crowe, who, together with 10 siblings, owned a farm in Garrett County as joint tenants, instituted an action against Houseworth for trespass. Houseworth countered with a preliminary objection that Crowe was only one of eleven joint owners and the other owners must be made parties to the case. Several years passed and the preliminary motion was ultimately granted. Although Crowe proffered that he would then join the other joint owners, the lower court held the entire action barred by the statute of limitations, which had clearly expired. The Court of Appeals reversed. First the Court acknowledged that in Maryland joint tenants must join in actions for injuries to real property, but explained that \u201c[i]f the rule as to joinder is applied too rigidly, it is not difficult to conceive of a case where a joint tenant\u2019s right to relief might well be frustrated by the recalcitrance of one of his co-tenants,\u201d and so concluded that the late joinder should have been allowed. <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 325 A.2d 592. Turning to the limitations defense, the Court held that, because Crowe\u2019s suit was indisputably timely filed and for the full amount of damages, Houseworth would not be prejudiced by the presence of new plaintiffs, and so the amended complaint was not barred by limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In <em>Crowe, </em>the court distinguished <em>Abrahams </em>and <em>McDowell </em>on two grounds. First, it noted that in those early creditors\u2019 rights cases, it was not the original plaintiffs, but the new parties, who sought the addition of the new parties. <em>Crowe, </em>272 Md. at 487, 325 A.2d 592. Secondly, the <em>Crowe </em>court recognized that in the earlier cases, unlike the situation in <em>Crowe </em>itself, permitting the addition of new plaintiffs would, if there were insufficient assets, imperil \u201cthe reward usually accorded the diligent,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the original plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>Both of these distinctions also differentiate <em>Crowe </em>from the case at hand. Moreover, Grand-Pierre\u2019s intervention is not required in order to preserve the original plaintiffs timely claim against Montgomery County, while the intervention of additional plaintiffs in <em>Crowe </em>was necessary to preserve Crowe\u2019s claim against Houseworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>That the Court of Appeals did not intend to permit relation back in cases like that at hand, although implicit in <em>Crowe, </em>is explicit in <em>Morrell v. Williams, </em>279 Md. 497, 366 A.2d 1040 (1976). In <em>Morrell, </em>a sixteen-year-old boy was struck and killed by a van owned by Morrell and driven by his employee, Worsham. The boy\u2019s mother filed a timely claim against Morrell and Worsham. After the statute of limitations had expired, an amended declaration was filed adding a fourth count, asserting a wrongful death claim by the next friend of the infant daughter of the young boy. Morrell \u201cdemurred\u201d to that count and that \u201cdemurrer\u201d was sustained on limitations grounds; Worsham did not \u201cdemur\u201d and the jury returned a verdict against him in favor of the illegitimate child. The Court of Appeals, in reversing the judgment, stated that [the infant\u2019s] claim did not merely relate to the manner in which the total amount of recovery originally claimed would be divided, but to an additional amount of recovery.... and [this] claim, instead of being based on the assertion of a claim to some part of [the mother\u2019s] recovery under the original [timely filed] declaration, was for a wholly different pecuniary loss and further pyramided the amount sought.</p>\n<p id=\"A9I\"><em>Id. </em>at 508, 366 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><em>Morrell, </em>considered in conjunction with <em>Crowe, Abrahams, </em>and <em>McDowell, </em>clarifies the law in Maryland on relation back when an additional plaintiff seeks to intervene after the statute of limitations has run. Unless the additional plaintiff will merely be sharing in the damage award, and not \u201cpyramiding\u201d the original amount requested, relation back will not be applied so as to allow a plaintiff to side step a defense of limitations. Here, as the circuit court recognized, Grand-Pierre\u2019s addition as a plaintiff would have subjected Montgomery County to additional liability. Grand-Pierre suggests that this is so only because he sought an additional amount in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause, which, according to him, \u201cis falling out of favor\u201d and is \u201cmeaningless in modern pleading,\u201d and so should be ignored. In fact, the Local Government Tort Claims Act specifically provides that liability for a local government for negligent acts of an employee may not exceed $500,000 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>total claims for an occurrence and $200,000 per individual claim. Md.Code (1957, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-404(a) of Cts. and Jud.Proc.Art. Thus, prior to Grand-Pierre\u2019s attempt to intervene, Montgomery County was only exposed to the amount of damages allowed for a single claim, $200,000. Had he been successful, Montgomery County potentially would have been subject to $400,000 in damages for two claims, not just because of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause, but because of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The denial of Grand-Pierre\u2019s motion to intervene, which was, in effect, a motion to amend the complaint to add a new plaintiff after the statute of limitations had expired, was in accord with the principles set forth in <em>Morrell, Crowe, Abrahams, </em>and <em>McDowell. </em>Federal case law interpreting a \u201crelation back\u201d rule for which there is no Maryland analogue is inapposite. Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s refusal to grant the motion was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">. At the outset, it should be noted that the appeal is properly before this Court because a denial of a motion to intervene is a final appealable order. <em>Maryland Radiological Soc\u2019y, Inc. v. Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n, </em>285 Md. 383, 388 n. 4, 402 A.2d 907 (1979). <em>See also Citizens Coordinating Comm. </em>v. <em>TKU Assocs., </em>276 Md. 705, 709-710, 351 A.2d 133 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-5\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) was originally adopted in 1938. It was amended in 1966 to reflect its present form and has existed since that time without substantial change, except for an unrelated amendment in 1991. Md.Rule 2-341 is based on two old rules: Rules 320 and 379. Those rules were rescinded and Rule 2-341 was adopted in July, 1984. <em>See also, </em>Paul V. Neimeyer &amp; Linda M.

Grand-Pierre also claims that Montgomery County had notice of his claim from the police report of the accident.

Not only was this issue not raised below and therefore is not preserved for our review, <em>see </em>Md.Rule 8-131, but also it is doubtful whether Martin who has \u201cstated his non-opposition to Mr. Grand-Pierre\u2019s intervention,\u201d would be so willing to accept Grand-Pierre as a co-plaintiff if Martin would be forced to share his damage award with Grand-Pierre,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
