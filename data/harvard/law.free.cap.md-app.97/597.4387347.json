They also appeal the trial court\u2019s determination that the claim was timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">At the pertinent time, Article 101, section 40(c) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provided for modification of awards if \u201capplication therefor shall be made to the Commission within five years next following the last payment of compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the last payment of compensation occurred on September 19, 1985, that the modification claim was filed with the Commission on September 24, 1990, and that the claim was filed with the Commission more than five years after the last payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The crux of the case revolves around a letter sent not to the Commission, but to the insurer. That letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">August 6, 1990</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">The Hartford</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">Attn: Samuel Gilliland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">57 W.

The insurer, in response to the letter, informed appellee, that the claim was time barred. Prior to receiving the insurer\u2019s response, the appellee filed his claim with the Commission but, as we have said, that filing was untimely. The trial court apparently found either that the silence of appellant, following the direct question posed in the letter of August 6th, amounted to an estoppel by silence and thus a waiver of the statutory bar or that the letter was the filing of a claim with the Commission, or both. We disagree and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Limitations and Equitable Estoppel Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In <em>Vest v. Giant Food Stores, Inc., </em>329 Md. 461, 620 A.2d 340 (1993), Vest asserted, among other things, that the Commission\u2019s express retention of jurisdiction to make a future determination of permanent partial disability tolled any application of the five-year limitation period. The Court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">The Commission\u2019s power to reopen awards ... is expressly limited with respect to the time during which it may exercise that power. Section 40(c) ... limits the exercise of that jurisdiction to a five-year period....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">... [S]uch a reservation [of the power to reopen], even if intended by the Commission, is wholly inconsistent with \u00a7 40(c). The Commission cannot bypass the statutory restriction on its authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 620 A.2d 340. <em>See also Adkins v. Weisner, </em>238 Md. 411, 209 A.2d 255 (1965) (when weekly payments are converted to lump sum, the five-year period is computed from the lump sum payment date, not the date that weekly payments would have been finally paid).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The Court noted in <em>Montgomery County v. McDonald, </em>317 Md. 466, 472, 564 A.2d 797 (1989), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">Undoubtedly the Act is to be construed liberally in favor of injured employees and to effectuate its remedial purposes, but a liberal rule of construction does not mean that courts are free to disregard the provisions comprising the Act....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The foregoing rule of construction is particularly apt for the subject limitations provision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201c[T]he general purpose of the applicable workmen\u2019s compensation act to compensate injured workers should not be used to interpret the limitations provision, because the very existence of a limitations provision in the act indicates that the legislature has deliberately compromised the general compensation purpose in the interests of the purposes served by the limitations provision.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>See also Walter J. Crismer &amp; Son, Inc. v.

Huntingfield Corporation, </em>304 Md. 615, 500 A.2d 641 (1985), addressed the tolling of the three-year general statute of limitations then contained in Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Annotated section 5-101. In <em>Booth, </em>the building owner discovered that glasswork installed by Booth leaked. Booth made numerous efforts to repair the work, but the problems were never completely rectified. During the period (two years) when Booth was attempting to repair the work and for two more years thereafter, its president proffered to the building owner, Huntingfield, that the repairs would be successfully made. Ultimately they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Huntingfield eventually filed suit. Booth pled limitations, asserting that more than three years had elapsed from the time when Huntingfield had first discovered the problem. We had held that Booth\u2019s continuing attempts to repair the work tolled the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reversing us, the Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">LW]e are aware that courts in some jurisdictions, in contract and warranty actions, have adopted or recognized the rule that limitations will be tolled where ... assurances are given that repairs will be made____ Other courts, however, have determined that even though assurances are given, attempts to repair will not toll limitations <em>absent a strong showing of inducement by the defendant not to sue.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 622, 500 A.2d 641 (citations omitted, emphasis added). The Court then addressed Maryland law, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">We have long adhered to the principle that where the legislature has not expressly provided for an exception in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>statute of limitations, the court will not allow any implied or equitable exception to be ingrafted upon it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmAC\">... In Maryland ... it is well settled that equitable estoppel will not toll the running of limitations absent a showing that the defendant \u201cheld out any inducements not to file suit or indicated that limitations would not be pleaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 623-24, 500 A.2d 641 (citations omitted). Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am_W\">The Court of Appeals does not allow any implied or equitable exception to be engrafted on the statute of limitations merely on the ground that such exception would be within the spirit of the statute. To the contrary, the Court looks to the public policy served by the defense of limitations, and permits it to function arbitrarily, without discrimination between the just and unjust claim, or the avoidable and unavoidable delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\"><em>Glenn v. Morelos, </em>79 Md.App. 90, 99, 555 A.2d 1064 <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 427, 559 A.2d 790 (1989) (quoting <em>The Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. 549, 562, 429 A.2d 538, <em>cert. denied </em>290 Md. 717 (1981)) (citation omitted). <em>See Antigua Condominium Association v. Melba Investors Atlantic, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 726, 751, 501 A.2d 1359, <em>vacated on other grounds </em>307 Md. 700, 517 A.2d 75 (1986) (no equitable estoppel in absence of inducements or indications that the defense of limitations will not be relied on by defendant); <em>McMahan v. Dorchester Fertilizer Co., </em>184 Md. 155, 160, 40 A.2d 313 (1944). In <em>The Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. at 564, 429 A.2d 538 we went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">Maryland courts have infrequently addressed the juxtaposition of the defense of limitations and the doctrine of equitable estoppel.... We have already seen that the courts rigorously protect the defense of limitations____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">In <em>Lehninger, </em>we noted and relied on <em>Leonhart v. Atkinson, </em>265 Md. 219, 289 A2.d 1 (1972), in which it was claimed that an accountant\u2019s assurances that the position of IRS was incorrect had lulled the plaintiffs into a false sense of security \u201cwhich delayed the start of litigation.\u201d <em>Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. at 566, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>429 A.2d 538. In the present case, as in those noted above, no assurances of any kind were made. Judge Digges\u2019s opinion in <em>Leonhart </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">[T]he Leonharts argue that appellee ought to be prohibited from using the statute as a bar since his conduct \u201cobscure[d] the [appellants\u2019] perception of the wrong---- It was not alleged that the accountant ... asked the Leonharts to forbear bringing suit ... [or] indicated he would waive the defense of limitations ... or that he induced them not to file suit by giving assurances---- [T]he only conclusion ... is that the delay ... was due to the lack of diligence on the part of the Leonharts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"><em>Leonhart, </em>265 Md. at 227-28, 289 A.2d 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">In an earlier breach of contract case, <em>Walko Corporation v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc., </em>281 Md. 207, 378 A.2d 1100 (1977), the Court of Appeals discussed the general standards applicable to statutes of limitations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">This policy of repose has fostered a traditional rule concerning the tolling of statutes of limitation that can be fairly termed one of strict construction. Early on we adopted this rigorous stance: \u201cThe principle of law is indisputable, that when the Statute of Limitations once begins to run, nothing will stop or impede its operation.\u201d The rule has lost little of its vitality.... [T]he principle ... \u201cwhile not immutable under all circumstances ... is still the general legal approach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">This venerable rule, which defers to the legislative intent expressed in the statute of limitations itself, ... avoids implied exceptions or strained constructions....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 378 A.2d 1100 (citations omitted). <em>See also Glenn v. Morelos, </em>79 Md.App. 90, 96, 555 A.2d 1064 (1989); <em>Bennett v. Baskin &amp; Sears, </em>77 Md.App. 56, 76, 549 A.2d 393 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">In affirming a trial court summary judgment dismissing a case on the basis of limitations, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>There is no showing that Mr. Clagett <em>held out </em>any inducement not to file suit. There is no indication that Mr. Clagett <em>indicated </em>in any way that limitations would not be pleaded. There is no indication that any legal defense would be waived. There is <em>no showing </em>of any unconscionable, inequitable or fraudulent act of commission or omission upon <em>which Jordan relied </em>and has been misled to his injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFi\"><em>Jordan v. Morgan, </em>252 Md. 122, 132, 249 A.2d 124 (1969) (emphasis added). <em>See also Nyitrai v. Bonis, </em>266 Md. 295, 300, 292 A.2d 642 (1972) (\u201cSettlement negotiations alone, however, do not raise an estoppel, especially where there is no showing ... that the appellee ... <em>held out </em>any inducements not to file suit or <em>indicated </em>that limitations would not be pleaded.\u201d (citation omitted, emphasis added)); <em>Leonhart, </em>265 Md. 219, 289 A.2d 1; <em>Watson v. Dorsey, </em>265 Md. 509, 290 A.2d 530 (1972); <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. at 568, 429 A.2d 538 (\u201cSimilarly the highest courts of other jurisdictions have refused, in the absence of fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment, to create an equitable estoppel precluding the defense of limitations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In the negligence case of <em>Bertonazzi v. Hillman, </em>241 Md. 361, 216 A.2d 723 (1966), suit was filed against Hillman\u2019s administratrix several days after the expiration of the limitations period. Prior to Hillman\u2019s death, the plaintiff and the Hillmans\u2019 insurer had been conducting negotiations to settle the claim. When plaintiffs filed a suit against Hillman, the summons was returned <em>mortis est. </em>Plaintiffs lawyer discovered that it had been so returned on the 18th of July 1963, at about the same time he discovered that he had filed the suit in the wrong jurisdiction. He refiled the suit against the administratrix but still in the wrong county.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Plaintiffs counsel contacted the administratrix and informed her that there were some technical problems with the suit. The administratrix responded that she had no objection to a proper determination of the facts and referred plaintiffs lawyer to her lawyer. The administratrix\u2019s lawyer was called and told of the potential limitations problem. He agreed to accept service of process but indicated that he would not be consent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ing to jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer then served the administratrix\u2019s lawyer. Thereafter, the suit was dismissed because it had been filed in the wrong jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">It was refiled in the proper jurisdiction after the statute had expired. When the plea of limitations was filed, the plaintiff filed a \u201cPlea of Estoppel as to the Statute of Limitations.\u201d The telephone conversation between the plaintiffs lawyer and the administratrix\u2019s lawyer was the primary basis for the claim of estoppel. While the Court of Appeals held that the prior filing was sufficient to toll the statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it summarily rejected the estoppel argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">We see no support ... for a finding of waiver or estoppel____ [T]here [is no] mention of or reference to any express promise or agreement ... to waive the statute.... [N]othing that Mrs. Hillman or her lawyer said or did inspired or fostered the idea [that the statute would be tolled]. There is no assertion that representatives of Mr. Hillman\u2019s insurer led appellant to believe that liability would not be contested or that any legal defense would be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9Pt\"><em>Bertonazzi, </em>241 Md. at 365, 216 A.2d 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In <em>Cromwell v. Ripley, </em>11 Md.App. 173, 273 A.2d 218 (1971), the appellant filed with the clerk of the court a motion to amend a declaration. The clerk failed to bring it to the attention of the court prior to the expiration of the limitations period. The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201c... [I]t was counsel\u2019s responsibility ... to keep himself abreast of the litigation of which he is counsel of record ... it was your responsibility to see ... that the motion ... got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>to the attention of the Judge ... and was acted upon before the Statute ran on August 18.\u201d<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-r\"><em>Id. </em>at 179, 273 A.2d 218. We held that limitations were not tolled by the deposit of the motion for leave to amend in the clerk\u2019s office, saying: \u201cIt was the obligation of appellant, in order to toll the Statute of Limitations, to commence an action within the three year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 273 A.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Dixon v. Checchia, </em>249 Md. 20, 238 A.2d 247 (1968), involved a statute of limitations for the filing of claims against an estate. During the period after the accident, negotiations for settlement were undertaken. Checchia died. The Dixons were not informed of Checchia\u2019s death during the negotiations with Checchia\u2019s insurer. After the period for filing claims against Checchia\u2019s estate had elapsed the Court, in upholding the defense of limitations, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">In this case, the statutory notice ... was given and it is not alleged ... that the administrator had \u201c \u2018requested and induced\u2019 the appellant not to file suit and assure her \u2018that said claim would be settled and * * * damages paid by * * * deceased\u2019s estate without the necessity of filing suit.\u2019 \u201d We do not think that the appellants were <em>induced </em>into filing after the expiration of the six month period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 27, 238 A.2d 247 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We note that information on the statute of limitations is equally available to all parties. These statutes of repose, being just <em>that </em>\u2014 statutes, are matters of record. The general rule is that \u201cmere silence as to rights of record does not create an estoppel.\u201d <em>Zimmerman v. Summers, </em>24 Md.App. 100, 119, 330 A.2d 722 (1975) (quoting <em>Oberheim v. Reeside, </em>116 Md. 265, 276, 81 A. 590 (1911)) (referring to property rights of record).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The Doctrine of Estoppel by Silence</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">One of the seminal cases addressing the doctrine of estoppel by silence was <em>Carmine v. Bowen, </em>104 Md. 198, 64 A. 932 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(1906), where a landowner learned of a tenant farmer\u2019s intention to sow a crop. The landowner had notified the farmer by letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">I understand that you are making preparations for sowing your fall crop which will not mature until after the expiration of your lease of the farm. * * * I do not admit that in any event you will have the right to remove any crops ... and will stand on my rights in this matter.... But I particularly warn you, that I will hold you strictly to the consequences of your failure to sow grass seed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 200, 64 A. 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In the fall, after that letter was written, the landowner was in the field while the farmer was sowing the grass seed. The landowner asked the farmer how much timothy had been sowed and expressed satisfaction. The farmer then told the appellant, \u201c T don\u2019t anticipate any trouble in the cutting of my crop....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The landowner made no response. The Court of Appeals noted the landowner\u2019s concern with the sowing of grass seed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">[H]e [the landowner] strongly implied ... before the crops were sown, that a failure to sow grass seed would defeat the tenant\u2019s right to remove the crops after the term had ended. But the tenant did sow the grass seed, and at the very time he was putting it in the ground in accordance with the insistence of the landlord he remarked to the latter that he, the tenant, anticipated no trouble in cutting the crop he was then sowing; to which remark the landlord made no reply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">It has been justly and forcibly observed that there is a negative fraud in imposing a false apprehension on another by silence <em>where silence is treacherously </em>oppressive....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">... It was whilst the tenant was doing the very thing which by the terms of the letter [from the landowner] he naturally believed was the thing that entitled him to remove the crop ... that he remarked to the landlord---- \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any trouble....\u201d <em>The circumstances </em>and the situation all clearly indicate that it was his [landlord\u2019s] duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>to speak____ He must be held to be estopped to deny what he tacitly admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 201-07, 64 A. 932 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">There is an important distinction that appellee fails to make in relying on <em>Carmine. </em>When a tenant farmer tells the landowner that he is planting crops and will harvest them when they ripen some months later, all parties immediately understand that the crops cannot be harvested until they are ripe. In the case at bar, there was nothing stopping appellee or limiting his ability to file his claim with the Commission simultaneously with, or the day after, his counsel\u2019s letter to the insurer. It was unnecessary to wait to file the claim, while in <em>Carmine </em>all parties knew that the crops could not be harvested immediately \u2014 before the time expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In another early case, <em>Carroll v. Manganese Steel Safe Co., </em>111 Md. 252, 73 A. 665 (1909), the dispute involved the payment of sales commissions. In a previous transaction, Carroll had been promised \u201ca liberal commission\u201d for selling a steel vault. That transaction was not consummated. Subsequently, negotiations ensued between Maganese and another customer for the erection of a vault. During these negotiations, Carroll was told by Maganese\u2019s representative that if the contract price was too low, no commission could be paid. Carroll remained silent. The Court held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOBi\">that Carroll fatally estopped himself to assert his present claim by remaining silent when Lindgren told him that at the price at which the appellee could get the contract there would be no commission for either of them. His silence permitted Lindgren to go on and conclude a contract on behalf of the appellee, under circumstances when it is not reasonable to suppose he would have done so but for that silence____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 259, 73 A. 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">More recently, however, the courts have subjected claims of estoppel by silence to closer scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">The claimant in the workers\u2019 compensation case of <em>Nazario v. Washington Adventist Hospital, Inc., </em>45 Md.App. 243, 412 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>A.2d 1271, <em>cert. denied, </em>288 Md. 740 (1980), claimed that the insurer should be estopped from making a subrogation claim because it had failed to intervene in the action until after the claimant had settled the case. Nazario asserted that had he known of the insurer\u2019s intention, his settlement demand would have been higher so as to include that claim. We reiterated that \u201c[e]quitable estoppel is applicable only where there is a duty imposed upon the party remaining silent to speak.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 412 A.2d 1271. We noted that the workers\u2019 compensation statute imposed no duty and that the insurer did not know of any lack of Nazario\u2019s knowledge as to the insurer\u2019s rights. \u201c[T]hus the estoppel argument fails.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 412 A.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">One of the issues involved in <em>Eastern Shore Warehousing, Inc. v. Wallis, </em>87 Md.App. 141, 589 A.2d 497 <em>cert. denied, 324 </em>Md. 325, 597 A.2d 422 (1991), was the application of a contractual limitations period. The party claiming damage from a fire gave timely notice (sixty days) of its claim to Eastern Shore. The notice itself contained all required information. Eastern Shore representatives affirmed that the notice was complete and timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The contractual arrangement, however, required that suit be filed within nine months after the notice was given to Eastern Shore. It was filed ten months later. The claimant alleged that the assurances made by Eastern Shore, that the notice was sufficient for notice purposes, caused him to overlook that the filing of suit had a contractual limitation deadline. Judge Fischer, for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">Ordinarily, equitable estoppel arises in cases of this nature because one party misleads the other into missing a filing deadline either by implying that the deadline has been extended or by assurances that the claim will be paid. It is clear that this did not occur here....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that Leizure did or said anything that gave a false impression or misled appellees or their agent in any way. As a result, appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>are left with the proposition that Leizure failed to advise Sharum that suit needed to be filed when Sharum asked if \u201ceverything [was] in order.\u201d ... Leizure was under no' duty to volunteer to Sharum that suit needed to be filed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">In addition, appellees cannot reasonably argue that they changed their position or course of action based upon anything Leizure said----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">... There were no conversations or correspondence between the parties relating to Dresser\u2019s obligation to bring suit within nine months. Leizure was under no duty to make Sharum aware of the requirement to bring suit ... and Leisure did nothing to lead Dresser to change its position to its detriment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 147-49, 589 A.2d 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Of the cases we have reviewed, <em>Eastern Shore </em>is closest on point with the instant case, where a statute imposes no duty. There were no contractual duties created in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The insurer did nothing to cause the claimant to change his position. In fact, it appears from his failure to file that Beall was unaware of the need to file. Nor is there any evidence that the insurer knew that the filing period was about to expire prior to its recovery of the file from the dead file depository, and the file was not recovered until after the filing deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In the case at bar, the estoppel argument is much weaker than that in <em>Eastern Shore. </em>The parties here were direct adversaries (to the extent adversarial relationships exist in workers\u2019 compensation cases), and there is absolutely no evidence that appellant had any knowledge that appellee was unaware of the statute of limitations \u2014 a statute of record. Additionally, the mere forwarding of a letter to the insurer in no way indicates that appellee was going to forbear filing his claim with the Commission within the five-year period. The claim could have been filed the next day, the next week.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>We are additionally constrained to comment on whether, in an adversarial relationship, there can generally be any duty (unless expressly imposed by statute, or by the rules of discovery, procedure, or pleading) for the parties to advise the opposing parties of anticipated defenses or whether there is any requirement (unless expressly imposed by statute or rule) for one adversarial party to advise the other of weaknesses or impending weaknesses in the other\u2019s cases. Certainly, unless statutorily imposed, there is no such duty in circumstances such as exist in the present case. <em>See also Subsequent Injury Fund v. Ehrman, </em>89 Md.App. 741, 757, 599 A.2d 875 (1992), and the cases therein cited (\u201cMere silence will generally not raise an estoppel against a silent party---- Equitable estoppel is applicable only where there is a duty imposed upon the party remaining silent to speak.\u201d); <em>Impala Platinum Limited v. Impala Sales (USA), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 323, 389 A.2d 887 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Before concluding, we note that equitable estoppel, whether by conduct or silence, generally involves situations much more egregious than the present case. In addition to the cases heretofore mentioned, an additional sample of the cases includes: <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Medical Center, </em>313 Md. 301, 545 A.2d 658 (1988), where there was a fraudulent statement (or negligent statement amounting to fraud) which served to conceal the true condition of a patient; <em>Bayshore Industries, Inc. v. Ziats, </em>232 Md. 167, 192 A.2d 487 (1963), where the employer told the employee that if she filed a claim \u201cyou will be sorry. You will never work here again and probably nowhere around here.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 192 A.2d 487; the often-cited case of <em>Chandlee v. Shockley, </em>219 Md. 493, 150 A.2d 438 (1959), where the personal representative\u2019s agent expressly told the estate claimant that he would not take advantage of the delay; <em>Patapsco &amp; Back Rivers Railroad Co. v. Davis, </em>208 Md. 149, 117 A.2d 566 (1955), where the workers\u2019 compensation claimant was illiterate, the normal practice was for the employer to prepare claims, the employer\u2019s agent had called a meeting about payment disputes, and the employer\u2019s representative indicated that they would help the claimant get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>something; <em>Webb v. Johnson, </em>195 Md. 587, 74 A.2d 7 (1950), where the employer told the employee he would take care of matters and that the insurer would take care of him and work out a settlement; <em>Harrison v. McCarty, </em>178 Md. 377, 13 A.2d 544 (1940), where the employer told the employee that everything was fixed up and that the employer would make the necessary reports; <em>Ohio Casualty Insurance Company v. Hallowell, </em>94 Md.App. 444, 617 A.2d 1134 (1993), where there was an express written forbearance agreement waiving the statute of limitations; <em>Markert v. Beatley, </em>84 Md.App. 594, 581 A.2d 445 (1990), a will caveat case where the only lawful heir, living in Germany, did not receive probate notice in time to permit a response and the opposing party was aware of the heir\u2019s attempt to file a caveat and allegations of fraud and undue influence existed; and <em>Sole v. Darby, </em>52 Md.App. 218, 447 A.2d 506 (1982), where the offered notice of the time to file objections to the appointment of a personal representative erroneously stated a date that was already three days beyond the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We hold that the trial court erred in finding an estoppel or waiver of the bar of limitations. As there is no dispute that the statute in effect during the entire relative period required claims to be filed with the Commission and the uncontradicted evidence proved that the claim was not filed with the Commission within five years, the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-15\">. The statute has since been recodified with little, if any, relevant substantive changes as section 9-736(a)(3) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-11\">.

The Court of Appeals later, in <em>Walko Corporation, </em>281 Md. 207, 378 A.2d 1100, strongly limited its holding in <em>Bertonazzi </em>as to the venue-limitations relationship. As pointed out by Judge Harrell for this Court in <em>Baker, Watts &amp; Company v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>95 Md.App. 145, 196, 620 A.2d 356 (1993), Maryland Rule 2-101(b) amended May 14, 1992, effective July 1992, now provides that if an action is filed in a foreign court within the Maryland period of limitations and subsequently dismissed, but refiled in a Maryland court within 30 days, it shall be treated as timely filed. This new rule modifies the treatment of limitations issues when suits are wrongfully filed in foreign jurisdictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\">4.
