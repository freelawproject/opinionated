The facts of this case distinguish it from other instances of racial prejudice. We are convinced by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and <em>Georgia v. McCollum, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992), and this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Mejia v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 31, 599 A.2d 1207, <em>vacated and remanded, </em>328 Md. 522, 616 A.2d 356 (1992), and <em>Brashear v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 709, 603 A.2d 901, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 523, 610 A.2d 796 (1992), to conclude that the trial court correctly dismissed the jury panel. Accordingly, we affirm the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The appellant, Gary Gilchrist, was charged with distribution of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the Honorable Ellen M. Heller presiding, on August 3rd and 4th of 1992. Appellant was convicted of both charges and sentenced to concurrent terms of five years imprisonment. From this conviction he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">During the jury selection process, the prosecuting attorney, Ms. McNamara, expressed her concern that defense counsel was exercising the use of her peremptory strikes in a racially biased manner. The following colloquy occurred between the court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">MS. STEPHENSON: Your Honor, may we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">(Counsel and the defendant approached the bench, and the following ensued:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">THE COURT: Do you want to try to get that juror back who was just excused? Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>MS. McNAMARA: I don\u2019t know the name of the case, but it is the case that came down after <em>Basso </em>which indicates that there are \u2014 there is no right to any racially motivated strikes. And every strike so far exercised by the defense counsel has been of white jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">Some of those jurors have not answered questions so it cannot be based on the fact that they gave answers that would indicate\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">THE COURT: Which juror are you questioning or do you want to go through a reason for each of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">MS. McNAMARA: For each one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">THE COURT: All right. That\u2019s seven jurors you\u2019ve struck. They were all white. Let\u2019s go through them one by one and give me the reasons you struck them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">Juror number one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">MS. STEPHENSON: She is a victim of a crime, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">THE COURT: What crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">MS. STEPHENSON: She\u2019s the victim of a robbery, a store was held up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">MS. McNAMARA: Excuse me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">THE COURT: Her parents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">MS. STEPHENSON: Right. Parents and grandparents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-16\">MS. McNAMARA: Do you want me to address them as we go through them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-17\">THE COURT: I appreciate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-18\">MS. McNAMARA: Your Honor, as to Juror Number One, there was no \u2014 she was one of many people who indicated that she was the victim of a crime. Also after questioning she indicated that could be fair and there was no request to strike her for cause at the time that we were at the bench initially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-19\">THE COURT: Well, that\u2019s right. But what I do for cause is still different from what she does for peremptory. Although I wouldn\u2019t see it reason for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>I don\u2019t think even with the latest decision you need a cause. You just cannot have a racially discriminatory reason for striking someone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">MS. McNAMARA: I\u2019m just putting\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">THE COURT: That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t strike for your own reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">MS. McNAMARA: I\u2019m just putting my reasons on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Until the day they say that we do [away] with peremptories \u2014 and we\u2019re almost there \u2014 I cannot \u2014 you strike for your cause as long as it\u2019s not a discriminatory, unconstitutional reason. But we\u2019ll go through \u2014 all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">MS. STEPHENSON: Can I just ask one question before we go on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">MS. STEPHENSON: What is the remedy for this, a new panel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">THE COURT: Well, it might be just that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">MS. STEPHENSON: It\u2019s really rather interesting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">THE COURT: It is true that of seven jurors you struck, they were all white.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-15\">MS. STEPHENSON: I understand that is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-16\">THE COURT: So let\u2019s go through them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-17\">MS. STEPHENSON: But the record should reflect the first three \u2014 six\u2014the first six jurors on the first page are all white. The next \u2014 and then the next three were black and the next one was white. That\u2019s on the first page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-18\">THE COURT: All right. But now that the call has been made, I\u2019ve got to, in the first instance, make a decision\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-19\">MS. STEPHENSON: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-20\">THE COURT: \u2014whether or not your reason was discriminatory because of an individual\u2019s race. I mean, that\u2019s what the cases say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-21\">MS. STEPHENSON: That\u2019s true, Judge. But I want the record to reflect that the majority of the jurors that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>presented to me were, in fact, white. There have been very few black jurors that have been called up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">THE COURT: But as I understand the case law, that\u2019s [sic] still might have it. The circumstances and the context might explain, but we\u2019ve got to go through them one by one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">MS. STEPHENSON: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">THE COURT: The next juror in numbers of where they were seated, not the numbers of who you struck, was Juror Number \u2014 Summons Number 117, Juror Number Three, you struck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">MS. STEPHENSON: Judge, I personally, by looking at her \u2014 I see jurors in the box and I look at the way they relate to each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">THE COURT: Well, how did she look?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">MS. STEPHENSON: She looked \u2014 she reminded me of my Catholic school teacher that I didn\u2019t particularly like, and I didn\u2019t particularly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t find that was a valid reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">MS. STEPHENSON: Well, that\u2019s why I struck her, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">THE COURT: She looked like your Catholic school teacher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">MS. STEPHENSON: Her look in the box at the other people who were in the box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not a satisfactory explanation. Now, let\u2019s continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">MS. STEPHENSON: Well, that\u2019s why I struck her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-16\">THE COURT: Did you not like your Catholic school teacher, Ms. Stephenson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-17\">MS. STEPHENSON: Not that particular one she reminded me of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-18\">THE COURT: All right. Let\u2019s go through them. The next one I have is Juror Number Five, Summons Number 122.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-19\">MS. STEPHENSON: I thought, Judge, he was young. I didn\u2019t think particularly he would be a strong juror for my case by looking at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>THE COURT: And why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">MS. STEPHENSON: Because I look at the way he fits into the persons that are on the panel. And what I\u2019m trying to accomplish from the look of him, from the way he sat\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">THE COURT: Well, how did he look from the way he was sitting that made you feel he was not good, other than the fact he was white and young?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">MS. STEPHENSON: Well, he \u2014 number one, most of the jurors would look at my client and look over at the table. He was just sitting there not relating to anything in the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">THE COURT: Because he wasn\u2019t relating to your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">MS. STEPHENSON: Not relating to anything or anyone in the room. Frankly, I don\u2019t think he even wanted to be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a satisfactory explanation either. Let\u2019s continue. Juror Number Nine who was Summons Number 131 was also struck by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">MS. STEPHENSON: 131?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">THE COURT: Summons 131, Juror Number Nine, was also struck by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">MS. STEPHENSON: Okay. ' Her brother\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\">THE COURT: It was a him. It was Juror \u2014 Summons Number 131.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\">MS. McNAMARA: On the bottom of the first page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-16\">MS. STEPHENSON: 131. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-17\">THE COURT: Juror Number Nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-18\">MS. STEPHENSON: I believe this is the young man who \u2014 was it Juror Number Nine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-19\">THE COURT: Juror Number \u2014 Summons Nine \u2014 Summons 131, Juror Number Nine. 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-20\">MS. STEPHENSON: Okay. My client looked over at him. He said \u2014 my client said he was acting kind of peculiar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-21\">THE COURT: How?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-22\">MS. STEPHENSON: I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: He stared at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">THE COURT: He stared at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">THE DEFENDANT: He stared at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">THE COURT: And he made you feel uncomfortable when he stared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">THE DEFENDANT: When he stared at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">THE COURT: All right. At your client\u2019s request then you struck the juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">MS. STEPHENSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">THE COURT: I find that\u2019s an acceptable reason. You may continue. Let\u2019s go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">Juror Number 137 was also struck by the defense. I don\u2019t have the number down of what that juror was in the box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-13\">MS. McNAMARA: 137. He never got to the box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-14\">MS. STEPHENSON: No. He never got to the box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-15\">THE COURT: He never got to the box. He was struck then. All right. Then the next one that got to the box that you struck I believe was 143.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-16\">MS. McNAMARA: She did not get to the box either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-17\">MS. STEPHENSON: She was held up at gunpoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-18\">THE COURT: Oh, she wasn\u2019t in the box. I\u2019m trying to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-19\">MS. McNAMARA: Those were all that were in the box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-20\">THE COURT: One\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-21\">MS. McNAMARA: Four in the box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-22\">THE COURT: And the others were not in the box?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-23\">MS. McNAMARA: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-24\">THE COURT: Well, so let\u2019s go through \u2014 are you challenging those as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-25\">MS. McNAMARA: I\u2019m not challenging \u2014 I believe there\u2019s a basis for striking 143. She was robbed at gunpoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-26\">THE COURT: All right. Well, let\u2019s go through them one by one. Juror Number\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-27\">MS. McNAMARA: 137</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-28\">MS. STEPHENSON: \u2014137 was struck why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>MS. STEPHENSON: By me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">THE COURT: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">MS. STEPHENSON: Oh, why? He was \u2014 I don\u2019t have anything written on here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">THE COURT: Let the record reflect he was a young white male in a navy blazer and khaki slacks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">MS. STEPHENSON: I believe he was \u2014 I remember him, Judge, and he was struck for the very [sic] we say was unacceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">THE COURT: And why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">MS. STEPHENSON: The other young man. There was another young man who was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">THE COURT: Well, what was wrong Juror Number\u2014 Summons 137?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">MS. STEPHENSON: His clothing, his manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">THE COURT: Well, what was wrong with his clothing and his manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">MS. STEPHENSON: Well, his manner and his clothing suggest to me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">THE COURT: I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">MS. STEPHENSON: Let me finish. Suggest to me that he wouldn\u2019t be able to relate to my client because in this particular case there are \u2014 there is the police officer\u2019s word against my client\u2019s word. My client may very well testify. And because of those things\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-17\">THE COURT: Well, how do his clothing have anything to do with it? I don\u2019t make the connection. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-18\">MS. STEPHENSON: The clothing, Judge, means when you go to Brooks Brothers and buy a suit, and maybe not the suit\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-19\">THE COURT: The people who go to Brooks Brothers are more likely to believe police than defendants; is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-20\">MS. STEPHENSON: Not necessarily so. But given the little information I have about them, I must make judgments about these individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>THE COURT: Well, what \u2014 well, all right. That\u2019s right. So what information did you have about Summons Number 137 that required you to strike him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">MS. STEPHENSON: Number 137, he\u2019s a student. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s studying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">THE COURT: Well, we could have asked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">MS STEPHENSON: Well, some courts don\u2019t let you bring them up and ask them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">THE COURT: But you didn\u2019t ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">MS. STEPHENSON: He seemed rather studious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">THE COURT: Well, so what if he\u2019s studious? He\u2019s 21 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">MS. STEPHENSON: That\u2019s right. He has 16 years of education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">MS. STEPHENSON: That means he\u2019s done his college.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">MS. STEPHENSON: And Pm not sure what his address. But for those reasons, Judge,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">THE COURT: That\u2019s an unacceptable reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-17\">MS. STEPHENSON: Those are my reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-18\">THE COURT: I mean, that\u2019s no reason at all. You\u2019re just citing his biography and saying those are reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-19\">MS. STEPHENSON: I have nothing else. Is the Court saying I can\u2019t strike him at all because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-20\">THE COURT: The Court is saying you have to, when you have struck seven jurors, potential jurors,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-21\">MS. STEPHENSON: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-22\">THE COURT: \u2014and they are all white and they all have different profiles, you\u2019re going to have to come up with a satisfactory explanation that persuades me that your reason for striking him was not racial. I mean, that\u2019s what the case law is saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>MS. STEPHENSON: I know, Judge. But I haven\u2019t said anything to you now that would suggest that the reasons were racial. Nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not quite sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">MS. STEPHENSON: I mean,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">THE COURT: When you say that someone comes in a navy blazer and khaki slacks, and because he\u2019s a student and because of his address that\u2019s reason for striking him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">MS. STEPHENSON: I said I don\u2019t know anything about his address because I don\u2019t know the address. But, Judge, that could have been a black man. Are we saying that black men don\u2019t wear blazers and khaki pants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">THE COURT: All right. That\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t buy that as a satisfactory explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">MS. STEPHENSON: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">THE COURT: The next juror was 143. What was the reason for striking that juror? 143.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">MS. STEPHENSON: I thought we\u2019d gone through seven already. 143. Held up at gunpoint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">THE COURT: Because it was a victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">MS. STEPHENSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-15\">THE COURT: All right. I\u2019ll accept that reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-16\">MS. STEPHENSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">THE COURT: Right. Okay. The next juror you struck was Juror Number 155.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-18\">MS. STEPHENSON: Unfortunately, I don\u2019t remember this gentleman. Did he get\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-19\">THE COURT: It\u2019s not a he. Juror Number 155.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-20\">MS. STEPHENSON: Judge, I don\u2019t remember her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-21\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, that\u2019s not a satisfactory reason at all. They\u2019re not adequate reasons. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m finding that the public defender has struck these individuals for race or race alone. She did give satisfactory explanations for Juror Number 9 and Juror Number 137 who are victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>On the other hand, the other people she\u2019s struck, all of them are white, none of them have particular profiles. She hasn\u2019t seemed to come up with adequate answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">I\u2019m going to leave it up to the State. If the State wants me to begin anew, I\u2019ll begin right now anew. I also don\u2019t know, now that you\u2019ve raised the objection, even if you don\u2019t want me to begin anew, what that does to the taint of the jury panel down the line if he is convicted and appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">And if an appellate court decides that this was not a jury that was unbiased whether they on their own would strike it. I really don\u2019t know what you want me to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">MS. McNAMARA: Well, Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">THE COURT: Having waited until this point in time, and I understand you waited until you saw the numbers, I\u2019m in a predicament and I almost feel like we have to begin all over again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">MS. McNAMARA: And I want to say a couple of things for the record, too, in reference. I would indicate that there are several members of the jury panel who are black who had no profiles provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">They were young. They were black. One especially was unemployed. They weren\u2019t struck. And so I believe that based on that, the theory that their profiles was enough is not adequate and is in direct contradiction to people who the defense counsel has left on the jury panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">And I would indicate that also I believe that I\u2019m not in any way calling her a racist, but it is racist to think that because someone is white and well-dressed they cannot relate to your client\u2019s predicament.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">MS.

We disagree and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">\n<em>Reviewability of Alleged Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the first jury panel and that the dismissal further prejudiced appellant by chilling defense counsel\u2019s use of peremptory strikes. Appellant\u2019s argument is two pronged. He argues that the Equal Protection Clause permits white jurors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be struck from a jury panel based upon race and that the court erred in finding that defense counsel had used peremptory strikes to discriminate against prospective white jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">First we address appellee\u2019s contention that this issue is not preserved for our review. It is generally true that once a party \u201chas previously made an objection with regard to a prospective juror or jurors, and thereafter, at the conclusion of the jury selection process, unequivocally states that the jury as selected is acceptable, such party had withdrawn or aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>doned his prior objection,\u201d <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 450-51, 499 A.2d 1236 (1985), <em>recons. denied, </em>305 Md. 306, 503 A.2d 1326 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986). Nevertheless, the situation that we are now contemplating is markedly different. Defense counsel offered explanations for her choosing to strike seven prospective white jurors \u2014 her explanations as to four prospective jurors were deemed inadequate by the court. The court determined that it was bound to excuse the entire panel and begin the jury selection process over again. Because the selection process was renewed in its entirety defense counsel did not waive the right to allege error in the dismissal of the first panel. Instead, the selection of the second panel was treated as a wholly separate process. Appellant claims that the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the first panel be dismissed and a second jury impaneled. This alleged error was not waived by acceding to the court\u2019s ruling that it would impanel a new jury \u2014 the fact that counsel found the second jury panel to be acceptable has no bearing on whether prejudicial error occurred in dismissing the first panel. We shall address the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\n<em>Exercise of Peremptory Challenges to Exclude White Jurors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The Supreme Court established in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719. \u201cPurposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire violates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection because it denies him the protection that a trial by jury is intended to secure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 106 S.Ct. at 1717. Justice Powell noted that discriminatory jury selection harms the general community by undermining the public\u2019s confidence in our system of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 106 S.Ct. at 1718.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">This holding was extended to include the exercise of peremptory challenges by the defense as well as by the prosecution in <em>Georgia v. </em>McCollum,-U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992). <em>See also Edmonson v. Leesville </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Concrete </em>Co.,-U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991) (Equal Protection Clause is violated by a civil litigant\u2019s exercise of racially discriminatory peremptory challenges). The Supreme Court has generally defined peremptory challenges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">[Peremptory challenges are not constitutionally protected fundamental rights; rather, they are but one state-created means to the constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial. This Court repeatedly has stated that the right to a peremptory challenge may be withheld altogether without impairing the constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury and a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>McCollum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2358 (citations omitted). The Court\u2019s analysis in <em>McCollum </em>addressed four specific issues: (1) whether the exercise of peremptory challenges by a criminal defendant in a racially discriminatory manner produces the harm identified in <em>Batson, </em>(2) whether the exercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action, (3) whether prosecutors have standing to raise a constitutional challenge to the racially motivated use of peremptories, and (4) whether the constitutional rights of criminal defendants preclude the extension of the <em>Batson </em>holding. In the majority opinion Justice Blackmun acknowledged that discriminatory jury selection meets the first <em>Batson </em>criteria because it threatens public confidence in the administration of justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">Be it at the hands of the State or the defense, if a court allows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, it is a willing participant in a scheme that could only undermine the very foundation of our system of justice \u2014 our citizens\u2019 confidence in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-12\"><em>McCollum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2354. In concluding that a criminal defendant\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action under the Equal Protection Clause the Supreme Court reasoned that the criminal defendant relies upon \u201cgovernmental assistance and benefits\u201d equal to those in the jury selection of a civil case. <em>See </em>Edmonson,-U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2084. <em>See also </em>McCollum,-U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2357 n. 10, discussing other commentators\u2019 conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>sions. The jury functions in the governmental capacity of guardian of individual rights. <em>Edmonson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 2085. The Court rationalized the extension of this doctrine to criminal defendants in part because of the governmental significance in jury selection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">The exercise of a peremptory challenge differs significantly from other actions taken in support of a defendant\u2019s defense. In exercising a peremptory challenge, a criminal defendant is wielding the power to choose a quintessential governmental body \u2014 indeed, the institution of government on which our judicial system depends. Thus, as we held in <em>Edmonson, </em>when \u201ca government confers on a private body the power to choose the government\u2019s employees or officials, the private body will be bound by the constitutional mandate of race neutrality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\"><em>McCollum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2356 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The Court further reasoned that a prosecutor, while asserting the rights of excluded jurors, has standing to attack the constitutionality of a defendant\u2019s racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, in part, because the excluded jurors are unable to do so. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2357. Addressing the fourth prong of the analysis, the Court suggested that the proliferation of racial stereotypes is too high a price to pay for the protection of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Justice Blackmun noted that the prohibition against discriminatory peremptory challenges does not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel or the confidential communications protected by the attorney-client relationship. <em>Id. </em>at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2358. The Court ultimately concluded that the exercise of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner by a criminal defendant is unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">We hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the ground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Accordingly, if the State demonstrates a prima facie case of racial discrimination by the defendants, the defendants, must ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ticulate a racially neutral explanation for peremptory challenges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2359.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The Court of Appeals and this Court have applied <em>Batson </em>on numerous occasions. <em>See State v. Gorman, </em>324 Md. 124, 596 A.2d 629 (1991) (prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude black venirepersons was discriminatory; remanded for prosecution to offer race neutral reasons for use of challenges); <em>Chew v. State, </em>317 Md. 233, 562 A.2d 1270 (1989) (remanded for new trial because prosecutor failed to articulate satisfactory nondiscriminatory reasons for using peremptory challenges to exclude black jurors); <em>Gray v. State, </em>317 Md. 250, 562 A.2d 1278 (1989) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow prosecutor to be cross examined regarding his reasons for using peremptory challenges); <em>Tolbert v. State, </em>315 Md. 13, 553 A.2d 228 (1989) (prosecutor failed to articulate a legitimate, clear, and reasonable explanation for striking potential black jurors); and <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988) (exercise of peremptory challenges to remove eight potential black jurors meets prima facie test so that limited remand was necessary to determine whether challenges were made with a discriminatory purpose). In <em>Mejia v. State, </em>328 Md. 522, 616 A.2d 356 (1992), the Court of Appeals held that the defendant, a Hispanic, established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by the prosecutor in his exercise of peremptory challenges when he struck the only Hispanic in the venire. <em>See also Hernandez v. New </em>York, - U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). The Supreme Court is now considering whether gender may serve as a basis for discrimination within the <em>Batson </em>ruling. <em>See, J.E.B. v. T.B., </em>606 So.2d 156 (Ala.1992), <em>cert. </em>granted,-U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2330, \u2014 L.Ed.2d- (1993) (father challenged use of peremptory strikes to exclude male jurors in paternity suit). <em>See also Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993) (use of peremptory challenges to exclude women from juries violates the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment and Maryland equal protection guarantees).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Appellee argues that the <em>Batson/McCollum </em>analysis is not applicable to the discriminatory removal of whites from a venire panel. The use of peremptories to remove potential white jurors has been challenged and found to be discriminatory in a number of other jurisdictions. <em>See Roman v. Abrams, </em>822 F.2d 214, 227-28 (2d Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1052, 109 S.Ct. 1311, 103 L.Ed.2d 580 (1989); <em>People v. Gary M., </em>138 Misc.2d 1081, 526 N.Y.S.2d 986, 994 (N.Y.Sup.1988); and <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Forte, </em>865 F.2d 59, 64 (3rd Cir.1989). In <em>Roman </em>the Second Circuit held that a prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude whites from the jury panel violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. <em>Roman, </em>822 F.2d at 227-28. Similarly, the Third Circuit concluded in <em>Forte </em>that the exercise of peremptory challenges to remove all whites from the jury constituted plain error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">Defendants of both groups [white and black] are entitled to trial before juries for which members of their race are not excluded as the result of purposeful discrimination by the prosecutor. We cannot hold that a white defendant convicted by a jury selected in a racially discriminatory manner should be satisfied with the knowledge that it is usually blacks who are unfairly treated and therefore may be denied relief himself.... Thus, we now hold ... that <em>Batson </em>applied to both white and blacks....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>Forte, </em>865 F.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In <em>Brashear v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 709, 603 A.2d 901, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 523, 610 A.2d 796 (1992), this Court addressed the issue of whether white jurors may be excluded for discriminatory purposes. Relying upon the forceful logic of Judge Moylan in <em>Mejia v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 31, 35, 599 A.2d 1207 (1992), this Court concluded that the <em>Batson </em>analysis must apply to \u201cperemptories used against other groups.\u201d Writing for this Court, Judge Garrity adopted the reasoning of the Second and Third circuits but concluded that the trial court did not err in finding that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for exercising peremptory challenges were race neutral. It is clear, therefore, that the <em>Batson </em>analysis applies with equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>force to the exercise of peremptory challenges in a manner discriminatory to blacks or whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in ruling that a prima facie case of discrimination had been established by the prosecution. As explained in <em>Mejia </em>and applied in <em>Brashear, </em>an appellate court\u2019s review of a trial judge\u2019s <em>Batson </em>ruling does not include a <em>de novo </em>fact finding or independent review. A trial court\u2019s ruling will be reversed only if it is clearly erroneous; we are not inclined to reverse the decision of the trial court unless clear error is presented. In reviewing the record in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that the trial court correctly assessed the defense\u2019s explanations as unsatisfactory. Under the law of this jurisdiction as expressed in <em>Brashear, </em>the prosecution established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, defense counsel failed to articulate race-neutral reasons for striking four of the prospective jurors, and the trial court concluded that the peremptory challenges were used in a discriminatory manner, thereby requiring the impaneling of a new jury. <em>See Hernandez v. New York, </em>-U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). We find no clear error in the trial court\u2019s factual finding or in the application of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The facts of this particular case raise another rather novel issue. What relief is appropriate when a trial court finds that racial discrimination has motivated the use of peremptory strikes? In other cases considered by our courts, this issue was raised after a verdict had been rendered by the jury, so the only relief available was to remand the case for a new jury trial. In the instant case the discriminatory exercise of peremptory strikes was apparent before the jury was impaneled and sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We believe Judge Heller correctly decided to impanel a new jury. In cases where the defense had made a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory use of peremptory strikes and counsel for the State had failed to articulate satisfactory, nondiscriminatory, race-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lenges, this Court and the Court of Appeals have consistently remanded the case for retrial. Because Judge Heller had already made a determination that a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory use had been established and asked defense counsel to explain her use of peremptory challenges we need not remand the case for such an inquiry. <em>Compare Chew v. State, </em>317 Md. 233, 562 A.2d 1270 (1989); <em>Gray v. State, </em>317 Md. 250, 562 A.2d 1278 (1989); <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988). Once such a determination has been made and the State has been unable to offer satisfactory nondiscriminatory explanations for the use of peremptory challenges, a new trial is required. <em>Stanley, </em>313 Md. at 92, 542 A.2d 1267. <em>McCollum </em>established the principle that the same rule applies to the defense as well as to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">This particular case presents an unusual situation. Even if we were to conclude that the trial court erred in discharging the first venire, was appellant prejudiced by having his case tried by a jury selected from a different venire? If the court did err, the relief available would be a new trial before another jury selected from a different venire, which was essentially what appellant received when the court dismissed the first panel and began jury selection anew. Neither the State nor the defense has a vested right in a particular jury prior to its being impaneled; the law only provides that the jury be capable of impartiality. Finding no error either in Judge Heller\u2019s determination that defense counsel has misused peremptory strikes for an improper purpose or in her decision to discharge the venire and begin the jury selection process anew, we affirm. We also hold that appellant was not prejudiced by the ultimate selection of a jury from the second venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Concurring opinion by WILNER, C.J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-15\">.

In making this comment, I do not mean to criticize either <em>Batson </em>or the cases that have followed or extended it. They rest on solid, fundamental principles of public policy. Nor do I deprecate in any way the intrinsic value of peremptory challenges, which have long been regarded as ah important \u2014 indeed vital \u2014 mechanism for assuring a fair jury in both civil and criminal proceedings. The problem is that the two are finding it increasingly difficult to coexist and, as the quoted colloquy in this case indicates, precious judicial time and resources are being sidetracked into resolving the conflict between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We are at the point now, at least in Maryland, where it is impermissible to exercise a peremptory strike on the basis of race, gender, and, I expect, ethnic origin. Because the underpinning of this impermissibility is the Constitutional right to equal protection of the law (coupled in Maryland with the State Equal Rights Amendment), as Judge Moylan recognized in <em>Mejia v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 31, 35, 599 A.2d 1207, <em>vacated and remanded, </em>328 Md. 522, 616 A.2d 356 (1992), logic \u201ccompellingly requires that its strictures be used against any other cognizable group.\u201d Congress has already, by statute, declared certain forms of discrimination against older persons and persons with disabilities to be against national public policy. Are these categories too to be protected against discrimination in jury selection? Will it be impermissible to strike a prospective juror because he or she is over 55 or is disabled? Religious discrimination is also Constitutionally impermissible. Can a juror be struck because of his or her religion, or lack thereof?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Occasionally, the Supreme Court starts a march that, years later, it realizes has led it into a swamp, and it reverses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>course. It may be too early yet to know whether that will happen here, but I suspect that it will not. We then may have to face the prospect that, in a seriously contested case, no peremptory challenge will go unchallenged, that counsel will be called upon to explain the basis of every one, that the court will then have to consider (1) whether the reason advanced by counsel falls within the dramatically reduced scope of allowable ones, and (2) even if, facially, it does, whether the reason asserted is merely pretextual. A whole new area of appellate review will blossom; indeed, the buds are already growing.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">I recognize that the abolition of peremptory challenges would mark a dramatic change in the way our jury system has traditionally operated, and, if we were to do that, we would need to be more liberal in allowing challenges for cause and in permitting voir dire examination for the purpose of making those challenges. The question is whether that would be more, or less, efficient and whether it would produce a more fair, or less fair, result than the hoops we need to jump through now under <em>Batson </em>and its children. I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I think it is a question we urgently need to address.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
