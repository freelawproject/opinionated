We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 19, 2008, a Bergen County Grand Jury returned an indictment against defendant charging him with third-degree possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5(a)(1), N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5(b)(11) ; fourth-degree possession of marijuana, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10(a)(3) ; and second-degree endangering the\n   welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(a). Defendant was represented at all proceedings related to this case by a staff attorney from the Bergen County Office of the Public Defender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 7, 2010, defendant entered into a negotiated agreement with the State through which he pled guilty to the first count in the indictment charging him with third-degree possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As described by the prosecutor, in exchange for defendant's guilty plea, the State agreed to dismiss the remaining counts in the indictment and recommend that the court sentence defendant to a term of probation conditioned upon serving 364 days in the Bergen County jail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After placing defendant under oath, the judge asked him the following questions with respect to his immigration status and apprised him of the potential legal consequences of his decision to plead guilty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Now, are you a United States citizen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   DEFENDANT: No.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand [that] if you're not a United States citizen or national you may be deported by virtue of your plea of guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand that if you plead guilty to a crime of a certain aggravated felony under federal law you will be subject ... to deportation or removal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand you have the right to seek legal advice on your immigration status prior to entering a plea of guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: All right. And you have sought advice on the immigration aspect of it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   DEFENDANT: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Are you prepared to proceed today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   DEFENDANT: No - yes, yes, your Honor. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: So you're not seeking any additional time to seek any advice as to the immigration[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   DEFENDANT: No, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: And, again, you fully understand that you're pleading guilty to possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. If that's a certain aggravated felony, then you would be subject to deportation. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court sentenced defendant on September 17, 2010. The judge found aggravating factors three, the risk that defendant will commit another offense, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3), six, the extent of defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(6), and nine, the need for deterring defendant and others from violating the law, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(9). The judge concluded that \"[t]he aggravating factors clearly and convincingly outweigh the mitigating factors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite reaching this conclusion, the judge sentenced defendant to a three-year term of probation subject to the payment of the statutory costs and penalties. Although the plea agreement permitted the court to sentence defendant to serve up to 364 days in the Bergen County jail as a condition of probation, the judge opted not to impose any jail time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant did not file a direct appeal to this court challenging any aspect of his plea hearing or the sentence imposed by the\n   court. On March 22, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant, represented by private counsel, filed this PCR petition alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Defendant averred that his trial attorney\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   did not advise [him] that a plea to an aggravated felony would result in virtually certain deportation and that [his] only chance at relief would be to show it is more likely than not [he] would be tortured if returned to [his] home country. In regards to [his] immigration situation, [defendant's attorney] told [him] only \"as long as you don't do a year and a day in jail, you're fine.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant also included as part of the appellate record a copy of a formal decision and an order issued by United States Immigration Judge Daniel A. Morris on September 20, 2016. In this decision, Judge Morris states, in relevant part, that defendant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   is a native and citizen of ... Jamaica who was admitted to the United States at New York, New York on April 16, 1988 as a lawful permanent resident ... On October 9, 2015, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personally served [defendant] with a Notice to Appear (NTA) charging that he is removable\n   under INA\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judge assigned to hear defendant's PCR petition was the same judge who presided over the plea and sentencing hearings. On July 11, 2016, the judge convened the attorneys in the case to determine whether an evidentiary hearing was warranted. The PCR judge noted for the record that the staff attorney from the Bergen County Office of the Public Defender, who represented defendant during the plea negotiations and at the July 7, 2010 plea hearing, was present with the original files. Despite his repeated statements that he had not decided whether an evidentiary hearing was necessary, the judge allowed both the prosecutor and PCR counsel to question under oath defendant's original counsel, a woman who was not married to defendant, but was described by PCR counsel as defendant's \"life partner[ ] for 27 years,\" and finally, defendant himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   These three individuals were thoroughly questioned by the prosecutor, PCR counsel, and the PCR judge about every detail concerning the discussions that led to defendant's guilty plea on July 7, 2010. In short, notwithstanding the PCR judge's disclaimer concerning the nature of these proceedings, defendant was afforded an evidentiary hearing within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-10. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, PCR counsel argued that plea counsel erroneously advised defendant there would not be any negative immigration consequences as long as the sentence imposed by the court was less than \"a year and a day.\" The prosecutor argued that at the time of the plea hearing, defendant's only concern was to minimize his penal exposure. According to the prosecutor, \"this immigration issue has only become an issue once [defendant] was arrested by immigration authorities.\" The PCR judge reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In a letter-opinion dated August 25, 2016, the PCR judge reviewed the procedural history of the case, and articulated the two-prong test established by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and subsequently adopted by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The PCR judge gave the following explanation for his ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   There is no evidence that trial counsel gave defendant inaccurate or misleading advice other than bald assertions from the defendant himself. Even more importantly, the defendant was put on notice of the possible immigration consequences through both the plea forms and the Judge in the case. Therefore, this [c]ourt finds that the defendant is unable to establish a sufficient claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Against this record, defendant appealed raising the following arguments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   I. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Standard of Review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   B. [Defendant's trial counsel] Gave Mr. Brown Patently Incorrect Advice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1. Question 1: What was the Advice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   2. Question 2: Was the Advice Wrong?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   C. Mr. Brown was Prejudiced by his Attorney's Incorrect Advice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This matter came before this court for oral argument on November 1, 2017. In the course of argument, we noted that defendant's PCR petition was filed on March 22, 2016, more than five years from September 20, 2010, the date the trial court signed the Judgment of Conviction. Defendant did not directly raise nor address the standard for relaxing\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12(a)'s five-year procedural bar before the PCR judge. We asked counsel how the Criminal Part could decide this PCR without first addressing the procedural hurdle presented in\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12(a)(1), which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   First Petition For Post-Conviction Relief. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this rule,\n   <em>\n    no petition shall be filed pursuant to this rule more than 5 years after the date of entry pursuant to Rule 3:21-5 of the judgment of conviction that is being challenged\n   </em>\n   unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (A) it alleges facts showing that the delay beyond said time was due to defendant's excusable neglect and that there is a reasonable probability that if the defendant's factual assertions were found to be true enforcement of the time bar would result in a fundamental injustice[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In order to allow both appellate counsel and the prosecutor sufficient time to more thoroughly address this potentially dispositive procedural issue, we entered a sua sponte order on November 13, 2017, that directed the attorneys to submit supplemental briefs, not to exceed twenty-five pages, addressing the following issues: (1) Is the procedural bar in\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12(a)(1)(A) subject to waiver if the State fails to raise it before the PCR court?; and (2) If the rule's preclusive effect is not subject to waiver, should the remedy on appeal be to either (a) remand the matter to the PCR court to permit defendant an opportunity to establish excusable neglect and a reasonable probability that if his factual assertions are true, enforcement of the time bar would result in a fundamental injustice;\n   <em>\n    OR\n   </em>\n   (b) review the record developed before the PCR court as is and decide the matter on appeal as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Both parties submitted their supplemental briefs as directed. We first address the issue of waiver. Defendant argues he raised the five-year procedural bar when he noted in his verified petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I had no reason to suspect this crime would guarantee my deportation because I have been convicted of other drug offenses and never had immigration consequences. The only way I would have known was with proper advice. Of all my convictions, this is the only aggravated felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   It is a fundamental injustice for a noncitizen to be convicted of a crime guaranteeing deportation and exile from a long life with my family when it was possible to prevent such exile by negotiating a plea to a non-aggravated felony or completing the motion to suppress and taking the case to trial if an immigration-safe plea was not possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The State's supplemental brief relies on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Cann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"111255\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/342/93/#p101\">\n    342 N.J.

Defendant did not directly raise nor address the standard for relaxing\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12(a)'s five-year procedural bar before the PCR judge. Viewed in the light most favorable to defendant, the statements in his PCR petition obliquely provide an explanation for his failure to seek PCR before his detention by immigration authorities. This does not address defendant's failure to heed the trial judge's suggestion to consult with an immigration attorney before deciding to plead guilty to a third-degree offense in which he admitted to possessing approximately five pounds of marijuana with the intent to distribute. As the Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Immigration law can be complex, and it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or\n   federal court or both, may not be well versed in it. There will, therefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner in such cases is more limited. When the law is not succinct and straightforward ...,\n   <em>\n    a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences\n   </em>\n   . But when the deportation consequence is truly clear ... the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As a staff attorney in the Public Defender's office, trial counsel's responsibility to defendant was to provide a competent defense to the criminal charges filed against him and to apprise him of the potential collateral consequences a conviction may have on his immigration status.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the evidentiary hearing, defendant testified that his trial attorney told him that his conviction would not have adverse consequences on his immigration status provided any custodial sentence imposed by the court was less than a year and one day. The PCR judge rejected defendant's testimony as not credible. The PCR judge provided the following explanation in support of his finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   After evaluating the sufficiency of the claim of [erroneous advice] the defendant alleges to have received from trial counsel, it is clear from the record and the plea forms, that defendant knew the crime he was pleading to may constitute an aggravated felony and as such, subjected him to deportation. Further, defendant knew he had the right to seek advice from an outside immigration counsel and would be afforded time from the court if he so desired as can be seen in both the record and the standard plea form. The defendant in his own words told the court that \"I wish for a chance at life without going to jail.\" Also, at sentencing defendant acknowledged, on the record, he may be deported, and once again declined the opportunity to speak to immigration counsel. It is clear that defendant was on notice of the fact that deportation was a possible consequence of his plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As an appellate court, we are bound to uphold a trial judge's factual findings \"which are substantially influenced by [the judge's] opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have a feel of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\"\n   <em>\n    Nunez-Valdez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143376\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/200/129/#p139\">\n    200 N.J. at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143376\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/200/129/#p139\">\n    975 A.2d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Achieving \"justice\" years after the fact may be more an illusory temptation than a plausibly attainable goal when memories have dimmed, witnesses have died or disappeared, and evidence is lost or unattainable .... Moreover, the Rule serves to respect the need for achieving finality of judgments and to allay the uncertainty associated with an unlimited possibility of relitigation. The Rule therefore strongly encourages those believing they have grounds for post-conviction relief to bring their claims swiftly, and discourages them from sitting on their rights until it is too late for a court to render justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    State v.

Absent sufficient competent evidence to satisfy this standard, the court does not have the authority to review the merits of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Here, the PCR judge found defendant was aware of the immigration consequences of his conviction at the time he decided to plead guilty. Stated differently, defendant did not show \"excusable neglect\" to justify filing a facially untimely PCR petition. Despite this finding, the judge reviewed defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and found them to be without merit. The record supports the PCR judge's ruling. The record of the plea hearing shows the trial judge gave defendant clearly worded warnings of the potential immigration consequences of his conviction. The judge also gave defendant the opportunity to consult with an attorney who specializes in immigration law. Defendant failed to take advantage of this opportunity and made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent decision to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A defendant cannot decide to remain intentionally ignorant of the legal consequences of his decision as a means of establishing excusable neglect.
