(KMA), plaintiff class of 8455 Kia Sephia owners and lessees represented by Regina Little proved at a jury trial that the Sephia, model years 1997 through 2000, had a defective front brake system, which caused premature brake pad and rotor wear. Concluding that the defect amounted to a breach of express and implied warranties, and that all owners had suffered damage due to the defect, the jury awarded each member of the class $750 ($6.3 million total) in repair damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Determining for the first time post-trial that repair damages could not be awarded on a class-wide basis because they were dependent upon individual factors, the trial court granted KMA's motion for judgment\n   notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on the repair damages award, decertified the class for purposes of damages, and ordered a new trial on repair damages only, to proceed by way of claim forms. With the advantage of recent case law unavailable to the trial judge, we now reverse, reinstate the jury award and remand for determination of counsel fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We recount only the facts and procedural history relevant to this appeal. We begin with the procedural history. On June 26, 2001, Little filed an amended class action complaint on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, against defendant, a California corporation with offices in New Jersey. The putative class alleged that the Sephia had a defective front brake system and asserted causes of action for: fraudulent business practices in violation of California law and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), N.J.S.A. 56:8-1 to -210; breach of an express warranty; breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; and failure to comply with the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act (MMWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202301\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 2312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2003, the court granted class certification. Prior to trial, the trial judge heard a number of pretrial motions on the\n   admissibility of evidence. Defendant moved unsuccessfully to exclude as net opinions the class expert testimony of Raymond King, on repair damages, and John Matthews, on diminution of value damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a month-long trial, in June 2008 the jury returned a verdict finding that defendant had breached the express and implied warranties as well as the MMWA, but that it had not violated the CFA. The jury found that the class had suffered damages and awarded each member repair damages. It awarded no damages for diminution in value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a November 24, 2008 written decision, the trial judge granted defendant's motion for JNOV as to repair damages only, decertifying the class for purposes of damages only based on the finding that individual factors predominated, and ordered a new trial on repair damages to proceed by way of claim forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a January 2011 decision, another judge granted plaintiff's motion to recertify the class, explaining that individual damages issues did not require decertification. This judge appointed a special master. In an August 12, 2011 order, without having read the record and based on the special master's recommendation, the motion judge vacated the zero diminution in value jury award to allow the master to consider damages for all class members on any applicable theory of recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a published decision dated April 2, 2012, we reversed the August 12, 2011 order because the motion judge had improperly vacated the jury's finding of no diminution in value damages without first canvassing the record to determine whether that aspect of the verdict resulted in a manifest denial of justice.\n   <em>\n    Little v.

Further, the motion judge's decision was inconsistent with the law of the case doctrine, since the trial judge's decision on the limited new trial had controlled the proceedings for nearly three years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928950\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/82/#p89\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928950\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/82/#p89\">\n    at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928950\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/82/#p89\">\n    39 A.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On remand, the motion judge appointed a new special master to adjudicate the claims. In August 2013, she accepted the new special master's finding that only 150 claimants had proven their damages, and his recommendation of a total award of $46,197. Little was not among the members for whom he recommended recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2015, class counsel requested an award of $6,055,916 in attorney fees and $481,850 in costs of suit, with pre- and post-judgment interest, pursuant to the MMWA. After reducing the class's attorney fee award based on the paucity of damages it recovered, on May 6, 2015, a new motion judge ordered defendant to pay: $200,000 for the class's attorney fees, plus $19,113 in prejudgment interest; $481,850 in fees and costs of suit; and $5000 to Little as an incentive award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At trial, plaintiff demonstrated a defect in the Sephia's brakes. Defendant began selling the Sephia in New Jersey in 1997. Raymond King, plaintiff's expert in mechanical engineering and repair damages, explained that when a driver presses the brakes, hydraulic pressure forces brake fluid into a brake caliper, which causes the brake pads to squeeze against the rotors and decrease the spinning of the wheel. The pressure of the brake pads against the rotors causes friction, which produces heat. The hotter the brake system becomes, the faster the brake pads and rotors wear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on the documents from defendant that King had reviewed, as well as deposition testimony from defendant executives, King concluded that the Sephia's front brake system had a systemic design defect that did not allow for the proper dissipation of heat. This defect caused a premature wear of the brake pads, pulsating or grinding brakes, warped or prematurely worn rotors, and shaking or vibration (also called shudder or judder) when the driver applied the brakes. Repairs or replacement of the brake pads and rotors failed to correct the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To reach this conclusion, King reviewed a standardized industry report; Quality Assurance Field Product Reports and District Parts and Service Manager Reports, drafted by defendant's mechanics and managers throughout the United States; defendant's Technical Assistance Center Incident Reports; Technical Service Bulletins; and defendant's warranty brake claims data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties stipulated that from 1997 to 2000 a total of 8455 Sephias were sold in New Jersey. Defendant's warranty repair data showed that the total number of warranty repairs to front brake components on the Sephia in New Jersey was about 8400. Defendant sold 42,713 model year 1997 Sephias in the United States. The warranty claim rate nationally for that model's brakes was 92%. King testified that he had never before seen a warranty claim rate that high. In his view, it \"screamed\" that there was a problem with the brake system. The following years the model had similarly high claim rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In January 2002, Kia Motors Corporation (Kia Motors), KMA's parent company based in South Korea, issued a technical services bulletin introducing newly designed brake pads and rotors, known as the \"field fix.\" The updated pads were not compatible with the original rotors; thus, both had to be replaced as a set. This was an improvement, King said, but it failed to meet the 20,000-mile standard. At most, the field fix brake pads lasted 14,000 to 15,000 miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to reviewing Kia Motors' documents, King inspected the cars belonging to Little and Samuel-Basset (the named plaintiff in a Pennsylvania class action against defendant,\n   <em>\n    Samuel-Bassett v. Kia Motors Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205963\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/613/371/\">\n    613 Pa. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205963,7265404\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/34/1/\">\n    34 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ). King found nothing remarkable about either car in general, or the brake system in particular, that would have caused premature brake pad and rotor wear, and nothing to suggest that driving\n   habits had caused the premature brake wear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After surveying five Kia dealerships, King estimated that an owner would spend about $250 for a brake repair. Defendant's documents showed brake replacements when cars had as little as\n   2000 miles, and others at more than 10,000 miles. On average, a Sephia would need a brake replacement every 10,000 miles. In King's experience, and based on industry data he reviewed, cars typically lasted 100,000 miles, or seven to eight years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on a life of 100,000 miles, and the need for a brake repair every 10,000 miles, King estimated an owner would incur ten brake repairs over the life of the car, doubling the normal repair expense due to the defective brake system. As a result, the owner would incur $1250 in additional repair expenses (five times $250) due to the defective brake system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On cross-examination, King conceded that the $1250 brake repair costs would not apply to someone who had brake replacements at 20,000-mile-or-more intervals, or to someone who had each brake replacement paid under warranty. He also admitted that his damages model did not conform exactly to Little's experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Little testified that in January or February 1999, she purchased a new Sephia for $13,288. Her constant brake problems began within two weeks. She testified that for the three years she owned the car, a set of brakes lasted no more than six to seven months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff read into the record a portion of the deposition testimony of several individuals, including defendant KMA's Director of Technical Operations, Timothy McCurdy, who testified that defendant had been aware of the brake issue based on the rate of repairs, and that it had taken steps to address it by relaying the complaints to Kia Motors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A \"major cause\" of these problems was improper dissipation of heat. While there was no set standard for the life of brakes, McCurdy said that consumers typically expected them to last 20,000 miles. One study from Kia Motors reported that the 1999 Sephia had a brake pad life of 16,000 miles. Defendant notified Kia Motors that 16,000 miles was not acceptable, since brake pads should last at least 20,000 miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant did not cover the brake pads under warranty, but it did cover defects in the brake system under the three-year or 36,000 mile warranty. In model year 2002, Kia Motors replaced the Sephia with the Kia Spectra. The Spectra was \"the same basic car,\" but with a different brake system. None of Kia Motors' vehicles, including the Spectra, had brake repair rates as high as the Sephia's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Kia Motors Deputy General Manager Young Sun Sohn's deposition testimony revealed that when Kia Motors developed the Sephia, the specification for the brake pads was that they achieve a life of 20,000 kilometers, or just under 12,500 miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lee Sawyer, defendant's Senior Vice President of Fixed Operations, testified at deposition that some Sephias had brakes that wore prematurely. Typically, brake pads lasted 20,000 to 25,000 miles before needing replacement. \"Some of the Sephia owners were experiencing brake pad life in the [ten] to [twelve thousand] mile range.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant became aware of the Sephia brake problem within the first year of sales based on warranty claims and brake pad orders from the parts department. After the first year, defendant also noticed an increase in part orders for rotors, which usually last 50,000 to 75,000 miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While defendant's policy was to exclude brakes from the warranty, some dealers covered brake pad replacements as warranty repairs or as goodwill repairs, both at no charge to the owner. Dealers did this because they knew that there were problems with the brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Sawyer said that McCurdy had an engineer investigate the brake issue and send a report to Kia Motors' headquarters. At some point, a South Korean engineer met with someone at KMA and said the brakes had to be redesigned with better quality material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Michelle Cameron, defendant's Manager for Consumer Affairs, testified that people who answered complaints through defendant's\n   call center were trained to notify callers that brakes were not covered under the warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff presented expert testimony from John Matthews, a professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Business, on diminution damages. In Matthews's opinion, Sephia owners paid about $2000 more for their Sephia than the car was worth as a result of the defective brake system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Matthews computed the diminution in value based on Sephia's value retention at the time of resale. The 1998 model's initial sale price was $10,000, but it retained only forty percent of that value, or $4000, while comparable cars retained fifty percent of value, or $5000, at resale. Matthews concluded that double the actual resale value, or $8000, was thus the true value of the Sephia at the time of purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Matthews testified that the diminution in value was a result of the defective brake system. Not only were owners aware of the problems, but defendant's dealers were also aware of the problems, based on the Technical Service Bulletins that Kia Motors had distributed. This knowledge drove down the price that people were willing to pay for a used Sephia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On cross-examination, Matthews said that the diminution in value was not dependent on the number of brake repairs the car had, but rather, on the market perception of a car with a faulty brake system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defense did not deny the Sephia had brake problems. Donald Pearce, defendant's Vice President of Parts and Service, testified that a database recorded the following dates of brake repairs to Little's car as warranty repairs: September 1999, April 2000, and June 2000. He said defendant had difficulty addressing the brake system complaints because the complaints differed: some related to noise, others had to do with judder, and some related to premature wear. Based on data he had seen, Pearce\n   said that $250 was a reasonable charge to replace brake pads and rotors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Larry Douglas Petersen, defendant's expert in auto engineering and design and warranty data analysis, testified that he was not aware of any industry standard or expectation for the life of brake pads. He believed the rate at which brake pads wore was dependent on environmental conditions, driving habits, type and size of the car, and design and construction of the brake pads and brake system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Petersen did not believe that the problem with the Sephia brake system was due to heat and the system's inability to dissipate it. Instead, he opined that the problem was the result of low-quality rotors provided by the vendor. He based this primarily on the warranty data he had seen, which suggested that the problem related primarily to the rotors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On cross-examination, Petersen said that McCurdy's goal was that brake pads would last 20,000 miles. Petersen was not aware of any test where the Sephia brake pads achieved that goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Petersen testified that defendant did not provide him, nor did he request, information on brake repairs not covered under warranty. He believed, however, the dealerships would have had that information. With respect to recalls, Petersen believed auto companies only issued them for safety concerns. He also testified that if a car had a design defect, all owners would experience the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Bruce Strombom, defendant's expert in statistics, economic analysis, loss causation, and damage calculation, disagreed with Matthews's conclusion that the faulty brake system caused excessive depreciation or diminution in value. Strombom's opinion was that Matthews's overpayment formula failed to account for the difference in purchase price and length of ownership, and the comparison groups that he used resulted in an overstatement of damages. Matthews also failed to account for other explanations for the Sephia's increased rate of depreciation, such as decreased\n   purchase price, problems with the fuel pump and seatbelt, and low quality-rating score. Thus, a major flaw in Matthews's analysis was that he failed to establish a link between depreciation and the brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant also called as witnesses three Sephia owners who had opted out of the class because they were all satisfied with their cars and had experienced no problems with the brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The jury returned a verdict finding that defendant had breached its express warranty, the implied warranty of merchantability, and the MMWA. In answering the question, \"Did the class sustain damages?\" the jury answered \"yes.\" The verdict sheet then asked the jury to specify the amount of damages that each class member had incurred for \"the difference in value, if any, of the Sephia as warranted compared to the Sephia as delivered,\" and the amount for \"repair expenses reasonably incurred as a result of defendant's breach of warranty.\" The jury answered zero for diminution in value, and $750 for repair expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In a November 2008 written decision, the trial judge found the evidence supported the jury's finding of liability, but that she had erred in submitting the question of repair damages to the jury because those damages were dependent upon individual factors, and thus, could not be awarded on a class-wide basis. She granted defendant's motion for JNOV as to repair damages only, decertified the class for purposes of damages, and ordered a new trial on repair damages to proceed by way of claim forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The trial judge cited\n   <em>\n    Kyriazi v. Western Electric Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224129\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/388/#p392\">\n    647 F.2d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (3d Cir. 1981), in ordering the claim-form proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Kyriazi\n   </em>\n   is a class action sex-discrimination employment case, where the trial court found in the liability phase of the litigation that the employer had a policy of discrimination against women.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224129\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/388/#p392\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224129\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/388/#p392\">\n    at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the damages phase, the court ordered the class members to submit claim forms to a special master who would presume each claim valid and consider any employer challenges at\n   a hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224129\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/388/#p392\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224129\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/388/#p392\">\n    at 390-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, after significant motion practice over the exact parameters of the claim-form process, the result was a hugely reduced total damages amount of $46,197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the trial judge erred in granting defendant's motion for\n   JNOV and vacating the $750 repair expenses award for each class member. It argues that the award was (a) consistent with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), N.J.S.A. 12A:2-714, which allows for a reasonable estimate of damages in a breach of warranty case; (b) consistent with breach of contract damages in a class action; and (c) supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In considering a motion for JNOV, a trial court and a reviewing court apply the same standard: \"[I]f, accepting as true all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according [it] the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied ....\"\n   <em>\n    Boyle v.

She believed she had erred in submitting repair damages to the jury for consideration, explaining that those damages were dependent on the actual expenses incurred by each class member. The judge said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The jury determined that [p]laintiff had not proven a diminution in value of the Kia automobiles. Such a finding would result in damage throughout the class. The jury instead determined that class members suffered losses of $750 due to the defective brake system. This court is convinced this finding was based upon an erroneous submission by the court of the jury question and accompanying instructions. The damages suffered by each class member are dependent on numerous variables, such as brake life, frequency of repair, driving habits and length of time the car was owned. These damages cannot be ascertained on a class wide basis, and the court's decision to submit same to the jury was error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We note that where theories of damages may impact one another, the court must order a new trial on damages as a whole and may not order a new trial on only one theory of damages.\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

As explained to the jury, the two types of damages were not fairly separable from each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff contends the judge erred in finding that repair damages could not be awarded on a class-wide basis. All class members purchased a car with the same faulty brake system, which, according to defendant's records, required a brake repair\n   about every 10,000 miles. As King testified, based on the average life of a car (100,000 miles) and the undisputed cost of a brake repair ($250), one could accurately estimate each class member's average repair damages resulting from defective brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff contends that King's method of estimating damages was consistent with the UCC standard for determining contract damages, as that standard allows for the computation of damages based on any reasonable method that places the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in had the defendant not breached the contract, or warranty, as in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 12A:2-714.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant argues that proof of a product defect does not equate to proof of damages, and it disputes that New Jersey law allows for the averaging of damages. It argues that the class must prove damages for each individual class member and the relatively few claims submitted during the claim-form process show that King's estimate was incorrect and was nothing more than a net opinion, unsupported by fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because the jury found the claims for breach of express and implied warranties were established, the UCC provides the starting point for assessing damages.

King's opinion, which is the only one that defendant claims on appeal is a net opinion, was based on the average life of the car (100,000 miles), the expected life of brake pads (20,000 miles), the average cost of a brake repair ($250), and defendant's warranty repair data. King's trial testimony provided examples of the claims, which supported his conclusion that, on average, the Sephia needed a brake repair every 10,000 miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant did not dispute that the average life of a car was 100,000 miles, and it conceded the average cost of a brake repair ($250) and the expected life of brake\n   pads (20,000 miles). While it did not concede that the Sephia needed a brake repair every 10,000 miles, it provided no evidence to challenge that figure, other than the testimony of three class members who had opted out of the class because they had experienced no brake problems with their cars. The experience that those three owners had, out of\n   an 8455-person class, does not outweigh the voluminous evidence that supported King's 10,000-mile brake-repair average.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It is worth noting that during the jury charge conference, the trial judge considered the propriety of the class's two theories of damages for a second time. In disagreeing with an argument raised by defendant that the jury could award diminution in value damages, or repair damages, but not both, the judge said that the jury was free to determine damages in any reasonable manner to make the aggrieved party whole. The jury could find both that the class members overpaid for their cars, and that they incurred additional repair expenses as a result of the faulty brake system.

Defendant contends that it did not breach the implied warranty of merchantability because Little conceded that her car provided safe transportation, and she drove her car 75,000 miles prior to surrendering it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The charge was proper and consistent with N.J.S.A. 12A:2-314(1)(c), which provides that goods are merchantable if they \"are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Model Jury Charge (Civil)\n   </em>\n   , 4.22, \"Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness for Particular Purpose Under UCC\" (1984) (explaining\n   in the commentary that when the issue does not deal with fitness for a particular purpose, the standard is one of fitness for the ordinary purpose). The implied warranty standard was not limited to whether the Sephia was safe and reliable, but rather, whether it was fit for the ordinary purpose for which cars are used. A driver would fairly assume that an ordinary car would have a brake system that does not cause premature wear of brake pads and rotors. The court correctly charged the jury on the implied warranty of merchantability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The class was certified in 2003 based on\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(a) and (b)(3). Defendant contends that the court erred in denying its many motions to decertify the class because Little's experience was not typical of the class, individual issues predominated, and the vast majority of the class members suffered no damages as demonstrated by the claims form process. In order to certify a class, the court must find that (1) the large number of members makes joinder impractical, (2) the members raise common questions of law or fact, (3) the representative's claims or defenses are typical, and (4) the representative will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the group.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The court must also find that the group has satisfied at least one of the three requirements set forth in\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b).\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(3) requires a finding that common questions of law or fact predominate, and that a class action is superior to other methods of resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendant first argues that the court erred in denying its request for decertification because Little's experience was not typical of the class. Defendant relies on (1) King's testimony that Little's repairs did not fit exactly within the average repairs his model computed, and (2) the testimony of the three Sephia owners who had opted out of the class because they had experienced no problems with their cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This argument lacks merit because a class representative need not establish her experience was exactly the same as every class members' in order to establish her claims are typical of other members' claims. Like the class members, Little purchased the same type of car with the same defective brake system that required repairs about every 10,000 miles. To require more similarity than that would defeat the purpose of class actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   As our Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    Iliadis v.

In such disputes, where the claims are, in isolation, \"too small ... to warrant recourse to litigation,\" the class-action device equalizes the claimants' ability to zealously advocate their positions.

This argument lacks merit because the claim-form proceeding should not have occurred. Further, failing to return a claim form does not prove that the class member incurred no damage. The court correctly certified the class. The cross-appeal is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We reverse the trial judge's grant of a JNOV and remand for a determination of counsel fees consistent with this opinion.
