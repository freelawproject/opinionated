We conclude that a duty to warn exists when the manufacturer's product contains asbestos components, which are integral to the function of the product, and the manufacturer is aware that routine periodic maintenance of its product will require the replacement of those components with other asbestos-containing parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Arthur Whelan contends he developed mesothelioma as the result of his work-related exposure to numerous asbestos-containing products. Plaintiff asserts, as a plumber and auto mechanic, he was exposed to asbestos in products manufactured by defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   specifically boilers, valves, steam traps, and brake drums. Although plaintiff installed and worked with some original products manufactured by some defendants, he primarily encountered asbestos in his cleaning, repair, and replacement of components used in the products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants Armstrong International Inc., Burnham LLC, Carrier Corp., Cleaver-Brooks Inc., Crown Boiler Co., Ford Motor Co., Johnson Controls Inc., NIBCO Inc., and Oakfabco Inc. filed\n   summary judgment motions. Each defendant argued plaintiff had not demonstrated exposure to friable asbestos on a regular and frequent basis from a product it sold, manufactured, supplied, or distributed. The trial judge found defendants were not liable for asbestos-containing replacement parts they did not manufacture or place into the stream of commerce. Because plaintiff could not identify an exposure to asbestos from a product actually manufactured or distributed by defendants, the court granted summary judgment to each defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In light of our determination that a manufacturer's product includes any replacement parts necessary to its function, defendants' duty to warn extends to any danger created by those replacement parts. A careful review of the record reveals plaintiff presented sufficient evidence detailing his exposure to asbestos, either from original parts supplied by defendants or replacement parts required for the function of defendants' products, to create issues of fact as to all defendants. We, therefore, reverse the October 3, November 15, and December 23, 2013 orders\n   granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We discern the following facts from the summary judgment record. Plaintiff began work as a residential and commercial plumber in 1952. He previously worked at an automotive repair shop, and continued throughout his life to restore vintage cars as a hobby. From 1955 to 1959, plaintiff worked for Franklin Lowe &amp; Sons. Plaintiff opened his own plumbing business, Arthur Whelan Plumbing and Heating, in 1959, which he maintained until 1968. From 1968 until 1971, plaintiff worked at several other plumbing companies before becoming employed by Powers Regulator, where he worked for twenty-five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2008, plaintiff was diagnosed with asbestosis ; he was subsequently diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma in 2012. Plaintiff's causation expert, pathologist Eugene J. Mark, M.D., stated in his August 2, 2013 report that plaintiff \"developed a diffuse malignant\n   mesothelioma of the pleura\" caused by asbestos exposure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Mark further concluded, \"with reasonable medical certainty\" that \"all of the special exposures to asbestos which took place prior to the occurrence of the malignancy together contributed to cause the diffuse malignant mesothelioma... [and each] was a substantial contributing factor in the causation of the diffuse malignant mesothelioma.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Armstrong International Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While employed by Franklin Lowe, plaintiff estimated he worked on twenty Armstrong steam traps installed on commercial boilers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The company's name was imprinted on the traps. Plaintiff's job duties entailed opening the traps in order to clean them and replace the asbestos gaskets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The process of replacing a gasket took approximately twenty minutes to one hour depending on its condition and how long it had been in place. Plaintiff testified that \"[d]ue to the high heat involved, these gaskets normally baked themselves onto the product, so they had to be scraped and brushed off.\" Plaintiff could not confirm whether he replaced gaskets original to the boiler or if the original had been replaced prior to his work on the system. His employer supplied the new gaskets but plaintiff did not know the manufacturer of them. He advised, however, that the Armstrong steam trap's design required the use of that specific type of gasket to function\n   properly. Plaintiff also testified that, in his experience, asbestos gaskets were \"the only product that would work with the heat involved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Armstrong confirmed it manufactured steam traps and some of its traps contained a single internal gasket, which contained \"an unknown quantity of non-friable chrysotile asbestos.\" The gasket was manufactured and supplied by an unrelated company. Armstrong also conceded the asbestos gaskets built into the steam traps \"were necessary[, and] ... standard in the\n   industry for these types of products,\" and were specified as the proper replacement part for the steam traps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Armstrong argued summary judgment was appropriate because plaintiff was unable to identify either the manufacturer of the replacement gaskets he installed or whether the gaskets he replaced in the Armstrong steam traps were original to the trap. Plaintiff opposed the motion, noting Armstrong's concession that the original component gaskets installed in its steam traps contained asbestos until 1987, the recommended routine maintenance required replacement of the gaskets every one to two years with gaskets identical to the original specifications, and asbestos gaskets were the industry standard and considered necessary for proper function at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Burnham LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While self-employed from 1959 to 1968, plaintiff installed twenty to thirty packaged, cast iron, oil-fired Burnham boilers. Plaintiff stated, in general, the process of installing a packaged boiler involved \"moving the boiler around, taking it out of the crate, [and] moving it into place, ... [which] created some dust from removing the insulation underneath the jacket.\" He described a gray dust, which he inhaled, as asbestos dust generated during the installation process. He stated the dust emanated from the boiler's\n   gray-colored insulation that was visible through the \"knock out hole where the piping would be hooked up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, Burnham pointed out the inconsistencies in plaintiff's deposition testimony. Contrary to the above-cited testimony, plaintiff also conceded he could not specifically recall whether any of the Burnham packaged units had asbestos insulation under the jacket. In an affidavit submitted in support of its motion, Burnham's former Chief Engineer and Chief Operating Officer, Donald Sweigart, certified Burnham began phasing out the use of asbestos insulation in the metal jacket of boilers \"beginning in the late 1940s and early 1950s,\" completing the process \"well before 1959\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   when plaintiff installed the Burnham boilers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition, taken prior to the summary judgment motions, plaintiff added that he cleaned approximately twelve Burnham cast iron sectional boilers. The process of cleaning a cast iron sectional boiler was \"basically the same\" for all boilers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each took approximately half an hour to two hours to clean. Plaintiff explained he used a wire brush and vacuum to clean the fireboxes\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it was \"normal for some of the asbestos to come loose with the wire brush.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Burnham filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing summary judgment was appropriate because plaintiff did not know the dates of manufacture of the boilers he installed nor their maintenance\n   history. Burnham also argued plaintiff conceded he did not know whether the Burnham boilers\n   he installed had asbestos insulation under their jackets and emphasized Swigert's affidavit that Burnham no longer used asbestos insulation in its products by 1959. Plaintiff countered he had presented evidence of exposure to asbestos in the cleaning and installation of the Burnham boilers and established the existence of material issues of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Carrier Corp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Between 1959 and 1968, plaintiff recalled cleaning and repairing less than ten Bryant\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   boilers that were packaged units with jackets. He described seeing dark gray asbestos insulation through the holes in the jacket of the boilers and stated it was \"very possible\" he disturbed the asbestos around the boiler during a repair. He explained that to repair a leak in a boiler's supply pipe, it was necessary to replace the asbestos-insulated pipe, resulting in a disturbance of the asbestos. In addition, any work on the boiler itself that required moving the jacket would disturb the asbestos insulation under the jacket because \"[t]he jackets are not really substantially fastened to the boiler ... [s]o when you're moving [the boiler], you were moving the whole jacket against the boiler ... [and,] after time, asbestos becomes brittle and flakes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition, plaintiff further recalled installing one or two Bryant cast iron sectional boilers during the same timeframe. Installation of a cast iron section boiler required\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   removal of the existing heating plant, then moving the new heating plant into position which would include uncrating [the boiler to] move into a basement or a boiler room that same equipment and assembling it on the spot where it's going. By assembling it, you put a base together, install a firebox in that base and set the sections on top of that base and draw them together with draw rods. If the boiler came with a jacket, the jacket would be applied at that point. If it did not come with a jacket, then the asbestos coating would be applied at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Once that jacket or coating is installed, then the piping to the house or building ... is connected to the ... boiler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff also described how he constructed and installed the fireboxes for cast iron sectional boilers. Using bricks made with a refractory material able to withstand extreme temperatures, the firebox was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   built up like you would build something with building blocks, put together with an asbestos type cement to hold it in place. Once that firebox is built up, you filled in the outsides with a Vermiculite type of insulation and capped it with an asbestos product, either the cement you used to put the bricks together or mix-up an asbestos powder and capped the top off so the Vermiculite did not fly out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff was able to identify the cement used to construct the firebox as \"asbestos type cement\" because \"asbestos [wa]s the only product at the time that you could mix and use as a bonding agent that would[ ]withstand [the] extreme heat of a firebox.\" The cans he used were marked \"asbestos cement.\" Plaintiff also stated the asbestos cement generated dust that dried on his hands, which he \"wiped on [his] clothes or wiped off on a rag.\" He also noted asbestos cement \"normally came with the boiler itself,\" because \"[t]he manufacturer supplied usually what was needed to put that boiler together.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Carrier's corporate representative, Howard E. Jameson, conceded that Bryant\n   boilers produced between 1938 and 1963 contained asbestos-based components such as jacket insulation and rope gaskets. The brochures for some models of Bryant boilers even described the jackets as asbestos-insulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Carrier filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing plaintiff's asbestos exposure from Bryant boilers was minimal. Carrier asserted plaintiff testified he did not install or remove Bryant boilers, cleaned fewer than ten of them, and could not specifically identify any unit or the maintenance history of any boiler he serviced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff responded he presented evidence of installing new Bryant boilers on at least two occasions, disturbing the asbestos insulation each time, and had cleaned or repaired twelve to fifteen other Bryant boilers. Plaintiff asserted Carrier manufactured and\n   distributed asbestos brick, cement, and rope gaskets, and admitted those products were used until the 1960s and 1970s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cleaver-Brooks Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   During the 1950s, plaintiff cleaned Cleaver-Brooks \"pork chop\" oil-fired boilers, although he could not recall a specific number of times. He also stated he was present during the installation of a Cleaver-Brooks boiler. These boilers were approximately eight to ten feet high and eight to twelve feet long, and each took one to two days to clean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When working on these boilers, plaintiff used a wire brush and vacuum to clean the soot inside of the boiler and, specifically, inside the boiler's firebox. The fireboxes were constructed of firebricks put together with asbestos cement and sometimes capped with a coat of asbestos. Plaintiff could not identify the manufacturer of the asbestos-containing materials in the boilers or the boilers' maintenance history or age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During the same timeframe, plaintiff testified he also cleaned and completed small repairs, such as cutting and replacing leaky tubes on Cleaver-Brook steel fire tube boilers. Plaintiff stated the cleaning process for a steel fire tube boiler was the same as other boilers and he was \"[d]efinitely\" exposed to asbestos when cleaning them. He conceded ignorance of the maintenance history of the specific steel fire Cleaver-Brooks boilers he worked on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Cleaver-Brooks filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence that he was exposed to any asbestos-containing product it manufactured or distributed. Plaintiff could not identify specific models or their maintenance history. He also did not identify the manufacturer of the asbestos-containing materials in the fireboxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff presented deposition evidence from a Cleaver-Brooks's corporate representative who affirmed in a different legal action that some of its boilers contained asbestos and regular maintenance\n   and cleaning was generally required. Another representative testified he was unaware of any Cleaver-Brooks boiler manufactured prior to the 1980s that was made with non-asbestos cement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Crown Boiler Co.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   During his January 2, 2013 deposition, plaintiff said he did not personally work on any Crown Boilers and could not attribute his asbestos exposure to that product. However, in response to his counsel's questioning during the January 28, 2013\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition, plaintiff testified he cleaned five or six Crown Boilers during his plumbing and heating employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Crown Boiler argued it was entitled to summary judgment because plaintiff had not established he was exposed to any\n   asbestos-containing materials that it manufactured, supplied, sold, or distributed, and because he failed to produce evidence that he was exposed to those materials on the frequency required by\n   <em>\n    Sholtis v. American Cyanamid Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344144\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/238/8/#p30\">\n    238 N.J.

He estimated he performed three brake jobs and two or three muffler jobs at this employment using Bendix replacement brakes and Marmont mufflers. He did not know if any of the brakes he worked on were original to the cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For six months in 1953, plaintiff worked at a \"machine shop\" called Modern Motors. He spent five days a week operating the brake lathe that cut brake drums, fitting new brake shoes to the drums, and installing brake linings. He testified the asbestos drums created dust when they were being set up, wiped out, and cut. The majority of the drums \"were original lined\" and plaintiff estimated approximately twenty-five percent of the drums he worked on at Modern Motors were made by Ford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff submitted documents from Ford reflecting dozens of its vehicles used asbestos for the rear brake drums and front disc brake linings for several decades. In a 1985 letter to the Environmental Protection Agency, Ford explained it purchased all of the brake systems installed on its vehicles from outside manufacturers. Ford recommended the EPA \"not seek to regulate the use of asbestos in the brakes\" of vehicles that currently or previously had been manufactured with asbestos-containing brake systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition to his professional automotive work, plaintiff encountered Ford brakes as part of his hobby of restoring antique cars. Among other vehicles, he owned a 1932 Ford Roadster, a 1934 Ford pickup truck, a 1949 Ford sedan, a 1950 Mercury, and a 1953 Ford pickup truck. In 1957, plaintiff performed a brake job on the 1953 Ford.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In or about 1997, plaintiff changed the drum brakes for all four wheels on the 1934 Ford. He recalled the brake shoes had been updated to \"1950 to '53 Ford F100 brakes on the front and a 1957 Ford rear end in it\" but he was unable to identify the manufacturer of the existing brake linings. Plaintiff \"sent the drums out to make sure they were perfectly round\" and when they returned, he put the Ford brake shoes back on the car with new Bendix brake linings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In 2009, plaintiff performed a brake job on his 1949 Ford, which had its original 1949 Ford brakes. He was exposed to asbestos dust when he removed the rear brake drums. He also removed the Ford engine from the car and cleaned the old asbestos gaskets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff replaced the brakes on a 1950 Mercury when he purchased that car in the mid-1980s. He was unable to identify the manufacturer of the old brakes because they were so worn down. He replaced them with Bendix brand brakes. Plaintiff also replaced the exhaust and intake gaskets on three of the Ford cars approximately seven times. He did not know the manufacturer of the original gaskets he removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Ford did not dispute plaintiff was exposed to some of its asbestos-containing products while working as an automotive professional. Ford argued, instead, that plaintiff's exposure to asbestos from changing the brakes on his personal vehicles was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response, plaintiff argued the evidence showed that as a professional mechanic, he worked on hundreds of \"Ford, original brake drums,\" which took five to ten minutes per drum, and fifty to sixty percent of those drums had never been cut or worked on before. He further contended the evidence showed Ford manufactured its own brakes for use with its cars and standard procedure required the drums be ground flat to accept a new brake shoe. While performing repairs on his personal Ford vehicles and for six or seven months while employed at another auto repair shop, plaintiff noted the brake systems required the use of asbestos and were designed to be replaced with asbestos linings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Johnson Controls Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During his employment with Powers, plaintiff testified he repaired approximately one dozen Johnson Controls steam and hot water valves at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey (UMDNJ). A repair entailed changing the stem packings, which involved \"taking the stem packing nut out, digging the packings out, and replacing them.\" The work took from one to four hours to complete. Plaintiff knew the stem packing on the valves\n   was asbestos. He did not know the service history of any of the valves or the components.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Johnson Controls' corporate representative, Robert Franecki, testified in his deposition that Johnson Controls sold replacement asbestos packing for its valves. He also acknowledged it was feasible for the company to place a warning tag on the valve itself or in a manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In its application for summary judgment, Johnson Controls argued plaintiff did not know who manufactured or supplied either the existing packing that he removed or the new packing he used as replacement in his work replacing stem packing and valves at UMDNJ. Plaintiff conceded he was unable to identify the manufacturer of the packing, but argued Johnson Controls supplied its valves with asbestos components and knew they would be replaced with like components. According to Franecki, the company also knew the replacement process would expose people to dangerous asbestos dust and it could have warned them of the danger but did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   NIBCO Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff installed new NIBCO brand valves in one of his homes and as part of his work at Franklin Lowe. He admitted it was unlikely he was exposed to asbestos during the installation of new valves, but would have been exposed to asbestos while replacing the packing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The exposure to asbestos occurred when cutting up the new packing and from \"digging the old packings out, cleaning up where it was.\" If a valve was leaking, the first repair would be to \"tighten down on the packing nut ... to see if there's anything left in there\" and then repair it if that did not work. NIBCO valves failed infrequently, however, and \"it was much easier and cheaper ... to put the packing in rather than put a new valve in.\" The valves' design required the replacement packing be the same type as the\n   original. Plaintiff did not know the repair history of any of the valves he worked on or whether the packing he pulled out\n   came from a manufacturer other than NIBCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, NIBCO argued there was no evidence plaintiff was exposed to asbestos from NIBCO valves as plaintiff admitted he was not exposed during installation and the valves failed infrequently. Plaintiff countered that the evidence showed he was exposed to friable asbestos when he removed original packing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Oakfabco Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff first encountered oil-fired Kewanee boilers in the 1950s and he worked on or around them \"[r]ight up to the day [he] retired.\" The commercial boiler was six to nine feet high and ten to twelve feet long. Plaintiff cleaned them approximately one to two dozen times, but he never installed, repaired or removed one. Cleaning required plaintiff to \"go into the firebox area, and wire brush whatever was accessible from that point, open the front and back doors, brush that all down, vacuum it out and inspect the tubes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff asserted he was exposed to asbestos from \"[d]isturbing the asbestos around the boiler, [and] replacing any gaskets that would be on the doors.\" He also stated it was \"possible\" the material being vacuumed contained asbestos, because the cleaning disturbed the refractory cement inside the firebox and vacuuming blew the dust back into the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff did not know who manufactured or supplied the asbestos around the boiler and in the fireboxes, or the old gaskets that he replaced, nor did he know the maintenance history of any of the boilers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Oakfabco argued it was entitled to summary judgment because plaintiff was unable to show he was exposed to any asbestos as a result of cleaning a Kewanee boiler or to any asbestos sold with the boiler. It was undisputed plaintiff had never installed or removed a Kewanee boiler. And, although he cleaned them, he was unable to provide any specific information as to the location, model, year, or maintenance history of any of the Kewanee boilers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In opposition to the motion, plaintiff reiterated he had testified to cleaning the fireboxes and removing and replacing gaskets on one to two dozen Kewanee dry back boilers - a very specific type of boiler. That process required brushing and scraping the inside of the asbestos-containing firebox, which took up to two hours for each boiler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   During oral argument before the trial court, plaintiff stated he was \"not necessarily arguing\" he was \"exposed to asbestos that Kewanee actually manufactured,\" but rather contended Kewanee manufactured and distributed asbestos-containing boilers, specified how to clean the asbestos-containing fireboxes of its boilers, mandated replacement of its asbestos-containing gaskets, and failed to warn plaintiff about it. Because the cement manufacturer could not place a warning on its cement inside the boilers, plaintiff contended it was Kewanee's responsibility to provide the warning on the boiler itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff argues defendants were strictly liable for their failure to warn users of the asbestos-related hazards of their products, inclusive of any component parts, including those hazards associated with routine maintenance and replacement,\n   regardless of whether defendants manufactured or supplied the asbestos-containing hazardous components or replacement parts.\n   Defendants assert settled principles of product liability law in New Jersey require a plaintiff to demonstrate he or she was exposed to asbestos and suffered injury from a defect in a defendant's own product.

A product that contained asbestos when it was supplied by the manufacturer, with no warning as to the dangers posed by the asbestos-containing\n   component, and that contained asbestos when encountered by\n   a worker years later, remains in substantially the same defective condition, whether or not its original asbestos has been replaced with other asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The \"product,\" against which a worker's exposure to asbestos is measured, is not the asbestos contained in the pump's component parts, as stated in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   . The \"product\" is the complete manufactured item as delivered by the manufacturer to the consumer, not just the asbestos contained in one of the product's components. In\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , the whole pump supplied by the defendants was defective, because it did not carry a warning about the dangers of asbestos in its components. Here, it is the boiler, valve, steam trap, brake systems, and the component parts integral to their function that is the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   To define the \"product\" as the manufacturer's complete product as marketed and distributed to the end user is consistent with our holding in\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   as well as our Supreme Court's holdings extending liability to a manufacturer for foreseeable alterations to its product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jurado v.

Replacing an original part with a substantially similar part is a foreseeable alteration. Therefore, the replacement of the asbestos did not substantially alter either the injury-producing element or the defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Employing this definition of \"product\" is a reasonable conclusion, following the concepts established in\n   <em>\n    Michalko\n   </em>\n   and the myriad of cases following it, and continuing in the vein of\n   <em>\n    Molino\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we conclude that a manufacturer will have a duty to warn in strict liability if a plaintiff can show: 1) the manufacturer's product as marketed to the end user contained asbestos-containing components; 2) the asbestos-containing components were integral to the function of the product; and 3) the manufacturer was reasonably aware its product would require periodic and routine maintenance involving the replacement of the asbestos-containing component parts with other asbestos-containing component parts. Under these limited circumstances, the manufacturer's liability for a failure to warn extends to the danger created by the component and replacement parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   We are satisfied the imposition of such a duty does not offend basic principles of fairness and public policy that must be accorded to all parties.\n   <em>\n    Olivo v.

In reviewing a summary judgment decision, the factual findings of the trial court are accorded substantial deference on appeal, but no special deference is owed to the trial court's interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that emanate from established facts.\n   <em>\n    Manahawkin Convalescent v.

As noted, the product-defect causation element has been met. The defendants may be held liable for the failure to warn\n   of the dangers associated with the asbestos contained in their product - inclusive of component parts it did not manufacture or supply. That liability extends to the failure to warn of the dangers from cleaning, repairing, and replacing the asbestos-containing components as none of those activities substantially changed the product or mitigated the danger. The fact that plaintiff was exposed to a replacement part, rather than an original part, will not eliminate a defendant's liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   We have also determined, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, that he presented sufficient evidence detailing his exposure to asbestos, either from original parts supplied by defendants or replacement parts required for the function of defendants' products to create issues of fact as to each defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With regard to the boiler defendants - Burnham and Carrier - plaintiff identified asbestos insulation under the boiler jacket. Installing and working on the units created asbestos dust. Plaintiff also built and cleaned fireboxes requiring the use of asbestos cement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The room-size boilers of Cleaver-Brooks and Oakfabco took two days to clean. The cleaning included work done on fireboxes constructed of bricks held together and capped with asbestos cement. None of the contact described by plaintiff with these boilers was casual or minimal. It is undisputed the products, as marketed, contained asbestos components and required periodic, routine replacement. Plaintiff noted asbestos cement was the only product available during the relevant years that could withstand the \"extreme heat\" of a firebox. He also noted the asbestos cement was supplied with the boiler as it was needed for the installation and operation of the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   When queried about his contact with Crown Boiler products during his January 2, 2013 deposition, plaintiff said he did not personally work on any Crown boilers and could not attribute his asbestos exposure to that product. However, several weeks later, at his\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition, plaintiff recalled cleaning five or six Crown boilers. This inconsistency in testimony is a factual dispute to be resolved by a jury. Plaintiff's description of cleaning all of the involved boilers is sufficient to allow an inference of exposure to these products on a frequent and regular basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Plaintiff also presented sufficient evidence to raise a jury question as to whether he met the \"frequency, regularity, and proximity\" test regarding the valve manufacturers - Johnson Controls and NIBCO. He testified he repaired at least a dozen Johnson steam and hot water valves, which entailed digging out and replacing the asbestos packing. Plaintiff described the same type of work regarding his exposure with NIBCO valves. Those valves required asbestos packing for sealing; the valves' design required the replacement packing be the same as the original. Plaintiff's testimony is, therefore, sufficient to raise the inference he worked frequently and regularly in close proximity to asbestos in Johnson Controls and NIBCO valves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiff also estimated he cleaned twenty Armstrong steam traps. The traps were designed to use a specific type of\n   asbestos gasket to function properly. The scraping out of the asbestos gasket took one to four hours. Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to withstand the grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   It is undisputed plaintiff was exposed to asbestos during his work with Ford cars and their brake systems. The systems required the use of asbestos and were designed to be replaced with asbestos linings. The majority of the brake drums plaintiff worked on at Modern Motors\n   were \"original lined.\" He stated twenty-five percent of those drums were made by Ford. The trial court erred in concluding plaintiff had not established Ford as the manufacturer of the lining on the vehicles on which he worked at Modern Motors. Plaintiff demonstrated an exposure to Ford asbestos products sufficient to raise a factual issue for the jury under the\n   <em>\n    Sholtis\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   We, therefore, reverse the orders of summary judgment as to each named defendant and remand to the trial court for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
