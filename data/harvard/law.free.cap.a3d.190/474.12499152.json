Anicama appeals from the Law Division's August 16, 2016 order. He received the mandatory 180-day sentence for his third or subsequent conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI), N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a)(3). The Municipal Court allowed him to serve his sentence by being in jail only two days a week, a form of periodic service. The Law Division reversed. Despite prior decisions by this court, it is apparently \"not entirely clear whether a third or subsequent offender's mandatory prison term may be served on a periodic basis.\" Richmond &amp; Burns,\n   <em>\n    Municipal Court Practice\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 29:3-3 (2017) (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disapprove\n   <em>\n    Grabowski\n   </em>\n   and hold that a third or subsequent DWI offender is ineligible for periodic service of the mandatory 180-day sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the Law Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his guilty plea colloquy, defendant admitted the following facts. On the evening of May 10, 2015, he consumed beer and a shot of scotch whiskey. The alcohol affected his ability to drive. As a result, defendant hit a parked car in the Town of Harrison and continued driving. He drove into the Borough of East Newark, and hit another parked car, and again kept driving to his house. When he parked at his home, police officers approached and arrested\n   him. The officers found cocaine and a half-empty bottle of scotch whiskey in defendant's car. Defendant had three prior\n   convictions for DWI, and a prior conviction for controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was charged in East Newark with DWI; third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance; leaving the scene of an accident; failing to report an accident; reckless driving; careless driving; and having an open container of alcohol in a vehicle. He was charged in Harrison with leaving the scene of an accident. The charges were consolidated in the East Newark Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 10, 2016, defendant pled guilty in the Municipal Court to a third or subsequent DWI violation, N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a)(3) ; disorderly-persons possession of drug paraphernalia, N.J.S.A. 2C:36-2 ; leaving the scene of an accident, N.J.S.A. 39:4-129(d) ; and careless driving, N.J.S.A. 39:4-97. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the other charges were dismissed, and he was sentenced to ten years' loss of driving privileges and 180 days of incarceration for the DWI charge, a suspended 180-day jail sentence and one year of probation for the paraphernalia offense, plus fines and other monetary assessments for those offenses, for leaving the scene, and for careless driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant requested that the 180 days in jail for his DWI offense be served two days per week. He claimed serving his sentence continuously would result in the loss of his restaurant business. The Municipal Court found it had authority to allow such periodic service under N.J.S.A. 2B:12-22. The judge ordered defendant to serve the 180 days \"at a rate of not less than two consecutive days per week,\" with his \"work schedule to be accommodated to the extent possible.\" Defendant began serving his sentence on Mondays and Tuesdays only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State appealed the \"illegal sentence\" on the DWI offense. After hearing argument, the Law Division issued a written opinion on August 26, 2016, reversing the Municipal Court. The Law Division ruled \"[d]efendant's argument that periodic service is permissible pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a)(3) is without merit,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   and ordered defendant to surrender and serve the remainder of his sentence on consecutive days.

The issue is whether this general statute applies to defendants convicted of third or subsequent DWI violations under N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a)(3).

The\n   <em>\n    Original Assembly Bill\n   </em>\n   provided that such a \"person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 180 days, except that the court may lower such term for each day, not\n   exceeding 90 days, of participation in a rehabilitation program for drug and alcohol dependent persons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bill's sponsors sought to \"motivate these offenders to seek treatment for the underlying alcohol or drug problem that causes them to reoffend.\"\n   <em>\n    Sponsors' Statement\n   </em>\n   at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Substitute\n   </em>\n   proposed to amend N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a)(3) to require that third or subsequent DWI offenders serve both \"90 days imprisonment in a county jail or workhouse\" and \"a 90-day drug or alcohol inpatient rehabilitation program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The committee statement explained this would require \"a mandatory 90-day term of imprisonment in a county jail or workhouse.\"\n   <em>\n    Assemb. L. &amp; Pub. Safety Comm. Statement to Assemb.

The Senate committee statement explained that, except for such inpatient rehabilitation, it was otherwise requiring \"a mandatory 180-day sentence in a county jail or workhouse.\"\n   <em>\n    Senate L. &amp; Pub.

Substit. for A. 3342\n   </em>\n   1 (Nov. 24, 2003) [\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, Michael's Law sought to prevent third or subsequent DWI offenders from serving any of their jail sentence in community service. The bill deleted the language in N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a)(3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   permitting up to ninety days of the jail term to be served by performing community service.\n   <em>\n    Original Assembly Bill\n   </em>\n   at 2, 36;\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Substitute\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Amended Bill\n   </em>\n   at 3. The committee statements differentiated Michael's Law from the \"current law\" under which a court could reduce the 180-day jail term \"by up to 90 days for each day served performing community service.\"\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Third, Michael's Law sought to remove the option of serving\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the 180-day term in an inpatient drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. Unlike the unnumbered paragraph of N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a) (1993), which permitted all DWI offenders to be sentenced \"to the county jail, to the workhouse of the county wherein the offense was committed, [or] to an inpatient rehabilitation program,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   , Michael's Law required third or subsequent DWI offenders to serve the first ninety days \"in a county jail or workhouse.\"\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Substitute\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Amended Bill\n   </em>\n   at 3. The committee statements noted that \"[u]nder current law,\" third or subsequent DWI offenders \"may not be required to serve their term of imprisonment in the county jail or workhouse, but may serve such imprisonment in an inpatient rehabilitation program. Under the substitute, at least 90 days would have to be served in jail without exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Fourth, Michael's Law sought to prevent work release for a third or subsequent DWI violation by inserting the language \"a first or second violation\" into N.J.S.A. 39:4-51.\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Substitute\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Amended Bill\n   </em>\n   at 3. The committee statements explained: \"The substitute also makes drunk drivers who are required to serve the [180-day] mandatory term of imprisonment ineligible to participate in a work release program. Under a work release program, qualified prisoners may be employed outside the jail, but when not working, they must be confined to the jail.\"\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, the legislative history shows Michael's Law sought to strengthen the penalties for third or subsequent DWI offenders, like the driver who killed Michael Albano, by requiring them to serve 180 days in the county jail or workhouse, with up to ninety days in an inpatient drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, and by precluding all other sentencing alternatives. These penalty enhancements served to keep third-time DWI offenders confined for 180 days and thus \" 'off the streets, even if they won't keep themselves off the streets.' \"\n   <em>\n    Governor's Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nowhere in the legislative history is there any indication the Legislature intended Michael's Law to weaken the penalties for third or subsequent DWI offenders by allowing them to be periodically released before they have served the 180 days. Such a result would be contrary to the Legislature's intent to end all other sentencing alternatives, and would defeat\n   the purpose of keeping such defendants confined for the 180 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, defendant's argument is contrary to our definitive interpretation of Michael's Law in\n   <em>\n    State v.

By contrast, N.J.S.A. 39:4-51 and Michael's Law specifically addressed how DWI offenders must serve their jail term. Thus, as to those defendants, the more specific DWI provisions governs over the general N.J.S.A. 2B:12-22, and\n   <em>\n    Luthe\n   </em>\n   properly relied on them. \"It is a well established precept of statutory construction that when two statutes conflict, the more specific controls over the more general.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.

However, the judge made too much of this distinction. Periodic service and work release strongly resemble each other. Both allow defendants to be in jail for limited periods and to be released from custody to work, including at the jobs they had prior to conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 30:8-46.

However, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-5(a) covers any person who \"fails to return to official detention following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period,\" and thus appears broad enough to cover defendants released during periodic service who fail to return after the \"limited period\" of release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5186511\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/388/431/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover,\n   periodic service can be limited to \"particular days.\" N.J.S.A. 2B:12-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The judge in\n   <em>\n    Grabowski\n   </em>\n   stated: \"Most importantly, inmates admitted to county work release programs may be granted a\n   diminution of their sentence of up to one-quarter of their term for good conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5186511\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/388/431/\">\n    388 N.J.

The judge noted that N.J.S.A. 39:4-51\"had authorized work release as a sentencing option for persons convicted of DWI,\" and that \"Michael's Law\n   eliminated that option for third and subsequent offenders\" by amending N.J.S.A. 39:4-51 so \"that the statute applies solely to '[a] person who has been convicted of a first or second violation of Section 39:4-50.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5186511\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/388/431/\">\n    388 N.J.

However, as the legislative history makes clear, the Legislature's purpose in inserting the language \"a first or second violation\" in N.J.S.A. 39:4-51 was to restrict work release to defendants convicted of a first or second DWI violation, and thus to make defendants convicted of third or subsequent violations \"ineligible to participate in a work release program.\"\n   <em>\n    Senate Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assembly Committee Statement\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To read the amended N.J.S.A. 39:4-51 literally would defeat that legislative objective.
