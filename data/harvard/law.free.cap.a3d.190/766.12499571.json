In support of its contention that the trial court should have granted its motion for JNOV, PennDOT argues that the plaintiffs, David and Brenda Carletti (together, the Carlettis), failed to offer any competent, non-hearsay evidence (1) on the essential elements of their negligence claim, and (2) that PennDOT had actual or constructive notice of an alleged defect in a state-operated roadway, which would thereby cause PennDOT to fall under the highway exception to sovereign immunity. In support of its argument for a new trial, PennDOT contends that the trial court failed to give adequate cautionary jury instructions. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately 6:30 p.m. on May 26, 2012, David Carletti (Mr. Carletti) was riding his bicycle downhill at about 30 miles per hour on State Route 320/Sproul Road near the entry of a bridge over trolley tracks in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania, when he allegedly hit a \"hump\" in the road. Mr. Carletti crashed, hitting his head on the pavement. Mr. Carletti was 63 years old at the time of the accident and had been an avid and experienced cyclist for 15-20 years, averaging 50-60 miles per week on his bicycle. He was wearing a helmet but the force of the fall caused it to crack. David and Pamela Kauffman (together, the Kauffmans) were standing nearby and tended to Mr. Carletti after his fall. While Pamela Kauffman (Mrs. Kauffman) was looking away at the exact moment of the accident, David Kauffman (Mr. Kauffman) witnessed it as it was happening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sergeant Andrew McKinney (Sergeant McKinney) of the Springfield Township Police Department came to the scene and spoke to the Kauffmans about the accident,\n   including their perceptions as to what caused Mr. Carletti to crash. Sergeant McKinney authored an incident report, in which he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The witnesses advised that they observed the victim traveling eastbound, on his bicycle, in the center of the traffic lane when he hit a hump in the roadway. As a result, the victim went forward over the handle bars landing on his head. The victim's bike helmet was located several feet away and was damaged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 520a.) Though he did not take measurements, Sergeant McKinney estimated that the hump Mr. Carletti hit was about three feet wide and rose a few inches above the rest of the roadway. Though described as a hump, it is more accurately described as a linear patch to a cut-out portion of the roadway, stretching from one side of the road to the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Immediately after the fall, Mr. Carletti suffered skull and facial fractures, as well as four broken ribs and a fractured T-2 vertebrae of his thoracic spine. Mr. Carletti also suffered serious, irreparable brain damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Carlettis brought an action against PennDOT alleging negligence in the design and maintenance of the portion of the roadway where the accident occurred, as well as a failure to warn bicyclists of the hazardous condition and failure to remedy the condition after receiving notice thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. Carletti claimed loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During discovery, the Carlettis retained Shawn Gyorke (Gyorke), an accident reconstructionist and Arlington Heights, Illinois Police Commander, as an expert witness. In Gyorke's report, he opined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The only stimulus for the ejection, which can reasonably account for the subsequent accident, was the roadway defect (patched section of asphalt), as it provided a discontinuity in the lateral, vertical and longitudinal directions. By way of explanation, absent an alternative cause, we can reasonably conclude the nearby road defect did cause the ejection/fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The roadway defect was a dangerous condition. Furthermore, it posed a hazard due to improper maintenance. By way of explanation, [PennDOT], as the agent responsible for maintaining the aforementioned roadway, had a duty to make the highway safe for its intended purpose. Seeing as though there were no dedicated off-highway bicycle paths available in the same area, the intended purpose of the highway would include, but not be limited to, transportation by way of bicycle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Knowing the ejection was a product of the listed defect, PennDOT failed in their [sic] duty to make the highway safe for its intended purpose. Similarly, the failure in maintaining the highway caused harm to Mr. Carletti. Simply put, the roadway defect was a product of improper maintenance, thereby creating a dangerous condition which was unreasonably unsafe for passing cyclists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (R.R. at 76a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, portions of PennDOT Assistant Manager Joseph Zielke's (Zielke) deposition\n   were read into the record. He confirmed that Route 320/Sproul Road is a state road and, as such, it is PennDOT's responsibility to maintain it and ensure it is free of defects. He also stated that in his role as Assistant Manager, he conducts inspections on state-operated highways to search for possibly dangerous conditions. Regarding the dangerous condition that the Carlettis claim caused the accident, the following exchange took place during Zielke's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: If that bump, when you do your inspections of the roadway, if you saw a bump such as you see in this photograph, is that something that you would have put in to have repaired?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q: And why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A: I would have probably milled it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: And what does that mean, sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A: And I see the grass in there, too, so, yes, I would have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: For us lay people, milling means what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: Going to make it level to the roadway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: And why would you do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Get the bump out of the road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (R.R. at 516a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Carletti did not testify as to what caused the accident because he did not recall the specifics of the incident due to the serious brain trauma he suffered as a result of it. Mr. Kauffman, the sole witness of the accident, also did not testify. In fact, Sergeant McKinney and Gyorke were the only liability witnesses offered at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Sergeant McKinney testified that when he arrived at the accident scene, the Kauffmans were tending to an unconscious Mr. Carletti. Sergeant McKinney also testified that, at the scene, he wrote down information that the Kauffmans relayed to him and, within a few hours of the incident, filled out an incident report of what he observed. When questioned about the cause of the accident, Sergeant McKinney read directly from the portion of his report containing Mr. Kauffman's observations and, later in his testimony, confirmed that was what Mr. Kauffman told him. He also testified that the Kauffmans were standing a couple hundred feet away from where Mr. Carletti hit the hump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Sergeant McKinney did not investigate the scene or take any measurements because it was not in his practice to do so unless the accident involved either a death or something of a criminal nature. He described the hump to the Carlettis' counsel as being roughly three feet wide and \"a couple of inches\" high. (R.R. at 408a.) Upon cross-examination, he described the hump to PennDOT's counsel as \"at some point in time [being] several inches high.\" (R.R. at 409a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Carlettis called Gyorke as an accident reconstruction expert to establish the cause of the accident. In arriving at his opinion as to what caused Mr. Carletti's crash, he testified that he reviewed a number of depositions, including those of Sergeant McKinney and Mr. Kauffman, which were not included in the record. Gyorke also reviewed Mr. Carletti's medical records, which included CT scans, and Sergeant McKinney's incident report. He had not visited the scene itself because by the time he had been retained, the defect had already been repaved. However, Gyorke was able to review photographs of the hump in the road dating back to June 2011, as well as photographs taken in August 2012 just months after Mr. Carletti's accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Regarding the defect on the roadway, Gyorke testified that the asphalt had worn away after rising and being pounded down\n   in certain areas, \"[s]o there is now a gap down and a hump up where the asphalt has not been chipped away.\" (R.R. at 276a.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gyorke went on to describe the defect as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   There is essentially a pavement section that has been now replaced which provides both a vertical change as well as a longitudinal change and lateral change in elevation with regards to the roadway. The roadway is no longer flat when he hits that. It's basically a - I'll call it a hump or a defect in the road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [I]t's a patch job essentially, for lack of a better term, wherein now there has been, due to weather and other things, that has risen above the level of the roadway. There is both a longitudinal change as well as a wave effect of the pavement. Essentially when cars travel - continue traveling over those sections of roadway, they pat down a certain section of the asphalt while the other sections are allowed to rise, for lack of a better term, which means that you have this wave effect across the defect as well as a hump in the roadway as well. That's the impact point that he strikes before being launched off his bicycle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   So where the asphalt has now worn away, there is now a gap. Okay? The asphalt is meant to patch the gap. But not only has the asphalt risen and been pounded down in certain areas, making it kind of that wave effect, but several parts were, due to wear, of that which is not intended to be a long-term solution or a long-term fix for a roadway of this particular condition, it's worn away, leaving a gap before you actually hip [sic] the hump as well. So there is a gap down and then a hump up where the asphalt has not been chipped away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (R.R. at 273a - 275a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Regarding whether the hump in the road was, in fact, a defect, Gyorke noted that he reviewed Zielke's deposition testimony, which assisted him in coming to his conclusion that the hump in the roadway was a dangerous or defective condition of the roadway and that it undoubtedly was the cause of the accident. When counsel for the Carlettis questioned him regarding why he was certain the defect in the roadway caused the accident rather than Mr. Carletti braking, Gyorke responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   So there's a difference when it comes to the mechanics of crash with regards to the way the person's body moves when they [sic] yank, like you just described, yank on the brakes. That's what called an end-over or people will commonly refer to it as an endo. I don't know why but they use that particular acronym. But an endo is distinctly different in that it causes your body to do something\n   completely dissimilar to what the witnesses in this particular case describe. When you impact something, that's a slowing of the bicycle and your body keeps going. Okay? When you can - when you perform or when you grab the brakes really hard, and you'll see this on occasion during bicycle races and things like that where riders panic and stop. When you brake hard, you can also cause to put the bike to - if I hold it hard enough, I can cause the bike to go over. The problem is is [sic] that my body doesn't get ejected upon the roadway. My body stays with the bicycle now because I'm applying the brakes and I go over and I hit head first upside-down, about as close to a 90-degree turnover essentially, and that is not what we saw in this particular case. So we know that it's not some event where [Mr. Carletti] simply jams on the brakes and basically does a 90-degree turn and hits his head first on the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   So if I'm a rider and I am on the bicycle and now my head is rotated down along with the bicycle, I'm basically taking it from here and I'm rotating the bicycle over. We would see an impact on the top of the helmet and we would see an impact on the top of the head. If it was - if it were a product of jamming on the brakes so to speak and going over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (R.R. at 285a - 286a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Gyorke also explained the exact scenario of the accident as he reconstructed it to a reasonable degree of certainty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   So as the bicyclist is riding, he hits this defect and the bicycle is slowed. The bicycle is definitely being slowed as a result of impacting the barrier. It's his body that's not [because] his body isn't conjoined to the bicycle. So his body follows Newton's first law of motion ... in that his body continues forward at the speed at which he was riding and goes over the handlebars, like Mr. Kauffman describes, whereas the bicycle, having been slowed due to the impact, is slightly behind him, meaning that the bicycle has been slowed some but his body has not and that's why his body goes over the handlebars and he goes tumbling down the roadway to where his final rest position is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (R.R. at 327a.) On cross-examination, PennDOT's counsel asked Gyorke how he could have relied upon Mr. Kauffman's deposition testimony in forming his opinion when Mr. Kauffman himself did not know precisely what caused Mr. Carletti to crash. Gyorke replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   It's by way of - it's by way of crash reconstruction that knowing the defect is there, knowing the size, scope, and nature of the defect, looking at the physical evidence, and then taking all of those facts into consideration is how you arrive at the ultimate opinion that it was the defect that did, in fact, cause the crash. Mr. Kauffman is just being honest because he doesn't - he's not a crash reconstructionist. He didn't attempt to reconstruct this crash. All he knows is that he sees [Mr. Carletti] get ejected over his bicycle, where the defect is in the roadway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (R.R. at 312a - 313a.) Gyorke did, however, concede that Mr. Kauffman did not state whether he knew if Mr. Carletti grabbed his brakes. Counsel for PennDOT then read part of Mr. Kauffman's deposition testimony, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   I never said starts to lose control. What I said is that something happened [sic] the bike back wheel came up and he went over the handlebars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (R.R. at 321a.) Later, PennDOT's counsel questioned Gyorke on this point:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q: So when you were asked about what Mr. Kauffman said, equally, you would disagree that he said in his deposition nine times that I can't tell you what caused him to flip over, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A: He does not know why the bike flipped over. He only knows that [Mr. Carletti] was ejected when he reached the defect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q: Okay. [Mr. Carletti] doesn't say he reached the defect and the defect caused him to flip. [Mr. Carletti] says I don't know. It was the area of where it was, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (R.R. at 365a - 366a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Throughout the trial, the Carlettis' counsel stated that he was going to call Mr. Kauffman as a witness. Based upon this assumption, throughout Gyorke's testimony, multiple references were made to Mr. Kauffman's deposition testimony. At the close of their case, the Carlettis' counsel stated that he did not intend to call Mr. Kauffman as a witness. Moreover, Mr. Kauffman's deposition was not entered into the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Counsel for PennDOT moved to strike as hearsay all references to Mr. Kauffman's out-of-court statements, including all references to these statements in Gyorke's testimony, arguing that the only reason the trial court permitted the references was because Mr. Kauffman was expected to testify. The trial court agreed, stating \"I think I got to exclude the Kauffman's [sic] testimony or there is reference to them and [Gyorke's] opinion is still there been [sic] based on all the things he reviewed.\" (R.R. at 441a.) The trial court made a similar ruling with regard to Sergeant McKinney's reiteration of what the Kauffmans said to him. (R.R. at 442a - 444a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Acknowledging that it \"agreed that the Kauffman's [sic] [deposition] testimony is hearsay since they are not being called,\" the trial court found that \"records and reports\" upon which an expert relies - even if hearsay - are admissible to help the jury assess an expert's opinion, \"but not as establishing the truth of the underlying information.\" (R.R. at 456a.) The trial court also reasoned, \"it will be up to the jury to recall what the basis of Mr. Gyorke's opinion was and there will be no mention of the Kauffman's [sic] testimony by either side [in their closings.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Separately, PennDOT moved for a nonsuit on the merits of the Carlettis' claims, arguing that the Carlettis had not proven that PennDOT had the requisite actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition on Route 320. It also contended that it was entitled to a nonsuit because there is no proof of a causal connection between the alleged defect on Route 320 and Mr. Carletti's accident because the Carlettis' case rested entirely upon Gyorke's impermissible speculation and conjecture. The trial court denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Carletti and awarded damages in the amount of $4,458,530.50 for loss of wages, medical costs and pain and suffering, and $1,000,000 in favor of Mrs. Carletti for loss of consortium. PennDOT made an oral motion for post-trial relief, but the motion was immediately denied. PennDOT followed with a written motion for post-trial relief, which was also denied. The trial court also molded the verdict, in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8528(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to\n   $250,000 per plaintiff, for a total of $500,000, plus delay damages of $18,811.00. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   PennDOT contends that it was entitled to JNOV because: (1) the Carlettis failed to establish negligence because they failed to provide competent testimony on the element of causation;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the Carlettis' claim does not fall within an exception to sovereign immunity because there was no evidence that PennDOT had notice of the defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A commonwealth agency waives its sovereign immunity for dangerous conditions of the highway under its jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4). Although it is not an insurer against all defects, a commonwealth agency is required to maintain its highways in a reasonably safe condition for the traveling public. The duty to keep the highway safe for the traveling public includes the duty to design the highway in a reasonably safe manner, maintain the highway in a reasonably safe manner, and update the design, if improvements are necessary, to protect the public from harm.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

While there is no evidence regarding precisely how long the dangerous condition existed, images of the hump dating back to over a year before the accident occurred were included in the record, as well as comparative images from a few months after the accident. There is no doubt the defect was apparent on reasonable inspection because Zielke testified that if he observed the condition while inspecting the road, he would have taken corrective action by milling the road to take out the hump and other imperfections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because there was sufficient competent evidence that the jury could have found that PennDOT had constructive notice of the dangerous condition, the trial court did not err in denying PennDOT's motion for JNOV based upon the issue of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Even if it is deemed to have constructive notice, PennDOT contends that the Carlettis failed to show the causal link between PennDOT's alleged negligence and the injuries Mr. Carletti suffered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinowski v.

[The] body stays with the bicycle....\" (R.R. at 286a.) Gyorke's opinion was based on Mr. Kauffman's deposition.

PennDOT does not contend that this evidence, offered into the record, was a basis for Gyorke's opinion that the hump caused the accident.

The trial court provided the following instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [I]f you find that the expert's testimony is not truthful, or it's not accurate, you reject it, just as you would any other witness's testimony. If you find, on the other hand, that the expert's testimony, or segments of it, are truthful and accurate, then it's going to be up to you to decide how significant it is, if at all, in this case. So in other words, the weighing of expert testimony is left to you, ladies and gentlemen, just as with every witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   But with respect to expert testimony, consider also the reasons that the expert gives you for his opinion.

It's no longer supported. And so it is with an expert's opinion are the reasons that the expert gives you for those opinions. So consider the reasons that the expert gives you in his opinion, and then decide, are those reasons supported by the evidence in this case, that is the evidence that you - which you, ladies and gentlemen, find to be truthful and accurate, and worthy of some weight. Now if one of the expert witnesses had told you that he relied upon a particular fact, but you find, from the evidence, that fact is not so, the opinion is not supported in that regard. Similarly, if a witness depended on the non-existence of a fact, but you find, from the evidence, that that fact did exist, then, again, the opinion is not supported in that regard.\n   <strong>\n    You've heard, in this case the records and reports upon\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    which the expert relied were marked and offered into evidence, and you may consider the facts, the data, or the opinions reasonably relied upon by the expert in evaluating the basis of the expert's opinion, but it does not establish the truth of the underlying information.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (R.R. at 473a - 475a.)

By omitting specific references to Mr. Kauffman's deposition testimony in its instruction, the trial court put the onus upon the jury to determine what precisely was the underlying foundation of Gyorke's opinion. This error was compounded because the trial court instructed counsel that neither was to refer to Mr. Kauffman's deposition or statements in their closing arguments for any purpose. Under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 105, \"[i]f the court admits evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose - but not against another party or for another purpose - the court, on timely request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.\" Pa.R.E. 105.

Pa., No. 97-6720, filed June 9, 1998) (holding that a police report which contains a cursory summary of a victim's report that he had been robbed at gunpoint constituted double hearsay and the statements did not fall within any exception).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Even though it found that the issue was waived, the trial court found that the statement was permitted under the \"recorded recollection\" exception to hearsay. Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 803.1(3), among other things, provides that it only applies to refresh the memory of those who made the statement. Pa.R.E. 803.1(3). Mr. Kauffman's statements memorialized by Sergeant McKinney's incident report do not fall under this exception because he was obviously not the \"declarant\" of Sergeant McKinney's report and was not a witness in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Alternatively, if the objection had not been waived, the Carlettis argue that it falls within the \"present sense impression\" exception to the hearsay rule. A present sense impression is \"[a] statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it.\" Pa.R.E. 803(1). A statement may fall under this hearsay exception if it occurred either contemporaneous with or immediately after an event the statement describes. The contemporaneousness of the statement ensures its reliability.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    The declaration is \"instinctive rather than deliberative-in short, the reflex product of immediate sensual impressions, unaided by retrospective mental action. These are the indicia of verity which the law accepts as a substitute for the usual requirements of an oath and opportunity for cross-examination.\"\n    <em>\n     Municipality of Bethel Park v.

A 30-minute lapse in time between the statement and the incident exceeds the scope of the present sense impression exception.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The Superior Court has held that a ten-minute lapse in time from an eyewitness' statements to a police officer after a motorcyclist's collision with a tractor trailer did not fall within the present sense impression hearsay exception.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Croyle v.

PennDOT does not contend that the statement did not occur \"shortly thereafter\"; but, without support, contends that Mr. Kauffman's statement does not fall within the exception because he made it in response to a question.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The trial court found that PennDOT waived this issue because it did not take an exception to the instruction. The trial court explicitly stated prior to issuing jury instructions:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n    The Court may give a limited instruction to the jury under Rule 105, that may - that it may consider the facts, data, or opinions reasonably relied upon by the expert under Rule 703 in evaluating the basis of that expert's opinion, but not as establishing the truth of the underlying information. So it will be up to the jury to recall what the basis of Mr. Gyorke's opinion was and there will be no mention of the Kauffman's [sic] testimony by either side, the Plaintiffs' or the Defendants'.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    (R.R. at 456a - 457a.) Immediately thereafter, counsel for PennDOT stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    [PennDOT]: Your Honor, we take an exception to that and we ask you to abide by the rule in Rule 703 and Rule 105 as written in the statute. Specifically, it says, when an expert testifies about the underlying facts and data that support the expert's opinion and the evidence would be otherwise inadmissible. The Trial Judge upon request, must, and we're asking this Court to do so, instruct the jury to consider the facts and data only to explain the basis for the expert's opinion and not as substantive evidence. And we would ask this Court to instruct the jury that the facts that the expert relied on are not substantive evidence in this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n    The Court: Well some of the facts are and some aren't and you're just getting back into this and I'm trying to clean up the business about the Kauffman's [sic] and the hearsay aspects of it and -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n    [PennDOT]: And we would ask specifically regarding the Kauffman's [sic] testimony is not substantive evidence in this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    (R.R. at 457a - 458a.) Clearly, PennDOT requested a more specific instruction, which the trial court acknowledged when it said to PennDOT's counsel, \"[Y]ou have an exception on the record, of course.\" (R.R. at 461a.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
