Specifically, we shall consider whether an expert's opinion on causation, relying on epidemiological studies, suffers from the same \"analytical gap\" identified in\n   <em>\n    Rochkind v. Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489994,12314571\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/277/\">\n    454 Md. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489994,12314571\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/277/\">\n    164 A.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). We shall also assess whether an expert may offer an opinion on specific causation when relying on epidemiological data coupled with an individualized analysis of the plaintiff and his claimed injuries. Finally, we consider the sufficiency of proof required for a plaintiff to demonstrate a loss of earning capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent, Chauncey Liles, Jr. sued Ivy Realty, Inc. and Stanley Sugarman (collectively \"Sugarman\") in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Liles alleged injury and damages caused by lead paint exposure at a residential property (the\n   \"Residence\") owned by Sugarman. At trial, the parties stipulated that, due to Sugarman's negligence, Liles was exposed to deteriorating lead paint at the Residence. The parties further stipulated that the exposure caused Liles's elevated blood lead levels (\"BLL\"). The only remaining questions for the jury were whether the lead exposure caused Liles any injury, and if so, what damages he incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Liles's Developmental History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Liles was born in 1998. At the age of 2, Liles's BLL measured 11 mcg/dL. At the age of 3, his BLL was 10 mcg/dL. When he entered the fourth grade, Liles began to have educational difficulties. At the same time, Liles was experiencing grief and anxiety from the death of several family members. His educational records reflect that in fifth grade, as a result of his educational difficulties, his teachers provided additional accommodations, including one-on-one support, individualized help on his math skills and test taking practice, additional response time in class, additional time to complete assignments, and repetition of directions. Through middle school, Liles earned grades in the 90s, 80s, and mid-to-high 70s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After middle school, Liles attended Baltimore City College (\"City College\"), a selective high school located in Baltimore. He graduated in May 2016. In 2012, Liles broke the thumb on his dominant hand. In 2012 and 2013, his academic performance faltered. Initially, in a deposition, Liles attributed this dip in his grades to not being able to write with an injured hand. At trial though, he testified that this was just an excuse meant to cover for his faltering performance and difficulties paying attention. In 9th grade, his GPA was 2.38. In 10th grade, he had a GPA of 1.09. His GPA increased in 11th and 12th grade, when he earned GPAs of 2.57 and 3.36 respectively. He graduated 194th out of 301 students in his class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Liles described his grades at City College as \"terrible.\" He attributed his performance to his inability to focus and claimed that he is easily distracted, has difficulty sitting still, and stated that he \"just can't grasp things as fast as other people\n   do.\" He claimed that these issues started when he was young and that \"as the work got harder, [he] couldn't get it.\" Despite these difficulties in the classroom, Liles tested at or above grade level on the Maryland School Assessment and passed his High School Assessment without any additional support. Liles was accepted at West Virginia University and Bowie State University, both of which are four-year schools. At trial, Liles testified that he intended to pursue a bachelor's degree from Bowie State.\n   Liles's mother graduated from high school and obtained some college education, but has no college degree. His father also graduated from high school but did not attend college and works as a truck driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Liles called four expert witnesses: (1) Robert Kraft, Ph.D.; (2) Jacalyn Blackwell-White, MD; (3) Mark Lieberman; and (4) Michael Conte, Ph.D. We shall examine the testimony of each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Robert Kraft, Ph.D.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Liles offered Dr. Robert Kraft as an expert in the field of psychology and neuropsychology. Dr. Kraft testified that he conducted a neuropsychological examination of Liles, which consisted of an interview as well as several tests administered to assess various aspects of intelligence including attention, memory, learning, and language. Specifically, Dr. Kraft administered an IQ test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (\"WAIS-IV\"). Dr. Kraft testified that Liles had a full-scale IQ of 94, which placed him in the 34th percentile and in the normal range. Dr. Kraft also explained that an average range IQ does not necessitate a conclusion that there was no evidence of brain impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to this overall score, the IQ test revealed several sub-scores, which measured various aspects of intelligence. Dr. Kraft found a \"statistically significant\" discrepancy between some of Liles's sub-scores, which indicated that Liles had some form of brain impairment. Liles received a sub-score of\n   86 on two indexes Dr. Kraft identified as most sensitive to attention and concentration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Notably, according to Dr. Kraft, Liles scored 86 in both: (1) auditory encoding of information in the working memory; and (2) information processing speed. Dr. Kraft testified that these are both factors of attention. Dr. Kraft described auditory encoding in the following manner: \"Any time an individual gives you a piece of information that you are expected to use in some way, you are encoding that information until you've completed the task, then you can forget about the information.\" Regarding information processing speed, Dr. Kraft said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Processing speed is your ability to independently focus and complete a task in a self-direct manner. So any time a student sits down to study, an adult, anyone sits down to read a book, any time a person sits down to complete a writing task-that requires information processing speed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Dr. Kraft tested Liles's information processing speed a second time, Liles received a scale score of 76, which placed him in the 5th percentile. Liles also performed in the \"borderline\" range on a test related to \"simple and complex visual motor tracking.\" This, Dr. Kraft testified, was \"consistent with his processing speed difficulty and difficulty shifting attention.\" Dr. Kraft opined that Liles's lower scores on these tests of attention were statistically significant and attributable to brain impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The lower scores on auditory encoding and information processing speed were the only impairments Dr. Kraft identified. On cross-examination, when asked about how these attention impairments related to Liles's academic performance, Dr. Kraft said, \"[h]e could, in fact, have these deficits but still [have] B's all the way through [school]. These deficits are mild, and they may not always show up in every school year.\" He further stated, that \"[m]y opinion ... is that he may not show any impairments in his school performance at all based on these deficits, if he's able to\n   adapt and accommodate in some way for them.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jacalyn Blackwell-White, MD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Blackwell-White was accepted as an expert in the fields of pediatrics and childhood lead poisoning. She testified that lead is a neurotoxin that \"causes damage to the central nervous system.\" She explained that lead blocks the transmission of neurotransmitters to the brain, which impedes \"learning pathways.\" Lead exposure during the prenatal stage through at least age six or seven can cause damage to the brain because it disrupts the learning pathways during critical developmental periods. Dr. Blackwell-White testified that this means that \"attention is going to be affected.\" She also explained that the Center for Disease Control \"issue[s] standards and protocols for diagnosis and treatment of children who have elevated blood lead levels ...\" and has set the current reference level at 5 mcg/dL. The reference level was once higher, but later lowered due to medical studies showing that BLLs under 10 mcg/dL are harmful to children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Blackwell-White did not examine Liles, but instead reviewed his medical records, Dr. Kraft's report, and other associated records. She opined that, \"within a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\" Liles \"was exposed to sustained toxic blood lead levels at an early age.... [and] [h]is documented period of toxicity was at least 12 months.\" Liles \"incurred brain impairment as a result of his early lead toxicity....\" This impairment included, but was not limited to, a loss of cognitive function. Dr. Blackwell-White also opined that Liles lost 4 IQ points \"as a result of early lead toxicity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Blackwell-White relied extensively on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Science Assessment for Lead (\"EPA-ISA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She explained that the EPA-ISA found causal relationships between lead exposure and attention problems in children, as well as issues with hyperactivity and impulse control. Dr. Blackwell-White relied on other studies, chiefly one by Dr. Bruce Lanphear, (\"Lanphear\n   Study\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   showing a causal relationship between lead exposure in childhood and the loss of IQ points. We shall examine the conclusions of both the EPA-ISA and the Lanphear Study in more detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Dr. Blackwell-White offered her opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that, Liles \"suffered brain damage as a result of his early lead exposure.\" She also testified that the cognitive deficits Dr. Kraft described were caused by Liles's early lead exposure. She explained that injuries suffered from lead exposure are permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When asked on cross-examination whether the EPA-ISA set forth a causal relationship between elevated BLLs and the specific attention deficits Dr. Kraft identified, Dr. Blackwell-White answered that the EPA-ISA speaks only to attention \"generally.\" She concluded that the attention problems identified by Dr. Kraft fell under the umbrella term \"attention\" as used in the EPA-ISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mark Lieberman\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court accepted Mark Lieberman as an expert in vocational rehabilitation counseling. Lieberman explained that\n   a vocational rehabilitation expert assesses how an individual's physical, cognitive, or psychiatric disability will affect the individual's ability to learn new skills and function in the job market. In evaluating Liles, Lieberman met with him, reviewed Dr. Kraft's report, and Liles's medical and educational records. With this information he then applied the RAPEL methodology to evaluate Liles's employment capacity. Lieberman explained that each letter in \"RAPEL\" stands for a separate stage of the vocational rehabilitation analysis. We have paraphrased his description below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 R =\n   <strong>\n    R\n   </strong>\n   ehabilitation plan. This assesses the responsibilities of the rehabilitation counselor, the client time\n   frames, and the expenses of rehabilitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 A =\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   ccess to labor market. What type of job can the client acquire?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 P =\n   <strong>\n    P\n   </strong>\n   laceability. Who will hire the client and why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 E =\n   <strong>\n    E\n   </strong>\n   arning capacity. How much can the client earn in his current condition and how much could they have earned prior to the disability?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 L =\n   <strong>\n    L\n   </strong>\n   abor force participation. What is known about persons with the specific type of limitations that the client presents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Relying on the report from Dr. Kraft, Lieberman concluded that Liles suffered from major cognitive problems, including problems with attention. He recognized that Liles has difficulty with auditory encoding and information processing speed. He explained that these issues \"affect[ ] your ability to learn when you're sitting, listening to a lecture.\" He said this was \"[b]ecause you [need] to hear the information, quickly process it based on other stuff you know, and put everything together to understand the new concept that's being presented.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lieberman also administered the Career Ability Placement Survey (\"CAPS\"), which he described as an \"eight[-]part test,\" for \"mechanical reasoning, spatial relations, verbal reasoning, ... math, ... grammar, [and] word knowledge.\" Liles scored below average on some aspects of the test, particularly reading and math. Although Lieberman explained that Liles had the skills of a high school graduate, he anticipated that difficulties would arise for Liles once he started college. Lieberman stated that Liles \"has the IQ potential and basic academics to be ... at least an Associate['s] degree graduate.\" He also opined that Liles would be unable to attain that degree:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   It's his ability to function in the college setting as the work gets more difficult. It's my expectation, I see [Liles] as going to college, being able to pass some classes, but eventually hitting that brick wall-the point where he's not going to be able to get the Associate['s] degree.... And what we see here is that [Liles is] going to get up to the level of an individual with a high school diploma and some college, but won't eventually reach the earnings of an individual with at least an Associate['s] degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Michael Conte, Ph.D.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Liles next offered Dr. Michael Conte as an expert in economics. Dr. Conte explained the concept of loss of earning capacity, which he described as the difference between \"how much you probably would have earned absent a certain impediment or insult versus how much you're likely to earn now.\" To understand an\n   individual's prospects in the labor market, Dr. Conte typically relies on an evaluation from a vocational rehabilitation expert. Here, he relied on Lieberman's conclusions regarding Liles's likely outcomes without his disability, and his likely outcome with the disability. In addition to reviewing Lieberman's report, Dr. Conte spoke with Lieberman regarding what Liles could have accomplished without his current deficits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To reach a conclusion on earnings, Dr. Conte factored in assumptions including sex, educational attainment, and work-life expectancy. In Liles's case, Dr. Conte assumed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Liles suffers from a cognitive disability, and ... on the basis of Lieberman's opinions, that he would not most likely have been able to compete in the labor market as an Associate's degree holder, absent the severity of his current deficits. [A]t this point in time however, he manages to proceed in the course of obtaining additional educational credits, that when he decides to enter the competitive labor market, he will most likely be able to compete at the level of a high school graduate with some college.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Conte then offered an opinion as to Liles's lost earning capacity. He described this as the difference between the career earnings of someone with the educational attainment of an Associate's degree, $3,456,127 (Liles's likely earnings without any deficits) and the career earnings of someone with the educational attainment of a high school diploma and some college, $1,757,320 (Liles's likely earnings with deficits). This difference, $1,698,808,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   represents the sustained loss of earnings resulting from Liles's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sugarman also called expert witnesses: (1) David Nelson, MD; (2) Scott Beveridge, Ph.D.; (3) Jack Spector, MD;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) Jerome Paige, Ph.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     David Nelson, MD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dr. David Nelson was accepted as an expert in pediatrics, epidemiology, and childhood lead exposure. Like Dr. Blackwell-White, Dr. Nelson did not examine Liles but reviewed his medical records, education records, and relied upon Dr. Kraft's neuropsychological testing. Dr. Nelson testified that, based on his review of the epidemiological literature, he would not expect a BLL of 10 mcg/dL or even 15 mcg/dL to be\n   significant in terms of causing brain impairment. Rather, he opined that he would expect a BLL of 20 mcg/dL or above to have a significant effect. Dr. Nelson also testified that Liles's educational records did not indicate any difficulty due to cognitive impairment. Instead, Dr.\n   Nelson attributed Liles's educational difficulties to severe anxiety from the loss of several family members while in the fifth grade and Liles's broken thumb in high school. Dr. Nelson offered his expert opinion that, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Liles's lead exposure did not cause him any issues at all, that Liles does not suffer any cognitive damage from any cause, and that even if Liles had never been exposed to lead, he would not be any better off than he is today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Scott Beveridge, Ph.D.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dr. Scott Beveridge was offered as an expert in forensic vocational rehabilitation counseling. Dr. Beveridge reviewed Liles's medical records, his educational records, and the reports from Dr. Kraft, Dr. Blackwell-White, and Lieberman. He also met with Liles just before his 18th birthday. Dr. Beveridge administered an IQ test that revealed a full-scale IQ of 96. Dr. Beveridge identified this IQ as in the \"average range.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Like Lieberman, Dr. Beveridge was asked to perform a vocational evaluation \"to determine if there was any impact on [Liles's] ability to work and maintain employment.\" Dr. Beveridge employed the PEEDS-RAPEL method of analysis, a method that differs from the RAPEL method employed by Lieberman. Dr. Beveridge testified that the PEEDS-RAPEL method also accounts for parental history and educational attainment when considering the likely outcome of an evaluated individual. Based on this evaluation, Dr. Beveridge testified that Liles has the capacity to complete an Associate's degree. Dr. Beveridge explained that Liles had expressed an interest in going into the medical field and that he could likely pursue further education in nursing after obtaining an Associate's degree. He further opined that Liles could work as a nurse throughout his normal life, and that his educational and vocational\n   capacity was the same as it was before his lead exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions for Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the conclusion of Liles's case in chief, Sugarman moved for judgment. Sugarman argued that Liles had not proven that his elevated lead levels caused any injury, and that he had not proven the existence of any damages beyond mere speculation. Regarding causation, Sugarman pointed to Dr. Blackwell-White's testimony and argued that her opinion rested solely on epidemiological literature \"without any identification of measurement for the individual to support her opinions that there has been cognitive loss caused by lead exposure.\" Sugarman also argued that Liles had not sufficiently proven that, but for his cognitive difficulties, he would have obtained a college degree. The trial court concluded that there was enough evidence for the issues to go to the jury and denied Sugarman's motion. At the conclusion of all the evidence, Sugarman again moved for judgment and raised the same arguments. Once again, the trial court deemed the evidence sufficient for the jury's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The jury returned a verdict for Liles in the amount of $1,302,610 ($600,000 in non-economic damages and $702,610 in economic damages). Final judgment was entered in the amount of $1,277,610 after a reduction consistent with the statutory cap on non-economic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Sugarman filed a timely appeal and argued that Dr. Blackwell-White did not have a sufficient factual basis for her opinions regarding causation. Sugarman also contended that Liles had not sufficiently proven that his claimed injuries had resulted in any damages. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the final judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sugarman v.

Did Dr. Blackwell-White's causation opinion have a sufficient factual basis to establish a causal relationship between lead exposure and cognitive defects identified in Liles or his IQ loss?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   2. Was there sufficient evidence for the trial court to submit the case to the jury on the issue of whether Liles's lead exposure resulted in damages?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Sugarman moved for judgment on two occasions, at the end of the presentation of Liles's case in chief, and at the conclusion of the evidence. The trial court denied both motions and the case was ultimately submitted to the jury. \"A judge must grant a civil defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law if the plaintiff failed to present evidence that could persuade the jury of the elements of the tort\n   <strong>\n    by a preponderance of the evidence\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v.

Liles's full-scale IQ score was 94, which Dr. Kraft characterized as in the \"average range of intelligence ....\" Sugarman attempts to distinguish the cases above by pointing out that some plaintiffs had far lower IQs than Liles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/#p42\">\n    445 Md. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/#p42\">\n    124 A.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (full-scale IQ of 78) ;\n   <em>\n    Rochkind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767701,12487055\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/229/422/\">\n    229 Md.

The IQs in\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rochkind\n   </em>\n   were sufficient evidence of IQ loss because they were lower than would otherwise be expected. Sugarman asserts that Liles's IQ has not been shown to be lower than expected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Sugarman suggests that plaintiffs with average or higher IQs could also prove injury by demonstrating an IQ deficit through a \"neuropsychological evaluation that finds a statistically significant discrepancy between the IQ measure and other cognitive measures, such that the IQ measure, even though it is average, is lower than would otherwise be expected ....\" Sugarman has not offered any legal authority to support limiting proof of injury to these two methods. We decline to adopt such a restrictive approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Dr. Kraft and Dr. Blackwell-White testified about Liles's cognitive function, as\n   well as the specific deficits that Dr. Kraft identified. Dr. Kraft explained that he found a \"significant\" discrepancy in Liles's scores on the WAIS-IV test. Liles obtained a \"perceptual reasoning index score of 104.\" By contrast, on the \"two index scores that are most sensitive to attention and concentration, which are working memory and processing speed,\" Liles obtained a \"standard score of 86 on both of those measures.\" Dr. Kraft stated that those scores were \"statistically, significantly lower than his performance in perceptual reasoning.\" From this, he concluded that Liles had a mild brain impairment-deficits in auditory encoding and information processing speed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Dr. Kraft testified that despite Liles's average full-scale IQ, he could not rule out brain damage because of the discrepancy in Liles's scores. As Sugarman points out, Dr. Kraft acknowledged on cross-examination that he did not find \"deficits in IQ.\" But immediately following that, he stated that \"it's the\n   <strong>\n    pattern of the scores that suggest deficit\n   </strong>\n   to me.\" (Emphasis added). This acknowledgment might detract from, but does not obliterate, Dr. Kraft's opinion on brain impairment. When we place this testimony in context, we see that Dr. Kraft interpreted Liles's scores as indicative of cognitive injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Dr. Blackwell-White built on Dr. Kraft's testimony when offering her own specific causation opinion. She agreed that population studies do not necessarily mean that each individual child in the population could show a measurable effect from lead exposure, and that neuropsychological testing may not be able to measure some damage. She explained that while she believes that \"every child who's exposed to lead does lose IQ points.... [the] very specific psychological tests that are given to these children ... may or may not pick up the deficits that these children have.\" On cross-examination, Dr. Blackwell-White stated that, in her opinion, the results of Liles's neuropsychological testing demonstrated brain injury.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n   ]: Okay. Would you agree with me that you do not have the quantifiable evidence to say to a reasonable degree of medical probability that Mr. Liles'[s] lead exposure caused him to have academic difficulties?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Blackwell-White\n   </strong>\n   ]: Dr. Kraft, in his evaluation of Chauncey Liles, found a discrepancy between-among some of his IQ-some of his test results. He found a perceptual reasoning index of 104, which is solidly average. But he found a processing speed-but he found a processing speed index and a working memory index that were in the low average range, 86. I mean that's a significant difference. In my opinion, that is a quantifiable indicator of brain injury. Again, when there is a discrepancy between subtests of neuropsychological testing, that often indicates some brain deficit or some brain injury in very-in a very specific area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Although Dr. Blackwell-White offered broad opinions about lead-exposed plaintiffs and IQ loss, here, she also offered specific testimony that the results of Liles's IQ testing revealed brain injury and explained why Liles's specific deficits were more consistent with an injury than another cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Like the experts in\n   <em>\n    Levitas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Blackwell-White relied on Liles's documented BLLs, the results of his neuropsychological evaluation, and the Lanphear Study, to estimate a specific IQ point loss. She did not look only to his elevated BLLs, assume he had a cognitive defect, and then extrapolate\n   a point loss based on the Lanphear methodology. Rather, Dr. Blackwell-White relied on evidence that Liles-individually-had already manifested\n   cognitive deficits. This gave her enough reason to use her knowledge and expertise to extrapolate a loss of IQ points according to the methodology outlined in the Lanphear Study. Sugarman presented contradictory experts and extensively cross-examined Liles's experts about their conclusions. That is what we contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Levitas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Levitas\n   </em>\n   , 454 Md. at 254-55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489993,12314548\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/233/\">\n    164 A.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/#p42\">\n    445 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   51 n.16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/#p42\">\n    124 A.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Dr. Blackwell-White's testimony provided sufficient evidence for the jury to draw the inference that, more likely than not, Liles's elevated BLLs caused a measurable loss of IQ points. For that reason, the trial court appropriately denied Sugarman's motions and allowed the question to go to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    DAMAGES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Sugarman also contends that Liles did not put forth sufficient evidence to prove damages. Even if lead exposure caused Liles's injuries, Sugarman argues, Liles did not prove any damages beyond mere speculation. Sugarman focuses on the testimony of Lieberman, Liles's vocational rehabilitation expert, and argues that Lieberman \"expressly made no assessment of Mr. Liles's likely pre-injury (pre-lead exposure) educational and vocational capacity ....\" Rather, he avers, Lieberman should have employed a different methodology-the same methodology used by Sugarman's vocational rehabilitation expert-that takes into account parental benchmarks to measure a child's likely outcomes absent injury. Sugarman insists that Lieberman's opinion rested on the \"baseless\" assumption that without deficits, Liles would have obtained an Associate's degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Here, Liles offered evidence, in the form of Lieberman's testimony, that he will not earn an Associate's degree and that, without the deficits caused by his exposure to lead, he would have earned a degree. He then offered Dr. Conte who explained the difference in lifetime earnings between a person\n   with an Associate's degree and a person without an Associate's degree. Accordingly, Liles has attempted to show a loss in earning capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, he tried to prove that his lead exposure reduced the amount of money he will earn over his lifetime. A claim for lost earnings differs from that of lost wages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Evidence in [a] wage loss claim reflects loss of specific opportunities, such as those represented by an existing job. Proof typically shows past wage and future\n   prospects in the job, coupled with proof that the plaintiff can no longer work or can work only part time.... For example, evidence might show that the plaintiff was studying to become an engineer and because of his injury he could no longer master the materials, or general capacity for advancement which has been limited by the injury. In either kind of claim, the evidence must be sufficient to permit a\n   <strong>\n    reasonable estimate\n   </strong>\n   of the loss claimed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Dan B.

As in those cases, Lieberman's opinion was based on substantial material. He interviewed Liles, conducted additional vocational testing, and reviewed his educational and medical records. He also reviewed and relied upon the neuropsychological evaluation and conclusions of Dr. Kraft. Additionally, Lieberman relied on his years of experience as a vocational rehabilitation counselor during which he has helped thousands of students attend college. After reviewing this data, he concluded that Liles was not likely to receive a college degree due to the attention problems Dr. Kraft identified. He further proffered that, in his expert opinion, Liles would have been able to earn a college degree without his disabilities. Dr. Conte, the economics expert, then testified regarding the financial earnings of an individual with a college degree versus those of an individual without a college degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The combined information offered by Lieberman and Dr. Conte presented a detailed\n   and individualized analysis of Liles's employment prospects and future earnings. Unlike the plaintiffs in cases where the evidence has been deemed insufficient to prove damages, Liles set forth an individualized analysis of his likely outcome coupled with statistical data to assist the jury in quantifying his damages. Although an award for lost earning capacity is necessarily less certain than pecuniary damages in other contexts, we view Liles's evidence as similar to-if not stronger than-the evidence offered by the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Adams,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lewin Realty\n   </em>\n   .

If he had, the argument goes, Lieberman would have realized that neither of Liles's parents had earned a college degree. Sugarman contends that consideration of parental achievement would invalidate Lieberman's conclusion\n   that, absent injury, Liles would have earned a degree. Lieberman should have changed his conclusion that Liles would have otherwise earned a college degree merely because his parents did not finish college. Sugarman points to the fact that in both\n   <em>\n    Lewin Realty\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rochkind\n   </em>\n   , Lieberman considered parental achievement when assessing the plaintiffs' likely outcomes with and without injury. Although the Court of Special Appeals approved of such parental consideration in\n   <em>\n    Lewin Realty\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rochkind\n   </em>\n   , we do not view those cases as mandating a\n   <strong>\n    requirement\n   </strong>\n   that a vocational expert must consider parental achievement when offering an opinion as to a plaintiff's pre-injury outcome. Sugarman offers no authority for such a requirement. Accordingly, we conclude that Liles set forth sufficient evidence of damages in the form of loss of earning capacity and the trial court correctly submitted the issue to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Unlike the expert's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Rochkind\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Blackwell-White's testimony regarding the causation of Liles's attention problems did not suffer from an \"analytical gap.\" Her review of the epidemiological literature, coupled with an analysis of Liles specifically, supported her conclusion that Liles's elevated BLLs caused his IQ loss.

The EPA-ISA finds that the numerous epidemiologic studies are \"sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between [lead] exposure and effects on attention\" and \"attention decrements.\" U.S. Envtl. Protection Agency, Integrated Science Assessment for Lead (\"EPA-ISA\"), EPA/600/R-10/075F (June 2013), https://perma.cc/5ZRA-W54H at 4-294, 4-289. As to what the study means by \"attention,\" the EPA-ISA only states that \"[a]ttention is the ability to maintain a consistent focus on an activity or relevant stimuli and can be assessed by examining sustained\n   attention, concentration, or distractibility.\" EPA-ISA\n   at 4-153. However, the study does not specifically list which attention decrements the individual epidemiological studies assessed; in other words, the EPA-ISA never identifies auditory encoding and processing speed as two types of \"attention decrements\" caused by lead exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Prior to Dr. Blackwell-White's testimony, Liles offered Dr. Kraft as an expert in psychology and neuropsychology. Dr. Kraft testified that he looked at Liles's \"performance on the two index scores that are most sensitive to attention and concentration, which are working memory and processing speed.\" Dr. Kraft explained that the results of Liles's performance \"suggest[ ] to [him] that [Liles] has a mild impairment with respect to auditory encoding of information in the working memory, and information processing speed. Both of those are factors of attention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Liles subsequently offered Dr. Blackwell-White as an expert in pediatrics and childhood lead poisoning. Dr. Blackwell-White testified that she relied, in part, on the EPA-ISA study, which concluded that lead exposure can cause attention problems. In addition, Dr. Blackwell-White noted that Dr. Kraft \"associated\" auditory encoding and processing speed \"to measures of attention.\" Dr. Blackwell-White provided only the following testimony to link the factors of attention identified by Dr. Kraft to the EPA-ISA: \"Not only the EPA, but a good much of the lead literature involving children speaks to attention. They don't parse it out as to what kind of attention. They are using the umbrella term 'attention.'\n   <strong>\n    And so it is my opinion that the deficits that Dr. Kraft found are part of that umbrella term, 'attention.'\n   </strong>\n   \" (Emphasis added). Therefore, Dr. Blackwell-White testified that it was her opinion that deficits to auditory encoding of information and information processing speed were two attention decrements that the EPA-ISA study considered when it concluded that lead exposure is causally related to attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In my view, there was insufficient information bridging the \"analytical gap\" between the attention decrements that the EPA-ISA study found to be caused by lead exposure and the\n   specific \"factors of attention\" of auditory encoding and processing speed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rochkind\n   </em>\n   , 454 Md. at 291,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489994,12314571\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/277/\">\n    164 A.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only evidence that the jury heard connecting the \"attention decrements\" in the study to the two specific cognitive deficits from which Liles suffered was Dr. Blackwell-White's singular statement that it is her opinion that auditory encoding and processing speed are part of the umbrella term \"attention\" as used in the EPA-ISA. This type of unfounded statement was exactly what the Supreme Court cautioned against in\n   <em>\n    Joiner\n   </em>\n   : \"Trained experts commonly extrapolate from existing data.\n   <strong>\n    But nothing ... requires a [ ] court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the\n    <em>\n     ipse dixit\n    </em>\n    of the expert\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/\">\n    522 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Respectfully, I believe that Dr. Blackwell-White's reliance on the EPA-ISA study along with her unsupported statement that Liles' cognitive deficits fall under the attention decrements identified in the study do not provide a sufficient factual basis to offer an expert opinion as to general causation.
