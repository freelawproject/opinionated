As originally enacted, Megan's Law presumed they would be subject to lifetime registration; subsection (f) provided conditional relief contingent not only upon G.H.'s and G.A.'s own conduct, but also upon their ability to persuade a judge they no longer posed a threat to public safety. More importantly, \"[t]here can be no vested right in the continued existence of a statute ... which precludes its change or repeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706939\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/128/608/#p617\">\n    128 N.J. at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"707193,706939\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/608/895/\">\n    608 A.2d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   However, at the time of their guilty pleas, appellants could reasonably\n   rely upon the possibility of relief from lifetime registration. The retroactive application of subsection (g) does not modify a remedy but eliminates an incentive integral to Megan's Law remedial purpose by denying certain registrants any relief from the obligations inherent in lifetime registration, along with the attendant opprobrium and potential criminal liability. Weighing that against the public's interest in the safety of the community, which was adequately served by subsection (f) prior to the passage of subsection (g), we conclude retroactive application of subsection (g) to G.H. and G.A. would be manifestly unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Lastly, we asked the parties to address whether according appellants relief in these appeals would affect New Jersey's compliance with SORNA.

Sex offenders may apply to the court to be removed from the sex offender registry if they committed only one offense, have not committed another offense for 15 years, and prove that they are not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others. Juveniles may also apply to the court to be removed from the sex offender registry if they were under the age of 14 at the time of their offense but are now over the age of 18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Because New Jersey uses a discretionary process to determine higher frequency of registration reporting\n   <em>\n    and allows a broader class of registrants than SORNA prescribes to petition for removal, New Jersey does not meet the SORNA requirements of this section\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Thus, contrary to the State's assertion, it appears that subsection (f), permitting a broad range of registrants relief from registration, is a fundamental reason why New Jersey is not complying with SORNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In any event, whether the retroactive application of subsection (g) would further delay compliance with SORNA is not properly before us, having never been raised in the trial courts.
