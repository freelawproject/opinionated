She argues the settlement was improperly approved on her behalf by a guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We hold that under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(a)(4), a trial court may appoint a GAL if there is good cause to believe that a party lacks the mental capacity needed to participate in the litigation. We also hold that, based upon the GAL's investigation or other information, the court may give the GAL the power to make decision(s) needed in the case, including the decision to try or settle the case, if it finds clear and convincing evidence that the party is mentally incapable of making the decision(s). Because the trial court properly found\n   that plaintiff lacked the mental capacity to decide whether to try or settle the case, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleged as follows. On March 11, 2008, she was a business invitee on the premises at 1515 Broad Street in Bloomfield. When exiting the building, she was struck on the head by a falling object and sustained severe and traumatic injuries. As a result, she suffered and continued to suffer great pain and anguish, confinement, and incapacitation for her usual course of conduct and employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff, represented by trial counsel, filed a complaint alleging negligence by defendants 1515 Broad Street, LLC (1515 Broad), The Walsh Company, LLC (Walsh), and County Glass &amp; Metal Installers, Inc. (County Glass). County Glass filed a third-party complaint against Virginia Glass Products Corp. (Virginia Glass) and Idesco Corp. (Idesco). Plaintiff amended her complaint to add Virginia Glass and Idesco as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A Law Division judge denied Idesco's motion for summary judgment, and its motion for reconsideration. We denied its motion for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judge dismissed plaintiff's claims against Virginia Glass. The remaining defendants filed a joint offer of judgment for $475,000. They gave plaintiff until ten days before trial to accept, or they would seek costs and fees under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:58-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the trial date approached, plaintiff's trial counsel filed a motion and certification seeking the appointment of a GAL for plaintiff. On September 27, 2013, the trial court entered an order appointing Frederick D. Miceli, Esq. as GAL, and staying the trial pending the GAL's review of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 17, 2014, the GAL issued his report. In light of the findings in the GAL's report, the trial court's April 22, 2014 order ruled the GAL should remain, and \"empowered and entrusted [the\n   GAL] with any and all decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of this case, whether by trial or settlement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At a July 1, 2014 hearing, plaintiff's trial counsel, the GAL, and defendants reported they had arrived at a $625,000 settlement. The trial court approved the settlement as fair, reasonable, and in plaintiff's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff appeals, represented by new counsel. Idesco filed a contingent cross-appeal of the denial of summary judgment and reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first issue is what rule governs the appointment of a GAL under these circumstances. Plaintiff's counsel moved for appointment of a GAL, invoking\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(b)(3). However,\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(b)(3) applies after a default or in a summary action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   On motion by a party to the action, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor or alleged mentally incapacitated person if no petition has been filed [under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(b)(2) ] and either default has been entered by the clerk or, in a summary action brought pursuant to\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:67 or in a probate action, 10 days have elapsed after service of the order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Neither circumstance was present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nonetheless, plaintiff's counsel could properly bring concerns to the trial court's attention. The Rules of Professional Conduct (\n   <em>\n    RPC\n   </em>\n   ) permitted plaintiff's counsel to seek appointment of a GAL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.R.\n   </em>\n   , 135 N.J. at 175, 178,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304582\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/135/155/\">\n    638 A.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    RPC\n   </em>\n   1.14 addresses \"[w]hen a client's capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with the representation is diminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment or for some other reason.\"\n   <em>\n    RPC\n   </em>\n   1.14(a). It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity\n   </em>\n   , is at risk of substantial physical, financial or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client's own interest,\n   <em>\n    the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action, including\n   </em>\n   consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases,\n   <em>\n    seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem\n   </em>\n   , conservator, or guardian.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    RPC\n   </em>\n   1.14(b) (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    RPC\n   </em>\n   1.14 uses the phrase \"diminished capacity,\" plaintiff is incorrect in arguing that phrase may not be used in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court granted the motion without specifying the subsection it relied upon. The court later ordered the GAL to remain pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(b)(4), which provides that a \"court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor or alleged mentally incapacitated person on its own motion.\" Because the court ultimately ruled on its own motion under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(b)(4), we examine the propriety of its action under that subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, plaintiff contends that the trial court had to follow the procedures in\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:86 before it could hold she lacked the capacity to handle her own affairs. Thus, she essentially challenges whether the GAL was properly appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff misapprehends the differences between appointment of a guardian of the person or property, versus appointment of a GAL. Those differing appointments are governed by different rules, which themselves recognize the distinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:26-2(a) (permitting the appointment of a GAL if no \"guardian of either the person or the property\" has not been appointed);\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:86-4(d) (allowing the appointment of a GAL to assist in the litigation for appointment of a guardian for person or property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The appointment of a guardian over the person or property of an incapacitated person is governed by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:86 (formerly\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:83) and N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24 to -35. Appointment of a general guardian under that rule gives the general guardian the authority to \"exercise all the rights and powers of the incapacitated person\" over their person, property, or both. N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24.1(a). It also gives the general guardian \"all of the powers conferred upon\n   the guardian by law and the provisions of this chapter.\" N.J.S.A. 3B:12-48. Those may include: title in the person's property; control over expenditures for the person; custody of the person; power over the person's property, place of abode, care, and medical care; and the ability to seek the person's admission to a psychiatric facility.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 3B:12-38, -43, -56(d), -57(f), -59. The authority of the guardian lasts until the person's death unless the guardian is removed or the person is restored to competency. N.J.S.A. 3B:12-64.\n   Because the appointment of such a general guardian has the effect \"to restrain an allegedly incompetent person of his liberty or deprive him of the control of his property and the management of his personal affairs, '[s]uch an adjudication must be sought in a constitutional manner in a proceeding instituted for that purpose.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re S.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874934\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/158/22/#p26\">\n    158 N.J.

Crain, plaintiff's psychiatrist who performed a neuropsychiatric evaluation. Dr. Crain found the accident caused \"cognitive decline, complicated by the onset of depression.\" That resulted in her having impaired focus and difficulties with comprehending, retention, and keeping up with verbal information, as well as being \"severely impaired emotionally and physically.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Counsel's certification also attached the report of Dr. Paula P. Reid, plaintiff's treating psychologist who performed a neuropsychological evaluation. Dr. Reid found \"[a] significant reduction in the predicted intellectual performance on verbal comprehension and processing speed,\" with \"cognitive impairment\" affecting her ability to pay attention and understand complex material, and significant depression which could affect her ability to think clearly. Additionally, counsel's certification attached a more recent neuropsychological\n   report confirming plaintiff's attentional deficits and difficulty in integrating complex materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel certified that defendants had retained numerous experts who refuted plaintiff's theory that the accident caused injury, and who concluded any difficulties plaintiff was experiencing were not related to the accident. Plaintiff's counsel certified that counsel had explained the $475,000 offer of judgment, but that \"[w]e have grave doubts that [plaintiff] is able to fully grasp\n   and understand the offer itself and/or the potential financial consequences of refusing the Offer of Judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel subsequently provided a new report from Dr. Crain. After a two-hour psychiatric examination of plaintiff on September 13, 2013, Dr. Crain concluded plaintiff had \"a diminished capacity to fully consider the risks of her decision making in regard with how to proceed with the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Counsel's certification and supporting psychiatric and psychological reports provided good cause for the trial court's September 27, 2013 order to appoint a GAL to investigate plaintiff's mental capacity and report to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The GAL's subsequent investigation provided clear and convincing evidence that plaintiff was mentally incapable of deciding whether to try or settle the case. The GAL reviewed extensive case materials, including the reports of the treating physicians and experts on both sides, and the depositions of plaintiff, fact witnesses, and others. The GAL conducted two interviews with plaintiff in the presence of her trial counsel. The GAL researched the applicable law. On March 17, 2014, the GAL issued his report, which stated as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff contended she sustained a traumatic brain injury, and had elevated cerebrospinal fluid, intracranial hypertension, and major depressive disorder. She made over 500 visits to health care providers, was still receiving speech and cognitive therapy, was taking several prescription medications daily, and was awarded permanent disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. The GAL cited the psychiatric reports from Dr. Crain that plaintiff had diminished capacity to consider the risks of litigation,\n   and the psychological reports from Dr. Reid and others who had found a significant reduction in plaintiff's intellectual performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The GAL noted Dr. Reid had engaged counsel and refused to testify on plaintiff's behalf. In her interviews with the GAL, plaintiff could not accept that Dr. Reid would not testify. She could not understand the types of proofs her case required from medical experts. After the second interview, it remained unclear that plaintiff understood what was being explained by the GAL and her trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The GAL found plaintiff still refused to accept the doctors who would be testifying, despite an explanation of the discovery rules, the deadlines involved, and the court's orders barring plaintiff from submitting additional experts. The GAL concluded plaintiff did not \"have sufficient mental capacity\" either to have \"the requisite\n   understanding and ability\" to make \"an informed and a rational decision regarding her case,\" or to overcome her \"intransigent unwillingness to confront the realities of her case.\" The GAL recommended that he should be entrusted with the decision whether to try or settle the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Subsequently, plaintiff had a phone conversation with the GAL asking that he speak to Dr. Reid in another attempt to get her to testify, which proved futile. On June 17, 2014, the GAL issued a supplemental report stating plaintiff continued to exhibit an inability to accept who would provide expert testimony for her, or understand the factors necessary to weigh the risks and make a decision. The GAL reiterated his conclusion that due to plaintiff's diminished capacity, she \"was incapable of making an informed, rational and prudent decision regarding her case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A party \"may be incompetent because [s]he lacks the ability to understand the information conveyed, to evaluate the options, or to communicate a decision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295411\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/98/321/#p381\">\n    98 N.J. at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201209\">\n    486 A.2d 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
