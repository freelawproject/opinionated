Koskoff and the law firm of Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder, P.C.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered, after a jury trial, in favor of the plaintiff, Sylvia N. Kuehl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To summarize, this protracted litigation concerns the plaintiff's contention that the defendants breached the duty of care they owed her during their representation of her in an underlying personal injury action involving her late husband, Guenther Kuehl (decedent), when the defendants failed to file a claim for survivor's benefits under our Workers' Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., within a year of his death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff failed to prove the proximate cause element of a negligence cause of action because she failed to present expert testimony that, more likely than not, she would have been awarded survivor's benefits under the act if the defendants had submitted her claim. On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion for a directed verdict, motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and motion to set aside the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the issue on appeal. The events giving rise to this case began on the morning of June 26, 1991, when a squirrel darted across a street in Greenwich causing a motorist to swerve and collide with the motor vehicle operated by the decedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later in the day, the decedent went to an emergency room and was diagnosed with a cervical strain. At the time, the decedent was the president and owner of Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc. (Z-Loda).\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913376\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/525/#p527\">\n    265 Conn. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%20818\">\n    829 A.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). The decedent believed that he had been injured in the course of his employment because, at the time of the collision, he was driving from his Greenwich home, where he had an office in addition to his office at Z-Loda, to a business appointment in Tarrytown, New York. On August 3, 1991, the decedent suffered an aortic dissection that was surgically repaired. The plaintiff and the decedent believed that his aortic dissection was a result of the injuries the decedent suffered in the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 24, 1991, the decedent and the plaintiff each signed a retainer agreement with the firm for their\n   respective claims arising out of the collision. The plaintiff's retainer agreement stated that the firm was retained \"to pursue and if warranted to prosecute a claim or claims against any party or parties arising out of the following: Accident to my husband on 6/26/91 in Greenwich, CT.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Koskoff was the firm's attorney who assumed responsibility for the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 16, 1991, the decedent, on his own behalf, filed a notice of claim for workers' compensation benefits (compensation claim).\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913376\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/525/#p527\">\n    265 Conn. at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%20818\">\n    829 A.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On August 31, 1998, the Workers' Compensation Commissioner (commissioner) held a hearing on the plaintiff's claim to determine whether she should be precluded from pursuing a claim for survivor's benefits due to the fact that she had not filed a formal notice of her claim within the statute of limitations pursuant to \u00a7 31-294c(a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%20818\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; i.e., one year from the date of the decedent's death.

See\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Travelers Cos.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343748\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/800/#p806\">\n    299 Conn. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20852\">\n    12 A.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The plaintiff alleged two counts: negligence or legal malpractice and breach of contract. Following the plaintiff's death, Clifford A. Mollo was appointed executor of her estate and substituted as the party plaintiff in the present action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The operative complaint was filed on May 1, 2014, during trial. It alleged in relevant part that the defendant was an attorney admitted to practice law in Connecticut and was employed by the firm. The plaintiff alleged that the decedent sustained personal injuries in the collision and that the tortfeasors had more than $3 million of insurance coverage. In addition, prior to the collision, Z-Loda had purchased workers' compensation coverage from Travelers that was available to compensate the decedent and the plaintiff for their losses. The plaintiff further alleged that she had retained Koskoff to prosecute \"a claim or claims against any party or parties arising out of [the decedent's]\" collision of June 26,\n   1991, and that the defendants accepted the employment and provided \"legal representation to the plaintiff,\" which was continuous from October 19, 1991, until October 1, 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The operative complaint also alleged that the defendants commenced a personal injury action against the tortfeasors on behalf of the decedent and the plaintiff on November 1, 1992. The plaintiff as executrix of the decedent's estate was substituted as the plaintiff after the decedent died. The plaintiff alleged that \"Koskoff, in the exercise of the skills ordinarily expected of attorneys in the community practicing law under the same or similar circumstances, knew or reasonably should have known\" that under the act, the plaintiff was entitled to file a claim for survivor's benefits; that the time for filing a written notice of claim for survivor's benefits was one year from the date of the decedent's death; and that the failure to file a written claim for survivor's benefits on or before November 14, 1993, would bar the plaintiff from receiving survivor's benefits under the act. The plaintiff also alleged that the value of her claim for survivor's benefits was in excess of $1 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff alleged that Koskoff was negligent in multiple ways but principally in that she failed to file a written notice of claim for survivor's benefits within one year of the decedent's death, failed to pursue benefits for the plaintiff when she knew or reasonably should have known that the plaintiff was entitled to them, and failed to advise the plaintiff that she had to file a notice of claim. In addition, she alleged that the defendants' negligent acts constituted legal malpractice that was a substantial factor in proximately causing her damages. On May 5, 2014, the defendants filed an answer and special defense to the amended complaint, in which they denied its material allegations and pleaded the special defense of comparative negligence on the basis of the plaintiff's alleged negligence in failing to consult\n   with other counsel for the purposes of filing for benefits under the act as she had been advised to do, and failure to retain counsel for that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties tried the case to a jury in April and May, 2014. The evidence relevant to the determinative issue in this appeal concerns the expert testimony the plaintiff presented as to the prevailing standard in the legal community, whether Koskoff had breached that standard of care when representing the plaintiff, and whether the alleged breach proximately caused the plaintiff's alleged losses and damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's expert witness\n   was Thomas Willcutts, an attorney who practices in the areas of personal injury and workers' compensation law. The defendants contend that he did not offer expert testimony as to the prevailing standard of professional care, but instead testified only about his personal preferences, and that he did not offer expert testimony that the defendants' negligence proximately caused the plaintiff's alleged losses and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Willcutts testified in part that Koskoff \"does not know workers' comp. She knows some of it, but she would not consider herself someone who would handle a workers' compensation matter, which is okay. You can handle the personal injury side of the case and not the workers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   compensation case. So that in itself I don't see as a problem. So I am judging her not as a workers' compensation lawyer and what a workers' compensation [lawyer] should know and should do, but my opinion is based on her being a personal injury lawyer who takes the position that she doesn't know workers' comp., but is handling a case that involves workers' comp.... Well, lawyers can make mistakes and they don't necessarily cause any harm. Part of my opinion is based upon the information in terms of what I expect would occur in this case had it been handled the way I believe it should have been handled.\" Although Willcutts testified at length about Koskoff's alleged mistakes in handling the plaintiff's claim, he did not testify that her alleged breach of the standard of care proximately caused the plaintiff's alleged losses and damages, that is that the plaintiff would have received survivor's benefits if Koskoff had submitted a claim for such benefits or if she had referred the matter to a lawyer who specializes in workers' compensation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case-in-chief, the defendants moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to produce expert testimony to establish that she likely would have prevailed on her claim for survivor's benefits because the complexities of workers' compensation law are not common knowledge to the jurors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants argued that because\n   the plaintiff claimed that her damages flowed from the loss of her right to pursue survivor's benefits under the act, she needed to present a legal expert to testify that she more than likely would have been awarded survivor's benefits if she had submitted a claim. Such an action is proved by presenting what is known as a case-within-a-case. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Grimm\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174219\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/322/#p352\">\n    303 Conn. 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20A.3d%20205\">\n    33 A.3d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring). The plaintiff faced a difficult challenge in proving causation, in that Z-Loda and Travelers had contested the claim that the self-represented\n   decedent filed on the grounds that the injuries he sustained in the collision did not arise in the course of his employment and that his aortic dissection and ensuing death were not proximately caused by the collision. The court denied the defendants' motion for a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The case and certain interrogatories were submitted to the jury on May 13, 2014. The jury found, pursuant to its answers to interrogatories, that the defendants departed from the standard of care that they owed the plaintiff and the departure proximately caused the financial harm that the plaintiff sustained. The jury also found that the defendants had proved that the plaintiff's negligence in failing to follow their advice to consult with an experienced workers' compensation attorney was a proximate cause of the financial harm that she sustained. The jury apportioned 85 percent of the negligence to the defendants and 15 percent of it to the plaintiff. The jury found that the plaintiff's damages were $1.1 million, but reduced that sum by 15 percent to $935,000, due to the plaintiff's comparative negligence, in awarding the plaintiff damages on her legal malpractice claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thereafter the defendants moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to set aside the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 21, 2014, they filed a memorandum of law in support of their postjudgment motions. In their memorandum of law, the defendants cited numerous cases for the proposition that a plaintiff must present expert testimony in a legal malpractice action that the defendant's breach of the standard of care proximately caused the plaintiff's alleged losses and damages.

Long before most of the issues in this case had developed, [the decedent] had died. The real workers' compensation issue became not so much the claim that he might have been able to pursue, but rather the [survivor's] benefits which [the plaintiff] might have received, had workers' compensation issues been pursued properly/diligently. That however entails its own trial within a trial element-in order for [the plaintiff] to have had a right to survivor's benefits, [there] first would have to be proof that the injury to [the decedent] was a compensable claim under workers' compensation. In other words, the viability of the survivor's benefit claim was contingent upon the viability of the underlying claim of [the decedent].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court summarized the issue presented by the defendants' postverdict motions as follows: \"[The] defendants claim that there was a need for expert testimony as to the likely outcome, had the initial claim by [the decedent], and the later [survivor's] claim of [the plaintiff], been properly and timely submitted to the administrative process of workers' compensation-what would a commissioner have done? The court does not believe that [the] defendants have submitted adequate authority for such a requirement; they have not adequately refuted the suggestion ... of [the] plaintiff that that would be asking for an opinion as to an ultimate issue for the jury to decide.\" The court concluded that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendants had breached a duty to take care of all legal\n   matters arising from the collision. It also concluded that there was adequate, if not overwhelming, evidence that the requirements to establish a valid workers' compensation claim by the decedent existed and that it would have been successful if timely filed, which in turn would have led to the awarding of survivor's benefits to the plaintiff if her claim had been submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In other words, the court was of the opinion that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to permit the jury to infer that there was a causal link between the collision and the decedent's injuries. It found that the medical evidence, if considered as presenting a chain of interrelated elements, established a causal connection between the collision and the condition that eventually led to the decedent's death. It found that when they prosecuted the personal injury action, the defendants argued that there was evidence of \"medical linkage\" between the collision and the decedent's aortic dissection. The court therefore concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the decedent's injury was compensable under the act. In summary, the court believed that \"there was adequate evidence presented that would allow a jury to infer that there was a causative link between the injury-causing [collision] and the eventual death of [the decedent]. The appropriate standards were presented through an expert [Willcutts]. There was evidence and discussion of the evidence relating to the employment nexus, including records created by [the] defendants. Again, the court must return to the refrain that even weak evidence, and evidence that must be stitched together, can be sufficient to support a jury verdict.\" For these and other reasons, the court denied the defendants' postverdict motions and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The essence of the defendants' claims on appeal concerns legal malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Malpractice is commonly\n   defined as the failure of one rendering professional services to exercise that degree of skill and learning commonly applied under all the circumstances in the community by the average prudent reputable member of the profession with the result of injury, loss, or damage to the recipient of those services ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Updike, Kelly &amp; Spellacy, P.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beckett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458349\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/613/#p649\">\n    269 Conn. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20145\">\n    850 A.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

We carefully have reviewed his testimony as to how he handles workers' compensation cases. He testified that litigating a personal injury case is different from litigating a workers' compensation case. He also testified that Koskoff was a personal injury lawyer, not a workers' compensation lawyer. He identified the decedent's report of the collision that should have put Koskoff on notice of a compensation claim and opined that she should have filed a claim. Nowhere in his testimony, however, did he testify that her failure to do so was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries and loss. At no time did he testify that the plaintiff would have prevailed on the issues related to the case-within-a-case, namely whether the collision occurred during the course of the decedent's employment and the collision was a proximate cause of his death, in the face of Z-Loda and Travelers filing notice that they intended to contest the decedent's claim for benefits. Z-Loda and Travelers contested the decedent's claim on the grounds that the collision did not occur in the course of his employment and that his injuries and death were not proximately caused by the collision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to whether the collision occurred during the course of the decedent's employment, Willcutts mentioned the coming and going rule that applies to an employee's commute\n   to his place of employment or start of the work day, but he did not opine that had Koskoff filed a compensation claim the plaintiff more likely than not would have received survivor's benefits. This omission was especially critical in light of the fact that Z-Loda and Travelers were contesting the decedent's claim for workers' compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In denying the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the court found that \"[the] plaintiff produced at least the minimum evidence needed to present the case to the jury, which in turn was at least the minimum evidence needed to support a possible verdict in favor of [the] plaintiff.\" The court also found that \"the evidence was not overwhelming and may have had to be pieced or stitched together, but that is not an issue to be addressed by way of motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or motion to set aside the verdict.\" It concluded that the jury could discern whether the collision occurred during the course of the decedent's employment and that his death was the result of the collision. In coming to that conclusion, the court found applicable the law related to proximate cause in a personal injury action. It did not, however, address the statutory and regulatory rules related to workers' compensation claims, in particular the coming and going rule that controls whether an injury that was sustained during an employee's commute\n   arose in the course of employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   It can hardly be said that the statutes and regulations regarding workers' compensation are within the ken of the jury. It is for that reason that expert testimony is needed to prove causation in a legal malpractice action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"It is well settled that, because the purpose of the act is to compensate employees for injuries without\n   fault by imposing a form of strict liability on employers, to recover for an injury under the act a plaintiff must prove that the injury is causally connected to the employment.

All of [the expert's] responses to the hypothetical questions asked of him with respect to the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' alleged damages were based on his personal belief, as opposed to the standard of care, and were conditional or speculative. As we noted in discussing the standard of review applicable to challenges to directed verdicts, a trial court should direct a verdict in the defendants' favor where there is insufficient evidence to support a verdict favorable to the plaintiffs.\" (Footnote omitted.)

Our review of Willcutts' testimony reveals that he opined that the defendants violated the standard of care and deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity to submit a claim for survivor's benefits. He, however, did not opine that, if the plaintiff had submitted a claim, she more likely than not would have prevailed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
