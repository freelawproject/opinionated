Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14 (g) affidavit, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   ORDERED that respondent's motion for leave to file her late response is granted and the lodged response is filed. It is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FURTHER ORDERED that Patricia Joan Barry is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia. To the extent respondent attempts to challenge the imposition of reciprocal discipline by requesting this court to conduct a hearing to permit her to relitigate the discipline imposed by the State of California, such a challenge is improper in reciprocal disciplinary proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zdravkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090555\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/964/#p969\">\n    831 A.2d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (D.C. 2003) (\"Put simply, reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline.\"). Further, respondent's response to this court's order merely recites the exceptions to be considered in rejecting the imposition of reciprocal discipline but she fails to provide any support that any of the exceptions apply; therefore, respondent has failed to rebut the presumption that reciprocal discipline will be imposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sibley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289674\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/990/483/\">\n    990 A.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2010), and\n   <em>\n    In re Fuller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8347738\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/194/#p198\">\n    930 A.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 (D.C. 2007) (rebuttable presumption of identical reciprocal discipline applies unless one of the exceptions is established). It is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FURTHER ORDERED that for purposes of reinstatement the period of respondent's disbarment will not begin to run until such time as he files a D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14 (g) affidavit.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
