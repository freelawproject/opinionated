On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal, (2) abused its discretion in declining to admit into evidence a transcript from the criminal trial of another defendant, and (3) erred in finding that his right to the effective assistance of counsel at his criminal trial\n   had not been violated. We disagree and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our Supreme Court, in the petitioner's direct appeal, recited the following facts, as found by the three judge trial court. \"[The victim] James Caffrey lived in the second floor apartment of 323 Hill Street in Waterbury with his girlfriend Samantha Bright and one other roommate. [The victim's] mother, Emilia Caffrey, lived in the first floor apartment. In the late afternoon of Saturday, October 26, 2008, [the victim] and Bright had five visitors, including [the codefendant] Tamarius Maner, in their living room. Maner had a clear view of the bedroom from where he was seated in the living room. Maner purchased a small amount of marijuana from [the victim] and paid him some money, which [the victim] put in the bedroom. [The victim] kept the marijuana in the bedroom. [The victim] remarked that he had saved $500 for a child that he was expecting with Bright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"At about that time, Maner and the [petitioner] lived next door to each other in Bridgeport and had done drug business together. Maner contacted the [petitioner] by cell phone during the evening of Saturday, October 26. Shortly after midnight on Sunday, October 27, Maner and the [petitioner] drove from Bridgeport to Waterbury to go to [the victim's] apartment. They were carrying loaded handguns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Just after 1 a.m., the doorbell to the second floor apartment at 323 Hill Street\n   rang and [the victim] answered the door. A conversation of a few seconds with ... [the victim] ensued. Maner then shot [the victim] in the face from a distance of one to three feet with a .45 caliber handgun. [The victim] fell in the hallway in a pool of blood and died from the gunshot wound to the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Maner and the [petitioner] walked past [the victim] and into a bedroom. There the [petitioner] put a gun\n   to Bright's head and asked: Where is everything? Bright understood the question to inquire about money and drugs. Bright referred them to the top dresser drawer. Maner opened it and threw its contents on the bedroom floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"At about that time, they heard the screams of Emilia Caffrey, who had heard the shot and discovered her son lying in the second floor hallway. The [petitioner] told Bright to keep her head down and face toward the wall. Maner and the [petitioner] then ran into the kitchen, which Emilia Caffrey had also entered in order to call 911. Maner, who was standing at the stove, fired one shot at [Emilia] Caffrey and missed. The [petitioner] was standing at the window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Maner and the [petitioner] then ran out of the kitchen, pushing [Emilia] Caffrey to the floor as they left. They returned to their car and arrived back in Bridgeport around 2 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Police interviews of some of the Waterbury visitors to [the victim's] apartment on the afternoon of October 26 led to the identity of Maner .... Further police investigation, including analysis of Maner's cell phone calls, brought police to an apartment in Bridgeport where they found the [petitioner]. The [petitioner] voluntarily returned to Waterbury with the police and told them that he had not left Bridgeport on the night in question. When confronted with the fact that his cell phone records showed him in Waterbury during the time of the crimes, the [petitioner] put his head down for a minute and then indicated that he had nothing more to say. A search, pursuant to a warrant, of his apartment in Bridgeport revealed a suitcase containing the [petitioner's] clothes, a loaded .45 caliber pistol, and a sock containing sixty-one rounds of ammunition.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20758\">\n    307 Conn. 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20A.3d%20221\">\n    59 A.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Our Supreme Court noted that the petitioner \"was charged with aiding and abetting murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a, felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, home invasion in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100aa (a) (1), and burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (3).

The habeas court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a subsequent petition for certification to appeal from the court's judgment. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court erred in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the\n   denial of his habeas petition.

Because the resolution of the petitioner's claims does not involve an issue that is debatable among jurists of reason and a court could not reasonably have resolved the issues differently, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification to appeal from the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We turn to the question of whether the habeas court abused its discretion in refusing to admit as a full exhibit a transcript of expert testimony from Maner's criminal trial.

At his habeas trial, the petitioner\n   claimed that Hopkins should have offered expert testimony on the issue of the reliability of eyewitness identification. The petitioner presented a legal expert, Lisa Steele, who testified comprehensively. Although she was qualified as a legal expert, the habeas court did not find Steele to be qualified as an expert in the science of eyewitness identification. Steele then testified that she had reviewed all of the transcripts and briefs in the cases of both the petitioner and Maner;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   she had also reviewed the witness statements by Bright and Emilia Caffrey.

Specifically, the police had used nonblind simultaneous photographic arrays, and the officer conducting the process knew the identities of the suspects. Steele opined that Hopkins should have forcefully highlighted the effects of stress, lighting, and the threatened use of weapons on the reliability of eyewitness identification through cross-examination and by using an expert in the field of eyewitness identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Steele contrasted the petitioner's criminal case to that of Maner, in which the expert testimony of Steven Penrod, a psychologist, was presented. She noted that Penrod had testified about the subconscious influences that officers exert in the presentation of photographic arrays to witnesses when the officers are aware of a suspect's identity. She said that an expert such as Penrod would have been effective in educating the three\n   judge court about factors such as the effect of stress on eyewitness identification. On cross-examination, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, elicited from Steele the information that Maner was convicted despite the use of Penrod at his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During Steele's testimony, the petitioner offered into evidence as a full exhibit his exhibit 19 for identification, which was a copy of the transcript of the\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing in Maner's trial on the issue of Penrod's qualifications as an expert. Steele had reviewed the transcript prior to her testimony, and from it she gleaned information regarding the science of eyewitness identification as it related to Maner's trial. The respondent objected to its introduction as a full exhibit, apparently on relevancy grounds, because the testimony took place in the trial of a different defendant and the trial took place approximately one year after the petitioner's criminal trial. The habeas court and the petitioner's counsel then engaged in the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Court: [W]hat's the purpose you're seeking to introduce this for?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Your Honor, I seek to submit it as a full exhibit for the purpose of the information that ... Steele reviewed and the basis of formulating her opinions or the opinions that she will be formulating in this particular trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The Court: Not for the truth contained within?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Not as far as what happened to ... Maner's trial or anything like that. Basically, just the information regarding the science of witness identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The Court: Well, there, I assume, is testimony by ... Penrod?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The Court: And are you seeking to have me accept that as for the truth contained in that testimony?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: For that limited purpose, yes, Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The Court: How's that not hearsay?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Well, I believe Your Honor can take judicial notice [of] the particular transcript. If nothing else, it was a part of ... Maner's appeal and that part of his appellate record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The Court: What do I care about ... Maner's [appeal]? I mean ... this case involves [the petitioner].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: I understand that, but ... Maner was [the petitioner's] codefendant .... I submit to the court that the information contained therein is relevant to [the petitioner] as far as\n   the eyewitness identification is concerned, and the ... availability of the information that ... Hopkins had and failed to utilize at the time of [the petitioner's] trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The Court: Objection's sustained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The record reveals, then, that the rationale advanced for admission as a full exhibit was somewhat scattered. The petitioner first suggested that the exhibit was admissible for the purpose of showing a basis for Steele's opinions. Although, in some circumstances, such information may be admissible for that limited purpose,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no requirement that such documents\n   be admitted as full exhibits, because the \"facts\" contained therein are hearsay nonetheless.

The record reveals that Steele testified at considerable length about the developments in the law regarding eyewitness identification, including\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20218\">\n    306 Conn. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   she testified about the opinions which Penrod had expressed during the\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing in Maner's criminal trial; and the petitioner agreed in his brief that Steele testified about the studies underlying the changes in the law.

Section 2-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence states in relevant part that \"[a] court may, but is not required to, take notice of matters of fact, in accordance with subsection (c),\" which provides that a \"judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) within the knowledge of people generally in the ordinary course of human experience, or (2) generally accepted as true and capable of ready and unquestionable demonstration.\" The opinions expressed by Penrod were simply not the sort of uncontested facts contemplated by the concept of judicial notice.

Error does not lie in the exclusion of evidence claimed on an inadmissible ground even though it might have been admissible had it been claimed on another and different ground [at trial]....

At the habeas trial, Hopkins testified that he hired an investigator to interview witnesses but did not use the results of that investigation in the petitioner's defense.

Bright later identified the petitioner at a probable cause hearing and at trial. Hopkins also testified that he had reviewed Bright's statement to police, in which she said that she did not get a good look at either of the two intruders. Hopkins said he \"never pursued a motion to suppress [Bright's in-court identifications] ... because, really, we used all of that background ... for purposes of cross-examination, both in the probable cause hearing and at trial, and made a big issue out of it in front of ... the three judge panel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The habeas court then engaged in the following discussion with the petitioner's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The Court: [Counsel], may I ask you a question?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"The Court: [Bright] did not identify [the petitioner].

At the time of the petitioner's criminal trial, the controlling law on the issue was\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535661\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/199/473/\">\n    199 Conn. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=507%20A.2d%201387\">\n    507 A.2d 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), overruled in part by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20218\">\n    306 Conn. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), in which our Supreme Court observed \"that the reliability of eyewitness identification is within the knowledge of jurors and expert testimony generally would not assist them in determining the question. ... Such testimony is also disfavored because ... it invades the province of the jury to determine what weight or effect it wishes to give to eyewitness testimony.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 477,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=507%20A.2d%201387\">\n    507 A.2d 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Three years after the petitioner's criminal trial, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   , which overruled\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   . The court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   was \"out of step with the widespread judicial recognition that eyewitness identifications are potentially unreliable in a variety of ways unknown to the average juror.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20218\">\n    306 Conn. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also observed that cross-examination \"often is not as effective as expert testimony at identifying the weaknesses of eyewitness identification testimony because cross-examination is far better at exposing lies than at countering sincere but mistaken beliefs.\" Id., at 243,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that \"some circumstances undoubtedly call for more than mere cross-examination of the eyewitness.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 244,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Again, because the law in effect at the time of the criminal trial discouraged the use of expert testimony on the issue of eyewitness identification, Hopkins did not perform deficiently by not presenting expert testimony. It was reasonable for Hopkins to use cross-examination to attack the weight of the testimony of Bright and Emilia Caffrey. Therefore, the habeas court did not err in failing to find deficient performance pertaining to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, the petitioner claims that Hopkins performed deficiently by not stressing in the course of cross-examination, even if an expert were not called to testify, several factors identified as important in\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   . Performance of counsel is not to be evaluated according to standards enunciated three years after the criminal trial. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764830\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/122/\">\n    291 Conn. at 164-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%2056\">\n    967 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , our Supreme Court had held that a nonblind photographic array was not unnecessarily suggestive. We have reviewed the record of the cross-examinations\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we\n   conclude that the habeas court did not err in finding the performance adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Maner, a coparticipant in the petitioner's criminal activity, was tried separately from, and after, the petitioner.
