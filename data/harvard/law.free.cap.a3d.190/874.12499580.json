On appeal, the defendant claims that we should overrule\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142752\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/602/\">\n    290 Conn. 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20148\">\n    966 A.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), in which we interpreted General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 21a-278 (b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to render drug dependency an affirmative defense to be proven by the defendant because (1) it is no longer good law in light of the subsequent decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    570 U.S. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    186 L.Ed. 2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), and (2) it was wrongly decided as a matter of statutory interpretation. The defendant also argues that the narcotics statutory scheme, which gives the prosecutor the sole authority to decide whether to proceed under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), rather than the otherwise identical General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 21a-277 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates\n   the separation of powers established by article second of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article eighteen of the amendments. The state contends to the contrary, and also argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct because that motion failed to raise a colorable claim challenging his sentence. Although we conclude that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct, we disagree with the merits of the defendant's claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court denying the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to sell narcotics in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48, and interfering with a police officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   No evidence concerning the defendant's drug dependency was presented at trial by the state or the defendant, and the trial court did not instruct the jury with respect to drug dependency. At sentencing, the court considered the defendant's history of narcotics convictions, and defense counsel argued that the defendant was not a career criminal but, rather, a career addict as a result of a painkiller\n   addiction following a neck injury suffered in an automobile accident. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    B. Fischer, J.\n   </em>\n   , sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twelve years imprisonment, followed by five years of special parole, to be served concurrently with a sentence that the defendant was serving for violation of probation. His conviction was subsequently affirmed on appeal.

The trial court,\n   <em>\n    S. Moore, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the defendant's motion, concluding that\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   did not control because of this court's interpretation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) in, among other cases,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142752\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/602/\">\n    290 Conn. at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20148\">\n    966 A.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that drug dependency is an affirmative defense to be proven by the defendant, rather than an element of the offense to be proven by the state. The trial court denied the defendant's subsequent motion for reconsideration and rendered judgment denying\n   the motion to correct an illegal sentence. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jurisdictional issues raised by the parties and the merits of the underlying arguments presented in this appeal are identical to those considered in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498612\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/1184/\">\n    329 Conn. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498612\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/1184/\">\n    189 A.3d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which we also decide today. We conclude that our examination of these same issues in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   thoroughly resolves the claims in the present appeal and that there is nothing in this case that would mandate a different result. Accordingly, we adopt the reasoning and conclusions of that opinion\n   herein. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Drakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487666\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/21/#p864\">\n    321 Conn. 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 864,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487666\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/21/#p864\">\n    146 A.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607328,12607329,12607330,12607331,12607332,12607333\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/321/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607328,12607329,12607330,12607331,12607332,12607333,12607334,12607335\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/196/234/\">\n    196 L.Ed.2d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). We, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    We note that the defendant's name has been spelled inconsistently in various court documents in this case, including in the briefs in the present appeal.
