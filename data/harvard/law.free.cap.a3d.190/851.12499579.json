The third\n   issue, which arose during the habeas trial, is whether the habeas court abused its discretion by denying the petitioner's request for a capias after Kelly failed to comply with a subpoena commanding his attendance at the habeas trial. We conclude that the habeas court properly determined that the state had not violated the petitioner's due process rights and that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioner's request for a capias. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury in the underlying criminal case reasonably could have found the following facts, as set forth in this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3144872\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/274/134/#p139\">\n    274 Conn. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20A.2d%20750\">\n    874 A.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20U.S.%20926\">\n    548 U.S. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20S.%20Ct.%202981\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20988\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). \"On the evening of October 10, 2001, the [petitioner] purchased the following stolen firearms: a Smith &amp; Wesson Daniels Cobray M-11 nine millimeter submachine gun (Cobray M-11); a Braco Arms .38 caliber pistol; and a Mossberg 500A shotgun. At the same time, the [petitioner] purchased stolen ammunition for the Cobray M-11 consisting of eight full thirty-five round magazines loaded with nine millimeter Luger Subsonic bullets. A Cobray M-11 is a semiautomatic or automatic assault weapon capable of emptying a thirty-five round magazine in [less than] two seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On October 12, 2001, the [petitioner], Franki Jones ... Kelly, Shaunte Little and Marquis Mitchell learned that individuals from the area of New Haven known as 'the Tre' were planning to 'shoot up' the area of New Haven known as 'West Hills' in retaliation for a shooting that had occurred the night before. The Tre area includes Elm Street and Orchard Street and the West Hills area includes the McConaughy Terrace projects. Rather than wait for the retaliation, the [petitioner], Jones, Kelly, Little and Mitchell decided to 'go through the Tre first.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The [petitioner] drove the four men to Jones' house where those who were not armed already retrieved guns and those with lighter colored clothing changed into darker attire. The [petitioner] armed himself with the Cobray M-11. All five men got into Jones' grey Lincoln Town Car and drove to the Tre. After they saw a group of people on the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Orchard Street, Jones parked the car next to a vacant house on Orchard Street. The [petitioner], Jones, Kelly, Little and Mitchell walked to the corner of Orchard Street and Edgewood Avenue, opened fire on the people on the street corner, then ran back to the Lincoln Town Car and fled the scene. Six people were shot and one of the victims died from his wounds.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20988\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioner was arrested and charged with various offenses in connection with the shooting. The petitioner elected a jury trial, at which his accomplices, Little, Jones, and Kelly all testified for the state against him. In particular, with respect to his own involvement in the shooting, Kelly testified that he had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kelly further testified\n   that, with respect to his guilty plea to those charges, it was his understanding that he was facing a maximum sentence of twenty-five years in prison, but that he did not know what his ultimate sentence would be. When the prosecutor, Christopher Alexy, asked Kelly if he had \"any understanding as to what could happen if you came in here and testified,\" Kelly replied, \"[n]ope.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Then, without any question pending from Alexy, Kelly began to explain the circumstances around a statement that he gave to the police after his arrest in connection with the shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Kelly testified that, \"[w]hen I gave that statement, I ain't make no deal. They were trying to make a deal with my life. When I gave that statement, I ain't make no deals, no lawyer, no nobody, no nothing, just the cop, I ain't got no deal. I ain't got to hear saying anything. I ain't got no deal. I could have sat here. It ain't really matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On cross-examination, the petitioner's trial counsel, Paul Carty, further questioned Kelly about his \"deal\" with the state. Specifically, Carty asked Kelly if he would have spent the rest of his life behind bars had he not worked out a deal to plead to the charges of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit. Kelly responded, \"I don't know nothing about no deals, none. I don't know nothing about no deals.\" Immediately thereafter, however, Kelly admitted that his lawyer did, in fact, work out a plea agreement with the state. Kelly acknowledged that the terms of that agreement required that he plead guilty to conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit. Kelly further admitted that, even though his purpose in going to Edgewood Avenue on the night of this incident was to commit\n   homicide, his plea agreement did not involve, nor did he plead guilty to, any homicide charges. Finally, Kelly explained that, pursuant to his plea agreement, the maximum sentence he could receive was twenty-five years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Carty then asked Kelly whether he had been informed that he could be sentenced to as little as one year in prison, which was the mandatory minimum sentence. Kelly responded that he did not know what the actual sentence would be, but that he did not expect that he would receive a sentence of one year. Rather, Kelly worried that he could receive the maximum twenty-five year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During closing arguments, Carty stated the following to the jury: \"[Kelly] claims he is not looking for a deal, but, think about it, he got the best deal of them all. His deal, he didn't even cop to a homicide\n   [charge]. What did he plead to? Conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and [carrying a] pistol without a permit. He claims not to be expecting anything in exchange for his testimony, but he knows good and well, as a veteran of the criminal justice system, which he told you he was, that he is going to be treated favorably at sentencing time. He knows how the system works. Give us your testimony, we'll take care of you. He didn't want to deal, but he was already treated favorably by not pleading to a homicide ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury ultimately returned a verdict finding the petitioner guilty of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a) and 53a-55a, conspiracy to commit manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-55a, five counts of assault in the first degree as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a) and 53a-59 (a) (5), conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree\n   in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-59 (a) (5), and possession of an assault weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202c. In addition, the petitioner pleaded guilty to three counts of theft of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-212 (a).

The habeas court denied that petition. The petitioner then appealed to the Appellate Court, which ultimately concluded that the petition should have been granted with respect to these counts and, accordingly, reversed in part the judgment of the habeas court. Id., at 136,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20A.3d%2029\">\n    2 A.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thereafter, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Santos, J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   vacated the petitioner's convictions on those three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2013, the petitioner filed his second petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which is the subject of the present appeal. That petition alleged, among other things, that the state violated the petitioner's due process rights during his criminal trial by failing to correct false testimony given by Kelly and by failing to disclose evidence favorable to him.

The habeas court held a trial on his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the habeas trial, the petitioner presented the transcript of Kelly's sentencing hearing as an exhibit. That transcript indicated that Kelley had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit in connection with the shooting incident. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Fasano, J.\n   </em>\n   , noted at that hearing that \"[t]here was no recommendation at the time of plea, and the understanding is that ... the ultimate sentencing would depend in part on another trial that was to take place in the interim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alexy, who was also the prosecutor in that proceeding, then stated that, \"[s]ince the pleas were entered ... Kelly complied with all the conditions of the plea\n   agreement very satisfactorily. He was instrumental in helping [to] solve a very brutal shooting.\" Alexy recommended a sentence of ten years imprisonment for the charges to which Kelly had pleaded guilty. Alexy then noted that there were two additional charges pending against Kelly in an unrelated matter and that it was the state's intention to nolle those charges. The trial court imposed the recommended sentence of ten years imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the habeas trial, Alexy testified that the state's plea agreement with Kelly provided that he could receive a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment for the two charges to which he pleaded guilty. Alexy acknowledged that it was possible that he could have charged Kelly with being an accessory to murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Alexy also acknowledged that, if Kelly had refused to testify at the petitioner's trial, or had testified falsely, Alexy would have recommended a higher sentence than ten years imprisonment. Alexy further testified that, before the criminal trial had commenced, he told Carty the terms of the state's plea agreement with Kelly. In particular, Alexy told Carty that Kelly would be testifying, that Kelly had entered a guilty plea, that \"there was no specific plea agreement\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"any sentence would be determined by Judge Fasano, subsequent to the trial, if, in fact ... Kelly did cooperate and testify at the petitioner's trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Alexy also testified about his own recollection of Kelly's testimony at the criminal trial. Specifically, when counsel for the petitioner asked Alexy whether Kelly had \"denied that he was receiving any consideration in exchange for his testimony,\" Alexy responded, \"[t]hat's\n   correct.\" Counsel then asked whether Kelly had testified that \"there was not an agreement,\" and Alexy responded, \"[a]n agreement for a specific sentence, correct.\" When counsel asked whether Alexy believed that Kelly's testimony \"fully summarizes the understanding that [Alexy] had with ... Kelly about his testimony,\" Alexy responded, \"Yes, it says right here that there '[wasn't] no understanding [about] what I was getting sentence[d] to,' which is ... absolutely\n   accurate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel then asked Alexy specifically: \"Does ... Kelly's testimony accurately [reflect] the understanding that you had with him?\" Alexy responded: \"To the extent that-yeah. Yeah.\" Counsel then asked: \"What did [Kelly] say about what was going to happen at sentencing?\" Alexy responded: \"He said he didn't know what he was going to be getting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The petitioner's attorney at the criminal trial, Carty, also testified at the habeas trial. He explained that Alexy had told him before the criminal trial that all of the petitioner's codefendants, including Kelly, \"were going to have their cooperation made known to the court at the sentencing of them on their respective cases.\" Carty further testified that, even though Kelly did not admit that he was hoping to benefit from his testimony, Carty still argued to the jury that Kelly was expecting to receive some benefit. Carty explained that \"it's kind of disingenuous for someone who is looking at a lot of time to say, well, I am not expecting anything. Of course he is expecting something.\" Carty further testified that it is standard practice for a cooperating codefendant to plead guilty prior to the trial of a codefendant, to testify at trial, and then to be sentenced. Sentencing is\n   delayed in order to ensure that the cooperating codefendant actually testifies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Oliver J.\n   </em>\n   , found that \"Alexy testified credibly that he properly disclosed to the defense that Kelly would testify against the petitioner, that Kelly had entered guilty pleas before trial, that there was no specific sentencing agreement for ... Kelly, and that his cooperation would be made known to the sentencing judge after trial.\" The court concluded that Kelly's testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial \"was not false or misleading. Though not a model of clarity, it sufficiently and accurately describes the ... 'agreement' [between Kelly and the state].\" The habeas court stated that it was aware of no authority \"that supports the proposition that a cooperating witness must use or agree to certain 'magic words' in describing the nature of the cooperation agreement. As, in this court's experience as the fact-finder, cooperating witnesses come from all walks of life and have various levels of education and proficiency with the English language, this court declines the invitation to require a cooperating witness to use certain words, including: 'consideration,' 'incentive,' 'agreement,' 'understanding' or 'motive.' Reasonabl[y] competent counsel can draw the fact finder's attention to the witness' motive to testify, falsely in some cases, through proper cross-examination and closing argument, as in the instant matter.\" Accordingly, the habeas court denied the petitioner's second petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Thereafter, the habeas court granted the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first address the petitioner's claim that the habeas court incorrectly concluded that his due process rights were not violated at his criminal trial when Alexy failed to correct Kelly's testimony. In particular, the petitioner asserts that Kelly and the state had reached an agreement that Kelly's testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial would benefit him-namely,\n   that Kelly would receive leniency at his own sentencing in exchange for testifying against the petitioner. Thus, the petitioner claims, Kelly testified falsely when he stated that he had no \"deal\" with the state and was expecting nothing in return for his testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial. As a result, the petitioner argues that Alexy had an obligation to correct Kelly's false testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, counters that there was no false or misleading testimony to correct. Specifically, the respondent argues that the context surrounding Kelly's testimony makes it clear that, when he testified that he had no \"deal,\" he was not broadly denying that he had received\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   benefit in exchange for his testimony. Rather, the respondent contends that Kelly's testimony related only to the sentencing component of his agreement with the state, and that Kelly only denied that he knew what\n   <em>\n    specific sentence\n   </em>\n   he would receive or whether he would receive any leniency at all.

Kelly responded, \"[i]t wasn't no\n   understanding; what I was getting sentenced to ... was just that.\" Then, after acknowledging that he faced a maximum of twenty-five years of imprisonment, Alexy asked whether Kelly had \"any understanding as to what could happen if you came in here and testified?\" Kelly responded: \"Nope.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner highlights Kelly's answer of \"[n]ope\" in connection with the question of whether he had any understanding of what could happen if he testified against the petitioner as evidence of false testimony. At first blush, this isolated response by Kelly could appear to be a blanket denial of any deal or agreement whatsoever. Kelly's statement, however, cannot be divorced from the context surrounding it. Indeed, immediately before this testimony, Alexy asked whether Kelly knew\n   <em>\n    what sentence\n   </em>\n   he would receive. In response to that question, Kelly explained that he was looking at a maximum sentence of twenty-five years of imprisonment, but that he did not know what his sentence would be. It only was at that point that Kelly responded \"[n]ope\" to the question regarding his understanding of what could happen if he came in and testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is clear to us, therefore, that Kelly's claim that he had no understanding of what would happen if he cooperated with the state related to whether he had an understanding of the specific sentence that he expected to receive and was not substantially misleading. This testimony neither denies the existence of Kelly's plea agreement with the state nor mischaracterizes its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The evidence adduced at the habeas trial further bolsters our conclusion that Kelly's testimony on this issue was not substantially misleading. First, Alexy gave testimony-which the habeas court credited-indicating that when he heard Kelly say \"[n]ope,\" and represent that he \"had no understanding\" of what would happen if he testified, Alexy understood that he was referring to the fact that he did not know what specific sentence he would receive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is entirely reasonable given the\n   fact that the line of questioning at that juncture related only to Kelly's understanding of the sentence he expected to receive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the transcript from Kelly's plea hearing, which was introduced as an exhibit at the habeas trial, further demonstrates that there was no agreed upon sentence, only a maximum exposure of twenty-five years of imprisonment. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Indeed, Alexy never asked Kelly whether he expected that his cooperation would be made known to the sentencing judge, and Kelly never testified on that precise issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, when viewed in the\n   context of the questions that were asked and the responses given, Kelly's testimony on direct examination was not substantially misleading. This conclusion also is consistent with the other evidence at the habeas trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To the extent that the petitioner's claim involves statements Kelly made during his cross-examination, those statements also cannot be evaluated in isolation, unconnected to the context in which they were made. Specifically, Carty asked Kelly the following question: \"Had you not worked that deal out [to plead to nonhomicide charges, you were] looking at basically spending the rest of your life behind bars.\" In response to that inquiry, Kelly testified as follows: \"I don't know nothing about no deals, none. I don't know nothing about no\n   deals.\" Carty then sought to clarify this testimony, and asked Kelly directly: \"You worked out a plea, right?\" Kelly responded: \"My lawyer, I guess, I don't know. I know he told me what I was copping out to, and I took it.\" This testimony was not substantially misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Again, when evaluated in context, specifically with respect to the questions asked, Kelly's statements did not categorically deny any deal with the state. Kelly's response and, more particularly, his clarification demonstrate that he was denying that he had worked out a plea agreement directly with the state\n   <em>\n    himself\n   </em>\n   , but that it was his lawyer who had worked out the deal. To be sure, immediately following his admission that his lawyer worked out a plea deal, Kelly admitted that he did, in fact, plead guilty to nonhomicide charges for his part in the shooting incident, rather than homicide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This obviously was not a denial of any deal with the state or a mischaracterization of his plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, at another point during cross-examination, Carty asked Kelly about his expectations regarding his sentence. Kelly responded: \"I ain't expecting nothing, but I know that I could do the time.\" As with Kelly's previous testimony, the petitioner takes these statements out of context in an attempt to claim that Kelly denied receiving any benefit for his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Just before Kelly made these statements, Carty had asked him if he knew that he could receive a sentence requiring as little as one year of imprisonment. Kelly responded that he was not expecting a sentence of only one year but, rather, was thinking about having to serve the full twenty-five years, and potentially more, given\n   that he had other charges pending. In response this testimony, Carty asked the following: \"That's not what are you expecting out of this?\" Kelly answered: \"I don't know what I'm getting.\" Carty then stated \"that's not what I'm asking you,\" and repeated his question: \"What are you expecting?\" Kelly responded: \"I ain't expecting nothing, but I know that I could do the time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is evident that Kelly was responding to questions regarding the length of the sentence he expected to\n   receive, not whether he expected any benefit whatsoever. His response that he could \"do the time\" further shows that Kelly understood the question to be directed at the sentence he expected to receive. Because there was no agreement with respect to his specific sentence, Kelly's testimony was not substantially misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This testimony, when considered in context, simply does not suggest that Kelly was denying that he had any expectation regarding whether the state would make his cooperation known to the sentencing judge, as the petitioner suggests. We note that Carty never specifically asked Kelly whether he was aware that the state intended to bring his cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court, and Kelly certainly never denied that he had such an expectation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We further note that the plea agreement had been disclosed to Carty, and he never objected to Kelly's testimony on the ground that it was misleading or inconsistent with the terms of the agreement. Although Carty's failure to object is not dispositive, we conclude that, because he had the full agreement, it is a factor that we may consider when determining whether Kelly's testimony was false or substantially misleading.

His testimony related to his expectations regarding the specific\n   sentence he would receive, and not to the broader question of whether he was receiving\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   benefit in exchange for his testimony. Indeed, Alexy testified at the habeas trial that his understanding of Kelly's testimony was that he did not expect to receive any particular sentence, and the habeas court found Alexy to be a credible witness. Furthermore, Kelly's testimony made clear that he had received some benefit, namely, that he had pleaded to nonhomicide charges, which carry a significantly reduced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, the jury was aware that Kelly had not yet been sentenced and that he was exposed to a twenty-five year prison sentence. Finally, at no point did Kelly ever expressly deny that he expected his cooperation to be made known the sentencing judge. As the respondent points out, under these circumstances, it would require \"no great leap of logic for the jury to appreciate and, indeed, expect, that Kelly's ... cooperation in the case against the petitioner would be brought to the attention of his sentencing judge, at the very least by his own counsel, if not by the state itself ....\" Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court reasonably determined that Kelly's testimony was not substantially misleading and, therefore, that Alexy had no duty to correct Kelly's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In support of his claim to the contrary, the petitioner relies on\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bigeleisen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1283007\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/625/203/\">\n    625 F.2d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1980).

Thus, the jury could not properly evaluate his credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The present\n   case, however,\n   is not one in which there has been a complete denial of any agreement with the state. To the contrary, Kelly admitted that he had pleaded guilty to certain nonhomicide charges, that the maximum sentence was twenty-five years of imprisonment, that he had not yet been sentenced in connection with those charges, and that he did not know what his sentence would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Bigeleisen\n   </em>\n   , the jury in the present case was made aware that Kelly already had received favorable treatment from the state by being allowed to plead guilty to nonhomicide crimes-after it also had heard that Kelly and his cohorts killed a person after they fired guns into a crowd of people-and that the state was in a position to reward Kelly further at sentencing. Therefore, although Kelly's testimony was, as the habeas court observed, \"not a model of clarity,\" the habeas court reasonably could have concluded that it was neither false nor substantially misleading. Accordingly, we reject the petitioner's claim that his due process rights were violated when Alexy failed to correct Kelly's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The concurring justices disagree with this analysis and would assume that Kelly's testimony was misleading. They stop short, however, of calling it false or even substantially misleading. The concurring justices also conclude that, when testimony regarding a plea agreement is misleading-but apparently not false or substantially misleading-the prosecutor has no obligation to correct the testimony if the plea agreement was disclosed to the petitioner before the criminal trial. We agree with this conclusion, but not because compliance with\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   excuses the prosecutor's failure to correct \"misleading\" testimony that is neither false nor\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   misleading. Indeed, the prosecutor has no duty to correct because\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Napue\n   </em>\n   do not apply to merely \"misleading\" testimony in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rather, those cases require the prosecutor to correct\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   testimony that is substantially misleading or false. Of course, if there was no prior disclosure of the plea agreement pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , that would be a due process violation in and of itself, regardless of the degree to which the testimony had the potential to mislead the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this regard, we note that the \"substantially misleading\" standard appears to have been first adopted in\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"169420\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/498/1164/#p1169\">\n    498 F.2d at 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated, without citation to authority, that \"\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Napue\n   </em>\n   require that the prosecutor apprise the court when he knows that his witness is giving testimony that is substantially misleading.\" See also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Paradise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566677\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/388/#p400\">\n    213 Conn. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%201221\">\n    567 A.2d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ), overruled in part on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Skakel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992204\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/633/\">\n    276 Conn. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20985\">\n    888 A.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20U.S.%201030\">\n    549 U.S. 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20S.%20Ct.%20578\">\n    127 S.Ct. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20428\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

The small, decontextualized snippets of Kelly's testimony, upon which the petitioner and the concurring justices seize, namely, his denial that he had \"any understanding as to what could happen\" if he testified, was not substantially misleading or untrue. It certainly was not received that way by Alexy or Carty. Accordingly, we have no reason to believe that the jury would have interpreted the testimony differently and concluded that Kelly, who had admitted firing a gun\n   into a crowd of people, one of whom was killed, and who had pleaded guilty to nonhomicide offenses for which he had not yet been sentenced, expected to receive no benefit in exchange for his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nevertheless, in reaching our conclusion in the present case, we are mindful of the difficulties that defendants face when attempting to provide jurors with the information that they need to make a reliable credibility determination regarding the testimony of a cooperating accomplice. We find those difficulties especially acute when the accomplice has pleaded guilty, has not yet been sentenced at the time of the defendant's trial, and has no express agreement with the state as to a specific sentence. Accordingly, to ensure\n   that the jury is accurately and fully informed of the nature of a cooperating witness' plea agreement and any potential benefits that the witness may receive in exchange for his or her testimony, we believe that it is the better practice, although not constitutionally required, for the prosecutor to ask fact-specific, leading questions of a cooperating witness instead of open-ended questions that may evoke incomplete or ambiguous responses. Indeed, the respondent in the present case has acknowledged that \"a prosecutor's better, but not constitutionally mandated practice, might be to ask a cooperating witness a fact-specific, leading question that accurately embodies the nature of the agreement between the witness and the state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore urge the state to follow this procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305067\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/173/#p186\">\n    295 Conn. at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201048\">\n    989 A.2d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"we urge the state to ensure that sentencing recommendations for cooperating witnesses conform to both the letter and the spirit of any plea agreements disclosed at trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We next address the petitioner's claim that the habeas court improperly determined that the state did not violate his constitutional right to due process by failing to disclose material favorable evidence to him before his criminal trial.

Eichler located Kelly and interviewed him in December, 2015. Eichler discussed the interview with the petitioner's counsel, who then instructed Eichler to obtain a written statement from Kelly and to issue a subpoena to him to attend the habeas trial. In February, 2016, Eichler met again with Kelly and presented him with a written statement that Eichler had prepared\n   based on his interview of Kelly. Kelly signed the statement under oath. Eichler also served Kelly with a subpoena directing him to appear at the habeas trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Notwithstanding service of the subpoena, Kelly did not appear at the habeas trial as directed. As a result, counsel for the petitioner asked that the habeas court either issue a capias for Kelly's arrest or declare Kelly to be unavailable. The petitioner's counsel argued that Kelly's testimony was necessary because his written statement and his statements during his interview with Eichler indicated that Kelly \"was aware that he would receive consideration for favorable testimony at [the] trial of the petitioner.\" Thereafter, the subpoena was marked as a full exhibit at the habeas trial, but the written statement was marked for identification only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The habeas court then questioned Eichler about Kelly's unavailability. Eichler testified that he had had no contact with Kelly between the date of his last interview, February 11, 2016, and the date of the habeas trial, February 24, 2016. Eichler tried to call Kelly on the day of trial, but his cell phone was \"off.\" Eichler made no attempt to go to Kelly's home address or to determine whether he was incarcerated or had a court date in another court. The court then questioned Eichler about the details of his interviews of Kelly and the procedure by which he had created the written statement. The court stated on the record that it was not reading Kelly's written statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On the basis of the evidence before it, the habeas court concluded that Kelly was not unavailable to testify, but \"he [was] simply not [t]here ....\" Accordingly, the court denied the petitioner's request to issue a capias to compel Kelly to attend the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The standards governing the issuance of a capias are well established. \"If one is not warranted in refusing to honor a subpoena and it is clear to the court that\n   his absence will cause a miscarriage of justice, the court should issue a capias to compel attendance. General Statutes \u00a7 52-143\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not, however, make it mandatory for the court to issue a capias when a witness under subpoena fails to appear; issuance of a capias is in the discretion of the court. The court has the authority to decline to issue a capias when the circumstances do not justify or require it.... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\" (Citations omitted; footnote added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DiPalma\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wiesen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"696462\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/163/293/#p298\">\n    163 Conn. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298-99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=303%20A.2d%20709\">\n    303 A.2d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the petitioner's request to issue a capias for Kelly's arrest. First, the petitioner presented no evidence that Kelly's failure to comply with the subpoena was not warranted. Second, the court reasonably could have concluded that the petitioner was partially responsible for Kelly's failure to appear because the petitioner made no effort during the two weeks between Eichler's last interview with Kelly and the date of the habeas trial to contact Kelly to ensure that he would be present in court to testify on the petitioner's behalf. Under these circumstances, we cannot\n   say that the habeas court abused its discretion in declining to issue the capias. Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, ROBINSON and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   D'AURIA, J., with whom McDONALD, J., joins, concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Like the majority, I conclude that the petitioner, Mashawn Greene, was not deprived of due process of law as guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.

A review of Kelly's direct examination reveals that he testified only that, after giving a statement implicating the petitioner, he later pleaded guilty to assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit. The jurors were provided with no\n   context during Kelly's direct examination that allowed them to assess or determine whether he had actually faced greater charges or whether permitting him to plead guilty to only those charges constituted a \" 'sweet-heart deal,' \" as the respondent refers to it. Nor was there, during Kelly's direct examination, any mention of the understanding, made explicit at Kelly's plea hearing, that \"his continued cooperation in the cases of the codefendants [including the petitioner] will be made known to the court at the time of [Kelly's] sentencing ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Instead, Kelly answered the prosecutor's first question about his \"understanding\" by denying, accurately, that there was an agreement concerning what his actual sentence would be. He answered the prosecutor's next question by stating, also accurately, that he was facing a maximum of twenty-five years incarceration on the charges to which he pleaded guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor then asked, \"[a]nd do you have any understanding as to what could happen if you came in here and testified?\" Kelly responded, \"[n]ope.\" Unsolicited, Kelly then expounded: \"When I gave that statement [to the police implicating the petitioner], I ain't make no deal. They were trying to make a deal with my life. When I gave that statement, I ain't make no deals, no lawyer, no nobody, no nothing, just the cop. I ain't got no deal.

We are not convinced that this is an accurate characterization of the habeas court's decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Although the habeas court noted that Kelly's testimony was not a \"model of clarity,\" the court found specifically that Kelly's testimony was not false or misleading. The court made no alternative finding that, if the testimony was false, it was then the petitioner's obligation to correct it. Thus, the decision reasonably can be interpreted as holding only that, when the state has disclosed all the terms of a plea agreement to the defense and a witness' testimony is not a model of clarity, but also is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    false or misleading for purposes of governing due process principles, defense counsel can attempt to clarify the testimony through cross-examination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Consequently, because we conclude that the habeas court properly determined that Kelly's testimony was not false or misleading, we need not address the question of whether a prosecutor has an obligation to correct false or misleading testimony in cases in which the prosecutor has fully and accurately disclosed a plea agreement to defense counsel.

Rather, he has simply made the general claim that Kelly's testimony was false because he testified at various points on direct examination and cross-examination that he had no deal, that he had no understanding of what would happen as a result of his testimony and that he was not expecting anything in exchange for his cooperation. Accordingly, we assume for purposes of this opinion that the petitioner is contending that each instance in which Kelly denied having any deal or any understanding of what would happen in his criminal case if he cooperated with the state was false and that the state's obligation to correct that testimony was triggered upon each occurrence.

The petitioner does not appear to challenge Kelly's representation that he had no deal at that point in time. It is important, however, in analyzing the petitioner's claims, that we distinguish between Kelly's testimony regarding any deals he had, or did not have, when he gave his statement to the police and his testimony regarding any deal he had with the state related to his plea agreement.

To attempt to avoid any ambiguity and potential misimpression, I agree with both the majority and the respondent that, when a prosecutor seeks to expose an understanding or agreement between the state and a cooperating witness, the better practice is for the prosecutor to ask leading questions that accurately describe the nature of any agreement between the witness and the state.
