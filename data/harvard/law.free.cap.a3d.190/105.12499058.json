Horsey II,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered in favor of the substitute plaintiff, The Bank of New York Mellon, as Successor Trustee for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee for Novastar Mortgage Funding Trust, Series 2005-2 Novastar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2005-2. The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly (1) granted the substitute plaintiff's motion to open a disciplinary judgment of dismissal because it disregarded the standard set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 and Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 ; (2) exhibited bias against the defendant; (3) failed to ensure that the defendant timely received a preliminary statement of the substitute plaintiff's monetary claim in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (b) ; (4) rendered summary judgment as to the defendant's liability; (5) declined to dismiss the foreclosure action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-9 ; (6) failed to consider his argument that \"bifurcation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   of the note and mortgage had rendered them unenforceable; (7) failed to address the issue of the substitute plaintiff's standing to prosecute this action; and (8) failed to consider whether the substitute plaintiff had engaged in fraud upon the court. The defendant's claims either are unpreserved, inadequately briefed, or fail to persuade us that the court's actions constitute reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of strict foreclosure and remand the case to the trial court for the purpose of setting new law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The original plaintiff, The Bank of New York Mellon, as Successor Trustee under Novastar Mortgage Funding Trust 2005-2, commenced this action in September, 2009. Its complaint contained two counts. Count one sought to foreclose on a mortgage that the defendant had executed in 2005 on property in Avon as security for a note in the principal amount of $390,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The original plaintiff alleged that it was the holder of the note and mortgage and that the note was in default for nonpayment. Count two sought reformation of the mortgage in order to correct a minor defect in the property description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 23, 2010, the original plaintiff filed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure and a motion to default the defendant for failure to appear. Soon thereafter, it also filed an appraisal, an affidavit of debt, a foreclosure worksheet and other documents necessary to obtain a foreclosure judgment. The court clerk\n   defaulted the defendant for failure to appear on May 3, 2010. On that same day, however, the defendant filed an appearance as a self-represented party along with a request to participate in the court-sponsored foreclosure mediation program. The default was set aside and the court granted the defendant's request for mediation. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-20 (d) (default automatically\n   set aside if defaulted party files appearance before judgment on default is rendered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Foreclosure mediation began and continued through the end of 2010. Over the following year and a half, the parties filed a number of motions related to discovery. On September 26, 2012, the original plaintiff assigned the mortgage to the substitute plaintiff, which the court substituted into the action for the original plaintiff on November 19, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant filed an answer to the complaint and a disclosure of defense on October 9, 2013. In his answer, the defendant admitted to executing the note and mortgage but denied the allegations that he was in default on the note or had been provided proper notice of default. The defendant did not assert any special defenses or raise any counterclaims. In his disclosure of defense, the defendant indicated that he reserved the right to dispute the amount of the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   No further activity in the action occurred until April 17, 2015, at which time the defendant filed a motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-3 asking the court to render a judgment of dismissal on the ground that the substitute plaintiff had failed to prosecute the action with reasonable diligence. The court,\n   <em>\n    Vacchelli, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued an order on May 6, 2015, denying the defendant's motion, but directing the substitute plaintiff to move for summary judgment or to take some other action to advance the case within sixty days. The court indicated\n   that, if the substitute plaintiff failed to comply, the court would entertain a renewed motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The substitute plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment as to liability only on December 21, 2015. Along with its motion, the substitute plaintiff submitted copies of the note, the mortgage and assignments, and an affidavit averring, inter alia, that the substitute plaintiff was the holder of the note and the mortgagee of record, the note was in default, notice of the default had been sent to the defendant, and the default had not been cured. The defendant filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment on February 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not attach an affidavit or any other evidence that disputed factually the summary judgment submissions of the substitute plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the defendant filed his objection to the motion for summary judgment, he also filed a motion renewing his request for a judgment of dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-3, noting that the substitute plaintiff had not filed its motion for summary judgment within the sixty day time period established by the court's May 6, 2015 order. The substitute plaintiff filed an objection to the motion to dismiss, arguing that dismissal was not an appropriate remedy at that juncture because the defendant had not established that he was prejudiced by the delay and the parties were now \"postured to litigate the matter in short order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Robaina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., heard argument on the motion for summary judgment\n   on March 21, 2016. On April 14, 2016, the court issued orders, without comment, denying the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss for lack of diligence and overruling his objection to the motion for summary judgment. The court also issued the following order granting the motion for summary judgment as to liability only: \"[I]t is hereby found that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to the defendants' liability on the note and mortgage.... Determination of the amount of indebtedness is deferred until such time as plaintiff seeks a judgment of foreclosure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 19, 2016, the defendant filed an appeal from the court's April 14, 2016 orders granting the motion for summary judgment as to liability and denying his motion for a disciplinary dismissal of the action. The substitute plaintiff filed with this court a motion to dismiss that appeal for lack of a final judgment. The motion was granted on May 25, 2016.

On July 20, 2016, the substitute plaintiff reclaimed for the short calendar list its April 23, 2010 motion seeking a judgment of strict foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 1, 2016, the parties appeared before the court,\n   <em>\n    Noble, J\n   </em>\n   ., on the court's dormancy docket. The court had issued a notice to appear and show cause on March 18, 2016, prior to the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, directing the parties to appear to address the status of the case and indicating that \"the court may dismiss this action at the hearing.\" The court first heard from counsel for the substitute plaintiff, who\n   indicated that the substitute plaintiff was ready to proceed to judgment but was awaiting the return of the original note and other documents necessary to secure the judgment. According to counsel, at some point, the substitute plaintiff had hired another law firm to represent it in this action, and the original documents had been transferred to that firm. The matter subsequently was transferred back to counsel's firm, but, according to counsel, the original documents had not yet been received back. Without first hearing from the defendant, the court indicated that it would give the substitute plaintiff one more chance, but if the matter did not proceed to judgment by November 14, 2016, the substitute plaintiff would be nonsuited and the matter dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant then asked the court if he could be heard. The court apologized for not giving the defendant an opportunity to speak prior to ruling. The defendant brought to the court's attention that he previously had filed a motion to dismiss for lack of diligence and that the substitute plaintiff had failed to comply with the court's order directing the substitute plaintiff to take some action to advance the case within sixty days. The substitute plaintiff responded that the same argument had been raised to and rejected by the court as part of its consideration of the motion for summary judgment and renewed motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, after confirming that the case had been on the docket since 2009, the court reversed its earlier ruling and dismissed the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 31, 2016, the substitute plaintiff filed a motion to open and set aside the judgment of dismissal. It argued that it had filed and reclaimed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure prior to the court's dismissal and now had in its possession all documents necessary to proceed to a final judgment, including an updated\n   appraisal and updated affidavit of debt. It also\n   argued that \"it would be an exercise in futility and would unduly burden the court's docket to require [it] to commence a new action.\" The substitute plaintiff filed the updated appraisal on September 6, 2016, and, on September 8, 2016, filed a new foreclosure worksheet, an updated affidavit of debt, and an affidavit regarding attorney's fees. The defendant filed an objection to the motion to open on September 6, 2016, in which he argued that the substitute plaintiff could not demonstrate that it was prevented from prosecuting the action by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause or that a good cause of action existed at the time of the judgment of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both the motion to open and the reclaimed motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure appeared on the court's September 12, 2016 foreclosure docket. The court,\n   <em>\n    Dubay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., asked the defendant at the beginning of that hearing whether he was objecting to the motion to open or the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendant replied: \"I'm objecting to the motion to open because my understanding is without opening the judgment the court can't consider any other motion.\" The court acknowledged that the case had been pending for a long time but asked the defendant to explain how he had been prejudiced by that delay. The defendant answered that he had been under the strain of not knowing whether he would be able to remain in his home. The court suggested that, with respect to prejudice, the defendant actually benefitted from the delay because he was able to remain in his home for seven years without making mortgage payments. After some further discussion with the defendant, including about the nature of his defense to the foreclosure action, the court summarily granted the motion to open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court then immediately turned to consideration of the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. It\n   began by confirming that summary judgment as to liability previously had been rendered in this case. The defendant then requested that the court grant a two month continuance to November 16, 2016, arguing that the substitute plaintiff had filed its updated financial information after the action had been dismissed and prior to it having been opened, and the defendant claimed that he needed additional time to prepare a defense. The court denied the request, explaining to the defendant that he had had seven years to prepare and, furthermore, that it intended to set law days to commence on November 28, 2016, and, thus, the defendant would have ample time to file a motion to open any judgment it rendered \"based upon whatever reasons you think it ... should be reopened for.\" Other than arguing that the substitute plaintiff's financial documents were filed too close in time to the hearing on the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, the defendant did not advance any reason why the court could not determine the amount of indebtedness on the basis of those documents. Because the defendant's liability already had been established, calculating the total net amount of the debt owed and establishing law days were the only outstanding issues for the court to resolve before it could render a judgment of strict foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, on the basis of its review of the documents submitted by the substitute plaintiff, including the revised affidavit of debt and updated appraisal, rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure, finding that the property had a fair market value of $390,000 and that the debt owed as of the judgment date was $644,382.77. The court also awarded attorney's fees, an appraisal fee, and a title search fee, and it set law days to commence on November 28, 2016. Finally, the court also rendered judgment for the substitute plaintiff, without objection, on count two of the complaint seeking reformation of the mortgage's property description. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly granted the substitute plaintiff's motion to open the disciplinary judgment of dismissal. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court disregarded the standard for opening a judgment set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 and Practice Book \u00a7 17-43. The substitute plaintiff responds that the defendant's claim is not reviewable because the trial court did not state the factual or legal basis for its decision to grant the motion to open and the defendant never requested an articulation. Alternatively, the substitute plaintiff argues that, on the basis of the record and arguments presented, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the criteria set forth in \u00a7 52-212 and Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 for opening a judgment were met, and, therefore, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion. We agree with the substitute plaintiff that, on the basis of the record before us, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court\n   abused its discretion in granting the motion to open the judgment of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"If a party shall fail to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence, the judicial authority may, after hearing, on motion by any party to the action ... or on its own motion, render a judgment dismissing the action with costs.\" Practice Book \u00a7 14-3 (a). \" Practice Book \u00a7 14-3 reflects the judicial branch's interest in having counsel prosecute actions with reasonable diligence. Judges, faced with case flow management concerns, must enforce the pace of litigation coming before the court, rather than allowing the parties to do so.... Our judicial system cannot be controlled by the litigants and cases cannot be allowed to drift aimlessly through the system.... [Therefore], lengthy periods of inactivity by the plaintiff constitute sufficient grounds for a trial court to determine that the plaintiff has failed to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Brochu\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aesys Technologies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20584\">\n    159 Conn.

Disciplinary dismissals pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-3, thus, are not favored and, accordingly, may be set aside and the action reinstated to the docket upon the granting of a motion to open filed in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 and \u00a7 52-212.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 provides in relevant part that the disciplinary dismissal of an action may be set aside within four months \"upon the written motion of any\n   party or person prejudiced thereby, showing reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action in whole or in part existed at the time of the rendition of such judgment ... and that the plaintiff ... was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from prosecuting\" the action. Section 52-212 contains nearly identical language. \"A motion to open ... is addressed to the [trial] court's discretion, and the action of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless it acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of its discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rino Gnesi Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sbriglio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8444267\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/83/707/#p711\">\n    83 Conn.

The defendant did not request an articulation of that decision. It is the appellant's burden to provide this court with an adequate record for review of all claims raised on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 (a). In a situation in which the court has not set forth the factual and legal basis for a discretionary ruling, and the appellant has failed to seek an articulation in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 66-5, we must presume that the court acted correctly and can only conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion if such abuse is apparent on the face of the record before us. See\n   <em>\n    Equity One, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shivers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20119\">\n    310 Conn. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20A.3d%201225\">\n    74 A.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"The correctness of a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. We do not presume error. The burden is on the appellant to prove harmful error.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.] ). We cannot reach such a conclusion in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to statute and our rules of practice, in order to justify the opening of a judgment rendered for failure to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence, the court must be satisfied only that there has been some\n   \"mistake, accident\n   <em>\n    or other reasonable cause\n   </em>\n   \" that justifies setting aside the judgment. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 ; Practice Book \u00a7 17-43. There is nothing in the record to support the defendant's assertion that the court failed to apply that standard. Moreover, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in granting the motion to open under the circumstances. The substitute plaintiff timely moved to open the disciplinary dismissal well within the requisite four month period. It argued to the court that any delay in proceeding to a final judgment was not the result of lack of diligence on the part of the substitute plaintiff but, rather, was caused by a delay in receiving original documents necessary to foreclose, a delay that was outside of its direct control. The defendant did not dispute the veracity of\n   the substitute plaintiff's factual assertions. Furthermore, because summary judgment as to liability already had been rendered prior to the court's dismissal, no real argument existed that a good cause of action failed to exist in whole or in part at the time of the dismissal. Finally, the court expressed skepticism that the defendant had been unduly prejudiced by any delay in bringing the action to a final judgment. We cannot conclude on this record that the court abused its considerable discretion in opening the judgment of dismissal or that its implicit finding of reasonable cause to do so was clearly erroneous, particularly in light of the well established policy that courts should favor bringing about a trial on the merits whenever possible. Accordingly, we reject the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court exhibited bias against him in ruling on the motion to open the judgment of dismissal. Specifically, he maintains that the court displayed bias by questioning him about how he was prejudiced by the substitute plaintiff's delay in\n   prosecuting the action, seeming to presume that judgment inevitably would be rendered against him. The substitute plaintiff argues that this claim is not reviewable because no claim of judicial bias was ever brought to the attention of the trial court. We agree with the substitute plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In order to preserve a claim for appellate review, it generally must have been distinctly raised to and decided by the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ;\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Munsill-Borden Mansion, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415250\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/147/30/#p36\">\n    147 Conn.

Accordingly, some preliminary statement of the defendant's indebtedness was filed more than five days before the hearing on the motion for a judgment of foreclosure. Four days before the hearing on the motion, the substitute plaintiff also filed and served an updated affidavit of debt. The defendant, in requesting a continuance of the motion, raised to the court that the substitute plaintiff had filed the updated affidavit of debt and other paperwork only a few days prior to the hearing. The defendant, however, never made any reference to Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 or a five day notice period, nor did he argue that the updated affidavit of debt or other submissions were inadmissible as evidence of the amount of indebtedness because they were not timely filed. Because those issues were not raised distinctly before the trial court, they are not properly before this court on appeal.

With respect to fraud, the defendant first asserted that he had been unable to refinance his loan because of what he described as an unfair\n   prepayment penalty. Second, he asserted that the substitute plaintiff and its predecessors in interest utilized the London Interbank Offered Rate to set and adjust rates, despite knowing that it, according to the defendant, \"had been determined to be a fraudulent index.\" With respect to standing, the defendant first asserted his belief that errors had been made with respect to how the note and mortgage had been transferred and assigned and that so-called \"robo-signers\" may have been used to reconstruct documents. The defendant also asserted the \"possibility of bifurcation,\" which the defendant described as the note and mortgage having been legally separated and rendered unenforceable. The various arguments made by the defendant to the court, however, were unsupported by reference to any evidentiary submissions included as part of the summary judgment record, nor did he offer other evidentiary proof or affidavits in support of his arguments at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In support of its motion for summary judgment as to liability only, the substitute plaintiff's evidentiary submissions included copies of the note, the mortgage and relevant assignments. It also submitted a sworn affidavit from its loan servicing agent. The affidavit provided, inter alia, that the substitute plaintiff was the holder of the original note and the mortgagee of record, the note was in default for nonpayment, the defendant was provided notice of that default in accordance with the terms of the note and mortgage, and, as of that date, the defendant had not cured the default. This evidence, which was not countered by the defendant through his own evidentiary submission, was sufficient to establish the substitute plaintiff's prima facie case and there was no genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment as to liability. We conclude on the basis of our plenary review that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment as to liability only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We next turn to the defendant's claim that the court abused its discretion by not dismissing the foreclosure action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-19. The substitute plaintiff argues that the defendant has failed to brief this claim adequately and that he failed to preserve the claim for review because he never expressly moved for dismissal of the action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-19. We agree that the claim, even if preserved, is inadequately briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 17-19 provides: \"If a party fails to comply with an order of a judicial authority or a citation to appear or fails without proper excuse to appear in person or by counsel for trial, the party may be nonsuited or defaulted by the judicial authority.\" The defendant argues that the substitute plaintiff failed to comply with the court's May 6, 2015 order to advance the case within sixty days, instead filing its motion for summary judgment more than six months later. As the defendant acknowledges, however, he did not file a motion raising the substitute plaintiff's noncompliance until he objected to the motion for summary judgment. At that time, he renewed his request for a dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-3 for lack of reasonable diligence. He did not, however, invoke Practice Book \u00a7 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendant's appellate brief contains no citations to the record demonstrating that he ever asked the court to exercise its discretion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-19. Furthermore, his legal analysis is essentially limited to a single sentence: \"By not following the court's [May 6, 2015] order in a timely fashion, this case should have been dismissed with prejudice.\" The defendant has provided no analysis or cited any legal authority, however, suggesting that a court is required to exercise its discretion under Practice Book \u00a7 17-19 sua sponte. \"We are not required to review issues that\n   have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief.... Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Kelib\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Housing Finance Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034738\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/100/351/#p353\">\n    100 Conn.

With respect to this claim, the defendant's brief is inadequate in at least two ways. First, it is unclear from the brief whether the defendant's claim challenges the court's decision to render summary judgment as to liability, the judgment of strict foreclosure, or both. Second, the defendant's brief contains only bald citations to two out-of-state cases, presumably because he believes that those decisions support his claim. The defendant does not explain, however, how the cited case law is applicable to the specific facts of the present case, whether there is Connecticut authority on the question, or why this court should adopt the reasoning of the cited cases. \"[A]lthough we allow [self-represented] litigants some latitude, the right of self-representation provides no attendant license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Tonghini\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tonghini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20231\">\n    152 Conn.

We reject this claim and conclude on the basis of the record presented that the defendant failed to rebut the presumption that the substitute plaintiff has standing to prosecute this action as the holder of the note and mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion.

[If] a holder seeks to enforce a note through foreclosure, the holder must produce the note. The note must be sufficiently endorsed so as to demonstrate that the foreclosing party is a holder,\n   either by a specific endorsement to that party or by means of a blank endorsement to bearer. If the foreclosing party shows that it is a valid holder of the note and can produce the note, it is presumed that the foreclosing party is the rightful owner of the debt. That presumption may be rebutted by the defending party, but the burden is on the defending party to provide sufficient proof that the holder of the note is not the owner of the debt, for example, by showing that ownership of the debt had passed to another party. It is not sufficient to provide that proof, however, merely by pointing to some documentary lacuna in the chain of title that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   give rise to the possibility that some other party owns the debt. In order to rebut the presumption, the defendant must\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   that someone else is the owner of the note and debt. Absent that proof, the plaintiff may rest its standing to foreclose on its status as the holder of the note.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)

The defendant arguably raised standing both in objection to the motion for summary judgment and at the hearing on the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. Although neither judge filed a written memorandum of decision addressing standing, it nevertheless is implicit in the court's decision to grant the motion for summary judgment as to liability that it concluded there was no genuine issue of fact regarding the substitute plaintiff's status as the holder of the note or mortgage. In order to be entitled to summary judgment as to liability, the substitute plaintiff had to establish that there was no factual dispute as to its status as the holder of the note and mortgage. See\n   <em>\n    GMAC Mortgage, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415848\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/165/#p175\">\n    144 Conn.

Further, in rendering the judgment of strict foreclosure, the court implicitly rejected the defendant's suggestion at the hearing that it remained undetermined\n   whether the substitute plaintiff was \"the right holder.\" The defendant never sought an articulation of either the court's ruling on the motion for summary judgment or the judgment of strict foreclosure. An articulation is the proper vehicle to test whether a court has failed to consider or overlooked an argument properly raised. See\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brennan Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20677\">\n    316 Conn. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20957\">\n    113 A.3d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (responsibility of appellant to ask trial judge to rule on overlooked matter). Because the defendant has provided no support for his assertion that the trial court failed to consider his standing arguments, we reject that aspect of his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because standing can be raised at any stage of the proceedings, we next consider the merits of the standing arguments\n   briefed by the defendant on appeal. First, the defendant argues that the original plaintiff \"is not on file as licensed to do business in Connecticut,\" relying on a business inquiry search for The Bank of New York Mellon on the Secretary of the State's website. The defendant cites case law for the proposition that a plaintiff must have an actual legal existence and cannot bring an action using a fictitious name. Second, the defendant raises a number of allegations the gravamen of which is that the note and mortgage were transferred in violation of terms of the mortgage trust's pooling and servicing agreement. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that neither of the defendant's arguments implicates standing and that the record establishes that the substitute plaintiff has standing to assert its claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, the defendant's business inquiry search for The Bank of New York Mellon on the Secretary of the State's website, without more, is insufficient to establish as a matter of law that The Bank of New York Mellon is either an improper legal entity or a fictitious name. As the substitute plaintiff correctly notes in its appellate brief, the defendant's argument is belied by the fact that the Connecticut Department of Banking's website\n   includes The Bank of New York Mellon in its list of out-of-state banks operating branches in Connecticut. See Connecticut Dept. of Banking, Banks in Connecticut, available at http://www.ct.gov/dob/cwp/view.asp?a=2228&amp;q=296954&amp;dobNAV_GID=1660 (last visited May 30, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the defendant is not a party to the pooling and servicing agreement at issue.

The mortgage later was transferred during the pendency of the action to the substitute plaintiff, who was substituted in as the plaintiff. Along with its motion for summary judgment, the substitute plaintiff submitted an affidavit averring\n   that it was currently the holder of the note and the mortgage. Neither the factual allegations of the original plaintiff nor the affidavit submitted by the substitute plaintiff were disputed by any evidence provided by the defendant. At the time judgment was rendered, the substitute plaintiff demonstrated that it was in possession of the original note, which included an allonge with a specific endorsement to the substitute plaintiff. In addition, the substitute plaintiff presented to the court original copies of the mortgage and assignments. The defendant has failed to direct our attention to any evidence in the record that would rebut the presumption that the substitute plaintiff, as the holder of the note, owns the debt. Because the record before us establishes that the substitute plaintiff has standing, we reject the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   VIII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, the defendant claims that the court \"ignored fraud upon the court\" perpetrated by the substitute plaintiff. The defendant suggests that the substitute plaintiff (1) misrepresented to the court that it was the holder of the original note, (2) fabricated its excuse of waiting for the return of the original note as the reason for the delay in prosecuting the action, and (3) \"fabricated documents, used robo-signers and claimed money that was not due to them because they did not have the proper paperwork when the suit was initiated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In support of these assertions, the defendant makes reference to instances of bank fraud associated with the recent mortgage crisis but fails to cite to any evidence in the record indicating that this type of fraud occurred in his case. As we have indicated previously, \"we take seriously all allegations of fraud and misdeeds in the prosecution of residential mortgage foreclosure actions before the courts of this state. Some evidence suggesting actual wrongdoing, however, and not merely the specter of such, is necessary in order to set aside a final adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20790\">\n    151 Conn.

The defendant's unsupported claim that the court turned a blind eye to fraud in this case lacks merit, and, accordingly, we summarily reject it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded for the purpose of setting new law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Jacquelyn Costa Horsey and Sovereign Bank also are named as defendants in the foreclosure action.

Horsey II as the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The note originally was executed by the defendant in favor of Novastar Mortgage, Inc. (Novastar), and the mortgage securing the note was executed in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for Novastar and its successors and assigns. In October, 2008, MERS assigned the mortgage to the original plaintiff. The note was endorsed from Novastar to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the original trustee of the Novastar Mortgage Funding Trust 2005-2, and then from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., to the substitute plaintiff as the successor trustee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We note that the copy of the objection to the motion for summary judgment included in the defendant's appendix, although substantially similar, is not the objection filed with the court. Because our review is limited to the record before the trial court, any reference to the defendant's objection to the motion for summary judgment is to the objection that is contained in the trial court file.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The defendant submitted three documents: An article of unknown origin titled \"Robo-Signer Misdeeds May Help Homeowners\" attributed to Jorge Newbery; an incomplete copy of a Wikipedia article titled \"Libor scandal\"; and a search result page from a website called MERS ServicerID.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    \"In a mortgage foreclosure action, a defense to the amount of the debt must be based on some articulated legal reason or fact.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted)\n    <em>\n     Bank of America, N.A.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Chainani\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490382\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/670/#p484\">\n     174 Conn.

Although, unlike a defense to liability, a defense challenging the amount of the debt does not need to be disclosed prior to a judgment hearing, the defense nevertheless \"must be squarely focused on the amount of the debt rather than other matters that are ancillary to the amount of the debt, such as whether the loan is in default, which is a matter of liability, or challenges that attack the credibility of the affiant or defects in the execution of the affidavit itself.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490382\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/670/#p484\">\n     Id., at 487\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490382\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/670/#p484\">\n     166 A.3d 670\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . If a proper defense as to the amount of the debt is not pursued, Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a), which authorizes the plaintiff to prove the amount of the debt through affidavit and documentary submissions, is applicable.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490382\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/670/#p484\">\n     Id., at 486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490382\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/670/#p484\">\n     166 A.3d 670\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The defendant never advanced any theory of defense to the court related to the amount of indebtedness. Rather, he returned to challenges related to the substitute plaintiff's authority to prosecute the action and whether alleged irregular procedures regarding the assignment of the note and mortgage invalidated the foreclosure action; issues that already had been raised and implicitly rejected by the court in rendering summary judgment as to liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Even if we considered the merits of the defendant's claim, we are unconvinced on the basis of our review of the hearing transcript that there is any compelling argument for the finding of judicial bias in this case. Although the court mentioned several times that the defendant had been able to live at the foreclosed property for approximately seven years without paying his mortgage, those statements, rather than necessarily evincing bias, were made in response to the legal arguments of the defendant and in the context of assessing whether the defendant was prejudiced by the substitute plaintiff's purported lack of diligence in bringing the action to judgment following the granting of the motion for summary judgment as to liability. The court's assertions were factual and supported by the evidence and thus do not reflect bias.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    We feel compelled to note that the defendant has not distinctly raised or briefed as a claim on appeal whether the court properly denied his request for a continuance. It is well settled that \"[a] trial court holds broad discretion in granting or denying a motion for a continuance. Appellate review of a trial court's denial of a motion for a continuance is governed by an abuse of discretion standard that, although not unreviewable, affords the trial court broad discretion in matters of continuances.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Marshall\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Marshall\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1272459\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/71/565/#p574\">\n     71 Conn.

Given the equitable nature of foreclosure proceedings and the important interests at stake, we question the court's decision to adjudicate immediately the reclaimed motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, particularly in light of the defendant's request for a continuance and given that the court, immediately prior to the defendant's request, had set aside a disciplinary judgment of dismissal based on the substitute plaintiff's failure to exercise due diligence in prosecuting the action. We do not mean to suggest that the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant's request for a lengthy, two month continuance, which, as we have indicated, is not an issue that is properly before us because he has not raised it as a claim on appeal. We simply take this opportunity to suggest that it may have been equitable under the circumstance for the court to have provided the defendant some additional time to evaluate the revised documents submitted by the substitute plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
