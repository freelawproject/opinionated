The principal issue is whether exclusionary language in a policy issued to Woodbury Medical Center Associates, LLP (Woodbury Medical) by Selective Insurance Company (Selective) precluded coverage for an environmental personal injury claim by Theresa Wear and a per quod claim by Richard Wear (collectively the Wears).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Having considered the record in light of controlling law, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Woodbury Medical is the owner of an office building in Woodbury, New Jersey. Theresa Wear worked in the building as a registered nurse (RN) for Underwood\n   Medical Center. She claimed to suffer injuries due to exposure to alleged toxic conditions in the building. In their complaint against Woodbury Medical, the Wears averred that Theresa was injured due to \"exposure to mold and the HVAC [ (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) ] filter fragments from when the HVAC system was activated in the basement of the property.\" The Wears further averred that Woodbury Medical had a duty to keep the premises safe from: \"1) hazardous toxic condition[s]; 2) dangerous air pollutants; 3) aspergillus fungus/mold hazards; and 4) other environmental dangers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Selective issued a commercial umbrella and business owners insurance policy (the policy) to Woodbury Medical, which was in effect at the time of the Wears' claim. The policy provided Woodbury Medical with \"protection for business liability for any bodily injury 'to which this insurance applies.' \" The policy included a fungi or bacteria exclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. The following exclusion is added to Paragraph B.1., Exclusions - Application To Business Liability Coverage:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   q. Fungi or Bacteria\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) \"Bodily injury[,\"] \"property damage\" or \"personal and advertising injury\" which would not have occurred, in whole or in part, but for the actual, alleged or threatened inhalation of, ingestion of, contact with, exposure to, existence of, or presence of, any \"fungi\" or bacteria on or within a building or structure, including its contents,\n   <em>\n    regardless of whether any other cause, event, material or product contributed concurrently or in any sequence to such injury or damage\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) Any loss, cost or expenses arising out of the abating, testing for, monitoring, cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying, neutralizing, remediating or disposing of, or in any way responding to, or assessing the effects of, \"fungi\" or bacteria, by an insured or by any other person or entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   B. The following definition is added [to] Paragraph F. Liability And Medical Expenses Definitions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. \"Fungi\" means any type or form of fungus, including mold or mildew and any mycotoxins, spores, scents or by-products produced or release [sic] by fungi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Woodbury Medical notified Selective of the Wears' claim in May 2011. In August 2012, after conducting an investigation, Selective issued a denial of coverage letter referencing the exclusionary language in the policy. The letter stated that the \"policy in effect for Woodbury does not provide coverage for any and all bodily injuries alleged by Theresa Wear arising out of her exposure to mold, mildew, fungi or bacteria or medical expenses\" as they were, among other unrelated reasons, \"excluded by virtue of Fungi or Bacteria Exclusion Endorsement Forms ... contained in the policies.\" Selective did not issue a reservation of rights letter as it took the position that the anti-concurrent and anti-sequential language in the exclusion precluded coverage even if there were other causes which may have contributed to the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Woodbury Medical instituted an action against Selective, later amended, seeking a declaration that Selective was required to defend and indemnify Woodbury Medical in the Wears' litigation. Woodbury Medical moved for partial summary judgment. Selective filed a cross-motion for summary judgment maintaining there was no coverage for the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 9, 2015, the judge granted Woodbury Medical's motion for partial\n   summary judgment and ordered that Selective immediately fund Woodbury Medical's defense in the underlying action, reimburse Woodbury Medical for expenses it already incurred in the defense of the Wears' litigation, and pay attorneys' fees incurred by Woodbury Medical in the declaratory judgment action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a separate order, also dated January 9, 2015, the judge denied Selective's cross-motion for summary judgment. On January 22, 2015, in a supplemental order, the judge clarified that the January 9, 2015 order was \"to be considered an interlocutory order applying\n   <em>\n    ONLY\n   </em>\n   to the defense obligations of Selective ....\"\n   The supplemental order also provided that the trial in the declaratory judgment action was to be adjourned until a resolution was reached in the Wears' litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In reaching the determination on Selective's obligation to defend, the judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The [c]ourt certainly reviewed the factual basis as alleged by Ms. Ware, [sic] who claims that she suffered bodily injury as a result of exposure to hazardous conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I acknowledge that there is an allegation that relates to the mold, but I am in agreement with the plaintiff's counsel. There also definitely is an allegation that pertains to the fibers from the filter, the air conditioning system, or the filter fragments. It is an environmental hazard that is claimed. It is something besides the mold issue, the [c]ourt finds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I understand your arguments. But I do find that there has been an indication of other environmental damages and based on the case law, I find that there is a duty to defend in this instance. I have examined the complaint. I have reviewed the policy limitations. But if there are any doubts, they are to be resolved in favor of the insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the cases as cited by plaintiff's counsel, I do find that the insurance company is required to defend in this instance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [D]efendant does owe the plaintiff the duty in the underlying lawsuit. It's appropriate here because there is another cause for Ms. Ware's [sic] injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Selective moved for leave to appeal, which we denied. Selective then moved before the Law Division to stay the order compelling it to fund Woodbury Medical's defense, which was denied. Thereafter, Woodbury Medical moved to enforce litigant's rights and Selective cross-moved for reconsideration of both the order requiring Selective to provide a defense and the order denying a stay. The judge granted Woodbury Medical's motion to enforce litigant's rights and ordered Selective to pay Woodbury Medical counsel fees for its defense in the Wears' litigation within thirty days. Selective again moved for leave to appeal, which we denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   By agreement of the parties, the Wears' litigation was submitted to arbitration. At the conclusion of the testimonial hearing, the arbitrator rendered a one-page written award in favor of the\n   Wears for $300,000. The arbitrator noted that the award was for a \"claim by RN for workplace exposure to toxic aspergillus mold.\"\n   After the rendering of the award, the Wears and Woodbury Medical entered into a consent order amicably resolving the Wears' litigation. The consent order contained the following essential terms. A judgment would be entered in favor of the Wears against Woodbury Medical in the amount of $300,000. Woodbury Medical would assign its coverage rights to the Wears, who then bore the burden of proceeding against Selective \"with respect to Selective's obligation to indemnify [Woodbury Medical] for the claims brought and judgment obtained ... under liability insurance policies issued by Selective.\" The Wears would \"never ... execute upon [Woodbury Medical] or its assets, or those of its past, present and future principals ... in order to collect the [j]udgment, or ... in any other way seek payment of the [j]udgment or any other sum from [Woodbury Medical] ....\" The Wears relinquished all claims against Woodbury Medical whether or not they were successful against Selective. The order stated: \"[N]o injury was suffered by [the Wears] as a result of exposure to mold at premises owned by [Woodbury Medical].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Wears moved to intervene as plaintiffs in the declaratory action. Among other arguments, the Wears asserted Selective was obligated to pay the $300,000 judgment premised upon our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Griggs v. Bertram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"341694\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/88/347/\">\n    88 N.J. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20A.2d%20163\">\n    443 A.2d 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) and premised upon principles of equitable estoppel due to Selective's bad faith and wrongful refusal to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The motion to intervene was granted by order on June 26, 2015. The order limited intervention to \"coverage and/or indemnification under the policy of insurance issued to Woodbury Medical ....\" The order provided that the Wears were substituted for Woodbury Medical for the purpose of asserting indemnification only and not to assert claims for \"bad faith\" or failure to defend against Selective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In support of their motion, the Wears provided an expert report by Robert J. Laumbach, who opined that mold was not a cause of\n   Theresa's injuries. Selective moved to bar the expert report and for summary judgment dismissing the Wears' intervention. Selective argued the consent order was unenforceable based upon\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By order of December 23, 2015, the judge denied all motions. In her attached statement of reasons, the judge found a\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   analysis was triggered as Selective wrongfully denied Woodbury Medical a defense by continuously failing to comply with the January 9, 2015 order. The judge further noted that the \"\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   analysis is triggered regardless of whether an insurer ultimately prevails on the question of coverage pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Passaic Valley\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge held that the issue of bad faith pertaining to the settlement remained open \"pending future discovery and/or future [m]otion practice.\" Regarding the issue of the expert's report, the judge held the Wears' expert was not barred from testifying since \"[t]he present action, though related to the underlying Wear matter, is a separate, distinct case with a separate discovery period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 20, 2016, Selective filed a motion to settle the form of the December 23, 2015 orders and to determine the scope of the hearing to be conducted. The Wears cross-moved for partial summary judgment under the reasonableness prong of the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   analysis. Thereafter, by consent\n   order dated February 26, 2016, the Wears and Selective settled the terms of the December 23, 2015 orders. The consent order provided that the monetary settlement between Woodbury Medical and the Wears based upon the arbitration award satisfied the reasonableness prong under\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   . The consent order further provided that the sole issue in contest was whether the settlement between Woodbury Medical and the Wears was made in good faith. The good faith issue was to be determined by the judge on the papers submitted.\n   After argument and after considering the record and papers, the judge issued an oral opinion in which she held that the Wears did not meet the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   settlement enforcement analysis. The judge found a lack of good faith as \"there [has] been a total effort made by the Wears and Woodbury Medical to force this issue to be covered by Selective because they knew of the mold exclusion ....\" As such, the judge found the settlement \"which places a 100 percent liability on Selective,\" to be a sham and concluded the settlement was unenforceable against Selective. The oral decision was memorialized in an order. The order also dismissed the intervenor complaint with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Wears filed a motion for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion was denied in an August 2016 order. The Wears filed an appeal. Selective filed a separate appeal of numerous orders concerning its duty to defend and to pay counsel fees as well as the denial of stays.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We granted Selective's motion to consolidate the appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On appeal, Selective raises the following points:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT REQUIRING SELECTIVE TO DEFEND WMCA DESPITE THE CLEAR EXCLUSION OF COVERAGE FOR INJURIES CAUSED BY MOLD, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY OTHER CAUSE CONTRIBUTED CONCURRENTLY OR IN ANY SEQUENCE TO THE ALLEGED INJURIES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    POINT II\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT MISCONSTRUED\n   <em>\n    FLOMERFELT V.

Selective argues \"[t]here was no allegation that [Theresa] suffered divisible injuries due to separate and discrete etiologies or that exposure to mold was not a principal cause of her symptoms.\" As such, the policy's exclusion, which included anti-concurrent and anti-sequential language, barred coverage. Woodbury Medical argues in reply that Selective had a duty to defend as the Wears alleged alternative causes of injury, separate and apart from mold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The judge's determination that Selective had a duty to defend was decided by the grant of summary judgment. Thus, the\n   judge's conclusions and interpretation of the record are not entitled to our deference.

As noted, the policy at issue contains within the exclusion language an anti-concurrent and anti-sequential clause and excludes coverage from any loss or damage \"regardless of whether any other cause, event, material or product contributed concurrently or in any sequence to such injury or damage.\" We do not consider the exclusion language to be ambiguous.

The judge found that the complaint averred other \"environmental\" hazards as causative factors thus requiring a defense.

Therefore, as in\n   <em>\n    Grand Cove II\n   </em>\n   , we hold that the duty to defend should be converted to a duty to reimburse pending resolution of the coverage action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Given our determination that the decision obligating Selective to defend was premature, it follows that the decision holding that\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   applied was without basis. The predicate for the application of\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   is whether there was a breach of duty by Selective by its failure to defend Woodbury Medical. Only if Selective was determined to be in default of that duty would it trigger indemnification. In\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Where an insurer wrongfully refused coverage and a defense to its insured, so that the insured is obliged to defend himself in an action later held to be covered by the policy, the insurer is liable for the amount of the judgment obtained against the insured or of the settlement made by him.
