We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   LD is a male child who was born on September 14, 2016. ALJ's Findings of Fact (F.F.) No. 1. On October 5, 2016, the Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth and Families (OCYF) filed an application for emergency protective custody of LD with the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County-Juvenile Division (Court of Common Pleas). F.F. No. 2. The Court of Common Pleas granted legal custody of LD to OCYF and later determined LD to be a dependent child by order dated November 4, 2016. F.F. No. 3. The hospital discharged LD on October 8, 2016, and OCYF placed LD in foster care in Petitioners' home. F.F. No. 4. LD remained in Petitioners' foster care for seven months. F.F. No. 5. On or about May 12, 2017, the Court of Common Pleas ordered that physical custody of LD remain with Petitioners and that legal custody remain with OCYF, but it also granted OCYF the authority to place LD with a relative by agreement. F.F. No. 6; Court of Common Pleas 5/12/17 Permanency Review Order (P.R. Order), Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 5b-6b. The Court of Common Pleas found that OCYF had been working with the maternal grandmother as a possible placement for LD. 5/12/17 P.R. Order, S.R.R. at 6b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 23, 2017, OCYF removed LD from Petitioners' foster care and placed LD with his maternal grandmother. F.F. No. 7. On that same day, Petitioners filed an administrative appeal with the Department challenging the removal of LD and requesting that LD be returned to their foster care. F.F. No. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also on May 23, 2017, Petitioners filed two motions with the Court of Common Pleas, a motion to stay removal and a motion to intervene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   F.F. No. 9. The Court of Common Pleas denied the motions, but, on June 2, 2017, held a status review hearing to consider Petitioners' evidence regarding LD's placement. F.F. No. 10. On June 2, 2017, the Court of Common Pleas issued an order confirming the placement of LD with his maternal grandmother. F.F. No. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 25, 2017, the Department issued an order to show cause as to why Petitioners' appeal with the Department should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. F.F. No. 13. Petitioners responded, arguing that they lacked advance written notice, asserting their right to a due process hearing and reiterating their desire for LD to be placed in their home. F.F. No. 14. On August 22, 2017, the Department conducted an administrative hearing on the issue of its jurisdiction. F.F. No. 15. At all times relevant to the appeal before the Department, the dependency case regarding LD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   had remained open in the Court of Common Pleas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   F.F. No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 11, 2017, the ALJ issued an Adjudication and Recommendation. The ALJ determined that LD's placement was under the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas and that the Department was without authority to issue a contrary order. Adjudication at 4. The ALJ determined that the appeal was prohibited by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.73\">\n    55 Pa.

However, even where an appeal is technically moot, \"where the conduct complained of is capable of repetition yet likely\n   to evade review, where the case involves issues important to the public interest or where a party will suffer some detriment without the court's decision,\" a court may proceed to address the merits of a claim.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Therefore, we will address the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioners argue that they were denied due process when LD was removed from their care essentially without notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard and without being afforded the appeal process they claim is guaranteed to them pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.73\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3700.73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners argue that the Department erred and abused its discretion in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Petitioners' appeal.

Code \u00a7 3700.73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , foster parents may appeal the relocation of a child from the foster home except in five enumerated circumstances; they contend none of those exceptions apply here. The Department, however, ruled that one of the five exceptions applied, in particular, the exception that the removal was initiated by the court per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.73\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3700.73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Petitioners disagree and maintain that the Department's determination is against the weight of the evidence because LD's removal from the foster home was \"initiated\" by OCYF, not the Court of Common Pleas. Petitioners argue that OCYF initiated the request to have LD declared dependent and then, ultimately, to remove LD from the foster home. Petitioners assert that the Court of Common Pleas only responded to OCYF's request to have LD removed upon agreement of the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Petitioners also argue that the Department erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction because the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction with regard to the dependency of LD and could not grant the relief sought. Petitioners maintain that foster parents come into existence only because a court of common pleas has jurisdiction and, pursuant to that jurisdiction, has found a child to be dependent. Petitioners' Brief at 12. Petitioners argue that all five exceptions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.73\">\n    55 Pa.

Petitioners point out that the \"agreement\" did not involve them because they lacked standing in the Court of Common Pleas to participate as a party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners argue, therefore, that the reasoning applied by the Department effectively eliminates all appeals by foster parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Juvenile Act\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The provisions of the Juvenile Act apply to proceedings in which a child is alleged to be dependent.\n   <em>\n    Sanner v.

However, on July 1, 2011, Pennsylvania Rule of Juvenile Court Procedure 1606 became effective, and that rule requires the county agency to seek\n   court permission prior to a change in placement, except in an emergency when a judge cannot be reached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.J.C.P. 1606(A)(2) (stating that in non-emergent cases, \"the county agency shall seek approval of the court for a change in the child's placement prior to the removal of the child from the placement by the filing of a motion or a stipulation for modification of the dispositional order\"). Even in emergency situations, however, the county agency must file a motion by the next business day following the child's placement. Pa.R.J.C.P. 1606(A)(1)(c).

Thus, up to the effective date of Pennsylvania Rule of Juvenile Court Procedure 1606, there were circumstances where a child's relocation from foster parent care could have occurred without court initiation.
