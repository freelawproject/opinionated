The actions were consolidated on the applications for attorney fees. Miele Sanitation Company (Miele) cross appeals from the denial of his motion for attorney fees pursuant to the Statute in one of the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">The first action, referred to as the \u201cland transfer\u201d action, was brought against all interested parties and challenged the transfer of land by the Borough of Closter (Borough or Closter) to Joseph Miele and Gloria Miele (the Mieles). Although the land was zoned for residential purposes, plaintiff alleged that the Mieles purchased it for use in an industrial waste operation. The court dismissed this complaint as woefully late and upon Closter\u2019s motion, granted Closter frivolous litigation fees of $4,331.21. On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed both the dismissal of plaintiffs underlying complaint and the award of attorney fees to Closter against plaintiff and, upon Closter\u2019s motion, awarded it attorney fees of $1,500 and disbursements of $471.53 pursuant to the Statute for plaintiffs frivolous appeal. Subsequently, the Supreme Court granted plaintiffs petition for certification and \u201csummarily remanded [the matter] to the Appellate Division for reconsideration [of the attorney fee award] in light of <em>McKeown</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>-Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel and Casino, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>546, [626 A.2d 425] (1993).\u201d The Appellate Division again affirmed, and the Supreme Court denied certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The second action is referred to as the \u201cgarbage contract\u201d action. Under an agreement dated June 12, 1991, incorporating the settlement of a prior dispute between Miele and Closter, Miele agreed to provide solid waste transfer station services to Closter for two years at a fixed rate for all waste types, notwithstanding the fact that Miele\u2019s cost to dispose of Closter\u2019s bulky waste might exceed the fixed rate charged to Closter. In this action, although plaintiff sought to set aside the contract, he sued only the Borough, deliberately omitting Miele as a defendant, allegedly because of a pending defamation suit brought by Miele against him. The garbage contract complaint alleged that the Borough\u2019s acceptance of a new contract with Miele \u201cis injurious to the taxpayers of Closter ... [because] the new contract forgives any funds or interest due the Borough from the prior contract.\u201d Plaintiff sought to have \u201cthe new contract, in that portion which forgives funds due the Borough on the prior contract\u201d declared invalid and sought to require the Borough to recoup such funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Prior to agreeing to this settlement, Closter considered the alternatives of pursuing legal action to recoup from Miele approximately $42,000 in alleged overpayments, as well as performing solid waste disposal services itself. Closter rejected these alternatives on three grounds. First, after thorough study of the matter, including a public hearing at which time plaintiffs objections were considered, Closter decided that it would not be cost effective to conduct its own solid waste disposal services because of the costs associated with the acquisition of additional facilities, the purchase of necessary equipment and the prohibitive costs of hiring of personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Second, when Closter had offered the new contract for bid in the preceding November, there were no bidders. A rebid failed to elicit any response. As Borough Councilman Farber explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>So our alternative was to either negotiate with Mr. Miele, who was the only contractor that was interested, or to start buying our own facilities, our own equipment, to do the work ourselves. The Council has made a policy decision that it is better to negotiate with Mr. Miele \u2014 which they feel is a good contract \u2014 and anyway, I feel it\u2019s a good contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Third, given the uncertainty of prevailing in a recoupment action against Miele, the Borough decided that legal action was inadvisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">At the outset, we must examine the background of the relationship that existed between plaintiff and Miele when plaintiff initiated this complaint to determine why plaintiff filed suit to set aside the garbage contract, failed to name Miele as a party to the action either at the outset or upon receipt of Closter\u2019s answer noting this deficiency and conducted lengthy and aggressive discovery against Miele and Closter, yet permitted his complaint to be dismissed with prejudice for failure to answer one Interrogatory-</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">As plaintiff has reiterated in numerous certifications and briefs, for three and one-half years he and Miele were embroiled in a libel action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed by Miele against plaintiff as the result of articles plaintiff published in his \u201ccommunity newsletter,\u201d the <em>Informed Citizen in Closter </em>(I.C.I.C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">After Miele initiated the libel suit, plaintiff filed numerous complaints and court actions implicating Miele, including the land transfer and garbage contract cases and a challenge to Miele\u2019s farmland assessment and demand for rollback taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, plaintiff challenged a Department of Environmental Protection permit issued to Miele and lodged numerous complaints against him and his company with local, county, state and federal agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>for incidents dating back to mid-1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, plaintiffs own certification attests to his enmity for Miele: \u201cNot only is Miele the Borough Bully, who was found <em>guilty of </em>criminally <em>assaulting </em>Rosenblum and Hoppe (and hijacking their vehicle to subsequently claim a trespass), but a totalitarian Big Brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Plaintiffs putative purpose for commencing the garbage contract action and pursuing what he has consistently characterized as a \u201cpublic interest\u201d action was to compel the Borough to \u201crecover an overcharge approximating $42,000 from Miele.\u201d When the case initially came on for trial on July 7, 1992, the trial judge declared a mistrial because of plaintiffs failure to prepare his case. Despite the trial judge\u2019s warning that plaintiff faced a difficult burden of proof, plaintiff vigorously continued to pursue the garbage contract action, engaging in extensive discovery with reference to both Closter and Miele for the next twenty months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, when plaintiff spent seven months opposing a trial court order requiring him to answer one Interrogatory propounded by Miele \u2014 including filing at least three motions in the Law Division and six interlocutory motions in the Appellate Division, which were all denied \u2014 the trial court sanctioned plaintiffs conduct. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>also awarded Closter fees pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:17-5(d), which are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">As a justification for filing the law suit, plaintiff has asserted that Closter\u2019s decision to settle the overcharge dispute with Miele was detrimental to the interests of Borough taxpayers, but nonetheless he sued only Closter. The basis of plaintiffs action was a conclusory allegation of \u201cchicanery and corruption between Miele and Closter officials, including the $42,000 overcharge by Miele on the garbage contract.\u201d Closter asserted in its answer that it had exercised its judgment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3 and 59:3-2 and that plaintiff had failed to join an indispensable party, Miele, without whom the action could not proceed. <em>See R. </em>4:28-1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Closter filed a third party complaint against Miele, not because it doubted the wisdom of the settlement, but because it then could still pursue its claim of overcharges against Miele in the event the settlement was set aside by the court. This was a required pleading under <em>R. </em>4:30A; otherwise, Closter would have been barred by the entire controversy doctrine from later pursuing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">At least as early as August 1992, plaintiff was aware that even if he succeeded in having the Borough recoup the entire $42,000, that amount would have been reduced by Closter\u2019s legal fees which at that point were by plaintiffs own calculations approximately $29,000. Ultimately, plaintiffs persistence in pursuing this \u201cpublic interest\u201d lawsuit cost Closter almost $38,000<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">On October 27, 1992, plaintiff was ordered to answer Miele\u2019s Supplemental Interrogatory No. 1 within twenty days and if he failed to do so, \u201cplaintiffs complaint against Defendant [Borough of Closter] and the third party complaint against third party defendant shall be dismissed without prejudice; said dismissal to be effective on the twentieth (20th) day following the day of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Order without further notice.\u201d By order dated March 19, 1993, the court, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:23-5(a)(2), converted the October 27, 1992, order of dismissal without prejudice into a dismissal with prejudice for plaintiffs failure to comply with the discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Closter subsequently filed a motion in the garbage contract action seeking attorney fees and litigation costs pursuant to the Statute in the amount of $32,882.23.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 24, 1993, the trial court granted Closter\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The Mieles originally made no application for attorney fees in the land transfer case, but instead made one motion for fees pursuant to the Statute for both actions at the conclusion of the garbage contract case. On October 21, 1993, the trial court awarded the Mieles attorney fees pursuant to the Statute against plaintiff in the amount of $4,271.75 for the land transfer case. However, it denied Miele\u2019s request for attorney fees of $9,012.50 for the garbage contract case because \u201cMiele Sanitation Company was not named as a direct Defendant by Plaintiff Jesse Rosenblum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Plaintiff challenges the award of attorney fees to the Mieles in the land transfer case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Sometime in 1988, Joseph Miele proposed that the Borough consider a sale of certain Borough-owned land. After extensive public hearings, the Mayor and Council adopted resolutions authorizing the sale of the property. After rejecting two private bids (one from Miele and one from plaintiff herein), the Borough offered the property at a public sale. It received only one bid, that of the Mieles for $126,000, which was found to be in order and accepted by the Borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>More than two years later, plaintiff filed a verified complaint in lieu of prerogative writs seeking to rescind the sale to the Mieles, which named both Closter and the Mieles as defendants. The trial court dismissed the complaint as woefully late, and awarded frivolous litigation fees to Closter in the amount of $4,331.21, both of which orders were upheld on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Upon the Mieles\u2019 application for attorney fees pursuant to the Statute, the trial court properly decided that its original finding as to the frivolous nature of the complaint was the law of the case. <em>Khoudary v. Salem County Bd. of Social Servs., </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 575, 658 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.1995). The judge noted: \u201cI have already made substantial findings about the nature of [plaintiffs] behavior with respect to this case and how egregious it was.\u201d At the hearing, plaintiff offered no evidence to indicate that his claims against the Mieles were any different than those he asserted against Closter, nor could there have been any such evidence since all defendants were equally affected by plaintiffs frivolous complaint. The trial court properly awarded the Mieles\u2019 attorneys $4,271.75 for the filing of this frivolous complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s order awarding frivolous litigation fees to the Mieles in the land transfer ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Plaintiff also challenges the award of attorney fees to Closter in the garbage contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Citizens should have ready access to all branches of government, including the judiciary. <em>McKeown-Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 561-62, 626 A.2d 425 (citing <em>Iannone v. McHale, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 27, 583 A.2d 770 (App.Div.1990)). Unless a litigant knows, or should know, that a complaint is without reasonable basis, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1a(2), he or she should not be deterred from filing a complaint which challenges the action of a public entity or public official. We do not suggest, however, that a citizen who questions a governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>decision not to pursue a claimed overcharge without considering purported valid reasons therefor should be subject to frivolous litigation fees for filing a complaint against all indispensable parties to compel governmental action.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">However, when a plaintiff deliberately fails to name an indispensable party even after immediately being specifically informed of this deficiency, <em>see R. </em>4:28-1(a), and continues extensive discovery for twenty months for a cause of action that clearly cannot succeed, that plaintiff is subject to being assessed attorney fees under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Plaintiffs claim could not have been adjudicated without the presence of Miele in this suit. <em>See Iannone v. McHale, supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 30-31, 583 A.2d 770 (holding that the candidate whose election is challenged is a necessary party to an action seeking to nullify the election results). Moreover, considering plaintiffs actions on an objective basis, <em>Khoudary v. Salem County Bd. of Social Servs., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 88, 615 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1992) (citing <em>Iannone v. McHale, supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 583 A.2d 770), no reasonable person would believe that he or she could rescind a party\u2019s contract without joining that party in the action. <em>See Fagas v. Scott, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 189, 597 A.2d 571 (Law Div.1991) (holding that a claim is frivolous or groundless where no rational argument can be advanced in its support, or it is not supported by any credible evidence, or a reasonable person could not have expected its success, or it is completely untenable).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Plaintiffs reliance on <em>McKeown-Brand </em>to shield him from application of the Statute is misplaced. <em>McKeown-Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>546, 626 A.2d 425. In that case, the Supreme Court specifically stated that the Statute cannot be applied against attorneys or parties who rely on their attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 557-558, 626 A.2d 425. Except with respect to a discovery matter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> plaintiff acted <em>pro se. </em>He did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>rely upon the advice of any attorney until the applications for frivolous litigation attorney fees were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">There are two instances in which, if the judge finds \u201con the basis of the pleadings, discovery, or the evidence presented\u201d that \u201ca complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or defense of the nonprevailing person was frivolous,\u201d the Statute authorizes an award of reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs to a prevailing party. N.J.S.A. 2A: 15-59.1. The first is where the \u201ccomplaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or defense was commenced, used or continued in bad faith, solely for the purpose of harassment, delay or malicious injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1b(1). The second justification exists where the judge determines that \u201c[t]he non-prevailing party knew, or should have known, that the [pleading] was without any reasonable basis in law or equity and could not be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Here, the trial court expressly determined that plaintiffs garbage contract complaint was frivolous under the latter circumstance, <em>i.e., </em>that it lacked a reasonable basis. In awarding frivolous litigation fees the trial judge found that there was not a scintilla of evidence that the Borough\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious or fraudulent. He found instead that plaintiff simply opposed the settlement and therefore sued \u201cthese people [to] run up a bill that\u2019s $32,000 in an effort to save him 49 [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Procedural rules are not abrogated or abridged by plaintiffs <em>pro se </em>status. This point was emphasized by this court in <em>Tuckey v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 224, 565 A.2d 419 (App.Div.1989), when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">Litigants are free to represent themselves if they so choose, but in exercising that choice they must understand that they are required to follow accepted rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>procedure promulgated by the Supreme Court to guarantee an orderly process. Such litigants are also presumed to know, and are required to follow, the statutory law of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The judge found here that \u201cplaintiff, though not a lawyer, is not unfamiliar with the legal system in this county and this state.\u201d The judge pointed out that \u201cthis plaintiff engaged in serious and aggressive discovery\u201d in \u201clitigation [which] from the beginning [was] frivolous\u201d and \u201cwas filed without any hope of a serious recovery.\u201d Realistically, \u201cno reasonable person could have expected its success.\u201d Having so determined, there was no need for the trial court to decide the issue of plaintiffs bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">There is absolutely no evidence that the Borough acted arbitrarily, capriciously or fraudulently. It merely acted in a manner with which plaintiff disagreed. Moreover, Closter consistently maintained that the settlement was reached after it gave due consideration to other alternatives, <em>i.e., </em>pursuing legal action to recoup any overcharge and undertaking its own solid waste disposal services, but rejected those alternatives as uncertain and too costly.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Although the trial court offered plaintiff the opportunity to have a hearing on the issue of his state of mind, plaintiff declined. Plaintiff has never indicated that he was unaware that he could not obtain relief without suing Miele nor that he was unfamiliar with the law that municipal action cannot be reversed unless it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Contrary to plaintiffs argument that the trial court concluded that plaintiffs litigation was frivolous because it had been dismissed for failure to provide discovery, plaintiffs complaint was deemed frivolous because it lacked any reasonable basis in law or in equity. More precisely, plaintiff failed to articulate how or why Closter\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious or fraudulent. He allegedly believed that his judgment was better for Closter than was the collective judgment of its elected officials. What makes plaintiffs filing of the complaint even more egregious is that relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>was impossible, since he deliberately failed to name an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">There is ample evidence to support a reasonable inference, as Closter argues, that plaintiffs enmity for Miele provided the initial impetus for this lawsuit and was the driving force behind its continuance. Unfortunately, Closter was the vehicle that plaintiff used to carry out this vendetta. Not only was plaintiffs complaint initiated without any basis in law or in equity, it was continued for twenty months during a period when plaintiff knew or should have known, using either a subjective or objective standard, that there was no legal or equitable basis for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Plaintiffs complaint was frivolous under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1b(2) and, therefore, we find it unnecessary, as did the trial court, to determine whether it was also frivolous under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1b(1). We affirm the trial court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees and litigation costs to Closter.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">In the garbage contract case, Miele Sanitation Company cross-appeals from the order which denied it frivolous litigation attorney fees solely because plaintiff did not name Miele as a direct defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The garbage contract case cannot be viewed in a vacuum but must be assessed against the backdrop of the extensive history between the parties. When plaintiff initiated the complaint, he did not mention Miele except by reference, calling it a \u201csolid waste transfer station facility.\u201d Plaintiff had told the court at oral argument that he did not specifically name Miele because of Joseph Miele\u2019s pending defamation action, discussed <em>supra, </em>and plaintiffs fear that including Miele in this action would have been used against plaintiff in the libel case. However, since plaintiffs complaint dealt solely with a specific transaction between Closter and Miele and because the relief sought required Closter to recoup funds allegedly due to it from Miele, Closter set forth as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>separate defense that Miele was an indispensable party and joined Miele by third party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Thereafter, plaintiff fully litigated and participated in reciprocal discovery with Miele. It was Miele, for example, which had plaintiffs complaint stricken for plaintiffs failure to answer one Interrogatory propounded by Miele. It was only when the issue of frivolous litigation attorney fees was addressed that plaintiff raised the defense that Miele was not named a direct defendant and therefore should not be awarded frivolous litigation attorney fees. The trial judge indicated in his oral opinion that, but for the narrow construction of the <em>McKeown-Brand </em>case, he would have awarded attorney fees to Miele.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Plaintiff now seeks to use his intentional failure to name a necessary and indispensable party to bar Miele from relief under the Statute. It is tortured logic to permit plaintiff to fully participate in reciprocal discovery with Miele and in every other aspect of the legal proceeding, and then be able to hide behind the defense that he did not name Miele as a party to the proceeding. Plaintiff knew of the legal standard of proof (which he never denied), yet chose to completely ignore it in his attempt to destroy Miele\u2019s contract rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It would be contrary to the legislative intent in adopting the Statute, and inherently unfair, to permit plaintiff to escape from having attorney fees assessed against him despite discovery because plaintiff deliberately did not name Miele. Without question, Miele has suffered the hardship of the frivolous litigation instituted by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">A plaintiff initiating a law suit is not immune from frivolous litigation sanctions simply by scrupulously avoiding naming an indispensable party to the suit. The plaintiff who deliberately fails to name an indispensable party to a frivolous law suit can reasonably expect the named defendant to make a third party complaint against the indispensable party, particularly where, as here, no relief can be obtained without that party. <em>R. </em>4:28-1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The Statute indicates that fees may be awarded to \u201c[a] party who prevails ... against any other party.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1a. The relief that plaintiff sought was to rescind Miele\u2019s contract. Regardless of the fact that plaintiff deliberately did not join Miele as a direct defendant, Miele was a party and Miele prevailed against plaintiff who was unsuccessful in attempting to set aside Miele\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Legislature clearly intended to have a party compensated for defending frivolous litigation, whether or not he, she or it was deliberately omitted as a direct defendant. Therefore, Miele is entitled to recover attorney fees from plaintiff pursuant to the Statute for defending the garbage contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Because we have all the necessary information to determine the reasonable attorney fees incurred by Miele, and plaintiff has never questioned the reasonable value thereof, we exercise original jurisdiction in this matter, <em>R. </em>2:10-5, and determine, based upon Miele\u2019s attorney\u2019s certification of services, the amount payable by plaintiff to Miele for attorney fees in the garbage contract case to be $9,012.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We affirm the two orders awarding attorney fees and costs. We remand to the trial court to enter an order awarding Miele $9,012.50 against plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The libel action was filed in June 1988 and concluded in plaintiff's favor in December 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\"> The Tax Court invalidated farmland status for 1991 but declined to impose rollback taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> The record indicates that plaintiff made at least 128 complaints, either in newspaper articles or letters to various people and entities, including governmental agencies, regarding Miele.
