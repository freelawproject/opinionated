Pfundstein, for lack of jurisdiction. Because we have concluded that Omnicom\u2019s contacts in this forum are insufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over it, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In 1986, Pfundstein, a resident of New Jersey, entered into an Employment Agreement with Doyle Dane Bernbach Group, Inc., a New York corporation which was then in the process of merging with two other corporations to form Omnicom. Pfundstein was to serve as Omnieom\u2019s chief financial officer through 1991. Both Pfundstein and Doyle executed the Employment Agreement in New York. The Agreement included a New York choice-of-law provision. According to Omnicom, the Agreement was negotiated in New York; Pfundstein does not dispute this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In 1987, the parties decided to part company and in furtherance of that decision entered into a Severance Agreement which also included a New York choice-of-law provision. This Agreement was apparently negotiated in New York as well. Subsequently, Omnicom hand-delivered two copies of the Severance Agreement to Pfundstein at Pfundstein\u2019s New York office, for him to sign and return. The record contains no indication that Pfundstein signed these copies. However, five days later, Omnicom mailed two copies of a revised Severance Agreement to Pfundstein at his New Jersey home, where he signed them. These copies had already been signed by Omnicom but, pursuant to the Agreement, were not to become binding until Pfundstein returned one copy to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Among other provisions, the Severance Agreement stated that Pfundstein would be paid fringe benefits equal to those paid to former executives who occupied positions similar to the one he had previously occupied. In 1989, Pfundstein learned that other former executives were receiving salary continuation benefits while he was not. In response to his inquiries, a third agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>reached. This Salary Continuation Agreement was negotiated by phone and through the mail, between Omnicom in New York, and Pfundstein in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Thereafter Pfundstein discovered that other executives were receiving more salary continuation benefits than he had been accorded. Pfundstein filed suit against Omnicom for breach of the Severance Agreement alleging, among other things, that Omnicom misrepresented to him that there was parity between his Salary Continuation Agreement and those offered to similarly situated executives. Pfundstein served Omnicom pursuant to the long-arm statute, <em>R. </em>4:4-4(e), and Omnicom moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The record contains no indication that Omnicom has any direct contacts with New Jersey other than those detailed above. However, Omnicom is a holding company with various subsidiaries in the advertising business which place advertisements in the New Jersey media.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Omnicom\u2019s Secretary and General Counsel certified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">Omnicom sets financial targets for its subsidiaries____ But Omnicom\u2019s subsidiaries decide on their own how to meet those financial targets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">In addition, all of Omnicom\u2019s subsidiaries (a) keep their own books and bank accounts; (b) file their own income tax returns; (c) are managed by their own board of directors; (d) make their own personnel, marketing and management decisions; (e) direct their own day-to-day operations; and (f) otherwise operate as independent companies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Pfundstein countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">Omnicom controls the operations of the subsidiaries in a very real sense. Usually, the subsidiaries are 100% owned by Omnicom. While the local management is given fairly wide discretion in determining how to meet profitability goals set by Omnicom, Omnicom keeps close watch on the subsidiaries and stands ready to replace management of any subsidiary if it does not meet the goals set by Omnicom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">In denying Omnicom\u2019s motion, the trial judge held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">THE COURT: Okay. Looking at the similar circumstances of this situation this case, New York law applies. No question about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">However, I\u2019m satisfied with, while it\u2019s minimal, those minimal contacts between the defendant and the plaintiff as well as the fact that the defendant does have subsidiaries doing business in the State of New Jersey, extensive business in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>State of New Jersey that there\u2019s a sufficient contact with the State so as to defeat the defendant\u2019s application to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. So I\u2019ll deny the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Omnicom\u2019s attorney asked for clarification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">MR. KLAUSNER: Your Honor, for the record, you\u2019ve asserted general jurisdiction? Is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">THE COURT: Yes, let me just \u2014 okay, if you\u2019ll see my law clerk she\u2019ll give you copies of the order. Thank you, counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Omnicom moved for leave to appeal which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">New Jersey\u2019s long-arm statute permits service on nonresidents to the limits of due process. <em>Avdel Corp. v. Mecure, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>264, 268, 277 A.2d 207 (1971). For a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant consistent with due process, the nonresident must have \u201ccertain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 <em>U.S. </em>310, 316, 66 <em>S.Ct. </em>154, 158, 90 <em>L.Ed. </em>95, 102 (1945) (quoting <em>Milliken v. Meyer, </em>311 <em>U.S. </em>457, 463, 61 <em>S.Ct. </em>339, 342-43, 85 <em>L.Ed. </em>278, 283 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">These \u201cminimum contacts\u201d are measured differently depending on whether the case \u201carises out of or relates to\u201d them. <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>408, 414, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1872, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>404, 411 (1984). If a suit \u201carises out of or relates to\u201d the contacts, the state acquires personal jurisdiction if the nonresident \u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>235, 253, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>1228, 1239-40, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, 1298 (1958). This is called \u201cspecific jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Helicopteros, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 414 n. 8, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1872 n. 8, 80 L.Ed.2d at 411 n. 8. If the suit does not \u201carise[ ] out of or relate[ ] to\u201d the contacts, the state acquires personal jurisdiction if the contacts were \u201ccontinuous and systematic.\u201d <em>Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>342 <em>U.S. </em>437, 445, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>413, 418, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>485, 492 (1951). This is called \u201cgeneral jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Heli</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>copteros, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 415 n. 9, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1872 n. 9, 80 L.Ed.2d at 411 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It is not altogether clear from this record on what basis the trial judge allowed Pfundstein to invoke this state\u2019s jurisdiction. Pfundstein argues that facts supporting the exercise of specific and general jurisdiction were shown. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We turn first to specific jurisdiction. Pfundstein technically sued only on the Severance Agreement in order to invoke its benefits. However, even if the Salary Continuation Agreement, upon which he relies as establishing contacts for jurisdiction, is viewed as \u201crelated\u201d to his suit within the meaning of <em>Helicopteros, supra, </em>specific jurisdiction is absent. The Salary Continuation Agreement is connected to New Jersey only by the interstate phone and mail communications which led up to it. Those communications are insufficient to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction. The reason for this is that in order to exercise jurisdiction, in addition to a finding that the suit is \u201crelated\u201d to Omnicom\u2019s contacts with New Jersey through the Salary Continuation Agreement, there must be a showing that Omnicom \u201cpurposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d The \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d test ensures that states will only acquire specific jurisdiction over nonresident defendants when they \u201cshould reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>286, 297, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>559, 567, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 501 (1980). No such showing is possible based on the mail and telephone communications in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In <em>Lebel v. Everglades Marina, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>317, 558 A.2d 1252 (1989), the Supreme Court explored this issue. There, the plaintiff was a New Jersey resident who bought a racing boat from a Florida defendant. Having met the plaintiff at a boat show in New York, the defendant, from his home in Florida, telephoned the plaintiff in New Jersey some twenty times over the following two years to solicit and to negotiate the sale. Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>defendant mailed the contract to New Jersey for the plaintiff\u2019s signature. The only other New Jersey contact was that the defendant knew that the boat was destined for New Jersey even though its tender was in Florida. Although the Supreme Court approved a finding of specific jurisdiction over the defendant, it noted that \u201cthis result pushes at the \u2018outermost limit\u2019 of personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 558 A.2d 1252. In ruling, the Court made it clear that the phone calls were relevant because the defendant had tried to \u201ctap an interstate market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 558 A.2d 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The negotiation of the Salary Continuation Agreement in this case lacks that linchpin. It pl\u00e1inly was not an attempt by Omnicom to tap an interstate market or to avail itself of the privilege of doing business here. Rather, it was a \u201cfortuitous\u201d or \u201cattenuated\u201d contact between Omnicom and New Jersey by which Omnicom accommodated Pfundstein. <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>770, 774, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1473, 1478, 79 L.Ed.2d 790, 797 (1984). The purposeful availment test was simply not met by Omnicom\u2019s actions. Thus, the underpinnings for the exercise of specific jurisdiction are lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We turn next to Pfundstein\u2019s claim of general jurisdiction which is posited solely on the New Jersey contacts of subsidiary corporations wholly-owned by Omnicom. More specifically, Pfundstein alleges that subsidiaries of Omnicom place media advertisements for their clients\u2019 products in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">It is well-established that the forum contacts of a subsidiary corporation will not be imputed to a parent corporation for jurisdictional purposes without a showing of something more than mere ownership. <em>Unicon Investments v. Fisco, Inc., </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 349 A.2d 117 (Law Div.1975); <em>Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Akzo, N.V., 2 </em>F.3d 56 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Pathe Computer Control Systems Corp. v. Kinmont Industries, Inc., </em>955 F.2d 94 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Southmark Corp. v. Life Investors, Inc., </em>851 F.2d 763 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Lucas v. Gulf &amp; Western Industries, Inc., </em>666 F.2d 800 (3rd Cir.1981); <em>Stratagem Development Corp. v. Heron In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>tern. N.V., </em>153 <em>F.R.D. </em>535 (S.D.N.Y.1994); <em>Sammons Enterprises, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>205 <em>Cal.App.</em>3d 1427, 253 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>261 (1 Dist.1988). Each court which has considered this issue has engaged in its own articulation of the notion of what, in addition to mere ownership, is required for the contacts of a subsidiary to be imputed to a parent. Yet the articulations echo each other. For example, <em>Mylan, supra, </em>required that in order to subject the parent to jurisdiction based on the subsidiary\u2019s contacts, the parent must exert \u201cconsiderable control\u201d over the activities of the subsidiary. <em>Mylan, supra, </em>2 F.3d at 61. Likewise, in <em>Pathe, supra, </em>Judge (now Justice) Breyer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">[T]o assert jurisdiction over an outH&gt;f-state parent ... based on the forum contacts of its subsidiary requires rather special circumstances.... <em>See Donatelli v. National Hockey League, </em>893 <em>F.</em>2d 459, 466 (1st Cir.1990) (subsidiary\u2019s contacts with forum state apply derivatively to parent company ... \u201cwhere the parent is exercising <em>unusual hegemony </em>over the subsidiary\u2019s operations ...\u201d) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\"><em>[Pathe, supra, </em>955 <em>F.2d </em>at 96.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In <em>Sammons, supra, </em>the court held that a parent holding company \u201cis not subject to personal jurisdiction based solely on the independent activities of its wholly-owned subsidiary even where the parent exercises general executive responsibility for the operations of the subsidiary and reviews its major policy decisions.\u201d <em>Sammons, supra, </em>253 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 264-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Likewise in <em>Lucas, supra, </em>applying New Jersey law, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the New Jersey contacts of a subsidiary corporation will not be imputed to its parent corporation for jurisdictional purposes unless the subsidiary is \u201cmerely the alter ego or agent\u201d of the parent and unless the \u201cindependence of the separate corporate entities was disregarded.\u201d <em>Lucas, supra, </em>666 <em>F.</em>2d at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Pfundstein\u2019s reliance on <em>Stratagem, supra, </em>is misplaced. The factors taken into consideration by the court there are similar to those in <em>Southmark, supra, </em>and support Omnicom\u2019s position, not that of Pfundstein. Included are common ownership, financial dependency, interference with a subsidiary\u2019s selection of person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>nel, disregard of corporate formalities, and control over a subsidiary\u2019s marketing and operational policies. <em>Stratagem, supra, </em>153 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 546. In short, all of the cases resound a single theme: \u201cJudicial jurisdiction over a subsidiary corporation will give the state judicial jurisdiction over the parent corporation if the parent so controls and dominates the subsidiary as in effect to disregard the latter\u2019s independent corporate existence.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, </em>\u00a7 52 comment b (1969). <em>Unicon, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 402, 349 A.2d 117. <em>See also Moon Carrier v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 323, 379 A.2d 517 (Law Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Here, it is undisputed that all of Omnicom\u2019s subsidiaries (a) keep their own books and bank accounts; (b) file their own income tax returns; (c) are managed by their own boards of directors; (d) make their own personnel, marketing and management decisions; (e) direct their own day-to-day operations; and (f) otherwise operate as independent companies. While Pfundstein posits the legal conclusion that Omnicom \u201ccontrols the operations of the subsidiaries,\u201d even he acknowledges that the subsidiaries are given \u201cfairly wide discretion\u201d in meeting the profitability targets Omnicom sets. Omnicom simply does not exercise unusual hegemony over its subsidiaries, or dominate and control them so as to, in effect, disregard their independent corporate existence. As such, the contacts of the subsidiaries cannot be imputed to Omnicom and no general jurisdiction theory is viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Reversed and remanded for the entry of an order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
