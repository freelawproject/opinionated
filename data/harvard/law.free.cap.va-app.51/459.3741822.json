On appeal, Morris asserts the evidence failed to establish that the offenses were committed within the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cas the proper venue was not Hanover County, Virginia.\u201d The underlying argument to support Morris\u2019s assertion is that she was unconscious from a self-administered drug overdose when transported by emergency vehicle into Hanover County and, thus, she was not \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d in possession of the drugs in that venue. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">So viewed, the evidence proved that around midnight on December 12, 2005, Morris was transported by ambulance from a residence in Henrico County to a hospital in Hanover County. Hospital paramedic Vicki Merkle testified Morris was unresponsive when she arrived at the hospital and that she appeared to have overdosed on drugs. Merkle undressed Morris and discovered two syringes and a glass smoking device in Morris\u2019s right front pants pocket. From another pocket, Merkle removed a dollar bill exhibiting a white residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Deputy Steve Wills interviewed Morris in the hospital. Wills described Morris as being \u201cunconscious\u201d when he first encountered her. After she was revived, Wills advised Morris of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Morris admitted to Wills that although the syringes were \u201cclean\u201d she possessed them for the purpose of injecting heroin. She also stated the glass tube was a \u201ccrack stem\u201d that did not belong to her but that she had smoked crack cocaine out of it earlier that night. Finally, Morris told the deputy that the residue on the dollar bill was heroin. Testing confirmed the \u201ccrack stem\u201d and dollar bill contained traces of cocaine and heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In Morris\u2019s motions to strike, she argued, albeit obliquely, that the Commonwealth did not prove proper venue in Hanover County because the evidence failed to establish Morris knowingly possessed the drugs while in that county. She relies upon the uncontroverted evidence that she was unconscious when transported from Henrico into Hanover without her knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-239 confers jurisdiction on the respective circuit courts of this Commonwealth for \u201call presentments, indictments and informations for offenses committed within their respective circuits.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-239. Thus, a \u201ccriminal charge cannot be sustained unless the evidence furnishes the foundation for a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Keesee v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 174, 175, 217 S.E.2d 808, 809-10 (1975). \u201cThe burden is on the Commonwealth to prove venue by evidence which is either direct or circumstantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 217 S.E.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u201c \u2018Questions of venue must be raised before the verdict in cases tried by a jury and before the finding of guilt in cases tried by the court without a jury.\u2019 Code \u00a7 19.2-244. Otherwise the question of venue is waived.\u201d <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 378, 380, 368 S.E.2d 295, 297 (1988). When venue is challenged on appeal, we determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cwhether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to support the [trial court\u2019s] venue findings.\u201d <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 36, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 (1990). Venue depends on the \u201cnature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>328 U.S. 699, 703, 66 S.Ct. 1213, 1216, 90 L.Ed. 1529 (1946). When a crime\u2014if committed at all\u2014must have occurred within the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, appellate approval of the sufficiency of the evidence necessarily subsumes the question of venue. \u201cAccurately speaking,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court has explained, a venue challenge in such a case is nothing more than the defendant claiming \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to establish his presence ... where and when the crime was committed.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 583, 594, 50 S.E.2d 407, 412 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Morris does not contest that she actually possessed the narcotics in Hanover County or that she had knowingly and voluntarily possessed the drugs in Henrico. Instead, she contends that \u201c[s]ince [she] was never conscious when she entered Hanover County, she never knowingly and intentionally possessed cocaine or heroin in Hanover County. If there was an offense committed,\u201d she reasons, \u201cit should have been brought in Henrico County, not Hanover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u201cIn order to convict a person of illegal possession of an illicit drug, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the presence and character of the drug and that the accused consciously possessed it.\u201d <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 422, 426, 497 S.E.2d 869, 872 (1998) (citation omitted). The Commonwealth may prove possession of a controlled substance by showing either actual or constructive possession. <em>Birdsong v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 603, 607, 560 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2002). To establish possession in the legal sense, not only must the Commonwealth show actual or constructive possession of the drug by the defendant, it must also establish that the defendant intentionally and consciously possessed the drug with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>knowledge of its nature and character. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 666, 669, 418 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1992). \u201c \u2018Knowledge of the presence and character of the controlled substance may be shown by evidence of the acts, statements or conduct of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 447, 450, 281 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Here, the contraband was recovered from Morris\u2019s clothing. She admitted that initially she had purposely and intentionally possessed the items knowing they contained drugs. Thus, Morris had knowingly and voluntarily possessed the narcotics and exercised dominion and control over them. Morris does not contest this issue. The question, then, becomes whether Morris continued to be in knowing and voluntary possession of the drugs and was aware of their nature and character even though she was rendered unconscious before and during the time she was transported into Hanover County.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">A suspect\u2019s actual, physical possession of drugs permits the inference that he or she knowingly possessed them aware of their illegal nature and character. <em>See Hunley v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 556, 562, 518 S.E.2d 347, 350 (1999); <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 102, 114, 510 S.E.2d 247, 252-53 (1999); <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 754, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993); <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 87, 101, 390 S.E.2d 491, 498-99 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cWhen the drugs are found in the actual, physical possession of the accused, knowledge of <em>where </em>they were and the defendant\u2019s assertion of dominion are virtually incontrovertible; such possession is also evidence that the accused <em>knew </em>what he possessed.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Practice Series: Criminal Offenses &amp; Defenses </em>166 (2007-08) (emphasis in original); <em>see also State v. Reid, </em>151 N.C.App. 420, 566 S.E.2d 186, 192 (2002) (stating that the \u201cknowing possession\u201d element can be inferred from \u201cactual possession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Morris notes, however, that for venue to have been established in a particular city or county, all elements of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>must have been committed in that particular city or county, <em>see Green v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 438, 449, 528 S.E.2d 187, 192 (2000) (\u201c[V]enue is appropriate in any jurisdiction where the required elements of the offense have been established.\u201d), and here, the uncontroverted evidence is that Morris was unconscious from the time that she was transported into Hanover County without her knowledge or consent until the items containing the drugs were removed from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We hold that, because knowing and intentional possession of a controlled substance is an ongoing and continuing offense and because self-induced intoxication or unconsciousness will not be considered a defense to possession of drugs, venue was established in Hanover County.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u201cPossession is by nature a continuing offense.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Virginia, </em>653 F.2d 870, 875 (4th Cir.1980). <em>See also United States v. Muhammad, </em>502 F.3d 646, 653 (7th Cir.2007) (distribution and possession with intent to distribute are continuing crimes); <em>United States v. Medina, </em>992 F.2d 573, 587 (6th Cir.1993) (\u201cPossession with intent to distribute a controlled substance is a continuing offense____\u201d); <em>United States v. Uribe, </em>890 F.2d 554, 559 (1st Cir.1989) (possession with intent to distribute); <em>United States v. Stitzer, </em>785 F.2d 1506, 1519 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201c[Possession with intent to distribute is a continuing offense.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cA continuing offense is a continuous, unlawful act or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force, however long a time it may occupy. Where such an act or series of acts runs through several jurisdictions, the offense is committed and cognizable in each.\u201d <em>United States v. Midstate Horticultural Company, </em>306 U.S. 161, 166, 59 S.Ct. 412, 414, 83 L.Ed. 563 (1939). <em>See also Dunlavey v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 521, 35 S.E.2d 763 (1945) (when property is stolen in one county and the thief is found with goods in another, venue for larceny is proper in either); <em>Barber v. Commonwealth, 5 </em>Va.App. 172, 360 S.E.2d 888 (1987) (because conspiracy is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>continuing offense, venue may be proper in more than one place).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 319, 324-25, 563 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2002). Like larceny, possession of illegal narcotics continues during the entire time one is in possession of the items. In this case, Morris, by her own admission, consciously and intentionally possessed the narcotics. She actually possessed cocaine and heroin in Hanover County and admitted the items found on her person in Hanover were the same items she possessed in Henrico. The fact that she may have been unconscious when she was transported into Hanover does not negate the fact that she knowingly and intentionally possessed the narcotics when she chose to carry them on her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Furthermore, \u201c[ejxcept in cases of first degree and capital murder, where proof of voluntary intoxication may negate deliberation and premeditation, such intoxication, whether from drugs or alcohol, is no defense to a criminal charge.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 46, 52, 255 S.E.2d 475, 479 (1979) (citation omitted). Morris admitted having voluntarily administered the drugs prior to being transported to Hanover. Witness testimony corroborated this claim and established Morris voluntarily consumed enough narcotics to render herself unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u201cUnconsciousness is a state of mind of persons of sound mind suffering from some voluntary or involuntary agency rendering them unaware of their acts.\u201d <em>Greenfield v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 710, 714, 204 S.E.2d 414, 417 (1974). \u201c[S]elf-induced unconsciousness goes only to the grade of the offense and not to the existence of a complete defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Morris\u2019s self-induced intoxication rendering her unconscious from an overdose of illegal narcotics, does not negate the continuing offense of her knowingly and intentionally possessing the drugs found on her. Her knowing and intentional possession of the items continued as she was transported into another jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Proof of venue \u201c\u2018is not a part of the crime.\u2019\u201d <em>Randall v. Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 182, 187, 31 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1944) (quoting <em>Farewell v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 475, 479, 189 S.E. 321, 323 (1937)). Thus, the prosecution need not \u201cprove where the crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, since venue is not a substantive element of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Griley, </em>814 F.2d 967, 973 (4th Cir.1987). As noted above, it is enough that the evidence, direct or circumstantial, raises a \u201c \u2018 \u201cstrong presumption\u201d \u2019 \u201d that the crime occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. <em>Thomas, </em>38 Va.App. at 323, 563 S.E.2d at 408 (quoting <em>Pollard v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 723, 725, 261 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1980), quoting in turn, <em>Keesee, </em>216 Va. at 175, 217 S.E.2d at 810). In this case, because the evidence raises a strong presumption that the offense occurred in Hanover County, we find no error with the court\u2019s decision. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was competent, was not inherently incredible, and was sufficient to prove that appellant was guilty of possessing heroin and cocaine in Hanover County.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
