ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Thomas Edwin Dunnavant, Jr. sought death benefits as a dependent of Phillip Dale Pettus, an employee who died as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>result of a workplace accident at Newman Tire Company. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission found Dunnavant did not qualify as a statutory dependent and rejected his claim for death benefits. Dunnavant appeals, arguing the commission erred as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to Newman Tire Company, the prevailing party before the commission. <em>See Apple Constr. Corp. v. Sexton, </em>44 Va.App. 458, 460, 605 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2004); <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">So viewed, the evidence showed that Pettus died as a result of an injury at work. Claiming to be a statutory dependent, Dunnavant sought death benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-516. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, Dunnavant testified that he moved into Pettus\u2019s home in 1997. Though Dunnavant had worked various jobs in the past, he claimed he stopped working in 2000 after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. He offered the commission no medical reports or physician\u2019s testimony in support of this claim. Dunnavant also said he had been declared disabled by the Social Security Administration but offered no documentary evidence of such a declaration or copies of any SSA disability checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Dunnavant alleged Pettus paid the majority of Dunnavant\u2019s living expenses, while Dunnavant \u201ccontributed when [he] could\u201d to the joint grocery bills. His SSA disability checks, Dunnavant testified, paid for his prescription medications. No such bills were offered into evidence, however. Dunnavant also offered the testimony of his mother and two friends to corroborate his alleged need for support and Pettus\u2019s benevolence toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The deputy commissioner found this evidence insufficient to prove dependency under Code \u00a7 65.2-516. On review, the full commission unanimously agreed and held Dunnavant \u201cfailed to prove a relationship with the decedent beyond sharing a house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and the ensuing economic dependencies that this entails.\u201d <em>Pettus v. Newman Tire Co., Inc., </em>VWC File No. 208-08-12, 2007 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 637, at *18 (Apr. 20, 2007). The commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">From the evidence presented, he has the status of a housemate, a situation that arises under many circumstances, but does not indicate a dependent relationship beyond the sharing of a household. At best, the situation could be considered \u201cmutually assistive\u201d____ Here, the parties lack the status of a blood, marital, or legal relationship, and the claimant has failed to prove a mental or physical disability that caused his dependency and prevented him from earning a livelihood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>Id. </em>at *18-19. Because it was wholly \u201cunaccompanied by medical evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *19, the commission also found unpersuasive Dunnavant\u2019s testimony about the existence and extent of any medical condition justifying his claimed need for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">On appeal, Dunnavant argues that the commission misapplied the legal standard governing Code \u00a7 65.2-516 and erroneously failed to accept his testimony claiming to have been dependent on Pettus. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The workers\u2019 compensation statute divides dependents into two classes. The first involves individuals \u201cconclusively presumed\u201d to be dependents solely because of their familial relationship to the decedent. Code \u00a7 65.2-515(A). Subject to certain exceptions, this class includes spouses, minor children, destitute parents, and adult children who are disabled or attending school. <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-516 recognizes that the traditional definition of dependency, however, can extend beyond the nuclear family categories of Code \u00a7 65.2-515(A). In this second class, \u201cquestions of dependency in whole or in part shall be determined in accordance with the facts as the facts are at the time\u201d of the decedent\u2019s accident. Code \u00a7 65.2-516.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Because the statute \u201cdoes not define dependency or specify the indicia of that status,\u201d <em>Glassco v. Glassco, </em>195 Va. 239, 242, 77 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1953), membership in the second class of dependents depends on the \u201cfacts and circumstances of each particular case, from the amounts, frequency and continuity of actual contributions of cash or supplies, the needs of the claimants, and the legal or moral obligations of the employee.\u201d <em>Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Place, </em>150 Va. 562, 568, 143 S.E. 756, 758 (1928) (quoting <em>Md. Cas. Co. v. Campbell, </em>34 Ga.App. 311, 129 S.E. 447, 448 (1925)). The second class of dependents excludes a mere \u201csituation of mutual assistance\u201d between the decedent and the putative dependent. <em>Miller &amp; Long Co. v. Frye, </em>215 Va. 591, 594, 212 S.E.2d 258, 260 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">While the second class relies \u201cneither upon relationship nor presumption,\u201d it nonetheless must be predicated on specific factual circumstances qualifying the claimant for dependency status. <em>Place, </em>150 Va. at 569, 143 S.E. at 759. That status presupposes the decedent owed some form of \u201clegal or moral\u201d obligation of support, <em>id. </em>at 568, 143 S.E. at 758, thus distinguishing true dependency from being subsumed within the broader \u201ccategory of charity,\u201d <em>Morrell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>107 F.2d 34, 36 (3d Cir.1939). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit put the point this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">That concept [of dependency] has been defined with variations <em>ad nauseam, </em>by the legislatures and courts, especially in connection with workmen\u2019s compensation and wrongful death statutes. But all those definitions, statutory and judicial, comprehend an irreducible common denominator\u2014 actual support plus some form of preexisting and at least ethical obligation____ \u201cTrivial or casual, or, perhaps, wholly charitable assistance would not create the relationship of dependency.... Something more is undoubtedly required .... [I]t must, it would seem, rest upon some moral or legal or equitable grounds, and not upon the purely voluntary or charitable impulses or disposition of the member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Morrell, </em>107 F.2d at 35 (citations omitted). Thus, even if the decedent made contributions to the claimant, \u201cit is then necessary to determine whether or not the claimant was entitled, legally or morally, to consider the contributions received from decedent as part of his or her necessary livelihood\u201d sufficient to justify the claimant\u2019s claim of dependency. 2 William R. Schneider, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 367, at 1195 (2d ed. 1932).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In resolving the question of dependency, \u201ca wide discretion is vested\u201d in the commission \u201cto find as a fact whether the particular claimant is entitled to compensation\u201d as a dependent. <em>Place, </em>150 Va. at 567, 143 S.E. at 758; <em>see also Commonwealth v. McGuire, </em>188 Va. 444, 449, 50 S.E.2d 284, 287 (1948) (recognizing the commission\u2019s \u201cwide discretion\u201d in dependency cases). We employ a highly deferential standard of review of commission factfinding. \u201cThis appellate deference is not a mere legal custom, subject to a flexible application, but a statutory command making clear that the commission\u2019s decision \u2018shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology </em>As<em>socs. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 279, 590 S.E.2d 631, 639 (2004) (quoting Code \u00a7 38.2-5011(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In this case, Dunnavant was unrelated to Pettus and did not fit within the first class of individuals \u201cconclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>presumed\u201d to be dependents under Code \u00a7 65.2-515(A). Dunnavant instead had the burden of proving his status as a dependent within the second class of individuals covered by Code \u00a7 65.2-516. To prevail, therefore, Dunnavant\u2019s proof had to address the duration and scope of Pettus\u2019s \u201cactual contributions\u201d to Dunnavant\u2019s claimed \u201cneeds\u201d and whether Pettus owed some \u201clegal or moral\u201d duty to support Dunnavant. <em>Place, </em>150 Va. at 568, 143 S.E. at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">With respect to Pettus\u2019s contributions to Dunnavant\u2019s needs, the commission rejected the first premise of Dunnavant\u2019s claim\u2014that he had any <em>genuine </em>need of support. Dunnavant claimed to be unable to work because of a medical condition but offered no medical evidence to support his allegations. He claimed to have been declared disabled by the Social Security Administration but offered no documentary proof of this declaration. Because of this conspicuous lack of easily available corroborating evidence, the commission refused to accept Dunnavant\u2019s claim that he was medically prevented \u201cfrom earning a livelihood\u201d and thus in need of any support from Pettus or anyone else. <em>Pettus, </em>2007 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 637, at *19. We will not disturb this factual finding. No factfinder\u2014whether a commission, a jury, or a trial judge\u2014is required as a matter of law to accept as credible wholly unsupported assertions by a layman about the existence, extent, and duration of an allegedly debilitating medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We acknowledge Dunnavant\u2019s argument that, by considering the genuineness of his claimed need for support, the commission\u2019s reasoning (as well as ours) adds a showing of incapacity to the statutory definition of dependency under Code \u00a7 65.2-516. We find the criticism overstated, however. Because the statute does not \u201cdefine dependency or specify the indicia of that status,\u201d <em>Glassco, </em>195 Va. at 242, 77 S.E.2d at 845, we apply the traditional definition of dependency which accepts that \u201ca claim of dependency will meet defeat if it appears that the claimant by the expenditure of such effort as, under all circumstances, ought fairly and reasonably to be expected of him is of ability to be self and family supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>according to the proper measure of such support.\u201d 2 William R. Schneider, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 367, at 1201. It is the requisite focus on the claimant\u2019s actual needs, not any judicially imported requirement of incapacity, that undermines Dunnavant\u2019s claim of dependency status under Code \u00a7 65.2-516.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As for whether Pettus had any legal or moral duty to support Dunnavant, the commission found the evidence proved nothing more than a \u201cmutually assistive\u201d relationship between two Mends. <em>Pettus, </em>2007 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 637, at *18. At best, the commission pointed out, Dunnavant\u2019s testimony showed he had no more than the mere \u201cstatus of a housemate, a situation that arises under many circumstances, but does not indicate a dependent relationship beyond the sharing of a household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That Dunnavant shared some sort of \u201cliving arrangement with the decedent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *11, the commission did not deny. But this fact alone, the commission correctly reasoned, could not qualify him as a dependent. Absent some form of \u201clegal or moral\u201d obligation of support, <em>Place, </em>150 Va. at 568, 143 S.E. at 758, nothing would distinguish true dependency from other forms of purely nonobligatory benevolence. <em>See Morrell, </em>107 F.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In sum, Dunnavant presents no basis for the conclusion that the commission abused its \u201cwide discretion,\u201d <em>Place, </em>150 Va. at 567, 143 S.E. at 758, <em>McGuire, </em>188 Va. at 449, 50 S.E.2d at 287, either by misapplying the governing legal principles or by adopting irrational conclusions from the evidence presented. \u201cOnly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2006) (citation omitted); Hern<em>andez-Guerrero v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 366, 370, 617 S.E.2d 410, 412 (2005). Dunnavant has made no such showing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Finding the commission did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Dunnavant\u2019s dependency claim under Code \u00a7 65.2-516, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. <em>See also Complaint of Cambria S.S.
