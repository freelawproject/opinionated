INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-89 states in part that \u201c[i]f any person break and enter the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony or larceny therein, he shall be guilty of burglary.\u201d The issue we consider here, one of first impression in Virginia, is the extent to which a person must inhabit a house for it to constitute a \u201cdwelling house\u201d under the statute. We conclude that under the facts of this case, where the owner slept in the house about one weekend per month and maintained the house ready for immediate occupancy, such habitation suffices to constitute a dwelling. We therefore affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">On the night of September 27, 2005, Christopher Lee Giles went with two other persons to a house in Martinsville, Virginia. Giles removed the screws from a screen door and broke the glass out from another door with a rock. He stuck his hand through the door frame where the glass had been and unlocked the door, thereby gaining access to the house. The following evening, the trio returned and took two televisions, a VCR, blankets, towels, toilet paper, and food.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">The owner of the house was Oscar Thornton, Jr., a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, who was retired. He inherited the house from his mother when she passed away on June 29, 2005. He last came to the house before the break-in on September 17, which was a Saturday, and stayed at the house for the weekend. This was more or less ten days before the burglary. Thornton testified he commonly stayed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>house on weekends when visiting. He came to the house two times between his mother\u2019s death on June 29 and the September 17 visit. Thornton kept the refrigerator and pantry-stocked with food and maintained sleeping quarters there. The electricity and water remained turned on, and the house was furnished in three bedrooms, a living room, family room, and kitchen. While Thornton was away, he left the house in the care of his cousin, Brenda Kirby. She testified she went to the house about once every two weeks to \u201cmake sure everything was in place and in order.\u201d Neither Thornton nor Kirby gave Giles permission to enter the home. Thornton himself paid to have the doors damaged by the burglary repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">A grand jury indicted Giles for statutory burglary in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-89. He received a bench trial on November 17, 2006, at the conclusion of which the court found him guilty. On January 25, 2007, the court sentenced Giles to twenty years incarceration, with thirteen years and eight months suspended. Giles now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 295, 373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988). \u201cThis principle requires us to discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth and to regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Guda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 453, 455, 592 S.E.2d 748, 749 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">However, issues of statutory construction present pure questions of law that receive <em>de novo </em>review before this Court. <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 409, 413, 650 S.E.2d 89, 91 (2007). In construing a statute, we first look to the words used by the General Assembly. <em>Tucker v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 490, 493, 604 S.E.2d 66, 68 (2004). \u2018When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language and may not assign the words a construction that amounts to holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the General Assembly did not mean what it actually stated.\u201d <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 302, 307, 634 S.E.2d 330, 333 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Construction of a statute involves \u201creference to its subject matter, the object sought to be attained, and the legislative purpose in enacting it; the provisions should receive a construction that will render it harmonious with that purpose rather than one which will defeat it.\u201d <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003). \u201cAn undefined term must be \u2018given its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sansom v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>257 Va. 589, 594-95, 514 S.E.2d 345, 349 (1999) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Taxation v. Orange-Madison Coop. Farm Serv., </em>220 Va. 655, 658, 261 S.E.2d 532, 533-34 (1980)). The Court \u201cmust not add to the words of the statute, nor ignore its actual words.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 45, 51, 645 S.E.2d 470, 473 (2007). Although we strictly construe penal statutes against the Commonwealth, <em>Gunn v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 580, 587, 637 S.E.2d 324, 327 (2006), we keep in mind \u201cthat the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983). Thus, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We addressed the meaning of \u201cdwelling house\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-89 in <em>Rash v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 22, 383 S.E.2d 749 (1989). At the time the house there was broken into, it had been vacant for about seven months. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 383 S.E.2d at 750. The owners of the house inherited it from their sister. <em>Id. </em>Although the owners planned to sell it, it was fully furnished and one of the owners conducted routine maintenance. <em>Id. </em>In considering whether this represented a \u201cdwelling house,\u201d the Court noted that \u201c[b]urglary was, at common law, primarily an offense against the security of the habitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and that is still the general conception of it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 25, 383 S.E.2d at 751 (quoting <em>Compton v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 48, 55, 55 S.E.2d 446, 449 (1949)). The common law understood \u201cdwelling house\u201d \u201cto mean any structure which human beings regularly used for sleeping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court found that since other code sections concerned breaking and entering into structures not used for human dwelling, Code \u00a7 18.2-89 incorporated the common law notion of burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 383 S.E.2d at 751. Thus, the Court held that \u201cdwelling house\u201d meant \u201ca place which human beings regularly use for sleeping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then considered whether a residence meeting this definition could lose its legal status by the temporary absence of an occupant. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 383 S.E.2d at 751-52. After citing cases from a number of jurisdictions, the Court held that \u201ca dwelling is no longer a \u2018dwelling house\u2019 for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-89 when its occupants leave without any intention to return.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 27, 383 S.E.2d at 752. On the facts of <em>Rash, </em>the Court found that since the house was unoccupied and would not have another occupant under the current owners, it did not represent a \u201cdwelling house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the fact that the house was fully furnished could serve as evidence of intent to return, the Court held such a conclusion clearly rebutted by the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Court further elaborated on the meaning of a \u201cdwelling house\u201d in <em>Hitt v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 473, 598 S.E.2d 783 (2004). The issue directly presented was whether a bedroom within a house could qualify as a dwelling. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 598 S.E.2d at 786. In finding it could not, the Court stated that \u201cwhile habitation or occupancy necessarily includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>sleeping, it clearly also includes other \u2018dwelling-related\u2019 activities, such as preparing and consuming meals, bathing and other day-to-day activities traditionally associated with habitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 598 S.E.2d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Thus, <em>Rash </em>and <em>Hitt </em>provide two criteria for determining whether a residence constitutes a \u201cdwelling house\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-89. First, humans must regularly sleep there and engage in other functions related to habitation. <em>Hitt, </em>43 Va.App. at 483, 598 S.E.2d at 788; <em>Rash, </em>9 Va.App. at 26, 383 S.E.2d at 751. Second, if the regular occupants are away, they must intend to return. <em>Hitt, </em>43 Va.App. at 482-83, 598 S.E.2d at 788; <em>Rash, </em>9 Va.App. at 27, 383 S.E.2d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Yet neither <em>Rash </em>nor <em>Hitt </em>answers the question presented here. Namely, the issue is the extent to which a house must be \u201cregularly use[d]\u201d to qualify as a \u201cdwelling house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Since, as noted above, Virginia follows the common law definition of burglary, we first look to the common law for guidance. Our holding in <em>Rash </em>that a dwelling house remains legally a dwelling during the absence of its occupant if the occupant intends to return reflected a long line of common law precedent. Even from the sixteenth century it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5h\">If a man have two houses and inhabit sometimes in one, and sometimes in the other, if that house in which he doth not inhabit be broken in the night, to the intent to steal the goods then being in his house, then this is burglary, although no person be then in the house.... And in the same manner the house of every one is the proper place to preserve his goods, although no person be there: and that the law was always so, it is to be collected by the course of the statutes thereof made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">79 Eng. Rep. 1169 (K.B.1593). Lord Hale commented on the issue in this way: \u201cSo if A. have two mansion houses, and is sometimes with his family at one and sometimes at the other, the breach of one of them in the absence of his family from thence is burglary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1 Sir Matthew Hale, <em>The History of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>Pleas of the Crown </em>556 (Philadelphia, Robert H. Small 1847). A nineteenth century American court later enunciated this principle by stating that \u201cif one breaks into a dwelling-house in the night-time for a felonious purpose, though the owner and his family be temporarily absent, and no one be in it, it is burglary.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State v. Williams, </em>90 N.C. 724, 729 (1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">While the common law permitted a person to maintain multiple dwelling houses, it still required more than only rare or infrequent use as a dwelling. In <em>Brown\u2019s case, </em>the court determined \u201cthat the fact of a servant having slept in a barn the night it was broken open and for several nights before, made no sort of difference in the question whether burglary or not.\u201d 2 Edward Hyde East, <em>A Treatise on the Pleas of the Crown </em>497 (Philadelphia 1806). Similarly, another case held that \u201ca porter lying in a warehouse <em>to watch goods, </em>which is only for a particular purpose, does not make it a dwelling house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Still, common law courts recognized that if a person often slept in a place, even if one not typically used for residency, that place represented a dwelling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The common law did not recognize a house maintained ready for occupancy as a dwelling where no person actually lived there. <em>Id. </em>at 498. In <em>Hallard\u2019s case </em>in 1796, a tenant moved out of a house and a new tenant prepared to arrive. <em>Id. </em>The new tenant placed all his furniture there and frequently visited the house, although he did not sleep there. <em>Id. </em>The court held the house was not a dwelling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Rex v. Davis </em>in 1800, a tenant left a house and sold his furniture to the owner. <em>Id. </em>at 499. The owner did not reside in the house, but had a servant sleep there for several weeks to guard the furniture until a new tenant arrived. <em>Id. </em>The court found no burglary could occur since no one resided in the house. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The common law was employed under facts analogous to this case in <em>Gillum v. State, </em>468 So.2d 856 (Miss.1985). A family there owned a vacation home they traveled to every two to three weekends. <em>Id. </em>at 858. They had owned the house for eight years. <em>Id. </em>They kept \u201cclothing, furniture, food and other amenities of life\u201d in it. <em>Id. </em>at 859-60. The court noted many courts held a house used for temporary purposes could constitute a dwelling and cited the common law. <em>Id. </em>It then found that given \u201c[t]he frequency and regularity of\u2019 trips to the house and \u201c[t]he presence of clothing, furniture, food and other amenities of life,\u201d the house was a dwelling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Another case following the common law and with similar facts to this case is <em>State v. Bair, </em>112 W.Va. 655, 166 S.E. 369 (1932). The owners there used a house for vacation and weekend trips, and more often during the warmer seasons. <em>Id. </em>at 370. The house \u201cwas completely furnished for occupancy, such furnishing including beds and bedding, chairs, tables, radio, victrola, heating stove, dishes, cook stove and kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>utensils. Food stuffs also were usually kept in supply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After noting some of the principles of common law described above, the court found the house represented a dwelling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">A court followed the common law in a different factual situation in <em>State v. Celli, </em>263 N.W.2d 145 (S.D.1978). In that case, two persons broke into an unoccupied cabin. <em>Id. </em>at 146. The cabin contained matches and dry macaroni, but had no running water or fuses and had mice in it. <em>Id. </em>at 146-47. The owners had not slept in the cabin for three to four years, although they occasionally used it during the day and their son and his wife sometimes slept there in the summer. <em>Id. </em>at 147. However, no one had stayed in the cabin for several months. <em>Id. </em>Based on the common law, the court found the cabin was not a dwelling house. <em>Id. </em>It found persuasive that \u201cnot only was the cabin usually unoccupied, but it was not ready for occupancy at the time defendants entered.... An unoccupied cabin with the electricity off and the bathroom facilities disconnected does not fall within our statutory definition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">From this law and our own precedent, we discern the following principles regarding how a house must be \u201cregularly used\u201d to qualify as a dwelling under Code \u00a7 18.2-89. A person may have multiple dwelling houses. Each dwelling house must have humans sleep in it and engage in other functions typically associated with habitation. The house must be maintained to make it suitable for immediate or rapid habitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such maintenance includes the presence of power, water, food, furniture, beds, clothing, and other items normally associated with daily living. The list is not mandatory, exclusive, or exhaustive. Rather, such items are simply pieces of evidence for the finder of fact to consider in determining whether the prosecution has proven the presence of a dwelling house. Furthermore, a person must inhabit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>house on a usual or periodic basis. Infrequent or very occasional use will not suffice. When the occupant is absent, he must intend to return to the house within a usual or periodic time. We do not establish a minimum amount of time a person must spend in the house. Each case will depend upon its particular facts. With a foundation in the common law, and reflecting the decisions of this Court and courts of other jurisdictions, we construe habitation sufficient to constitute a dwelling house under Code \u00a7 18.2-89 to include maintenance for reasonably prompt habitation, and at a minimum periodic habitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In this case, we conclude the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to show the house owned by Thornton was a dwelling. The house had furnishings in three bedrooms, a living room, family room, and kitchen. It had food in the refrigerator and pantry. The electricity and water worked. The house was maintained for immediate occupancy. The owner testified he stayed at the house approximately one weekend per month. We conclude that under these circumstances, the finder of fact could determine the house was a dwelling under the statute. We therefore affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\">.
