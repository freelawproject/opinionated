He contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he obtained utility services valued at more than $200 and that the trial court erred when it failed to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s case. We agree and reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">The facts are not in dispute. On April 29, 2005, a Dominion Virginia Power (\u201cDominion\u201d) employee, Carl Wohlleb, visited appellant\u2019s house to determine whether electricity continued to be used following an earlier meter removal. Wohlleb discovered that an illegal meter had been installed at appellant\u2019s house. Appellant asked Wohlleb to \u201clook the other way and leave the meter in place.\u201d When Wohlleb refused, appellant told Wohlleb to get off his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Wohlleb went to his car and called a serviceman to disconnect the power at the pole that supplied power to the illegal meter. He also called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Officer Matt Connelly arrested appellant for utility fraud. Subsequently, appellant admitted that his power had been turned off on April 5, 2005, that he owed Dominion $1,200, and that he had \u201cincurred three hundred dollars since then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Kevin Woolridge, a Dominion employee, testified that the power provided to appellant between April 5, 2005 and April 29, 2005 was valued at $82.29. Woolridge also testified the following costs were associated with appellant\u2019s service, and the court included them in its calculation of the value of the</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">services appellant had wrongfully obtained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">a. Fee to turn off meter on April 5, 2005 $34.12</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">b. Fee for service investigator visit (Wohlleb) $34.48</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">c. Fee for service technician to turn off power at pole $75.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">d. Monthly flat fee for being a Dominion Power customer $ 7.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">e. Utility and taxes $ 4.67</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Concluding that the value of the services appellant fraudulently obtained from the power company was greater than $200, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Appellant argues the \u201cvalue of service, credit or benefit procured\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-187.1(D) only includes the value of the electrical current received. On that ground, he argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove the value of the services he fraudulently obtained was greater than $200. He reasons that Code \u00a7 18.2-187.1 makes a distinction between \u201cvalue of services received\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d and that the latter are only recoverable as restitution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Code \u00a7 18.2-187.1 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-16\">B. It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain or attempt to obtain oil, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, cable television or electronic communication service by the use of any scheme, device, means or method, or by a false applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tion for service with intent to avoid payment of lawful charges therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">D. Any person who violates any provisions of this section, if the value of service, credit or benefit procured is $200 or more, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony; or if the value is less than $200, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition, the court may order restitution for the value of the services unlawfully used and for all costs. Such costs shall be limited to actual expenses, including the base wages of employees acting as witnesses for the Commonwealth, and suit costs. However, the total amount of allowable costs granted hereunder shall not exceed $250, excluding the value of the service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In <em>Lund v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 688, 232 S.E.2d 745 (1977), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the common law offense of larceny did not include the theft of computer time or services. In response to <em>Lund, </em>the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-98.1 and several related statutes, including Code \u00a7 18.2-187.1, to include certain services as the subject of larceny. <em>Sylvestre v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 253, 256, 391 S.E.2d 336, 338 (1990). <em>See also Jha v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 349, 354, 444 S.E.2d 258, 261 (1994) (valuing fraudulently obtained phone services collectively and analogizing them to a \u201cseries of larcenous acts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We hold that the offense created under Code \u00a7 18.2-187.1 is a species of larceny. As such, the \u201cvalue of service, credit or benefit procured\u201d is to be measured at the time the services were taken. <em>See Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 118, 121, 489 S.E.2d 482, 483 (1997) (\u201cThe value of the stolen property is measured as of the time of the theft[.]\u201d). Applying this analysis to the facts before us, the value of the services appellant \u201ctook\u201d is limited to the electrical current he used, and not the costs incurred by the power company as a result of the theft. <em>See also Dimaio v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 755, 765, 621 S.E.2d 696, 701 (2005) (\u201c[T]he cost of producing the stolen items was not the proper method of valuation, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>rather the actual value was the proper measure.\u201d (citing <em>Lund, </em>217 Va. at 692, 232 S.E.2d at 748)). The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the court properly considered the additional expenses charged to appellant\u2019s account because such expenses would be charged \u201cto any customer ... whose power was being disconnected^]\u201d and because they were \u201ca direct result of the illegal actions of Penley,\u201d is not consistent with these well-established common law principles governing the prosecution of larceny offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Any additional \u201ccosts\u201d incurred by the electric company as a result of the theft must be excluded from the court\u2019s calculation of value. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s case because the evidence failed to establish that the value of services obtained was $200 or more. Consistent with <em>Commonwealth v. South, </em>272 Va. 1, 630 S.E.2d 318 (2006), we remand solely for a new sentencing proceeding on appellant\u2019s misdemeanor violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-187.1, as the elements of this lesser-included offense have already been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
