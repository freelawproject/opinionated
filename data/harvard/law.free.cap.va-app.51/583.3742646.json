Acts ch. 99 (House Bill 2316), the uncodified predecessor of Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3:5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants argue the Department unlawfully refused to recognize their \u201cgood cause\u201d standing to participate in the administrative process. The Department denied that request on the ground that 2005 Va. Acts ch. 99 (which we will refer to simply as the \u201c2005 Relocation Act\u201d) exempted qualifying relocation requests from the plenary administrative process and, by doing so, precluded nonparties from obtaining standing to participate in the Act\u2019s more abbreviated and simplified process.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The appellants filed petitions for appeal to the circuit court pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq. </em>The circuit court agreed with the Department\u2019s interpretation of the 2005 Relocation Act and dismissed the VAPA appeal because the appellants had no standing to pursue it. We too find this reasoning persuasive and, thus, affirm the circuit court\u2019s dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The appellants argue that this interpretation of the Act converts it into an unconstitutional \u201cspecial\u201d law in violation of Article IV, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, of the Virginia Constitution. Though we question whether the appellants have standing in this case to challenge the constitutionality of the 2005 Relocation Act, we assume <em>arguendo </em>they do and nonetheless find the Act cannot be judicially vacated as an unconstitutional special law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Through various affiliates, Medical Facilities of America, Inc. (MFA) operates a nursing home, the Warsaw Healthcare Center, located in Warsaw, Virginia. MFA also operates two other nursing homes, Hanover Healthcare Center, located in Hanover County, and Beaufont Healthcare Center, located in the City of Richmond. Regulated by the Virginia Department of Health, MFA obtained certificates of public need to operate these nursing homes and others throughout the Commonwealth in various planning districts maintained by the Department. In 2005, MFA sought permission from the Department to relocate 120 beds from Warsaw Healthcare Center (located in one planning district) to Hanover Healthcare Center and Beaufont Healthcare Center (both located in another planning district).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Two of the appellant nursing homes wrote letters to the Department requesting an informal fact-finding conference pursuant to Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6. The Department refused to conduct a conference, asserting that the 2005 Relocation Act exempts the relocation request from the normal process governing certificates of public need. All of the appellants responded by filing petitions with the Department seeking \u201cgood cause\u201d standing to participate in administrative hearings. The Department rejected the petitions and again explained that the 2005 Relocation Act removed MFA\u2019s relocation request from the normal hearing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The Department later approved MFA\u2019s request and issued certificates of public need (COPNs) authorizing the bed transfers. Claiming to be \u201caggrieved parties\u201d from an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201ccase decision,\u201d the appellants filed VAPA petitions for appeal in the Circuit Courts of Chesterfield County and the City of Richmond. In their petitions for appeal, the appellants asserted that the Department erroneously interpreted the 2005 Relocation Act. Properly construed, the appellants claimed, the Act did not exempt MFA\u2019s relocation request from the normal administrative process. And whether it did or not, they added, the Department\u2019s decision to approve the request without granting them a hearing should be judicially set aside as arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In their VAPA petitions for appeal, the appellants also alleged that the 2005 Relocation Act violated the prohibition against \u201cspecial, private, or local law\u201d found in Article IV, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, of the Virginia Constitution. None of the appellants, however, filed any non-VAPA declaratory judgment claims or asserted any separate counts requesting either circuit court to exercise its general jurisdiction. Each of the petitions for appeal limited their claims and their jurisdictional allegations to the judicial review provisions of VAPA and the underlying basic law governing the administrative regulation of nursing homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Both VAPA appeals were consolidated in the Chesterfield County Circuit Court. The appellees moved to dismiss the appeals on various grounds, including that the 2005 Relocation Act deprived appellants from obtaining standing as parties in the administrative proceeding and thus precluded their status as aggrieved parties for purposes of VAPA\u2019s judicial review procedures. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the VAPA case. The appellants appeal to us, claiming the circuit court erred in dismissing their VAPA appeals and in not addressing the merits of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">A. <em>The VAPA, The Basic Law &amp; Standing Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Under VAPA, the circuit court reviews the agency\u2019s action in a manner \u201cequivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>J.P. v. Carter, </em>24 Va.App. 707, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>721, 485 S.E.2d 162, 169 (1997) (quoting <em>Sch. Bd. v. Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1061-62, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Allen, </em>24 Va.App. 272, 277, 482 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1997) (citation omitted); <em>Pence Holdings, Inc. v. Auto Ctr., Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 703, 708, 454 S.E.2d 732, 734-35 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">VAPA, however, \u201cdoes not vest circuit courts with appellate authority over all agency decisions.\u201d <em>Giannoukos v. Va. Bd. of Med., </em>44 Va.App. 694, 699, 607 S.E.2d 136, 138 (2005). \u201cOnly those within the definition of a \u2018case decision\u2019 fall within the scope of the VAPA\u2019s judicial review provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Code \u00a7 2.2-4026). A \u201ccase decision\u201d results from an agency proceeding involving a \u201cnamed party.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4001. A \u201cnamed party\u201d who loses an agency case decision ordinarily can seek judicial review under VAPA. A party who is not \u201cnamed,\u201d but a party nonetheless, can appeal to circuit court if he is genuinely \u201caggrieved\u201d by the case decision, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4026, or qualifies as a \u201cnecessary party\u201d essential to the resolution of the appeal, <em>Browning-Ferris Ind. v. Residents Involved, </em>254 Va. 278, 282, 492 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1997), or is otherwise deemed a party under Rule 2A:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Nonparties, however, cannot appeal a case decision to the circuit court under VAPA. They can appeal, however, the agency\u2019s decision to <em>exclude </em>them from participating in the administrative process\u2014which, in this context, involves the question whether the agency properly refused to recognize the appellants\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d to intervene and thereby acquire party status. <em>See Tidewater Psychiatric Inst., Inc. v. Buttery, </em>8 Va.App. 380, 383-84, 382 S.E.2d 288, 290 (1989); <em>see also Chippenham &amp; Johnston-Willis v. Peterson, </em>36 Va.App. 469, 474 n. 1, 553 S.E.2d 133, 136 n. 1 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Whether an agency correctly refused to recognize the standing of a putative intervenor depends on the criteria for standing, if any, adopted by the underlying administrative statute, the \u201cbasic law\u201d as Code \u00a7 2.2-4001 calls it. The basic law may provide broader standing, <em>see, e.g., Harrison v. Ocean </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>View Fishing Pier, LLC, </em>50 Va.App. 556, 568, 651 S.E.2d 421, 427 (2007), or narrower standing, <em>EDF v. State Water Control Bd., </em>12 Va.App. 456, 462, 404 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1991), than the default standard adopted by VAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">When the basic law refuses to recognize <em>any </em>standing for nonparties seeking to participate in the administrative process, VAPA respects that refusal. While VAPA seeks to \u201cstandardize court review\u201d of agency action, it does so <em>\u201csave </em>as laws hereafter enacted may <em>otherwise </em>expressly provide.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 (emphasis added); <em>see also Health Sys. Agency v. Stroube, </em>47 Va.App. 299, 308, 623 S.E.2d 444, 449 (2005) (recognizing that the VAPA \u201cgoverns the appeals process for administrative decisions, unless the agency\u2019s basic law provides otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">B. <em>The Relocation Act &amp; \u201cGood Cause\u201d Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In this case, the circuit court reasoned that the 2005 Relocation Act so completely exempted the relocation request from the normal administrative process that no \u201cgood cause\u201d standing for nonparties could be recognized. The court also found no other statutory basis, either in the basic law or VAPA, granting the appellants standing to seek judicial review of the relocation approval. For this reason, the court held the VAPA appeal must be dismissed. We agree with the court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The basic law governing medical care facilities, including nursing homes, states that no \u201cperson shall commence any <em>project </em>without first obtaining a certificate\u201d issued by the Department\u2019s Commissioner of Health. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(A) (emphasis added). The definition of \u201cproject\u201d under Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1 includes any \u201cincrease in the total number of beds\u201d in an \u201cexisting medical care facility\u201d like a nursing home. The Department cannot issue a certificate of public need \u201cunless the Commissioner has determined that a public need for the project has been demonstrated.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6 provides procedures for obtaining certificates of public need for projects. Subsection A provides: \u201cTo obtain a certificate for a project, the applicant shall file a completed application for a certificate with the Department and the appropriate health planning agency.\u201d Subsection B describes various reviews, including a public hearing near where the \u201cproject\u201d has been proposed. Subsection D requires the Department to make a timely determination on whether the \u201cproject\u201d satisfies the public-need criteria. Subsection D makes this determination, with some minor exceptions, subject to \u201cthe provisions of the Administrative Process Act\u201d and permits individuals to seek \u201cgood cause\u201d standing to intervene in the proceeding and request an informal fact-finding conference under the VAPA. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-1022.6(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The 2005 Relocation Act, however, adds a structural proviso qualifying the broad reach of the basic law. The Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">A. <em>Notwithstanding (i) the provisions of\u00a7\u00a7 32.1-102.3 </em>and 32.1-102.3:2, (ii) any regulations of the Board of Health establishing standards for the approval and issuance of Requests for Applications, or (iii) the provisions of any current Requests for Applications issued by the Commissioner of Health pursuant to \u00a7 32.1-102.3:2, the Commissioner of Health shall accept applications and may issue certificates of public need for nursing home beds when such beds are a relocation from one facility to another facility or facilities under common ownership or control, regardless of whether they are in the same planning district, if, as of December 31 of the year preceding the year in which relocation is proposed, the following criteria are met....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">B. <em>A relocation of nursing home beds under the circumstances described herein shall not constitute a \u201cproject\u201d as defined in \u00a7 32.1-102.1. </em>An entity may not relocate more than two-thirds of the total number of beds for which the facility was licensed prior to any relocation pursuant to this section. Any restrictions that apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the certificate at the time of the relocation shall remain in effect following the relocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">2005 Va. Acts ch. 99 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The circuit court correctly read the 2005 Relocation Act to provide a simplified and abbreviated process for approving or disapproving requests for bed relocations from one nursing home to another under common ownership or control. Subsection B makes clear that a qualifying relocation \u201cshall <em>not </em>constitute a <em>\u2018project\u2019 </em>as defined in \u00a7 32.1-102.1.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The opening sentence of Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1 provides that its statutory definitions, including the definition of \u201cproject,\u201d apply throughout Article 1.1 (entitled \u201cMedical Care Facilities Certificates of Public Need\u201d) unless context dictates otherwise. By exempting qualifying relocations from the definition of \u201cproject,\u201d subsection B of the 2005 Relocation Act renders inapplicable Article 1.1\u2019s elaborate procedures governing the approval of certificates of public need for projects\u2014 including Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6\u2019s procedures for holding public hearings and granting good-cause standing to nonparties.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Subsection A of the 2005 Relocation Act reinforces the point by making equally clear that the Department shall process the request \u201c[notwithstanding\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3. That statute requires \u201cprojects\u201d to be supported by a showing of public need and details the multitude of considerations governing the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion. In short, the 2005 Relocation Act not only exempts qualifying relocation requests from Article 1.1\u2019s procedures applicable to \u201cprojects,\u201d the Act also negates the very statute (Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3) putative objectors would rely upon to challenge the agency\u2019s discretion on the ultimate issue of public need.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, the 2005 Relocation Act eschews any \u201cjudicially manageable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>standard of review,\u201d 3 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 17.8, at 1303 (4th ed.2002), which the courts could employ to test the legitimacy of the appellants\u2019 challenge of the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In this respect, VAPA is \u201cvirtually identical,\u201d <em>State Bd. of Health v. Godfrey, </em>223 Va. 423, 434 n. 6, 290 S.E.2d 875, 881 n. 6 (1982) (citation omitted), to the Federal Administrative Procedure Act.Code \u00a7 2.2-4000\u2019s standardization of judicial review <em>\u201csave </em>as laws hereafter enacted may otherwise expressly provide\u201d parallels 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a), which provides for judicial review of federal agency action <em>\u201cexcept </em>to the extent that (1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Agency action is committed to agency discretion by law where a statute is \u201cdrawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u201d <em>Inova Alexandria Hosp. v. Shalala, </em>244 F.3d 342, 346 (4th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). \u201cThere is no law to apply if \u2018the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1655, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In this case, the 2005 Relocation Act authorizes the Department\u2019s exercise of discretion by providing that the Commissioner \u201cmay\u201d issue a certificate to a qualifying relocation request. <em>See </em>2005 Va. Acts ch. 99. The Act, however, also provides that this exercise of discretion would remain wholly unfettered by any consideration of the various \u201cpublic need\u201d factors of Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3. By framing the subject that way, the 2005 Relocation Act includes no meaningful standard by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>which any court could judge the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s action when attacked by those who would otherwise have \u201cgood cause\u201d standing under Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">C. <em>The Circuit Court\u2019s Refusal To Adjudicate The Constitutional Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Having concluded the appellants lacked VAPA standing to pursue an appeal, the circuit court refused to adjudicate the merits of the appellants\u2019 claims\u2014including their assertion that the 2005 Relocation Act violated the prohibition against \u201cspecial, private, or local law\u201d found in Article IV, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, of the Virginia Constitution. We understand the court\u2019s reluctance. The appellants made that allegation in their VAPA petitions for appeal predicated solely on the circuit court\u2019s VAPA appellate jurisdiction. The appellants did not file separate complaints seeking declaratory or injunctive relief predicated on the circuit court\u2019s non-VAPA general jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., St. Luke Hosp. v. Health Policy Bd., </em>913 S.W.2d 1 (Ky.App.1996) (entertaining a claim for declaratory judgment that a statutory exception to the general COPN law was unconstitutional special legislation). The limited jurisdiction authorized by VAPA \u201cdoes not extend to any matter \u2018subject by law to a trial de novo in any court.\u2019\u201d <em>The Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 708, 601 S.E.2d 667, 676 (2004) (quoting Code \u00a7 2.2-4025(A)), <em>aff'd, </em>270 Va. 423, 621 S.E.2d 78 (2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Appellants argue on appeal to us the seemingly circular thesis that they have VAPA standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional deprivation of VAPA standing. They point out, however, the antithesis of their position is equally circular\u2014that a VAPA court cannot enforce an allegedly unconstitutional statutory deprivation of VAPA standing on the ground that the deprived litigant has no standing. We see no need in this case to choose between these two mutually exclusive, but equally anfractuous, theories of VAPA standing. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the appellants have standing in this VAPA appeal to challenge the constitutionality of the law that eliminates their standing in the first place, we find no merit in their constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The prohibitions against \u201cspecial, private, or local law\u201d found in Article IV, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, of the Virginia Constitution track the minimum rationality requirements employed by longstanding due process and equal protection doctrines. Virginia courts \u201capply the so-called \u2018rational basis\u2019 test\u201d when testing the constitutionality of legislation \u201cunder due process, equal protection, and special legislation provisions.\u201d <em>Willis v. Mullett, </em>263 Va. 653, 659, 561 S.E.2d 705, 709 (2002). The special laws prohibitions recognize \u201cthe necessity for and the reasonableness of classification are primarily questions for the legislature. If any state of facts can be reasonably conceived, that would sustain it, that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u201d <em>Jefferson Green Unit Owners Ass\u2019n v. Gwinn, </em>262 Va. 449, 459, 551 S.E.2d 339, 345 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Litigants challenging a statute as an illegitimate special law shoulder a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>Holly Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, </em>241 Va. 425, 432, 404 S.E.2d 48, 51 (1991), one calculated to safeguard the maxim that all \u201clegislative acts are \u2018presumed to be constitutional,\u2019\u201d <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 506, 592 S.E.2d 768, 774 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>(quoting <em>In re Phillips, </em>265 Va. 81, 85, 574 S.E.2d 270, 272 (2003)). \u201cThis presumption is \u2018one of the strongest known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507, 592 S.E.2d at 774 (citation omitted). \u201cUnder it, courts must \u2018resolve any reasonable doubt\u2019 regarding the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cTo doubt is to affirm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The 2005 Relocation Act exempts a specific class of bed transfers from an administrative process that has been criticized by some as inefficient and' expensive. <em>See generally Report of the Special Joint Subcommittee Studying Certificate of Public Need, </em>Sen. Doc. No. 6, at 46 (2001) (noting the \u201cstrong feeling that the certificate of public need process needs streamlining and could be reduced\u201d). For bed transfers meeting the applicable conditions, the 2005 Relocation Act provides a streamlined, non-litigious process to seek administrative approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The appellants argue that if the Act truly has this streamlining effect, it should be struck down as an example of economic favoritism because it applies only to \u201ccorporations owning multiple nursing homes\u201d and, as a result, \u201conly large, influential corporations stand to benefit\u201d from the Act\u2019s abbreviated procedures. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 34. To make matters worse, the appellants contend, the General Assembly specifically intended the Act to benefit only MFA. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 34. We disagree with the reasoning underlying both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">To begin with, it is true the Act applies only to companies owning or controlling at least two nursing homes. A company owning one nursing home cannot transfer beds to another home owned and operated by some other company. This distinction, however, cannot be characterized as a \u201cpurely arbitrary\u201d legislative classification, <em>Martin\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v. Commonwealth, </em>126 Va. 603, 612, 102 S.E. 77, 80 (1920), devoid of any rational basis. Limiting the Act\u2019s reach to nursing homes under common ownership or control discourages the creation of a <em>de facto </em>market in bed relocations between disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>corporate entities and places the entire relocation effort under the settling effect of a unified business plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Whether limiting the Act to commonly owned or operated nursing homes represents sound public policy, we are not competent to say. Judicial review does not evaluate the \u201cpropriety, wisdom, necessity and expediency\u201d of legislation. <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 585-86, 575 S.E.2d 567, 571 (2003) (citations omitted). We ask only whether the statutory classification erects an irrational, arbitrary distinction\u2014one that no conceivable state of facts could reasonably sustain. <em>Jefferson Green Unit Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>262 Va. at 459, 551 S.E.2d at 345. None of. the appellants\u2019 arguments rise to this level.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">For similar reasons, we cannot accept the appellants\u2019 allegation that the General Assembly enacted a facially neutral statute with the <em>sub silentio </em>intent that it \u201cinure to the benefit of MFA alone.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 34. The argument rests on the factual assumption that, in 2005, MFA operated the only nursing home business in the Commonwealth that could have met the criteria of the Act. MFA rejects this assumption, arguing that the legislative history of the Act, including the floor statements of the patron, demonstrates that at least five or six nursing homes might have met the criteria in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We think this factual debate misses the point. The question is not the size of the statutory class in 2005. The Act is not a one-time piece of legislation applicable only to nursing homes operating during the year of its enactment. The Act applies <em>in perpetuity </em>and shuts the class door fully only when repealed. Even if the 2005 statutory class size benefited a favored few, the question is whether it would forever do so. We can strike down legislation as an unconstitutional special law only when \u201cthe class established by its provisions is at once so narrow and so arbitrary that duplication of its content is to be ranked as an unexpected freak of chance, a turn of the wheel of fortune defying probabilities.\u201d <em>Peery v. Va. Bd. of Funeral Dirs. &amp; Embalmers, </em>203 Va. 161, 167, 123 S.E.2d 94, 98 (1961) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Such an assertion cannot be made here. It would hardly be an \u201cunexpected freak of chance\u201d or a \u201cturn of the wheel of fortune defying probabilities,\u201d <em>Peery, </em>203 Va. at 167, 123 S.E.2d at 98 (citation omitted), for the 2005 Relocation Act to benefit future nursing homes. The nursing home industry, like most economic markets, is far from static. Corporate reorganizations and asset acquisitions can be hypothesized that could create conditions consistent with the criteria of the Act. To be sure, the General Assembly may have even intended the Act to encourage just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">It may well be that, at least in the foreseeable future, the 2005 Relocation Act will apply only to a relatively small portion of the nursing home industry. \u201cLaws may be made to apply to a class only,\u201d however, \u201cand that class may be in point of fact a small one, provided the classification itself be a reasonable and not an arbitrary one, and the law be made to apply to all of the persons belonging to the class without distinction.\u201d <em>Ex parte Settle, </em>114 Va. 715, 718-19, 77 S.E. 496, 497 (1913). The facially neutral criteria of the Act insures that its streamlined process, while arguably limited to a small sector of the nursing home industry, may be accessed by <em>any </em>applicant meeting the statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Finally, we respectfully decline the suggestion of our colleague in dissent to remand this case to the agency for it to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the constitutionality of the 2005 Relocation Act. Nothing in VAPA authorizes an administrative agency to conduct evidentiary hearings into the constitutionality of legislation and to make factual findings which, under Code \u00a7 2.2-4027, would be entitled to judicial deference on appeal to the circuit court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Vested with the <em>sui generis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>power of judicial review, the judiciary alone must perform whatever factfinding is necessary to fulfill this task. It cannot be delegated, in whole or in part, to the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Because the 2005 Relocation Act precludes the appellants from acquiring standing to seek judicial review of the agency\u2019s actions in this case, the circuit court properly dismissed this VAPA appeal.

The appellants contend that certain enforcement provisions, like Code \u00a7 32.1-102.4(C)(2) and (E), might likewise be rendered inapplicable if subsection B of the 2005 Relocation Act is read literally. The excision of certain relocation requests from the \"project\u201d definition, however, may or may not have any impact on the Department\u2019s enforcement powers. That question must await a litigable controversy in which the issue is directly in play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\">. Appellants also argue that they should be considered necessary parties. We find no merit in this assertion. They cannot be necessary parties without first being parties. <em>See, e.g., Browning-Ferris Ind., </em>254 Va. at 282-83, 492 S.E.2d at 434 (holding a permittee, the named party in an administrative case decision, is necessary to the VAPA appeal of the permit).

Our interpretation, they conclude, should be rejected by the rule of statutory interpretation against treating some statutory language as superfluous.

(MFA) is a Virginia corporation that has an ownership interest in and/or manages at least 30 nursing homes in Virginia. MFA plays some role in the ownership and operation of the three nursing homes at issue in this appeal: Warsaw Healthcare Center (Warsaw HCC), located in Planning District 17, Hanover Healthcare Center (Hanover HCC), located in Planning District 15, and Beaufont Healthcare Center (Beaufont HCC), located in Planning District 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Warsaw HCC has housed 180 licensed nursing home beds in Warsaw, Virginia, since 1985. Citing the weak financial per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>formance of Warsaw HCC,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MFA sought to transfer 60 of the beds at Warsaw HCC to Hanover HCC and 60 of the beds to Beaufont HCC, both in a different planning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-102.1 to 32.1-102.13 detail the requirements and procedures for obtaining a COPN for medical care facilities. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">No person shall commence any project<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> without first obtaining a certificate issued by the Commissioner. No certificate may be issued unless the Commissioner has determined that a public need for the project has been demonstrated.... Any decision to issue or approve the issuance of a certificate shall be consistent with the most recent applicable provisions of the State Medical Facilities Plan....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">(Footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The statute then lists twenty factors that \u201cthe Commissioner shall consider\u201d when determining \u201cwhether a public need for a project has been demonstrated.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(B). Those factors include the recommendation of the relevant health planning agency, the \u201cneed that the population served or to be served by the project has for the project,\u201d \u201cthe relationship of the project to the existing health care system of the area in which the project is proposed,\u201d and \u201cthe efficiency and appropriateness of the use of existing services and facilities in the area similar to those proposed.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>For applications for a COPN to increase the number of nursing home beds in a planning district, Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3:2 requires the Commissioner to \u201capprove, authorize or accept\u201d only those applications that \u201care filed in response to Requests for Applications (RFAs).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Further, Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6 sets out administrative procedures that govern the filing and review of any application for a COPN. Those administrative procedures require the regional health planning agency to review each application for a COPN and to hold a public hearing on each application for a COPN. Both the regional health planning agency and the Department of Health\u2019s Division of Certificate of Public Need (DCOPN) review the applications and provide recommendations to the Commissioner. In addition, Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6 provides a process for a person to seek and obtain \u201cgood cause standing\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as a party to the case and, after obtaining such status, to request an informal fact-finding conference (IFFC) to be convened. This IFFC allows all of the parties involved to provide additional information for the Commissioner to consider when determining whether to approve the application for a COPN. The regional health planning agency or DCOPN can also request an IFFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In the 2005 legislative session, the Virginia legislature passed HB 2316, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">A.

Any restrictions that apply to the certificate at the time of the relocation shall remain in effect following the relocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">On August 8, 2005, in response to this legislation, DCOPN promulgated special procedures and time frames \u201cfor processing a request for relocation of nursing home beds under the provisions of HB 2316.\u201d DCOPN interpreted HB 2316 to require a \u201csimplified and abbreviated process for handling such requests.\u201d Further, DCOPN noted that HB 2316 \u201cdirects\u201d the Commissioner to \u201ctake certain actions <em>notwithstanding </em>the statutory criteria for determining need\u201d and <em>\u201cnotwithstanding </em>the administrative procedures that apply to review of <em>projects.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Essentially, the special procedures provided that the Commissioner would review an application pursuant to HB 2816 to determine only (1) whether it met the classification criteria set out in the legislation, and (2) that \u201cit is not likely to result in significant harm to affected nursing home residents or to other citizens of the Commonwealth.\u201d The procedures then set forth an abbreviated time frame for reviewing the applications, and specified that an IFFC would occur only if it \u201cis required as a result of the recommendation of the Department of Health staff.\u201d The only role for the regional health planning agency was an opportunity \u201cto review an HB 2316 request and provide its comments to the Commissioner,\u201d but the procedures did not provide for a public hearing or for the regional health planning agency to request an IFFC. Further, the procedures did not provide for any other person to apply for good cause standing, or to request an IFFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">On September 20, 2005, MFA applied for a COPN, pursuant to HB 2316, to transfer 60 nursing home beds from Warsaw HCC to Beaufont HCC (the Beaufont application). On October 7, 2005, MFA applied for a COPN, pursuant to HB 2316, to transfer 60 nursing home beds from Warsaw HCC to Hanover HCC (the Hanover application). If approved, Warsaw HCC would be left with no nursing home beds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On October 25, 2005, the Central Virginia Health Planning Agency (CVHPA) held a public hearing, contrary to the procedures outlined by DCOPN.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> MFA contended that the statute did not provide for a public hearing, or for a recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>mendation from CVHPA, but participated in the hearing as a courtesy to the agency. CVHPA received seven letters of opposition to the transfers of beds, three from family members of residents at Warsaw HCC, one from the administrator of the hospital located near Warsaw HCC, and three from nursing home facilities located in Planning District 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Based on this \u201csignificant provider and consumer opposition,\u201d and their review of the application under the twenty factors in Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(B), CVHPA recommended the Commissioner deny both applications submitted by MFA. Specifically, CVHPA noted that the transfer of these beds into Planning District 15 violated provisions of the State Medical Facilities Plan, creating an unnecessary and harmful surplus of nursing home beds in Planning District 15 and a deficiency of nursing home beds in Planning District 17. The surplus of beds would negatively impact occupancy rates and the financial viability of existing nursing homes, while the deficiency of beds would have \u201ca negative impact on the economic viability of area hospitals.\u201d Additionally, CVHPA pointed to alternatives to the transfer of beds that would diminish the negative consequences for both Warsaw HCC\u2019s service area and Planning District 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On November 18, 2005, CVHPA requested that the Commissioner convene an IFFC regarding MFA\u2019s applications. The Commissioner responded that, because applications under HB 2316 are not \u201cprojects\u201d for purposes of the COPN administrative process, \u201cno IFFC is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">DCOPN released its review and recommendations on November 14, 2005, regarding the Hanover application, and on November 30, 2005, regarding the Beaufont application. For many of the same reasons cited by CVHPA, DCOPN determined that neither application had \u201ca great deal of overall merit\u201d when considered alone and that DCOPN would not normally recommend approval. Moreover, when both applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tions were considered together, DCOPN determined that approval of both applications \u201cwould very likely cause serious and long-lasting harm to the nursing home services capability of [Planning District] 17 and [Planning Districts] 17 and 18 combined, and would likely cause undue, though probably relatively modest harm to some or perhaps many nursing home providers in [Planning District] 15.\u201d However, DCOPN recommended approval of the applications solely because the applications met the criteria set out in HB 2316, and because DCOPN believed that the design of HB 2316 did not permit consideration of the merit of the applications on any other criteria.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Appellants filed separate petitions for good cause standing with the Commissioner in the consideration of MFA\u2019s applications for COPNs, each requesting party status in the case. Appellants also asked the Commissioner to convene an IFFC to consider the lawfulness of the applications under HB 2316, even if DCOPN recommended approval of the applications, and argued that HB 2316 constituted unconstitutional special legislation. In response, the Commissioner stated that, \u201c[inasmuch as HB 2316 expressly removes any proposed relocation submitted pursuant to it from the category of those things that are projects, your attempt to petition to show good cause in relation to the proposed relocation cannot be accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On December 15, 2005, the Commissioner approved the Hanover application for a COPN to transfer 60 beds from Warsaw HCC, stating, \u201cI have concluded that approval of the request is warranted, based on the following finding: The application meets each of the criteria for its acceptance and possible approval that are set forth by HB 2316 of the 2005 General Assembly.\u201d On December 19, 2005, the Commissioner approved the Beaufont application for a COPN to transfer 60 beds from Warsaw HCC on identical grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Appellants filed petitions for appeal in the trial court,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> arguing that: the Commissioner erred in failing to hold hearings on the applications, the Commissioner erred in denying appellants\u2019 good cause petitions, the Commissioner erred in approving the applications where DCOPN and CVHPA found that the applications were without merit and were harmful to the public interest, and the Commissioner erred by giving effect to unconstitutional special legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">MFA and the Virginia Department of Health filed motions to dismiss appellants\u2019 petitions, arguing that, as appellants were not named parties to the proceedings before the Commissioner and were not \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the VAPA, appellants lacked standing to bring the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The trial court, after hearing oral argument, granted the motions to dismiss appellants\u2019 petitions for appeal.

Necessarily, the trial court must decide what basic law controls; in this case, the trial court had to decide whether HB 2316 supplanted the basic laws contained in Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-102.1 to 32.1-102.13. However, such a determination requires first that the trial court evaluate whether HB 2316 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Indeed, every decision made by the Commissioner and by the trial court in this case was premised on the assumption that HB 2316 was constitutional. Appellants challenged, before both the Commissioner and the trial court, the constitutionality of HB 2316, alleging that it was special legislation; yet, both the Commissioner and the trial court refused to consider the constitutional arguments advanced by appellants on the grounds that HB 2316 removed their opportunity to contest any part of the proceedings on MFA\u2019s applications for COPNs.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Such reasoning is clearly incorrect; one cannot be divested of standing to challenge the constitutionality of legislation by the very legislation argued to be unconstitutional.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, standing to challenge the constitutionality and lawfulness of a statute or regulation is wholly separate from standing to challenge the merits of a decision. For example, the VAPA makes a distinction, in terms of standing to appeal, between one challenging the lawfulness of a regulation and one challenging the lawfulness of a case decision. The VAPA provides, in pertinent part, that <em>\u201cany person affected by </em>and claiming the unlawfulness of any regulation, or <em>party aggrieved by </em>and claiming unlawfulness of a case decision ... shall have a right to direct review thereof by an appropriate and timely court action against the agency.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4026 (emphasis added). While the VAPA addresses only the lawfulness of a regulation and not the lawfulness of legislation, the distinction does not alter my analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision that appellants did not have standing to challenge the <em>merits </em>of the Commissioner\u2019s actions has no bearing on whether appellants had standing to challenge the constitutionality of HB 2316. Indeed, constitutional standing is defined as \u201cwhether the parties seeking to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction have \u2018alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cupp v.

To do so, the Court must consider: (1) the legislative history and purpose of the Act, <em>see Sciortino, </em>236 Va. at 149, 372 S.E.2d at 757; (2) whether the classification in the Act promotes the Act\u2019s purpose, <em>see Mandell, </em>202 Va. at 991, 121 S.E.2d at 525; <em>Quesinberry v. Hull, </em>159 Va. 270, 275, 165 S.E. 382, 383 (1932); and (3) the factual determination of the inclusiveness or exclusiveness of the classification, <em>see Quesinberry, </em>159 Va. at 273, 165 S.E. at 383 (considering number of counties in the class); <em>Sciortino, </em>236 Va. at 149, 372 S.E.2d at 757 (considering number of workers exempt from the Sunday laws); <em>County Bd. of Supervisors of Fairfax County v. Am. Trailer Co., </em>193 Va. 72, 78, 68 S.E.2d 115, 119 (1951) (considering number of counties included by classification).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">These three factors are not exclusive, but are relevant to this particular analysis. Each case may warrant consideration of other factors depending on the particular facts of that case. \u201cIf any state of facts can be reasonably conceived, that would sustain it, that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u201d <em>Martin\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>126 Va. at 612-13, 102 S.E. at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>There is evidence in the record regarding the reasonableness of the classification in HB 2316; however, this evidence was not evaluated by either the Commissioner or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In arguing that HB 2316 is unconstitutional special legislation, appellants point to several factors. First, in its report on the applications, DCOPN noted that the transfer of nursing home beds from one planning district to another is \u201cexceedingly unusual\u201d and that no similar request had been reviewed by the Department in at least seven years. Indeed, correspondence between counsel for MFA and staff at the Department of Health mentioned the \u201ctruly unique situation\u201d the application poses and suggests that, in drafting procedures pursuant to HB 2316, the Department of Health must develop a \u201cunique solution.\u201d Counsel for MFA consulted with staff at the Department of Health in May 2005 regarding the drafting of these procedures pursuant to HB 2316 and provided guidance to the Department in interpreting what the legislature intended in drafting the legislation. Counsel for MFA remarked that his \u201cpartner\u201d was \u201cintimately involved in this legislation as it was winding its way through the [General Assembly].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Additionally, counsel for MFA, in correspondence to the Department of Health, notes that Warsaw HCC \u201cbegan reducing the number of residents in Warsaw starting around September of 04 in order to achieve an occupancy of 120\u201d by December 31, 2004. Counsel for MFA asserts that this is the reason that HB 2316 uses occupancy rates on a single date, December 31, as part of the classification criteria. CVHPA commented that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">occupancy on a single day is generally not used to identify unused capacity, rather overall occupancy for the year is commonly used in health planning since the average daily census of any facility can vary throughout a year based upon seasonality, staffing availability, management decisions, and other factors that may or may not be related to public need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>DCOPN noted that, contrary to HB 2816, no prior legislation regarding COPN applications had ever \u201cdirected substantial alterations in the review procedures, time frames, and content of a COPN review as set forth in the basic COPN law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">DCOPN stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">it is quite unlikely that any nursing home in Virginia, other than Warsaw HCC, could meet the very restrictive criteria of HB 2316. Other than a few nursing homes that opened in 2004, DCOPN can identify only two Virginia nursing homes, operated by multi-facility firms with locations in two or more planning districts, which had 2004 occupancy less than 67%. It seems unlikely that either of these two nursing homes would meet both the resident-origin requirement and the agency-staffing requirement set forth in HB 2316.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">MFA, however, denies that they are the only facility that meets the criteria set forth in HB 2316. There is little evidence on this point developed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The issue of whether HB 2316 was special legislation was before the Commissioner, but he did not rule on it. The Commissioner found only that the criteria set forth in HB 2316 had been met, and issued the COPNs on this basis. On appeal to the trial court, appellants again raised the constitutionality of HB 2316, but the trial court failed to rule on that issue. Instead, the trial court found that appellants had no standing to challenge the issuance of the COPNs.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Here, there are factual disputes between appellants and MFA that must be resolved before the test for special legislation can be applied. Appellants argue that HB 2316 applies only to MFA, while MFA argues that the classification of HB 2316 is broad and potentially applies to many different nursing homes in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Neither the Commissioner nor the trial court considered the purpose of HB 2316, whether the classification was reasonable, or whether the classification promotes the Act\u2019s purpose. There was no factual determination of the inclusiveness or exclusiveness of the classification. No determination was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>made as to whether Warsaw HCC was the only member of the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Thus, this Court cannot determine whether HB 2316 is special legislation. To do so would require this Court to make factual findings not made by the Commissioner or by the trial court. <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 727, 742, 644 S.E.2d 396, 403 (2007) (holding that, where the trial court denied a defendant\u2019s request \u201cusing an incorrect legal standard without making any of the predicate factual findings, one way or the other, required by the correct standard,\u201d the only appellate remedy was to vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions and \u201cremand the case to the trial court -with instructions to conduct a hearing on the matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Appellants raised a constitutional challenge to HB 2316 as special legislation that should have been considered by the trial court, as the trial court\u2019s standing analysis under the VAPA applied only to arguments reaching the merits of the Commissioner\u2019s decisions. Further, the Commissioner\u2019s decisions were predicated on the assumption that HB 2316 was constitutional, though no constitutional analysis was conducted by the Commissioner. I do not believe that we can indulge such assumptions without determining first whether HB 2316 is constitutional. I would reverse the decision of the trial court to dismiss appellants\u2019 petitions for appeal, and remand this case to the trial court with instructions to remand this case to the Commissioner to conduct a hearing to determine whether HB 2316 is unconstitutional special legislation. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">. MFA attributed the weak financial performance to \"poor survey results and a Department of Justice investigation,\u201d staff shortages, and the addition of a new nursing home facility in the Warsaw area. MFA noted that the combination of these factors led them to rely on outside agencies to staff their nursing positions and resulted in the facility operating at a loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1 defines \"project\u201d as, among other things, \"[a]n increase in the total number of beds or operating rooms in an existing medical care facility.\u201d This statute categorizes a nursing home as a \"medical care facility.\u201d Thus, the applications for the COPNs involved here would normally fall under the definition of \"project\u201d for purposes of this statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6(G) defines \"good cause\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">(i) there is significant relevant information not previously presented at and not available at the time of the public hearing, (ii) there have been significant changes in factors or circumstances relating to the application subsequent to the public hearing, or (iii) there is a substantial material mistake of fact or law in the Department staff\u2019s report on the application or in the report submitted by the health planning agency.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">. Although Warsaw HCC had a COPN to operate 180 nursing home beds, beginning in September 2004, MFA began reducing the number of occupied beds at Warsaw HCC with the goal of reaching 120 occupied beds by December 31, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">. CVHPA noted that they disagreed with the exclusion of MFA\u2019s applications from the normal review process for COPNs, remarking that prior legislation passed by the legislature had only removed the RFA process from the required COPN procedures. Further CVHPA believed that, under their Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Health, they were mandated to conduct the same review of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>COPN applications. As such, CVHPA proceeded as they would with any other application, notwithstanding the special procedures issued by DCOPN.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\">. Indeed, in an internal memorandum to the Commissioner dated December 9, 2005, DCOPN stated that they recommended approval of the applications \"only because the language of HB 2316 seems to leave us no choice\u201d and that approval was \"clearly harmful to the public interest that the COPN program is intended to serve.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. Three of the appellants filed their petitions for appeal in the Circuit Court for Chesterfield County, while the remaining two appellants filed their petitions for appeal in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond. These filings were based on the different physical locations of each appellant. As the petitions in Chesterfield County were filed first, venue was transferred in the cases arising in the City of Richmond to Chesterfield County and the separate petitions were consolidated into one case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">. Appellants raise various other arguments on appeal. However, the analysis of these issues requires a determination as to whether HB 2316 is unconstitutional special legislation. Because I would remand this case for a determination as to the constitutionality of HB 2316, I would not address any of these arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b655-5\">. In turn, the analysis in the majority opinion presupposes the constitutionality of HB 2316 without first determining whether the statute is constitutional. The majority contends that appellants have no remedy under VAPA, and must instead file a separate action for declaratory judgment or seek injunctive relief. Appellants raised the constitutionality of HB 2316 before the Commissioner, before the trial court, and before this Court throughout their appeal. By concluding that HB 2316 precludes any action under VAPA, the majority deems the statute constitutional without engaging in a review of the statute\u2019s constitutionality. It is this reasoning, also exhibited by the trial court, that prevents me from joining in the majority's analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b656-5\">. The majority opinion maintains that, in order to resolve the constitutionality of HB 2316, appellants had to seek either a declarative judgment or injunctive relief in the trial court <em>separately </em>from their administrative action under the VAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">I disagree. Appellants are entitled to receive complete relief administratively; they are not required to parse out their claims, pursuing some of their claims administratively and others simultaneously in the trial court. Our standard of review on appeal from agency decisions acknowledges that agencies do in fact decide issues of constitutionality.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A60\">\"If the issue falls outside the area generally entrusted to the agency, and is one in which the courts have special competence, i.e., the common law or <em>constitutional law,\" </em>the court need not defer to <em>the agency\u2019s interpretation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em>Chippenham &amp; Johnston-Willis Hosps., Inc. v.
