McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Matthew Tremaine Moore appeals his conviction, upon a conditional guilty plea, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Moore contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of these crimes because the officer who stopped him lacked probable cause to make a warrantless traffic stop, in violation of Moore\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. A panel majority of this Court reversed the decision of the trial court on different grounds. We granted a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The following facts are undisputed. Henrico County Police Officer W.T. Bryan stopped Moore\u2019s vehicle after observing a peeling inspection sticker on the windshield. Upon approaching the vehicle, Officer Bryan smelled marijuana. Officer Bryan then conducted a search of the vehicle and discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>various illegal drugs and a firearm. Moore was subsequently indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Moore moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle, contending the stop was illegal under the Fourth Amendment. The trial court concluded the stop was legally justified under a reasonable articulable suspicion standard, and denied the motion. Moore subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea on the two possession charges referenced above, preserving his right to appeal the ruling on his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The question presented in Moore\u2019s petition for appeal is: \u201cDid Officer Bryan have probable cause to make a traffic stop of the vehicle being driven by Moore on the sole basis that he observed that a valid inspection sticker was not totally affixed to the windshield of the vehicle?\u201d On brief, Moore reiterates that \u201cthe issue in this appeal\u201d is whether the officer had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to conduct the traffic stop of Moore\u2019s vehicle. He further asserts on brief that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has held that an officer must have probable cause to believe a traffic violation to have occurred, only then can the officer have the right to conduct a traffic stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Moore sets forth the wrong legal standard that governs this case and also misstates the law. Whether an officer is justified in making an investigatory traffic stop is not governed by probable cause; rather, the officer\u2019s action is judged by the lesser standard of reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 673, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004); <em>Shiflett v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 141, 146, 622 S.E.2d 758, 760-61 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">As no appeal was sought or granted on the issue of whether \u201cthe officer\u2019s action [was] supported by reasonable suspicion\u201d of \u201clegal wrongdoing\u201d when making the traffic stop, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750, \u201cwe may not consider this issue on appeal\u201d under Rule 5A:12(c). <em>Selph v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 426, 434, 632 S.E.2d 24, 28 (2006) (holding assignment of error barred under Rule 5A:12(c)). Rule 5A:12(c) provides that \u201c[o]nly questions presented in the petition for appeal will be noticed by the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>See Clifford v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 23, 25, 645 S.E.2d 295, 297 (2007) (reversing decision of this Court based, in part, on application of Rule 5A:12(c)); <em>Lay v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 330, 336 n. 3, 649 S.E.2d 714, 716 n. 3 (2007) (explaining that under Rule 5A: 12(c) \u201c[w]e ... do not answer [an] unasked question\u201d); <em>McLean v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 322, 329, 516 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cOnly those arguments presented in the petition for appeal and granted by this Court will be considered on appeal.\u201d (citing Rule 5A:12(c))). And unlike Rule 5A:18, Rule 5A:12(c) contains no \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to the prohibition of addressing issues outside the scope of the question presented. <em>See Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 620, 626, 500 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1998); <em>see also Selph, </em>48 Va.App. at 434, 632 S.E.2d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">For these reasons, we affirm Moore\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-12\">. Our <em>en banc </em>order had the effect of vacating the panel opinion. <em>See Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 423 n. 3, 642 S.E.2d 282, 287 n. 3 (2007) <em>(en banc) </em>(observing that the \u201cgrant of <em>en banc </em>review vacates the prior panel opinion <em>in toto\" </em>and thereby eliminates the need to address the \u201cdiffering views expressed by the panel majority and dissent\u201d); <em>see also Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 170, 622 S.E.2d 771, 772 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(recognizing that, with an <em>en banc </em>order, we \"set aside our panel opinion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b48-7\">HUMPHREYS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">I entirely join in the analysis and judgment of the majority and I write separately solely to emphasize the rationale for Rule 5A:12(c) and the necessity for adherence to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">As Judge Elder points out in his dissent, counsel for the appellant alleged in the trial court that Officer Bryan lacked \u201cprobable cause or a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to conduct a stop of the vehicle operated by Matthew Moore.\u201d Although phrased in the disjunctive in the trial court, it was apparent to me from appellant\u2019s brief and <em>en banc </em>oral argument, that appellant\u2019s counsel was erroneously using the distinctively different terms of constitutional art\u2014\u201cprobable cause\u201d and \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d\u2014interchangeably. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). This perhaps explains appellant\u2019s failure to allege as error in his issue presented, the actual legal standard relied upon by the trial court. However, such an explanation cannot operate as an excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Some might suggest our disposition of this case is an overly technical application of our Rules. However, under the constitutional and statutory scheme under which we operate, we must decide cases based upon the issues appellants present to us, not the issues they might or should have presented. At both the trial and appellate level, our system of justice is inherently an adversarial system and the courts may not properly assume the role of an advocate for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The rule of law can only exist if laws are administered fairly, rationally, predictably, consistently, and impartially. Our entire judicial system is premised upon the notion that, only a party acting <em>pro se </em>or a professional attorney, making strategic and tactical decisions as an advocate and theoretically in the client\u2019s best interest, may frame the issues the courts must resolve. To second guess counsel for the parties and substitute our collective judgment to re-frame issues in a way that may better serve the appellate interest of one of the parties, would necessarily call into question our objectivity and impartiality with respect to both the other party and the public generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Accordingly, we have no alternative but to affirm the judgment of the trial court for the reasons more fully stated in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b49-8\">PETTY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADA\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The majority opinion and Judge Humphreys\u2019 concurring opinion both make a very valid point regarding both the application and purpose of Rule 5A:12(c) as well as our obligation to ensure that appellants adhere to our Rules. It is a point with which I would typically agree. However, in this case I believe that we can decide the basic question presented by the appellant\u2014whether the trial court erred in denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>motion to suppress\u2014without doing harm to the purpose or effect of Rule 5A:12.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">While it is clear that appellant employed the irrelevant probable cause standard in his question presented, it is also clear that all parties involved in this case addressed the relevant standard of reasonable suspicion in arguing and deciding the case. The defense attorney as well as the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney identified the appropriate standard in their arguments to the trial court. The trial court obviously understood those arguments, commenting that \u201cit basically boils down to whether or not the officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion____\u201d In his opening brief, appellant argued that the officer had neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. The Attorney General understood the issue, rephrased the question presented to state the correct constitutional standard, and went on to address it. In a published decision, a panel of this Court decided the case on the merits. Finally, we never asked appellant to address the issue at oral argument. Simply put, at no time prior to our decision did the form of the question presented raise any concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">This case presents the rare occasion in which I believe that we should exercise our inherent authority to expand the question presented and decide the issue argued\u2014whether the stop of the appellant\u2019s car was in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For that reason, I do not join in the reasoning of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">I do, however, agree with the conclusion reached by the majority. For the reasons stated by the dissent in the panel decision, <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 294, 308-11, 640 S.E.2d 531, 538-39 (McClanahan, J., dissenting), <em>reh\u2019g en bane granted by Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 497, 642 S.E.2d 769 (2007), I would affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b50-8\">ELDER, J., with whom FELTON, C.J., and BEALES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">It is undisputed that, in the proceedings before the trial court, Moore\u2019s argument expressly included the assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Officer Bryan did not have \u201cprobable cause or a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to conduct a stop of the vehicle operated by Matthew Moore\u201d based solely on the fact that \u201cthe inspection sticker on the vehicle was not fully attached to the windshield.\u201d Thus, Moore properly preserved for appeal under Rule 5A:18 the dispositive issue of whether Officer Bryan had the reasonable suspicion necessary to validate the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Although the majority does not dispute that Rule 5A:18\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement has been satisfied, it concludes Moore\u2019s statement of his question presented\u2014which contended the stop was unreasonable based on a lack of probable cause without reference to the controlling legal standard of reasonable suspicion\u2014failed to satisfy Rule 5A:12(c). I disagree with the majority\u2019s application of Rule 5A:12(c), which the majority has raised for the first time <em>sua sponte </em>following argument on rehearing <em>en banc. </em>The Commonwealth posed no Rule 5A:12(c) objection at any stage of these proceedings, including on rehearing <em>en banc; </em>rather it merely restated the question presented so that it included the proper legal standard of reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause and proceeded to make argument on this issue. Further, I believe the majority interprets Rule 5A:12(c) too narrowly. Contrary to the majority\u2019s holding, I would conclude the trial court\u2019s ruling that Officer Bryan had the reasonable articulable suspicion necessary to conduct the stop was properly before us under Rule 5A:12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Rule 5A:12(c) provides that \u201c[o]nly questions presented in the petition for appeal will be noticed by the Court of Appeals.\u201d Here, Moore noted a timely appeal on the question presented, \u201cDid Officer Bryan have probable cause to make a traffic stop of the vehicle being driven by Moore on the sole basis that he observed that a valid inspection sticker was not totally affixed to the windshield of the vehicle?\u201d This question presented was specific enough to allow the Commonwealth and this Court to focus on the relevant issue\u2014whether the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was error\u2014such that the purpose of Rule 5A: 12(c) has been met. The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>monwealth clearly understood the relevant issue and\u2014without objection, as stated above\u2014simply rephrased the question presented to include the proper legal standard. Had Moore\u2019s assignment of error in fact been worded more generally to allege that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was error, without including any reference to reasonable suspicion or probable cause, it would be undisputed that the requirement of Rule 5A: 12(c) had been met. This stands in marked contrast to a situation in which we grant a petition for appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to prove one element of a crime and the appellant later attempts to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to prove a different element of the offense. <em>See Selph v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 426, 434, 632 S.E.2d 24, 28 (2006); <em>see also Clifford v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 23, 24-26, 645 S.E.2d 295, 296-97 (2007) (involving one objection at trial to limits on cross-examination, that Clifford should be allowed to cross-examine victim about her prior sexual contact leading to prosecution of a different defendant in order to show victim had access to law enforcement authorities but did not make contemporaneous report of Clifford\u2019s sexual contact, and a wholly different statement of error on petition for appeal, that Clifford had made a threshold showing of a \u201creasonable probability of falsity\u201d necessary to cross-examine victim about victim\u2019s prior false accusations against another under an exception to the rape-shield law). Here, the question whether reasonable suspicion for the stop existed was subsumed within the probable cause assignment of error because the same evidence was involved and the only difference in the legal analysis was whether that evidence met the \u201clesser\u201d legal standard of reasonable suspicion rather than the \u201cgreater\u201d legal standard of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Further, we have expressly held that \u201cthe text of [Rule 5A:12(c)] does not prevent this Court, in its discretion and pursuant to its inherent authority, from considering ... additional issues as long as the Court has acquired jurisdiction over the appeal via timely filing of the original petition for appeal.\u201d <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 440, 455, 579 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>S.E.2d 671, 678-79 (2003) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>268 Va. 296, 601 S.E.2d 555 (2004). To the extent the wording of Moore\u2019s assignment of error was not specific enough to place the issue of reasonable suspicion before us, I believe our consideration of the reasonable suspicion issue at the panel stage constituted an enlargement of the scope of the issues on which we granted appellant\u2019s petition for appeal. As set out above, the Commonwealth posed no objection to that consideration and, in fact, rephrased the question presented to set out the proper legal standard before arguing on brief why the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Thus, I would reach the merits of appellant\u2019s reasonable suspicion argument. Further, for the reasons set out in the panel majority decision in this case, <em>see </em>49 Va.App. 294, 300-308, 640 S.E.2d 531, 534-38 (2007), I would reverse appellant\u2019s convictions. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
