He argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance and refusing to allow his retained attorney to represent him, in violation of his right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we find no error and affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The facts of this matter are not in dispute. On September 7, 2005, a grand jury indicted Johnson for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Shortly thereafter, the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk (\u201ctrial court\u201d) appointed attorney Jon Eichler (\u201cEichler\u201d) to represent Johnson. The case was originally scheduled for January 23, 2006, but was continued by defense motion until March 16, 2006, so that the trial court could hold a suppression hearing. On March 16, 2006, Johnson requested a jury trial. As the case had previously been set for a bench trial, the trial court continued the case until May 9, 2006, again on motion of the defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">On May 9, 2006, at the outset of the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth amended Johnson\u2019s indictment to allege that Johnson had previously been convicted of a felony \u201cor adjudicated delinquent of an act which would be a violent felony if committed by an adult.\u201d Johnson asserted that he was entitled to a continuance because of the amendment to the indictment. After denying Johnson\u2019s suppression motion, the trial court granted Johnson\u2019s continuance motion, primarily because of the amendment to his indictment. The trial court ruled that the evidence received at the suppression hearing would be admissible at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court continued the case until June 20, 2006. Judge Everett Martin, the judge presiding, ordered that the case remain on his docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">On June 20, 2006, by joint motion of the parties, the trial court continued the case until July 12, 2006, this time so that the parties could \u201ckeep [the case] on Judge Martin\u2019s [d]oeket,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>because he had \u201calready begun hearing the case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By request of the Commonwealth, the trial court continued the case from July 12, 2006, until August 17, 2006. On this day, Attorney Duncan R. St. Clair, III, (\u201cSt. Clair\u201d) appeared in court and stated that he wished to substitute as defense counsel for Johnson. St. Clair stated that Johnson\u2019s family had \u201ccome into some money,\u201d and had retained him \u201cabout a week ago.\u201d St. Clair also stated that he would need a continuance if he became Johnson\u2019s defense counsel, because he had not yet reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The trial court denied this motion, stating that it \u201cnever believed that [a] defendant had a right to hire an attorney on the morning of trial,\u201d and declined to continue the case. Thus, the case proceeded with Eichler as Johnson\u2019s court-appointed attorney. The trial court convicted Johnson, and sentenced him to five years in the Virginia State Penitentiary. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Johnson argues on appeal that the trial court violated his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution by denying his motions for substitution of counsel and a continuance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>An accused\u2019s right to be represented by counsel includes \u201cnot only an indigent\u2019s right to have the government appoint an attorney to represent him, but also the right of any accused, if he can provide counsel for himself by his own resources to be represented by an attorney of his own choosing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Feigley v.

Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1616, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983)). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n order to justify a continuance \u2018by the last minute change of counsel, exceptional circumstances must exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Feigley, </em>16 Va.App. at 721, 432 S.E.2d at 523 (quoting <em>Shifflett v.

However, \u201conce a defendant is <em>erroneously </em>denied his right to counsel of choice, \u2018no additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation complete.\u2019 \u201d <em>London v.

Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 145, 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>S.Ct. 2557, 2562, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In <em>Feigley, </em>we held that a request for a continuance to obtain private counsel was not a \u201c \u2018justifiable request for a delay\u2019 \u201d when the defendant made the request on the day of trial, stating only that he had a \u201cbasic feeling\u201d that a privately retained attorney would represent him better than a court-appointed attorney. 16 Va.App. at 721, 432 S.E.2d at 523 (quoting <em>Paris, </em>9 Va.App. at 461, 389 S.E.2d at 722).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In this case, Johnson\u2019s family had \u201ccome into some money,\u201d and had retained St. Clair \u201cabout a week [earlier]\u201d after several continuances and a suppression hearing. Thus, Johnson\u2019s family had actually hired an attorney, as opposed to the defendant in <em>Feigley, </em>who merely wanted to hire one. Nonetheless, for the following reasons, we hold that this does not amount to an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d that warrants the last minute continuation of a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In <em>London, </em>which Johnson cites, we reversed a trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s continuance motion when the defendant\u2019s family retained a private attorney sixteen days before trial, the retained attorney notified the trial court twelve days before trial, and the trial court had granted no prior continuances at the defendant\u2019s request. 49 Va.App. at 239, 638 S.E.2d at 725. <em>London, </em>unlike this case, did not involve a last minute request for a continuance, and the situation in that case did not require \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In this case, although Johnson\u2019s family retained St. Clair a week before trial, neither Johnson nor St. Clair advised the trial court of this fact until the morning of trial. Furthermore, the case had been continued five times before Johnson asked the trial court to substitute St. Clair as his counsel, three times at Johnson\u2019s request, and once upon joint motion of Johnson and the Commonwealth. Thus, <em>London </em>is distinguishable on its facts from the case before us. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s decision was neither unreasoning nor arbitrary and we hold that it did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s request to substitute St. Clair as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>counsel and to continue the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Johnson also relies on <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to make the [Sixth Amendment] violation complete\u201d after a trial court erroneously denies a defendant his right to counsel of choice. 126 S.Ct. at 2562 (internal quotations omitted). However, <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>clearly applies only to situations where a trial court <em>erroneously </em>denies a defendant his right to counsel of his choice. Having held that the trial court did not err by denying Johnson\u2019s continuance and substitution of counsel, we also hold that <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In summary, several countervailing circumstances appear in the record before us that offset Johnson\u2019s last minute request to assert his Sixth Amendment right to an attorney of his choosing. These circumstances include the five prior continuances, the week-long delay until the morning of trial in informing the trial court and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney that new counsel had been retained, and the fact that witnesses were present and both the Commonwealth and John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>son\u2019s court-appointed attorney were ready to proceed. Thus, we cannot say as a matter of law that the trial court acted in an unreasoning or arbitrary manner when it determined that Johnson\u2019s right to an attorney of his choosing was outweighed by the Commonwealth\u2019s right to have its cases resolved expeditiously and efficiently. We therefore find no error in the refusal of the trial court to continue Johnson\u2019s case a sixth time and allow Johnson to substitute new counsel, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-15\">. Johnson also argued on brief, in a single question presented, that the trial court erroneously admitted his prior juvenile adjudications into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>evidence and that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 did not apply to him because his juvenile adjudication of guilt occurred before July 1, 2005. However, Johnson conceded at oral argument that there was no reversible error on this question presented. Accordingly, we do not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\">. Johnson apparently later changed his mind again and decided that he wanted a bench trial after all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\">.

The order further stated that the transcript had been ordered and would be sent to Judge Martin by July 7, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. At trial, Johnson also cited Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1(B), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">[When] the defendant undergoes a change of circumstances so that he is no longer indigent, the defendant shall thereupon obtain private counsel and shall forthwith advise the court of the change of circumstances. The court shall grant [a] reasonable continuance to allow counsel to be obtained and to prepare for trial. When private counsel has been retained, appointed counsel shall forthwith be relieved of further responsibility and compensated for his services[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASS\">Johnson does not argue the applicability of this statute on appeal. The dissent notes that Johnson raises this statute on page 2 of his brief, and in his \"table of authorities\u201d as well. What the dissent neglects to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>mention is that this hardly constitutes an \"argument,\u201d since Johnson only references the statute on page 2 of his statement of facts, in which he simply states that Eichler brought this statute to the attention of the trial court. As a result of this, the statute appeared in Johnson\u2019s \"table of authorities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">.

Five days before trial, the law partner of defendant\u2019s retained counsel appeared in the trial court and requested the substitution of the defendant\u2019s court-appointed attorney with retained counsel. <em>Id. </em>The law partner also moved for a continuance because appellant\u2019s retained counsel was on vacation and would not return until the next week. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney objected to the motions because three \u201cvery important\u201d witnesses were traveling great distances to attend the trial on the previously scheduled date. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 638 S.E.2d at 723. The trial court denied both motions, and this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, holding the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motions for continuance and substitution of counsel pursuant to an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the statutory requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1(B). <em>Id. </em>at 239, 638 S.E.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The majority attempts to distinguish this case from <em>London, </em>observing, in <em>London, </em>that the newly retained attorney hired by the defendant\u2019s mother notified the trial court of his intention to enter the case and seek a continuance twelve days before the trial. Therefore, the argument continues, the continuance requested in <em>London </em>was not a \u201clast minute\u201d continuance requiring \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d The problem with this argument is that appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice is not qualified by any state interest in avoiding \u201clast minute\u201d continuances. Rather, appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right is qualified only by the state interest in orderly and expeditious prosecutions. In short, it is not the time when the motion for a continuance is made that qualifies the Sixth Amendment right; it is the effect upon the orderly administration of justice if that motion be granted that generates the qualification. No cases suggest that an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>disappears at the \u201clast minute\u201d before trial commences. The language from <em>Feigley </em>and <em>Shifflett </em>cited by the majority is more sensibly understood to mean that a continuance to retain a lawyer on the eve of trial will rarely be appropriate because, at such a time, a continuance is much more likely to disrupt the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in an orderly and expeditious prosecution. <em>See United States v. Grow, </em>394 F.2d 182, 208-09 (4th Cir.1968) (affirming trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for a continuance to hire new lawyer when request was made at the beginning of jury selection during complicated savings &amp; loan fraud trial and trial judge stated he \u201cwould not permit withdrawal of counsel at the last moment \u2018to be used as an excuse for the postponement of this case\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v.

These federal appeals court cases are the authority relied on by our Supreme Court in <em>Shifflett </em>to introduce into Virginia law the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d language relied upon by the majority. <em>Shifflett, </em>218 Va. at 30, 235 S.E.2d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">When one compares the facts of <em>London </em>with the facts of this case while keeping the legally relevant state interest in mind, the majority\u2019s emphasis on the notice given by the defendant\u2019s new lawyer seems inappropriate. In <em>London </em>the attorney for the Commonwealth proffered that, \u201cthree \u2018very important\u2019 witnesses [were] traveling from great distances, including two from out of state, and that \u2018it would really inconvenience the Commonwealth....\u2019\u201d <em>London, </em>49 Va.App. at 233-34, 638 S.E.2d at 723. It seems unreasonable to decide that the absence of advanced notice in this case meaningfully distinguishes this case from <em>London. </em>Even though the notice that the defendant\u2019s new attorney gave to the trial court seems to have done little or nothing to lessen the adverse impact the requested continuance would have had on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>state\u2019s interest in an orderly and expeditious prosecution, <em>London </em>still held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the continuance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In this case, the attorney for the Commonwealth conceded that a continuance would not affect her ability to present her case, \u201cYour Honor, we have one witness. So that in itself is not an issue about continuing to the Commonwealth.\u201d The parties\u2019 stipulation that the prior testimony of Officer Dean would be part of the evidence at appellant\u2019s trial also suggests that the impact of a short continuance upon the prosecution\u2019s case would be <em>de minimis. </em>Indeed, as a result of this stipulation it is far from clear that the Commonwealth needed to call any witnesses at all. With the exception of a few new questions about the physical characteristics of the handgun he recovered from appellant, all of the facts to which Officer Dean testified at trial were already in evidence because of the stipulation. Before trial the Commonwealth was missing prima facie evidence of only one element of the offense charged in the indictment: evidence that appellant was a convicted felon or a person previously adjudicated delinquent of an offense which would have been a felony if committed by an adult. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The assistant Commonwealth\u2019s attorney was able to produce this evidence at trial using a certified copy of a robbery adjudication from the Virginia Beach Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, and the document\u2019s admission did not even require the testimony of a single foundation witness. Appellant also waived his right to a trial by jury. Short of a guilty plea, it is difficult to imagine a proceeding in which the task of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney could be completed so swiftly, easily, and conveniently.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Whether or not appellant got his continuance, this trial was going to be exceptionally quick and easy for the Commonwealth. But even this fact would not be enough to overcome the deference we owe to the trial court unless Mr. St. Clair had a good reason for asking for a continuance. Otherwise criminal defendants accused of simple offenses might avoid trial indefinitely by waiving their rights to a jury and stipulat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ing to the parts of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief that depend on the presence of live witnesses. However, Mr. St. Clair gave the trial court a sensible explanation for wanting a continuance. The same evidentiary stipulation that made this trial so simple for the Commonwealth would put appellant at a serious disadvantage if Mr. St. Clair had represented him without first reading a transcript of Officer Dean\u2019s suppression motion testimony. Without reading it, Mr. St. Clair would.have no way to subject the prosecution\u2019s case against his new client to meaningful adversarial testing. \u201c[I]f counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment Rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047. Officer Dean\u2019s suppression motion testimony covers eleven pages of the record on appeal. It does not take a long time to read. The majority points out that a continuance order dated June 20 reflects that a transcript had been ordered and would be sent to the trial judge by July 7, 2006. So there is reason to believe that the trial judge, the assistant Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, appellant\u2019s appointed counsel, or possibly all three of them, already possessed transcripts they might have lent to Mr. St. Clair. These facts suggest that only a very short continuance for Mr. St. Clair to read the transcript and discuss it with his client would have sufficed before he would be prepared for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">I also believe the majority is incorrect in suggesting its conclusion is supported by <em>Feigley, </em>16 Va.App. 717, 432 S.E.2d 520. First, the majority overlooks language in <em>London </em>expressly suggesting that <em>Feigley </em>is no longer good law because <em>Feigley </em>affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction at least in part because there was no evidence that court-appointed counsel was ineffective, an approach overruled by <em>Gonzalez-Lopez. London, </em>49 Va.App. at 239, 638 S.E.2d at 725. Second, the defendant in <em>Feigley, </em>as the majority rightly concedes, requested a continuance on the eve of trial to look into hiring an attorney. Some criminal defendants will not hesitate to feign an interest in retained counsel for the sole purpose of postpon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ing their trials. And appellate courts must seriously consider circumstances indicating that the only purpose of the continuance is to delay the trial. <em>See Grow, </em>394 F.2d at 208-09; <em>Gilchrist, </em>227 Va. at 546, 317 S.E.2d at 787. But there is no evidence that appellant was seeking a continuance for the sole purpose of delay. Indeed, the following exchange suggests that the trial judge did not believe that he was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">MR. EICHLER: The circumstances have changed. He\u2019s able and has hired counsel. I\u2019d point out that some of the other continuances were occasioned by the fact that the matter was misdocketed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">THE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">MR. EICHLER: They were not occasioned by actions on the part of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">THE COURT: You are exactly right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Because of these comments by the trial court, I believe the majority exaggerates the degree to which the prior continuances of this case support the denial of appellant\u2019s continuance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Mr. St. Clair needed only a brief continuance to prepare for trial, and the impact of the requested continuance on the state\u2019s countervailing interest in an orderly and expeditious prosecution would have been negligible. Under these circumstances, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion was \u201can unreasoning and arbitrary \u2018insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay....\u2019\u201d <em>Paris, </em>9 Va.App. at 461, 389 S.E.2d at 722 (quoting <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1616 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1 also requires that the trial court\u2019s decision be reversed. Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1(B) states that, when a change in circumstances enables an accused to retain his own lawyer, \u201c[t]he Court <em>shall grant </em>[a] reasonable continuance to allow counsel to be obtained and prepare for trial.\u201d (Emphasis added). The majority opinion quotes the statute in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>footnote but adds, \u201cJohnson does not raise this statute on appeal.\u201d This is incorrect. Appellant cites the statute on page ii of his brief in the \u201ctable of authorities.\u201d He mentions the statute again in the middle paragraph of page 2. Appellant\u2019s brief also states, \u201cJohnson relies on the recent case decided by this Court <em>London v. </em>Commonwealth....\u201d Our decision in <em>London </em>specifically relies on both the statute and the Sixth Amendment in deciding that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s continuance request. \u201cOnce the trial court is notified that the accused has retained counsel, the statute provides that \u2018appointed counsel shall be relieved of further responsibility,\u2019 and the trial court \u2018shall grant [a] reasonable continuance to allow [retained] counsel to ... prepare for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>London, </em>49 Va.App. at 236, 638 S.E.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The majority does not explain why they believe the citations to the statute by appellant\u2019s brief were insufficient to \u201craise the issue on appeal.\u201d Perhaps this conclusion is based upon a restricted view of the issues fairly raised by the \u201cquestion presented,\u201d as that term is used in Rules 5A:12 and 5A:20 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, that is, because the appellant\u2019s brief did not list as a separate question presented the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance violated Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1, it would be improper for us to consider the statute. I disagree. \u201cAs the Supreme Court of Virginia has made plain, these rules have been designed to protect the appellee, not to penalize the appellant.\u201d <em>Carlton v. Paxton, </em>14 Va.App. 105, 110, 415 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1992) (citing <em>Avery v. County School Board, </em>192 Va. 329, 333, 64 S.E.2d 767, 770 (1951)). Moreover, on brief appellant recites that he relies upon <em>London.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">More specifically, I also believe that adopting the majority\u2019s narrow view would be inconsistent with the way we viewed the scope of the question presented in <em>London. </em>Our question presented, according to appellant\u2019s brief is, \u201c[w]hether the trial court abused its discretion and violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it refused to allow retained counsel to substitute in the case.\u201d The question presented in <em>London, </em>according to this Court, was whether, \u201cthe trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>abused its discretion and violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it refused to allow him to be represented by his retained counsel of choice, and abused its discretion when it denied his requests for a continuance to permit his retained counsel a reasonable time to prepare for trial.\u201d <em>London, </em>49 Va.App. at 232, 638 S.E.2d at 722. Where the questions presented in the two cases are so close to being identical, I find it inconsistent for this Court to publish two decisions, one holding that the trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>London </em>violated Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1 and the other holding that appellant\u2019s case did not even raise the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">I would hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s continuance request violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and Code \u00a7 19.2-159.1(B). I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is also limited by \u201cthe judiciary\u2019s \u2018independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 600, 604, 652 S.E.2d 156, 158 (2007) quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>126 S.Ct. 2557, 2565-66 (2006). This limitation is not important to our resolution of the question presented in this case because nothing in the record suggests the existence of a conflict of interest or other ethical difficulty concerning Mr. St. Clair\u2019s representation of appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
