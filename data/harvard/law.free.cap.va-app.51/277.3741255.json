PETTY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Appellants, Town of Waverly Law Enforcement and Virginia Municipal Group Self-Insurance Association (collectively, \u201cemployer\u201d), appeal a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission granting Owens benefits. Employer argues that the commission erroneously applied the presumption of occupational disease as provided in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B). Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the record before us, we determine that the commission applied the law correctly; thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Owens, as the party prevailing below. <em>Whitlock v. Whitlock Mechanical/Check Servs., Inc., </em>25 Va.App. 470, 479, 489 S.E.2d 687, 692 (1997). On November 2, 2005, Owens filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim alleging an occupational disease after he suffered a heart attack. He was a police officer for the Town of Waverly, where he had worked since October 14, 2002. The parties stipulated that the Town did not request nor conduct a preemployment physical examination as set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Employer contested the workers\u2019 compensation claim, arguing that Owens was not entitled to the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402. In the absence of \u201ca preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) affords a police officer suffering from heart disease a presumption that his heart disease was caused by his or her employment and is a compensable \u201coccupational disease, suffered in the line of duty.\u201d The employer also maintained that, absent the presumption, Owens\u2019 heart disease was an ordinary disease of life that was not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The commission rejected employer\u2019s argument and awarded Owens compensation benefits. In doing so, it found that employer had failed to ask Owens to take a preemployment physical examination and that Owens had never been told that he suffered from heart disease prior to his heart attack. Accordingly, the commission held that the presumption applied in this case and that the employer \u201cfailed to exclude a work related cause and therefore failed to rebut the presumption that claimant\u2019s heart disease is an occupational disease.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Employer raises two issues on appeal. First, employer argues that the commission made an error of law when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>held that Owens was entitled to the statutory presumption in the absence of a preemployment physical examination. Employer reasons that changes to the statute made as a result of the 1991 recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act superseded our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>222 Va. 564, 281 S.E.2d 911 (1981). Employer also contends that, in the absence of the presumption, the evidence shows only that Owens\u2019 heart disease was a noncompensable ordinary disease of life. Because this case involves the interpretation of a statute, we review the commission\u2019s legal determination <em>de novo. Crawford v. Haddock, </em>270 Va. 524, 528, 621 S.E.2d 127, 129 (2005). Based upon that review, we hold that the commission correctly applied the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402; therefore, we need not reach employer\u2019s second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">A. City of Waynesboro v. Harter</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">At the time our Supreme Court decided <em>Harter, </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 afforded police officers a presumption of causation in workers\u2019 compensation claims arising from heart disease, just as Code \u00a7 65.2-402 does now. However, Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 stated, in pertinent part, that the presumption only applied \u201cprovided that prior to making any claim based upon such presumption, such ... [police officer] shall have been found free from ... heart disease ... by a physical examination which shall include such appropriate laboratory and other diagnostic studies as the [employer] shall prescribe....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In <em>Harter, </em>as in this case, the employer argued that the claimant was not entitled to the statutory presumption because he did not receive a preemployment physical examination. Our Supreme Court held that the word \u201cshall,\u201d used repeatedly in Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1, imposed an affirmative duty upon employers to conduct preemployment physical examinations before they could defeat the presumption by establishing that the claimant suffered a preexisting heart condition. <em>Harter, </em>222 Va. at 567, 281 S.E.2d at 913. In rejecting the employer\u2019s argument, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The interpretation urged on us by the City would eviscerate \u00a7 65.1-47.1 and defeat the obvious legislative intent. Not only would it give the employer the ability to defeat the statutory presumption, but it would also discourage municipalities from giving pre-employment examinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 567, 281 S.E.2d at 913. Thus, our Supreme Court affirmed the disability benefits award even though Harter had not undergone a preemployment physical. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">B. Recodification Of The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In 1991, some ten years after the <em>Harter </em>decision, the General Assembly recodified the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See </em>1991 Va. Acts, c. 355. During that recodification, Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 became Code \u00a7 65.2-402. <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-402 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cheart disease causing the ... impairment resulting in total or partial disability of ... members of ... town police departments ... shall be presumed to be [an] occupational disease[ ], suffered in the line of duty, ... covered by this title unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B). The statute imposes the following limitation on the applicability of the presumption: \u201cThe presumption[ ] ... shall only apply if persons entitled to invoke [it] have, <em>if requested by the [employer], ... </em>undergone preemployment physical examinations.... \u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-402(D) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Employer roots his argument in this statutory change, arguing that the phrase \u201cif requested by the [employer]\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(D) was specifically added to eliminate the mandatory nature of the preemployment physical as discussed in <em>Harter. </em>Thus, employer reasons that <em>Harter </em>was superseded by Code \u00a7 65.2-402 and therefore does not control the outcome of this case. Employer concludes that Code \u00a7 65.2-402 does not mandate that employers conduct a preemployment physical before asserting a bar to the presumption. Employer concludes that its failure to request that Owens undergo a physical examination makes the presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-402 unavailable to him. We are not, however, persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">C. Code \u00a7 65.2-402</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We must reject employer\u2019s argument that the linguistic differences between Code \u00a7 65.2-402 and the former Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 show that the General Assembly intended to legislatively overrule <em>Harter </em>based on the plain language of the statute and prior decisions of both this Court and our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Our analysis begins with the well-settled \u201cpresumption that a recodified statute does not make substantive changes in the former statute unless a contrary intent plainly appears in the recodified statute.\u201d <em>Waldrop v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 210, 214, 495 S.E.2d 822, 825 (1998) (citing <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. v. Major, </em>239 Va. 375, 378, 389 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Further, in the absence of an explicit statement to the contrary, we also presume that the General Assembly is familiar with the decisions of its appellate courts when it takes legislative action and that it \u201cacquiesce[s]\u201d in those decisions. <em>Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 803, 805, 553 S.E.2d 729, 730 (2001); <em>see also City of Norfolk v. Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. 424, 430, 424 S.E.2d 243, 247 (1992) (\u201cCode \u00a7 65.1-47.1 (now \u00a7 65.2\u2014402) has long been recognized as a remedial statute, enacted by the legislature to overcome the difficulty ... in proving causation. We presume that the legislature is cognizant of the interpretation the statute has been given by this Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia ....\u201d) (parenthetical in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Our examination of Code \u00a7 65.2\u2014402 and the prior decisions of both this Court and our Supreme Court did not reveal that the General Assembly plainly expressed an intention to substantively change Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 when it was recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-402. Moreover, we can find no expression of the General Assembly\u2019s purported disagreement with the <em>Harter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>decision. Thus, we reject employer\u2019s argument and affirm the commission\u2019s application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Furthermore, our conclusion is supported by both the longstanding policy behind the Act and the historical application of the presumption at issue here. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was adopted for the protection of workers and their dependents. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc., </em>223 Va. 641, 643, 292 S.E.2d 327, 328 (1982). Consistent with this overarching goal, we are to \u201c \u2018read [the statute] so as to promote [its] ability ... to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulala v. Boyd, </em>239 Va. 218, 227, 389 S.E.2d 670, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. King Land Corp., </em>238 Va. 97, 103, 380 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The mischief the General Assembly sought to remedy in enacting Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 was the risk that the classes of employees enumerated in the statute would be incapable of meeting their burdens of persuasion because of differences of opinion in the medical community regarding the causes of hypertension and heart disease. <em>See, e.g., Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Servs. v. Newman, </em>222 Va. 535, 538-39, 281 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1981) (\u201c \u2018The obvious purpose of the rebuttable presumption is to establish by law, in the absence of evidence, a causal connection between ... disability from certain diseases and the [claimant\u2019s] occupation.... The effect of the presumption is to eliminate the necessity for proof by the claimant of causal connection.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Page v. City of Richmond, </em>218 Va. 844, 847, 241 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1978))).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In cases involving the former statute, the presumption was applied somewhat liberally as a means to effectuate this purpose. <em>See generally, e.g., Harter, </em>222 Va. at 564, 281 S.E.2d at 911; <em>Garrison v. Prince William County Bd. of Supervisors, </em>220 Va. 913, 920, 265 S.E.2d 687, 691 (1980) (\u201cA claimant who has undergone a pre-employment physical examination failing to make a positive finding of the disease cannot be denied the benefit of the presumption merely because subsequent examinations conducted several years after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>employment as a police officer or fire fighter result in such a finding.\u201d); <em>Page, </em>218 Va. at 847, 241 S.E.2d at 777. The 1991 recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did nothing to nullify these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Here, the employer\u2019s proposed interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-402 would, just like the argument advanced by the employer in <em>Harter, </em>\u201ceviscerate [\u00a7 65.2-402] and defeat the obvious legislative intent\u201d behind the presumption. <em>Harter, </em>222 Va. at 567, 281 S.E.2d at 913. We can find no evidence of an explicit intent on the part of the General Assembly to justify such a major and far sweeping change in the interpretation and application of Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 when it was recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-402. The employer in this case bore the burden to show that the General Assembly had the intent to effect a substantive change in Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1 when it was recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-402, or that the General Assembly did not acquiesce in the <em>Harter </em>decision. <em>See Waldrop, </em>255 Va. at 214, 495 S.E.2d at 825. It has done neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We conclude that the commission did not err when it applied the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402 in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
