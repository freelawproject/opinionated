Duane Howard (appellant) appeals from his bench trial conviction for disorderly conduct in violation of the Roanoke City Code, based on his behavior during a city council meeting. On appeal he contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because his \u201cverbal utterances\u201d were expressly excluded from the scope of the ordinance and his disorderly conduct, if any, occurred during a recess. We hold the evidence of appellant\u2019s behavior excluding the content of his utterances was sufficient to support his conviction under the ordinance, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">On November 7, 2005, appellant attended a meeting of the Roanoke City Council. Prior to the 2:00 p.m. meeting, appellant and a companion engaged Police Officer John T. Rogers in conversation, asking Rogers why he was present. Rogers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>explained to both men \u201c[he] was there to make sure that everything ran fast and smoothly and everything was secure.\u201d They spoke about whether Officer Rogers had ever asked people to leave a meeting, and when he indicated he had, appellant inquired, \u201c[W]hat if they don\u2019t want to leave[?]\u201d Officer Rogers responded, \u201cthere\u2019s a thing called pain compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">When the meeting began at 2:00 p.m., Mayor Harris made an \u201copening statement telling everybody the rules he was going to apply for that meeting.\u201d Those rules included time limits at the podium for each of the 54 scheduled speakers; a requirement that comments relate to the issue at hand, which concerned whether to renovate the city\u2019s Victory Stadium; and a warning that \u201cany outbursts, ... any verbal attacks or anything against city council or any other people\u201d would not be tolerated. The mayor also advised the attendees \u201cthat the officers were [there] to make sure that was enforced.\u201d He said people who did not comply with the rules would \u201cfirst ... be asked to leave, and if they didn\u2019t, he said the officers [would] escort them out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">After appellant took his turn at the podium, \u201canother man was talking to city council saying his views,\u201d including his belief that some members of council were \u201crotten to the core,\u201d and the mayor was \u201cstopping him.\u201d At that time, appellant \u201cwas yelling out loud. Everybody was a little bit rumbling, but [appellant] was the loudest all the way from the back row ... yelling toward the city council,\u201d \u201c[L]et him speak, let him speak.\u201d Appellant had his hands \u201c[c]upped around his mouth\u201d \u201cwhen he was yelling.\u201d The mayor \u201cwarned everybody there ... that this would not be tolerated and ... he again laid down the rules of exactly what he expected.\u201d The mayor reiterated, \u201cWe are not having people heckle from the audience .... If people heckle from the audience, I will call a recess, and we will have the police officers come forward. We are going to conduct ourselves in a civil manner.\u201d After several additional speakers had taken their turns at the podium, the mayor calmly declared a five-minute recess between speakers, after which statements resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>At about 4:10 p.m., after more people had taken their turns at the podium, Officer Rogers stepped outside the chamber to brief the officer replacing him \u201con what was going on and what the mayor\u2019s rules were.\u201d Rogers told his replacement that appellant and others were heckling and that appellant was the \u201cloudest.\u201d At that same time, inside the chamber, the mayor repeated his request for \u201ccivil discourse,\u201d and as he was attempting to talk, appellant spoke in a loud voice while the mayor was attempting to speak. Appellant was again heckling by \u201c[c]upping\u201d his hands \u201caround his mouth,\u201d and his \u201cloud voice\u201d was audible on the videotape of the meeting. When appellant refused to be silent, the mayor said, in an agitated voice, \u201cMr. Howard\u2014Mr. Howard\u2014Where is the police officer? Where is the officer?\u201d Officer Rogers immediately re-entered the chamber and approached appellant, at which time, the mayor said, \u201cThank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Council stands in recess, Mr.\u2014officer,\u201d and rapped the gavel. Officer Rogers interpreted the mayor\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d as confirmation that appellant Howard \u201cwas the same gentlemen [the mayor had been] talking to\u201d for speaking out of turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Officer Rogers then spoke to appellant during the recess in order to remove him from the chamber, saying to appellant, \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve already had your time to speak____[W]hy don\u2019t you be a gentleman, stand up with me, and we\u2019ll walk out of here like two ... adults?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI have a right to speak.\u201d Officer Rogers again said, \u201c[S]ir, why don\u2019t you stand up and walk with me.\u201d Appellant said, \u201c[v]ery loud[ly],\u201d \u201c[I]f you want me out of here, you have to drag me out.\u201d When Officer Rogers, aided by Officer Johnson, tried again to get appellant to stand and leave the chamber, appellant repeated, \u201cIf you want me out, you have to drag me out.\u201d Appellant then \u201cwasn\u2019t responding\u201d and refused to look at Officer Rogers. Rogers \u201cput ... what we call a wristlock\u201d on appellant and, using that technique, Rogers \u201capplied pressure for [appellant] to stand up,\u201d which appellant did. \u201c[E]ach time [appellant] went to stop,\u201d Officer Rogers again applied pressure. Using this method, Rogers guided appellant outside the doorway to the chamber and then released him.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>When the mayor reconvened the council meeting after appellant had been removed from the chamber, the mayor said, \u201cI\u2019ll repeat again. I expect our discourse in this chamber to be civil. We are here to discuss an issue. I will <em>obviously </em>not tolerate heckling from the chamber. We now pick up with speaker 28....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Officer Rogers, after removing appellant from the chamber, obtained a summons charging him with disorderly conduct under Roanoke City Code \u00a7 21-9A2. At appellant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence in keeping with the above. Appellant testified in his own behalf, conceding the mayor had a right to set rules for the meeting and that he, along with others, broke the rules by speaking out of turn from the audience rather than from the podium. He also conceded that he \u201cverbally resist[ed]\u201d the officers\u2019 efforts to remove him from the chamber, but he denied \u201cphysically resisting]\u201d in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the recess was called \u201cbecause of what [appellant] was saying, not because he refused to leave.... It wasn\u2019t necessitated by his conduct. It was necessitated by his statements made,\u201d and the statements, he averred, were insufficient to constitute disorderly conduct under the ordinance. He also argued that his refusing to leave occurred during the recess and, thus, did not constitute \u201ca disruption of a public meeting because there wasn\u2019t a public meeting in place at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In finding the evidence sufficient to convict appellant for the charged offense, the trial court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">I\u2019m satisfied that the evidence shows a technical violation of the ordinance, ... that the recess was called to facilitate the removal of [appellant]. And the defense has conceded ... that the mayor and council have the right to have him removed.... [T]he evidence shows that there was a willful disruption of the meeting____And the conduct associated with his removal, his resistance and then forcible removal, as the officer said by the pain application, certainly length<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ened ... the recess and prevented the orderly conduct of the meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">$ $ ^ ^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">I\u2019m satisfied the Commonwealth has made [its case]. Treacherous though the shoals of the First Amendment might be ... in -winding our way through this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Following appellant\u2019s conviction, he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, we examine the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">The ordinance appellant was convicted for violating provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">(a) A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with the intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">H\u00ed H\u00ab H\u00ab \u2756 H\u00ab H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">(2) Willfully ... disrupts any meeting of the city council ... if such disruption prevents or interferes with the orderly conduct of such meeting ...; provided, however, such conduct shall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">Roanoke City Code \u00a7 21-9. This ordinance parallels the language in Code \u00a7 18.2-415, which also authorizes \u201c[t]he governing bodies of counties, cities and towns ... to adopt ordinances prohibiting and punishing the acts and conduct prohibited by this section.\u201d Although Code \u00a7 18.2-415 and the ordinance are arranged differently, both contain the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>sion that the conduct prohibited \u201cshall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words.\u201d Thus, prior appellate decisions interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-415 are relevant in our application of the Roanoke disorderly conduct ordinance to the facts in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">The \u201cquestion as to whether a particular act is disorderly conduct depends largely on the facts in the particular case, and in the determination of such question not only the nature of the particular act should be considered but also the time and place of its occurrence as well as all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\"><em>Keyes v. City of Va. Beach, </em>16 Va.App. 198, 200, 428 S.E.2d 766, 767 (1993) (quoting <em>Collins v. City of Norfolk, </em>186 Va. 1, 5, 41 S.E.2d 448, 450 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Appellant contends the ordinance proscribes only disorderly conduct, not disorderly speech, and that his only conduct consisted of twice refusing to leave the council chamber when asked to do so by Officer Rogers during the recess. He contends that because this conduct occurred during a recess in the council meeting, it did not constitute a \u201cdisruption [that] prevented] or interfere^] with the orderly conduct of such meeting,\u201d as required for a conviction. We disagree. A review of the history of Virginia\u2019s disorderly conduct statute and the specific language of the statute and related ordinance makes clear the court was entitled to consider the entire course of appellant\u2019s conduct, excluding the content of his speech but including the time and manner of his speaking. We hold this evidence of appellant\u2019s conduct, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supported his conviction for violating the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The provision in the disorderly conduct statute stating that the conduct prohibited \u201cshall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words\u201d was added in 1976, following a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit holding the statute \u201cunconstitutionally vague and overbroad particularly given its potential impact on free speech protections.\u201d <em>Battle v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>135, 139, 647 S.E.2d 499, 501 (2007) (citing <em>Squire v. Pace, </em>516 F.2d 240 (4th Cir.1975), <em>aff'g </em>380 F.Supp. 269 (W.D.Va.1974)). The statute applicable prior to that time, Code \u00a7 18.1-253.2, provided in relevant part as follows: \u201c \u2018If any person behaves in a riotous or disorderly manner in any street, highway, public building or any other public place, ... he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u2019 \u201d 380 F.Supp. at 276 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.1-253.2 (1973 Supp.)). The district court in <em>Squire </em>recognized the United States Supreme Court\u2019s prior holdings that \u201cthe state may reasonably limit the time, manner, and place of expression,\u201d but it noted that the statute\u2019s proscription against \u201cbehav[ing] in a riotous or disorderly manner,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.1-253.2, \u201cfail[ed] to specify with any particularity whatsoever the conduct proscribed ... [or the] intent required\u201d and gave \u201cno consideration ... to the exercise of constitutional rights\u201d under the First Amendment. <em>Squire, </em>380 F.Supp. at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The General Assembly\u2019s rewriting of Virginia\u2019s disorderly conduct statute in 1976\u2014specifically the addition of language excluding from the statute\u2019s scope \u201cthe utterance or display of any words\u201d\u2014must be viewed in light of the pronouncements in <em>Squire </em>that the prior statute provided inadequate protections for First Amendment rights. <em>See, e.g., Burke v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 183, 188, 510 S.E.2d 743, 745-46 (1999) (\u201cWhen new provisions are added to existing legislation by amendment, we presume that, in making such amendment, the legislature \u2018acted with full knowledge of and in reference to the existing law upon the same subject and the construction placed upon it by the courts.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>City of Richmond v. Sutherland, </em>114 Va. 688, 693, 77 S.E. 470, 472 (1913))). The United States Supreme Court decisions upon which the court relied in <em>Squire </em>permit reasonable limits on the time, place and manner of speech and prohibit only punishment based on the <em>content </em>of the speech. <em>See Squire, </em>380 F.Supp. at 279 (citing cases); <em>see also Adams Outdoor Adv. v. City of Newport News, </em>236 Va. 370, 382, 373 S.E.2d 917, 922 (1988) (holding that \u201c[r]estrictions on the time, place and manner of expressions are permissible if \u2018they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, ... serve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>significant governmental interest, and ... leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Citizens Consumer Research, </em>425 U.S. 748, 771, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830, 48 L.Ed.2d 346, 364 (1976))). As the Supreme Court of West Virginia recognized in upholding a conviction under that state\u2019s \u201canti-disruption statute\u201d based on time, place, and manner principles,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayr\">If concerned citizens were permitted to assert their First Amendment rights by addressing public meetings at will, without following established procedures, the governmental body would cease to function and no meaningful communication could occur. \u201cFirst Amendment rights are not a license to trample upon the rights of others. They must be exercised responsibly and without depriving others of their rights, the enjoyment of which is equally precious.\u201d <em>Barker v. Hardway, </em>283 F.Supp. 228, 238-39 (S.D.W.Va.1968) (quoting <em>Baines v. City of Danville, </em>337 F.2d 579, 586 (4th Cir.1964)), <em>aff'd, </em>399 F.2d 638 (4th Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 905, 89 S.Ct. 1009, 22 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><em>State v. Berrill, </em>196 W.Va. 578, 474 S.E.2d 508, 513-14 (1996) (decided under statute that does not exclude \u201cthe utterance or display of any words,\u201d as Virginia\u2019s does).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Appellant contends the ordinance is unambiguous and that we must strictly construe it and apply its plain meaning, a proposition with which we agree. <em>See, e.g., Gunn v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 580, 587, 637 S.E.2d 324, 327-28 (2006). We disagree, however, with appellant\u2019s argument as to the result of such application. Contrary to the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel at trial that \u201c[the ordinance] says yelling is not a violation of it,\u201d what the ordinance actually provides is that the proscribed conduct \u201cshall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words.\u201d As the trial court expressly found in ruling on the motion to strike, appellant was not removed from council chamber for \u201cthe utterance ... of any words,\u201d i.e., the content of what he spoke. Rather, he was removed based on the \u201ctime, manner, and place\u201d in which he spoke\u2014yelling repeatedly with his hands cupped, presumably to further magnify his voice, while the mayor was attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>to speak and after appellant had already had his turn at the podium. The behavior <em>accompanying </em>appellant\u2019s speaking, without regard for the content of the speech, was in clear violation of the time, place, and manner restrictions set out by the mayor at the beginning of the meeting and again while the meeting was underway. <em>Cf Mannix v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 271, 280, 522 S.E.2d 885, 889 (2000) (holding, under different subsection of disorderly conduct statute\u2014which proscribed \u201cconduct having a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, such conduct is directed\u201d\u2014that \u201cboard [of supervisors\u2019] chairman could not disregard Mannix\u2019s conduct and continue the meeting\u201d because \u201cthe chairman was unable to solicit comments from other citizens while Mannix remained at the podium\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">If appellant merely had made noises or hummed at a similarly loud volume rather than yelling and chanting, \u201cLet him speak,\u201d when the mayor tried to cut off a speaker at the podium, appellant\u2019s actions would clearly have run afoul of the ordinance. We see nothing in the language of the ordinance indicating it should be applied any differently when the violation is caused by similarly disruptive conduct that happens to be accompanied by \u201cthe utterance ... of any words.\u201d To hold otherwise would allow appellant to insulate himself from criminal responsibility for his disruptive conduct simply because he \u201cutter[ed] ... any words\u201d while engaging in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Further, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the recess at issue was called solely to permit removal of appellant so that the meeting could continue without his ongoing interruptions, and appellant\u2019s counsel said at trial that he \u201caccepted] that ruling.\u201d When the mayor had called an earlier recess, he did so calmly and indicated the recess would last five minutes. When the mayor called the recess at issue, by contrast, he did so in the midst of appellant\u2019s disruption. Immediately prior to declaring the recess at issue, the mayor had been attempting to restate the chamber\u2019s rules of discourse but was unable to complete that restatement due to appellant\u2019s ongoing verbal disruption. The mayor then re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>peated appellant\u2019s name in an agitated voice in an effort to persuade appellant to cease the disruption. When appellant continued to talk out of turn, the mayor called for the officers handling security and immediately \u201cgaveled a recess\u201d as he simultaneously thanked the officers for their prompt appearance at appellant\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">As the recess began, appellant twice refused Officer Rogers\u2019s requests to leave the chamber like an \u201cadult[]\u201d and \u201ca gentleman.\u201d Appellant stood only when Officer Rogers applied pressure to appellant\u2019s wrist in a \u201cwristlock,\u201d and appellant walked toward the door only when Officer Rogers re-applied that pressure. Only through the repeated reapplication of that pressure was Officer Rogers able to remove appellant from the chamber. When the mayor reconvened the meeting after appellant had been removed from the chamber, the mayor said, \u201cI\u2019ll repeat again. I expect our discourse in this chamber to be civil. We are here to discuss an issue. I will <em>obviously </em>not tolerate heckling from the chamber. We now pick up with speaker 28----\u201d This evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the recess was called solely to facilitate appellant\u2019s removal and that appellant\u2019s behavior in refusing to leave the chamber at Officer Rogers\u2019s request delayed the resumption of the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Thus, appellant\u2019s verbal disruptions while the meeting was taking place and his twice failing to leave the council chamber when Officer Rogers asked him to do so and moving toward the door only when Officer Rogers applied pressure through a wristlock were a violation of the ordinance because that conduct disrupted the meeting, caused the mayor to call the recess, and delayed resumption of the meeting, thereby \u201cpreventing] or interfering] with the orderly conduct of [the] meeting,\u201d Roanoke City Code \u00a7 21-9(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>supported a finding that appellant engaged in <em>conduct </em>that violated the ordinance, including the conduct accompanying his speech, and that he was not punished for his \u201cutterance ... of any words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence of appellant\u2019s entire course of conduct, excluding the content of his utterances, was sufficient to support his conviction for violating the ordinance, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">. Because the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the recess was called due to appellant\u2019s disruptive conduct during the meeting and the need to remove him so that the meeting could continue, we need not decide whether disruptive conduct occurring during a scheduled recess may constitute \u2018\u2018interfere[nce] with the orderly conduct of such meeting\u201d under the ordinance or Code \u00a7 18.2-415.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
