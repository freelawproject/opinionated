Virginia Tech asks us to reverse the judgment of the circuit court and reinstate the hearing officer\u2019s decision, arguing that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was not contradictory to law. Virginia Tech also argues that the hearing officer erred in not admitting evidence of the employee\u2019s prior misconduct. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court. We do not address Virginia Tech\u2019s second question presented, as it is procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">\n<em>A. Quesenberry\u2019s Encounter with Rebecca Hampton</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">The hearing officer found the following facts in his decision. Maynard Quesenberry (\u201cQuesenberry\u201d) was employed as a business manager at Virginia Tech responsible for overseeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the university mail system. Quesenberry received progressive promotions during his career at Virginia Tech, and in 2004, received special recognition from the university for his suggestions to improve the university\u2019s operations. At the time Virginia Tech terminated his employment in March 2006, Quesenberry had worked for Virginia Tech for approximately twenty-nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Quesenberry also served as a volunteer coach and board member of a nearby boxing club, which is a non-profit organization intended to assist disadvantaged youth by helping them develop self-esteem and self-discipline. In order to raise funds for the boxing club, the board members discussed the possibility of producing a boxing calendar to sell to local businesses. The proposed calendar would feature photos of attractive young women posing in the context of boxing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Emmet Long (\u201cLong\u201d) worked for Virginia Tech as the residential mail supervisor, and reported directly to Quesenberry. Although Long was not affiliated with the boxing club, he became interested in the production of the calendar, and asked several female students if they wished to pose for the calendar. Long later stopped asking students to pose for the calendar at Quesenberry\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On December 9, 2005, Quesenberry and Long were leaving the university mail room when Long told Quesenberry that he wanted to introduce him to an acquaintance of his, Rebecca Hampton (\u201cHampton\u201d), and indicated that she might be interested in posing for the calendar. Hampton was a twenty-year-old female student at Virginia Tech, and an employee of We Care, a student-run organization whose purpose was to assemble and distribute care packages around the university. Although Hampton\u2019s superiors included full-time Virginia Tech employees, Quesenberry did not supervise Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Quesenberry and Long entered Hampton\u2019s office, and Long introduced Quesenberry as his supervisor. Long indicated to Quesenberry that Hampton might be interested in posing for the calendar. Quesenberry then told Hampton he was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>volved in the boxing club and that he was looking for models to pose for his calendar. Quesenberry asked Hampton if she would be interested in posing for the calendar, wearing either a bathing suit or \u201cshort shorts,\u201d and assured Hampton that the photos would be done in \u201cgood taste.\u201d During the conversation, Hampton grabbed a piece of candy, and Quesenberry admonished her not to eat it, stating \u201cif you continue eating that, you will look like a little refrigerator with your head on top.\u201d The total conversation lasted between eight and fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Hampton felt that Quesenberry\u2019s comments toward her were inappropriate, and she also felt \u201cobjectified.\u201d Hampton reported the incident to her supervisor, who in turn reported it to officials higher in the university hierarchy. Virginia Tech then launched a formal investigation into the incident. After her interaction with Quesenberry, Hampton began taking a more circuitous route to her office to avoid any further contact with Quesenberry or Long. Hampton also began closing and locking her door with more frequency when she came to her office. Neither Quesenberry nor Long had any further contact with Hampton after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Quesenberry\u2019s supervisor issued him a \u201cGroup III\u201d written notice of discipline for the incident with Hampton, and terminated his employment with Virginia Tech, based on Quesenberry\u2019s violation of Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025, an anti-sexual harassment and discrimination policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Quesenberry filed a grievance, and, after exhausting internal remedies, requested a hearing. In addition to the factual findings stated above, the hearing officer found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">As a result of her conversation with [Quesenberry], [Hampton] regularly began closing and locking her office door and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>withdrawing from communication with other employees working in offices next to her office. By withdrawing into her office, [HamptonJ\u2019s work performance and participation in University activities was diminished. This interference was unreasonable because the degree to which [Hampton] openly communicated with other employees was significantly reduced. In particular, [Hampton] changed from a very extroverted outgoing employee to a secluded introverted employee. This change materially affected her and the others around her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The hearing officer additionally found that, all things considered, Hampton \u201coverreacted\u201d to Quesenberry\u2019s conduct. The hearing officer based his finding partially on the fact that Hampton did not believe the calendar would be in \u201cgood taste\u201d despite clear evidence that Quesenberry intended for the calendar to be tasteful.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Nevertheless, the hearing officer concluded that Quesenberry\u2019s conduct violated Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025, because \u201c[b]y any objective standard, it was inappropriate for a female to be asked to pose wearing short shorts or a bathing suit for a calendar unrelated to the University\u2019s mission.\u201d The hearing officer continued to state that \u201c[although [Quesenberry]\u2019s behavior was not sexual harassment in the legal sense because it was neither severe nor pervasive, his actions could have been a piece of the foundation of a sexual hostile work environment claim.\u201d The hearing officer then found that Quesenberry\u2019s conduct amounted only to a \u201cGroup II\u201d violation of university policy, but upheld Quesenberry\u2019s termination because Quesenberry had a previous \u201cGroup II\u201d violation on his disciplinary record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Quesenberry timely appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">By order dated April 24, 2007, the circuit court reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision as contrary to law, concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>under \u201cany objective standard of reasonableness, [Quesenberry]\u2019s conduct, as complained of, was not sexual harassment.\u201d The circuit court ordered Virginia Tech to reinstate Quesenberry to his position, compensate Quesenberry for all accrued pay since the date of his termination, and reinstate all of Quesenberry\u2019s benefits as if there had been no break in service. Virginia Tech now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">\n<em>.STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In a state employee\u2019s grievance hearing, \u201c[t]he hearing officer\u2019s decision \u2018shall (i) be in writing, (ii) contain findings of fact as to the material issues in the case and the basis for those findings, and (iii) be final and binding if consistent with law and policy.\u2019\u201d <em>Tatum v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Agric. &amp; Consumer Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 110, 121, 582 S.E.2d 452, 458 (2003) (quoting Code \u00a7 2.2-3005(D)). \u201c[The applicable] statutes clearly provide the hearing officer is to act as fact finder and ... [its] determination ] is [not] subject to judicial review[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121-22, 582 S.E.2d at 458 (quoting <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Barton, </em>39 Va.App. 439, 445, 573 S.E.2d 319, 322 (2002)). As such, the factual findings of a hearing officer are binding upon an appellate court. <em>See id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe only grounds of appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u2018that the determination is contradictory to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting former Code \u00a7 2.1-116.07:1(B) (recodified as amended at \u00a7 2.2-3006(B))). On appeal, Quesenberry has the burden of \u201cidentifying] [a] constitutional provision, statute, regulation, or judicial decision which the [hearing officer\u2019s] decision contradicts.\u201d <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 446, 573 S.E.2d at 323. An appellate court reviews issues of law <em>de novo. Bristol v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 568, 573, 636 S.E.2d 460, 463 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">\n<em>I. Whether Quesenberry\u2019s Conduct Constituted Sexual Harrassment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Virginia Tech first argues that the hearing officer\u2019s decision should be reinstated because the hearing officer correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>found that Quesenberry\u2019s conduct violated Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">As stated above, we review a hearing officer\u2019s decision only to determine whether it is \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 445, 573 S.E.2d at 322. \u201c \u2018Law' is the \u2018aggregate of legislation, judicial precedents, and accepted legal principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 573 S.E.2d at 323 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>889 (7th ed.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Virginia Tech notes that Policy No. 1025, its official university policy prohibiting sexual harassment among university employees, comports with federal anti-discrimination law, namely Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Furthermore, Policy No. 1025\u2019s definitions of sexual harassment are taken directly from 29 C.F.R. 1604.11(a), the federal regulation defining sexual harassment as it pertains to Title VII.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>this is a case of first impression in Virginia, and because Virginia Tech has patterned its sexual harassment policy on the provisions of Title VII, we turn to judicial interpretations of Title VII and consider their persuasive merit in determining whether the hearing officer\u2019s decision that Quesenberry violated Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025 was contradictory to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">\u201cThe concept of sexual harassment is designed to protect working women from the kind of male attentions that can make the workplace hellish for women.... It is not designed to purge the workplace of vulgarity.\u201d <em>Baskerville v. Culligan Int\u2019l Co., </em>50 F.3d 428, 430 (7th Cir.1995). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has recognized a \u201cline that separates the merely vulgar and mildly offensive from the deeply offensive and sexually harassing.\u201d <em>Carr v. Allison Gas Turbine Div., </em>32 F.3d 1007, 1010 (7th Cir.1994). \u201cConduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment\u2014an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive\u2014is beyond Title VII\u2019s purview.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). \u201cUnlike other, more direct and discrete unlawful employment practices, hostile work environments generally result only after an accumulation of discrete instances of harassment.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Alternative Res. Corp., </em>458 F.3d 332, 339 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In order to determine as a matter of law whether conduct falls within the purview of Title VII, reviewing courts look to the totality of the circumstances. <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. The applicable factors may include \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025 defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when[ ] ... [s]uch conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work ... or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or academic environment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Thus, in order to discipline an employee for sexual harassment under this policy, the evidence must establish that (1) the employee made unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or nonverbal conduct of a sexual nature towards a fellow employee; and (2) that conduct either had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or academic environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The first question we must answer is whether Quesenberry\u2019s proposal could be reasonably interpreted as a sexual advance, a request for a sexual favor, or other sexual conduct. After considering all of the circumstances, and using an objective standard, we conclude that a reasonable person could not consider Quesenberry\u2019s proposal to be sexual in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Quesenberry approached Hampton, who was not under his supervision, on one isolated occasion and spoke to her for no more than fifteen minutes. He asked her if she would pose for a fund-raising calendar in a bathing suit or \u201cshort shorts,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and assured her that the photos would be done in \u201cgood taste.\u201d He made no comments or gestures that objectively betrayed a sexual intent, and did not ask her for a date or suggest any other personal social interaction. He did not touch Hampton, nor did he make any other type of advance towards her. While a reasonable person may have found Quesenberry\u2019s proposal annoying and inappropriate, to say that an isolated proposal to pose for photographs in a bathing suit or \u201cshort shorts\u201d for publication in a calendar necessarily contains veiled references to sex, strains credulity.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The holdings of federal courts addressing similar questions with regard to Title VII bolster this analysis. In <em>Baskerville, </em>the male supervisor of a female employee frequently referred to the employee as a \u201cpretty girl,\u201d and made grunting noises that sounded like \u201cum um um\u201d when she wore a leather skirt to the office. 50 F.3d at 430. When she commented on how hot his office was, he replied that it was \u201cnot [hot] until you stepped your foot in here.\u201d When the announcement \u201cmay I have your attention please\u201d was broadcast over the public-address system, he stopped at her desk and said, \u201cYou know what that means, don\u2019t you? All pretty girls run around naked.\u201d Once, when she complained that his office was \u201csmokey\u201d from cigarette smoke, he replied, \u201cOh really? Were we dancing, like in a nightclub?\u201d During a period when the supervisor was not living with his wife, he commented that it was \u201clonely in his hotel room ... and all he had for company was his pillow.\u201d He then looked provocatively at his hand, in a gesture suggesting masturbation. All of these incidents took place over a seven-month time span. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The employee brought a Title VII sexual harassment claim against the company, and a jury awarded her $25,000. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a Title VII claim. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">[i]t is no doubt distasteful to a sensitive woman to have such a silly man as one\u2019s boss, but only a woman of Victorian delicacy-a woman mysteriously aloof from contemporary American popular culture in all its sex-saturated vulgarity-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>would find [the supervisor]^ patter substantially more distressing than the heat and cigarette smoke of which the plaintiff does not complain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 431. The court also stressed the infrequency of the conduct, noting that a \u201chandful of comments spread over months is unlikely to have so great an emotional impact as a concentrated or incessant barrage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In this case, Quesenberry\u2019s comments to Hampton were even more innocuous than those made in <em>Baskerville. </em>While Quesenberry asked Hampton if she would pose tastefully in a bathing suit or \u201cshort shorts,\u201d the supervisor in <em>Baskerville </em>implied that the plaintiff in that case should \u201crun around naked.\u201d In <em>Baskerville, </em>the plaintiffs supervisor used his hand to make transparent references to masturbation, while Quesenberry made no such crude gestures. While the plaintiffs supervisor in <em>Baskerville </em>made comments clearly expressing a personal interest in the plaintiff, Quesenberry\u2019s proposal was more detached and impersonal. Finally, Quesenberry only approached Hampton on one occasion, as opposed to numerous times over a seven-month period, as did the plaintiffs supervisor in <em>Baskerville.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">While a violation of Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025 for sexual harassment may require a lower quanta of evidence than a sexual harassment claim under Title VII, we nonetheless agree with the circuit court and conclude that Quesenberry\u2019s conduct was insufficient as a matter of law to support a violation of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Having concluded that Quesenberry\u2019s proposal was not sexual, we need not address whether the proposal had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with Hampton\u2019s work. Therefore, we hold that Quesenberry\u2019s proposal, as a matter of law, did not fall within the ambit of Policy No. 1025. Thus, the hearing officer\u2019s decision was contrary to law, and we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\n<em>II. Evidence of Prior Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AOC\">Virginia Tech also argues that the hearing officer erred in not admitting evidence of Quesenberry\u2019s prior mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>conduct during the hearing. Virginia Tech, however, cites no authority or principles of law in support of its argument. \u201cStatements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Budnick v. Budnick, </em>42 Va.App. 823, 833, 595 S.E.2d 50, 55 (2004) (quoting <em>Roberts v. Roberts, </em>41 Va.App. 513, 527, 586 S.E.2d 290, 297 (2003)); <em>see </em>Rule 5A:20(e) (requiring appellants to brief the \u201cprinciples of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented\u201d). Because Virginia Tech cites no authority in support of its argument, this question is procedurally defaulted, and we will not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">For the reasons stated, we agree with the circuit court and hold that the hearing officer\u2019s decision regarding Quesenberry\u2019s violation of Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025 was contradictory to law. We refrain from addressing Virginia Tech\u2019s second argument, as it is procedurally defaulted. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. A \"Group III\u201d offense is an act or behavior \"of such a serious nature that a first occurrence should normally warrant removal.\u201d Va.

In oral argument, Virginia Tech argued that reference to federal cases construing Title VII should not be considered by us because \"[the policy] is Virginia Tech\u2019s policy and not a Title VII case and Virginia Tech can interpret [its policy] any way it wants.\u201d However, we note that Code \u00a7 2.2-3900, the Virginia Human Rights Act, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atm\">It is the policy of the Commonwealth to: [ ][s]afeguard all individuals within the Commonwealth from unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, marital status, or disability, ... in employment^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Furthermore, Code \u00a7 2.2-2639(D) states that: \u201d[c]auses of action based upon the public policies reflected in this article shall be exclusively limited to those actions, procedures and remedies, if any, afforded by applicable federal or state civil rights statutes or local ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtI\">In <em>Doss v. Jamco, Inc., </em>254 Va. 362, 492 S.E.2d 441 (1997), the Supreme Court of Virginia interpreted Code \u00a7 2.1-725(D), the predecessor to Code \u00a7 2.2-2639(D), to prohibit causes of action for wrongful discharge from employment based upon the policies reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act (\"VHRA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 371, 492 S.E.2d at 446. While rejecting causes of action arising from violations of the VHRA, the Court nonetheless recognized that the VHRA is an expression of Virginia public policy and that the General Assembly had intended to limit causes of action to those provided by federal or state civil rights statutes, such as Title VII. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we view Code \u00a7 2.2-2639(D) as evidence that the General Assembly considered the public policies of Virginia as expressed in the VHRA to be analogous to those expressed in Title VII. Moreover, since the definition of \"sexual harassment\u201d in Virginia Tech\u2019s Policy No. 1025 is taken almost verbatim from 29 C.F.R. 1604.11(a), the Federal Regulation construing Title VII, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>find it appropriate to consider Title VII jurisprudence as persuasive precedent to assist us in interpreting Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. In defining sexual harassment as sexual \u201cconduct [that] has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work[,]\u201d Virginia Tech has elevated the final factor mentioned in <em>Harris </em>to dispositive status. Therefore, Virginia Tech Policy No. 1025 requires less egregious conduct for a finding of sexual harassment with regards to employee discipline than what a plaintiff in a Title VII sexual harassment claim is required to prove. Nevertheless, we find that even under the more relaxed standard contained in Virginia Tech\u2019s policy, it is appropriate to apply the totality of the circumstances test described in <em>Harris </em>to determine whether Quesenberry\u2019s conduct constituted sexual harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
