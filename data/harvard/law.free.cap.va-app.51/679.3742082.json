Scialdone, Barry R. Taylor, and Edward S. Jones each appeal from a finding of summary contempt for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-456.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, each contends the proceeding in which he was convicted for contempt was not a summary proceeding and, thus, that he was improperly denied his due process rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including the rights to pretrial notice, to present a defense, and to be represented by counsel. We hold each of the appellants was denied his right to due process, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>consistent with this opinion if the trial court and the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Beginning on July 12, 2006, Frankie Dulyea was tried by a jury for several offenses, all of which stemmed from online conversations he had in April and May 2005 with an undercover police officer posing as a twelve-year-old girl. Dulyea was represented by attorneys Claude Scialdone and Barry Taylor, of Scialdone &amp; Taylor, Inc. They were assisted by a law student, Edward Jones. All three men participated in the preparation of Dulyea\u2019s case for trial, but Taylor did not appear at trial. Scialdone served as lead counsel at trial, and Jones was present in the courtroom to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">While cross-examining the undercover police officer, Scialdone attempted to ask her about the age-limit rules applicable to the online chat room in which she and Dulyea had conversed. When Scialdone proffered a copy of the rules dated July 11, 2006, the day prior to trial, the Commonwealth objected that the document was irrelevant because it did not cover the proper time period. The court sustained the objection, ruling <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[I]f you want to pursue this line of questioning ... [,] you would have to have the rules that were in place in 2005.\u201d Scialdone responded, \u201cI can introduce that in part of my case____I believe we\u2019ll have [the rules that were in place in 2005].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Later, when Dulyea was testifying in his own behalf, Scialdone inquired, \u201cAfter you were arrested, did you make an effort to check out the rules of Yahoo in that chat room that you were in?\u201d The Commonwealth objected that \u201cthe rules after [Dulyea] was arrested are not relevant.\u201d After excluding the jury, the trial court examined a second set of proffered rules and stated, \u201c[T]he first chat rules [you proffered earlier] ... had a date on the bottom of 7/11/06. So they were printed yesterday. You\u2019ve now shown me what appears to be the exact same thing with just no print date on the bottom.\u201d Dulyea indicated that the proffered rules \u201cwere printed off by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>my father and my step cousin.\u201d The court asked, \u201cWhy is there not a print date on the bottom?\u201d and then stated twice, \u201c[I]t\u2019s got to have some sort of authentication on it.\u201d When the trial court inquired why Scialdone had \u201cprint[ed] [them] off again yesterday,\u201d Scialdone said they had been unable to locate the copy that Dulyea\u2019s father had provided to them. The court noted \u201cit would be very easy\u201d to create such a document by \u201cwhit[ing] out the bottom print time and then just runfning] a copy of it.\u201d Scialdone said, \u201c[I]f you want to voir dire us while we\u2019re outside the presence of the jury, I have no problem with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The trial court then asked the Commonwealth for its position. The Commonwealth agreed with the court\u2019s assertion, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s very suspicious that that document is exactly the same as the document that we objected to earlier today.\u201d The trial court then noticed the most recently proffered copy of the rules bore a different \u201cWelcome so and so\u201d line\u2014a different screen name, indicating that a different person had signed on to access the rules. Scialdone argued the challenged document containing the rules was admissible regardless of the presence or absence of a print date because Dulyea would testify both that he was familiar with the rules in place before his online contact with the undercover officer and after and that the proffered document accurately set out those rules. The trial court said, \u201cWell, you can ask him all of those things\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s just the document itself that\u2019s causing me the problem.\u201d The court then indicated that, in the absence of a print date, the court was \u201cnot convinced that this was done at the time\u2014that this is an authentic document. If it were printed out on a computer, it should have a print date on the bottom just like the one you offered a couple of hours ago.\u201d The court noted that, although the screen name of the person who printed it was different, that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t just gotten. I need to know a date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Still outside the presence of the jury, Scialdone then called Dulyea\u2019s father to the stand in an attempt to authenticate the second set of rules so that the court would admit it into evidence, but as the testimony of the elder Dulyea progressed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>it became apparent upon questioning from the court that the copy of the rules he obtained and printed in December 2005 was a two-page document that bore the screen name \u201cpdulyea,\u201d one of his wife\u2019s screen names, and that the copy of the chat room rules Scialdone had most recently attempted to have admitted was a one-page document showing it had been printed by someone using the screen name \u201cwndydpooh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The court then inquired of Scialdone what his secretary\u2019s name was, and when he answered, \u201cWendy,\u201d the trial court responded, \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I thought. Get her over here.... Right now. Call her from the court because I don\u2019t want you to talk to her outside anyone\u2019s presence----Just tell Wendy to come over here. She\u2019s got five minutes.... Tell [Mr. Taylor] to come too____It is 3:19. I\u2019m giving them until 3:30.\u201d The court recessed and reconvened at 3:34 p.m. when secretary Wendy Suttlage and attorney Barry Taylor arrived. The judge said, \u201cMr. Taylor, I need you to go wait out in the hall.... Wendy, I need you in here.\u201d The judge then showed Wendy Suttlage the chat room rules sheet bearing the screen name \u201cwndydpooh\u201d and questioned her about it. Suttlage testified she printed it out on the Sunday preceding the trial at the request of Mr. Taylor. She did not recall whether the printout included a date at the bottom of the sheet, and she denied having altered the document. The judge then inquired whether the attorneys had any questions for her. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">The trial judge then sent Suttlage out of the courtroom and called Taylor to the stand. Taylor testified that he recognized the printout bearing the chat room rules. Upon further questioning, he said he did not know when the sheet was printed but said, \u201cThis is the one, I think, that was given to us by our client, Mr. Dulyea.\u201d When the trial court said \u201cthat would be very interesting since it\u2019s under Wndydpooh\u2019s user name\u201d and asked Taylor to \u201c[e]xplain it,\u201d he responded he \u201cwas called and asked to look for the document that the client said he dropped off\u2019 and that he \u201cfound the document in a pile on the conference room table where they had been working on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the case.\u201d Taylor denied \u201cwhit[ing] out the date at the bottom\u201d or altering the document in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The court then stated as follows, without mentioning the word \u201ccontempt,\u201d \u201cOne of you\u2014one of the three of you, I guess\u2014Mr. Jones, you\u2019re in this too\u2014is going to come clean about this.... [S]omebody better take the fall or everybody is going to take the fall for this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The trial court attempted to press Taylor further, but he insisted, \u201cAll I was asked to do was to look for the document\u2014 look for any document that talked about the adults being in the chat room.\u201d He indicated he was very familiar with the rules page because when \u201cwe were in preparation for the case, we had looked at this very document multiple times because ... it was crucial to our case.\u201d When the trial court inquired further why Taylor thought the document he retrieved was the document their client had brought to them, he said, \u201c[It was] the only document in the stack that had this material on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The trial court then had Suttlage return to the courtroom and, upon further questioning, Suttlage reiterated that she printed the rules the Sunday prior to trial in response to a specific request from Taylor to do so, and she said she handed the document to Taylor. The trial court then asked Taylor why he presumed the document he received from Suttlage on Sunday was \u201cthe one your client gave you two years ago.\u201d Taylor responded, \u201cWell, ma'am, it\u2019s the same document.\u201d When the court said, \u201cMr. Taylor, you better come clean with me right now. What is going on?\u201d Taylor responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am,\u201d and the judge told him to wait in the hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The trial court then swore Jones and questioned him about what it believed was the fraudulent removal of the copyright and date information from the exhibit, but he, too, denied any knowledge of it. The court then asked who \u201cran ... off\u2019 \u201cthis other copy that we rejected this morning that\u2019s dated 7/11/2006.\u201d Jones responded, \u201cOh, I ran that off, Your Hon- or.\u201d Changing focus, the trial court then inquired about the screen name on that copy of the exhibit, asking, \u201cWhose idea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>of a joke is [the screen name, West is a Nazi<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]? Mr. Scialdone, you better do some talking.\u201d (Footnote added). Scialdone said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll answer every one of your questions,\u201d and the court placed him under oath. Scialdone testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXS7\">I know Mr. Dulyea\u2014when he had retained us, he gave Barry [Taylor] a couple of these screen things about adult chat rooms. That\u2019s my extent of knowledge about it. This morning when they handed the one to me that was dated afterwards, I realized we needed to find the one that was included in the file; and I asked [Taylor] to look in the file to see if they could find it. I don\u2019t know how to work emails and my little windows and stuff in my desk. I don\u2019t go into any of that stuff. Wendy is not my secretary. Antonia is my secretary. I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know. Sunday if she printed something, she didn\u2019t print it for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">When the trial court inquired once more about \u201cwestisanazi,\u201d Scialdone again pleaded ignorance about computer matters, and the trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">But you know how to white out and copy, I would assume, which is what\u2019s been done to this document that is being represented as being given to you two years ago but was actually run off by your secretary or Mr. Taylor\u2019s secretary on Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">jfc \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">There is a serious ethical issue here, if not criminal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\"># \u00ed\u00a1\u00ed <em>% </em>^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">Somebody in your firm, Mr. Scialdone\u2014and it\u2019s Scialdone and Taylor. So it\u2019s you and under your direction, and you\u2019re lead counsel in this case. Somebody has perpetrated a fraud on this court, and I will get to the bottom of it----I am finding both you and Mr. Taylor and Mr. Jones\u2014get them back in here\u2014in contempt; and we will deal with it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>after the trial. And if it comes out that one of you may not have had any knowledge, I may reconsider; but at this point in time all of you are involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">When Taylor and Jones had come back into the courtroom, the trial judge inquired further, \u201cWhose idea of a joke is [wjestisanazi? Anybody want to fess up to that?____ You ran it off, Mr. Jones. Did you do it?\u201d Jones admitted that he did and said he chose the screen name \u201cwestisanazi\u201d because \u201cI was very upset about some of the rulings, and I thought it was unfair to the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The trial court repeated that it was finding all three men in contempt, saying, \u201cWe will finish this trial and then we will have hearings on this matter as far as ... anything else you might want to say. Otherwise, it will just be sentencing hearings. Is there anything anybody else wants to say right now?\u201d When Mr. Scialdone objected, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any basis of you finding me in contempt,\u201d the trial court recited the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">THE COURT: I have a document that you tried to offer into evidence, and you argued vehemently that it was a document that your client and his father provided to you two years ago when, in fact, it\u2019s a document that your secretary printed out on Sunday for you and Mr. Taylor. Those are the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">MR. SCIALDONE: Judge, no one printed anything out for me. That is not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">THE COURT: You are lead counsel. That was printed out for you and Mr. Taylor. And if Mr. Taylor wants to take the full fall for it, he can; but right now it\u2019s both of you on the line ... and Mr. Jones as well. So if somebody wants to break ranks and rat somebody out, they can; but otherwise the three of you are in contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">The court also said, \u201cthese documents will not be coming in unless you can find the ones that have at the top pdulyea and a date at the bottom of 2005, in which case I don\u2019t think you can actually find the true documents.\u201d Taylor made an unsuccessful attempt to locate the document at the firm\u2019s offices in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>span of twenty-five minutes allowed by the trial court. At that same time, at Scialdone\u2019s request, the court agreed to break for the day and dismissed the jury, but said \u201cyou all aren\u2019t going anywhere until we get those documents back over here.\u201d When Taylor\u2019s search failed to reveal the 2005 document, the trial judge directed her baliff to accompany Wendy Suttlage back to the law office and asked Suttlage to try to generate a copy of the chat room rules that were identical to the ones with the screen name \u201cwndydpooh\u201d and no date line. The court recessed for this purpose from 4:49 p.m. until 5:16 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The trial court ultimately concluded that \u201c[wjhether [the 2005 \u2018pdulyea\u2019 chat room rules] actually exist[ ] or not, that\u2019s totally irrelevant\u201d to the contempt issue because the copy of the rules Mr. Scialdone attempted to have admitted bore \u201ca space ... where evidently something was laid over on the copyright date and it was copied on a copier or it was whited out or something. Because you can see a line on the one that you gave me that is clearly where the copyright was and it\u2019s been altered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Mr. Scialdone then said, \u201cI\u2019d like to know what I\u2019m being charged with, whether it\u2019s civil contempt, criminal contempt, or whatever it is. And I may want to have a lawyer for that.\u201d The trial court responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">Well, right now I\u2019m finding you in summary contempt, all three of you.... [0]ne of you all knows what\u2019s going on here. It is so obvious that this document has been altered. I mean, there is no other explanation except that one of the three of you or someone in your office or someone in your directions altered the documents and then offered them to the court as something that they are not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Mr. Taylor then asked to see the documents again\u2014the one bearing the \u201cwndydpooh\u201d screen name Scialdone had offered into evidence and the one bearing the same screen name that Suttlage had generated at the court\u2019s request during the recess. When Taylor argued the documents were not the same and that the court\u2019s emphasis on the lack of a date line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>was faulty because \u201c[o]bviously, they must have different pages that can print differently,\u201d the court said, \u201cWendy, I need you to try to get ... this exact page ... and print it out. Because ... when you do, I think it\u2019s going to have ... both the copyright and the date [at the bottom] when you print it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">While Suttlage was gone a second time, Taylor offered additional testimony about his retrieval of the chat room rules for Scialdone during the lunch recess that day. Taylor argued, \u201c[I]t might be negligence on our part; but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s contempt judge.\u201d The trial judge repeated her finding that the copy had clearly been altered by someone to remove the date.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">When Suttlage returned with additional copies of the chat room rules printed from various computers at the law firm\u2019s offices, the judge found that the one \u201cprinted from Mr. Taylor\u2019s computer is the exact replica of the one that was introduced into evidence except for the copyright is gone\u201d where \u201ca piece of paper [was] placed over it and copied off.\u201d At 6:18 p.m. the court recessed for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">When Dulyea\u2019s trial resumed on July 13, Scialdone offered a reconstructed document that appeared to be the 2005 \u201cpdulyea\u201d chat room rules, which he said was found in pieces during a search of his firm\u2019s trash. When the Commonwealth objected on grounds of relevance because the rules were dated December 10, 2005, whereas the relevant period was in March 2005, the trial court sustained the objection and refused to admit the copy of the rules. The court also stated, \u201cthis has nothing to do with the contempt issue,\u201d which involved what the court concluded was offering \u201can obviously altered document.\u201d When Scialdone again protested his innocence, the court said, \u201cIt was an obviously manufactured document, so stop with the charade on that.\u201d \u201cNow whether you knew it or not, I don\u2019t know. And I said until someone comes clean, you are tainted with that. Unless Mr. Taylor wants to come in here and fall on his swor[d] and say he did it, you\u2019re tainted with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Following the conclusion of Mr. Dulyea\u2019s trial on July 14, 2005, the trial court dismissed the jury and ruled as follows on the contempt issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">Pursuant to Code Section 18.2-456, I found all three of you in contempt of court. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Scialdone, I found that the two of you attempted to perpetrate a fraud upon the court by you, Mr. Taylor, altering the document that was to be presented to this court and you, Mr. Scialdone, for offering that fraudulent document to the court. That very clearly falls under Section 4 of 18.2-456, misbehavior of an officer of the court in his official character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">You, Mr. Jones, violated Sec[tion] 3 of 18.2-456 which deals with vile, contemptuous, and assaulting [sic] language addressed to or published of the judge for or in respect of any act or proceeding had, or to be had, in such a court. It goes on, but that covers your creating a screen name, West is a Nazi, and then the document obtained with that screen name being offered to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">I\u2019ve given a great deal of thought on how to deal with this matter.... Now, contempt can range from merely being late to court to under some circumstances progressing to rudeness and disrespect for the court all the way up to what the three of you have done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">In looking at the continuum of acts that could be considered contempt, I can\u2019t think of anything much worse than an attorney creating a false document and offering it to the court as true. If the court can\u2019t trust those who are officers of the court to be honest and professional, the whole system will fail....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">To that end, I have come to the conclusion that your dishonesty and unprofessional behavior require the maximum punishment. I\u2019m sentencing each of you to ten days in jail and a $250 fine with a copy of the order to be sent to the Virginia State Bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Taylor responded, \u201cNote our exception for the record please,\u201d and the trial court responded, \u201cNote everybody\u2019s exception.\u201d That same day, Scialdone and Taylor filed notices of appeal of the contempt finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On July 16, 2006, Scialdone and Jones began serving their sentences as ordered. Taylor, with permission from the trial court, was scheduled to report at a later time so that he could be married and take his honeymoon as previously scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On July 17, 2006, Scialdone and Taylor filed motions for stay of execution of sentence in which they asserted their right in the contempt proceeding to present a defense and to have counsel. On July 18, 2006, Jones filed both a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of execution of sentence in which he asserted the same rights Scialdone and Taylor had asserted. In addition, the three motions averred that when the trial court found them in contempt at the conclusion of Dulyea\u2019s trial, it \u201cread a prepared ruling ... and immediately left the bench without giving [appellants] the opportunity to present evidence, to present any argument [or] to have the assistance of counsel.\u201d Appellants noted they were able merely \u201cto take exception to the [court\u2019s] ruling as [the trial judge] was leaving the courtroom.\u201d In the memoranda accompanying their motions, appellants asserted that although the proceedings were conducted in a summary fashion, \u201c[t]he conduct upon which the Court relied was not wholly contained within the record of the proceedings of the trial in <em>Commonwealth v. Dulyea </em>\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Court conducted an investigation that included the [summoning and] interrogation of witnesses who were not participants in the trial proceedings\u201d and the use of the court\u2019s baliff to gather evidence from computers at counsel\u2019s law office. Appellants alleged they should have been allowed time to obtain counsel and prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">By July 18, 2006, the men had retained counsel, Marvin Miller, whose offices were located in Alexandria, Virginia. By letter faxed to the trial court that day, Miller sought an expedited ruling on the motions for stay and requested that, if a hearing on the motion was required, it be conducted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>telephone conference that same day. The trial court later indicated it \u201cheard about [the faxed letter]\u201d but that \u201c[somebody ... in the clerk\u2019s office said they don\u2019t accept faxes\u201d and that, as a result, the trial court \u201c[did not] see [the faxed letter].\u201d The trial court also later indicated the motion was not set for hearing because \u201c[no one] call[ed][to] set[] it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On July 19, 2006, by counsel, appellants filed in the Court of Appeals an emergency motion for stay of execution of sentence indicating two of them were already serving their sentences and that the circuit court \u201cha[d] been unwilling to say yes or no\u201d to their motions for stay filed in that court, which they alleged \u201c[was] tantamount to a denial.\u201d The Court of Appeals also received appellants\u2019 notices of appeal of their contempt convictions that day. The Court of Appeals, in the course of the attempt to resolve the appellants\u2019 emergency motion, learned that the trial court had not yet prepared or entered a written order finding the men in contempt. In response to the Court of Appeals\u2019 inquiry, the trial court prepared and entered the written contempt order that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The July 19, 2006 contempt order found Scialdone and Taylor in contempt for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-456(4) \u201c(misbehavior of an officer of the court in his official character)\u201d and Jones in contempt for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-456(3) \u201c(Vile, contemptuous or insulting language addressed to or published of a judge for or in respect of any act or proceeding had, or to be had, in such court or like language used in his presence and intended for his hearing for or in respect of such act or proceeding).\u201d After noting \u201c[t]hese documents are filed and made a part of the record of this contempt proceeding,\u201d the court also found \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 18.2-456(1) that such misbehavior in the presence of the court obstructed and interrupted the administration of justice,\u201d presumably applying this language to the actions of all three men.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Also on July 19, 2006, after receiving the contempt order from the trial court that afternoon via fax, the Court of Appeals \u201cgrant[ed] a temporary stay of the execution of [the appellants\u2019] jail sentences until such time that the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>rules on the pending motions.\u201d The Court of Appeals also \u201cdirect[ed] the clerk of the circuit court to forward a copy of the written orders addressing these motions to the clerk of this Court within 14 days of today.\u201d Scialdone and Jones were released from incarceration pursuant to that stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In proceedings held on July 24, 2006, the trial court indicated it was aware of the filing of the motions for stay of execution of sentence on Monday, July 17, <em>that it read the motions, </em>and that it \u201ckept waiting for [the matter] to show up on [the court\u2019s] docket\u201d but that \u201c[i]t never did because it was never set.\u201d The trial court confirmed that it entered the contempt order on Wednesday, July 19. The trial court also indicated on July 24, 2006, that the fact that the men\u2019s attorney \u201ccircumvented this Court and went to the Court of Appeals, telling them that we wouldn\u2019t hear your case, was not particularly appreciated\u201d \u201c[s]ince you-all didn\u2019t bother to set [the motion].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The trial court then indicated, \u201c[0]nce I got the stay from the Court of Appeals, pending a hearing on the stay, I went ahead and asked our Clerk to put it on the docket for today,\u201d and inquired why the men\u2019s attorney, Marvin Miller, was not present for the hearing. The men averred that none of them had received personal service of notice that a hearing would be held on July 24. Scialdone also said, \u201cLast night Marvin told me that the hearing was going to be on Thursday, because he had trials this week and could not be here.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cIt is not going to be on Thursday because we don\u2019t have court reporters on Thursday. It\u2019s Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d Scialdone said, \u201cI don\u2019t make the arrangements. I just rely on my lawyer,\u201d and the trial court responded, \u2018You don\u2019t have a right to counsel anyway.... It is a summary proceeding. Do you not understand that?\u201d Scialdone averred, \u201cI believe we have a right to counsel,\u201d and the trial court said, \u2018Well, you can believe anything you like.... But I am going to accommodate you, since you have hired counsel. But he will need to be here Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The trial court then pressed Scialdone regarding not whether or when he had received personal service but when he had received actual notice of the hearing. Scialdone indicated Miller had told him Sunday evening that the hearing would be Thursday and that he did not have actual notice of a hearing for Monday morning until Monday morning. He indicated he was in court in Norfolk when \u201cthey called me [from my office] ... and they said we had to be here.\u201d The trial court noted that on Sunday, Scialdone had arranged to have a court reporter present on Monday and questioned the accuracy of Scialdone\u2019s statements about actual notice, and Scialdone responded he had made those arrangements because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABE\">Mr. Miller told me that he should have someone over here this morning ... [b]ecause, dealing with this court, I am not taking any chances____I don\u2019t know what you-all are doing. You don\u2019t notice us. No one calls us. No one tells us anything. And if you think I am just going to not send somebody over here, wrong. I will spend a hundred and fifty dollars to make sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">After additional argument between the court and counsel about notice, the trial court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">Mr. Scialdone, I find it very interesting that you didn\u2019t have actual knowledge of this hearing until this morning, yet you called the court reporter to have her here at nine o\u2019clock this morning----Frankly, I think it is a lie on your part, if you want to get right down to it.... I think you are lying to me. I think you knew that it was set today and that is why you had the court reporter here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">And you didn\u2019t get notice. You are right. I have discovered that problem. I was out of town Thursday and Friday. I have discovered that problem. And that is why I wanted you-all here, because we will set it right now with the three of you here in court. And that is the notice that you will get. The court then indicated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">So it needs to be heard on Wednesday. That is a felony day. That is a day when we have a court reporter here. I know you are not charged with a felony, but this arises out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>of a felony case. There needs to be a court reporter here. Your attorney\u2019s letter says he cannot be here tomorrow. So we will hear it on Thursday I think\u2014Wednesday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">When Scialdone responded, \u201cI think he said\u2014he couldn\u2019t be here until Thursday is what he said,\u201d the trial court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think his letter says that.\u201d Scialdone indicated they would \u201cbe glad to provide a court reporter.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cObviously,\u201d and commented further, \u201cHis letter says he is in the western district on Tuesday and that is all it says. So he can be here Wednesday.\u201d Taylor said, \u201cOkay.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court said, \u201cWe will see him on Wednesday morning. Please let him know.\u201d Apparently, the Clerk\u2019s Office also notified Mr. Miller that the hearing would be held on Wednesday \u201cbecause the Virginia Beach courts hear these matters on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">At the hearing held on Wednesday, July 26, 2005, for which the appellants\u2019 attorney was unavailable, the trial court denied the motions for stay of execution of sentence, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">Although you\u2019ve been found in summary contempt and thus have no right to counsel, I have, in fact, read all of the papers and information submitted by [your attorney,] Mr. Miller[,] and I\u2019ve also reviewed a memorandum of law submitted by the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">It appears that their position is that this is not summary contempt but some other form of contempt. But I do not find their arguments persuasive. I cannot imagine any worse misbehavior by attorneys in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice than in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">Furthermore\u2014that\u2019s Subsection 1 of 18.2-456. But 3 and 4 addressing vile, insulting language and misbehavior of an officer of the court in his official character, which I also cited in finding you in contempt, ... do not have the requirement that the actual act occurred in the courtroom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Even though it\u2019s not required except under Subsection 1 to actually have occurred in court, these acts did occur in court and had to be dealt with immediately to preserve the integrity of the trial. While you all may not have intended for me to see the document containing the screen name West is a Nazi, you nonetheless offered it into evidence. Your intent is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">Furthermore, while you may not have actually manufactured in the courtroom the fraudulent document that you offered as authentic, it was certainly continuing in nature because of the fact that you offered it into evidence in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">As to the assertions that not everything is on the record, I disagree. I saw what I believed to be unethical conduct on the part of the three of you, and I had an obligation to determine if you were trying to perpetrate a fraud on the court. That appears on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">As to obtaining documents from your office, first, there was no objection posed by any of you. Second, I went out of my way to make clear on the record that attorney/client confidentiality would be maintained. And, third, your employee, not my deputy, produced the requested materials. On my direction he was to only escort her to and from court and observe what she did. Again, all of this is on the record and it\u2019s very clear, so assertions that something is missing from the record are untrue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">Hi H* H* Hi \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">As such, I do not believe that you have a substantial likelihood of prevailing on appeal and thus your request for a stay is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">\u2756 \u2756 Hi H\u00ab Hi H\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">Mr. Scialdone, as recently as Monday you lied to this court. There were several references by your attorney to the potential Monday [July 24, 2006,] hearing date in letters to me dated before Monday. Your court reporter was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>called Sunday. Yet you insisted [in the proceedings on Monday, July 24, 2006,] that you only had actual notice of the hearing Monday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">There is a pattern of behavior during this entire case that anyone reviewing the matter should be aware of. I dare say that once the entire picture is seen by your supporters, you may find yourself standing alone. I don\u2019t see how anyone can read the entire transcript and still defend your unethical, shameless behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">Your motion is denied____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Taylor asked the court to \u201cnote our exceptions, please.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">All three men served portions of their sentences before the Virginia Supreme Court granted a stay of execution of their sentences pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AOu\">A. PROCEDURAL BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The Commonwealth contends each appellant waived his right to challenge his summary contempt conviction on due process grounds because he did not properly present these objections to the trial court. Citing <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 641 S.E.2d 494 (2007), it contends the due process objections each appellant asserted in his motion for stay of execution of sentence were insufficient to satisfy Rule 5A:18. We hold <em>Nusbaum </em>is distinguishable and that, on the facts of this case, appellants\u2019 post-conviction objections coupled with the contents of their motions for stay of execution were sufficient to preserve their objections for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Rule 5A:18 provides that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Commonwealth expressly acknowledges on brief, the purpose of the rule is to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals, and mistrials by requiring litigants to inform the trial judge of the action complained of so that the judge has the opportunity to consider the issue intelligently and take timely corrective action. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 574, 576, 413 S.E.2d 885, 886 (1992). A party \u201cmay meet the mandates of Rule 5A:18 in many ways.\u201d <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va.App. 512, 515, 404 S.E.2d 736, 738 (1991) (en banc).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">For instance, counsel may make clear the ground for his objection in a motion to strike the evidence or in closing argument. Counsel may also state the grounds therefor during a motion to set aside the verdict or a motion to reconsider. Likewise, counsel may ... include an objection and reasons therefor in the final order or at least tender such an order to the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 404 S.E.2d at 738 (citations omitted). Formal exceptions to rulings are not necessary as long as the party \u201cmakes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objections to the action of the court and his grounds therefor.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Where a party wishes to preserve objections for appeal through a motion filed after entry of the final decree or order, he must obtain a ruling from the trial court in compliance with Rule 1:1 in order to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>See Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991); <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>18 Va.App. 427, 433, 444 S.E.2d 269, 274 (1994). However, where a party makes his objections known to the court prior to or at the time of entry of a final order or decree and does not specifically disclaim the desire to have the court rule on those objections, entry of a final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>or decree adverse to those objections constitutes a rejection of them and preserves them under Rule 5A:18 for purposes of appeal. <em>See Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>12 Va.App. 1200, 1204, 409 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1991) (holding objections were preserved for appeal where the party \u201cmade known to the trial court his position through his memoranda and other written correspondence with the court prior to the court\u2019s issuance of its amended final decree\u201d and \u201cthe trial judge specifically acknowledged the existence of [his] objections\u201d); <em>see also Nusbaum, </em>273 Va. at 402-06, 641 S.E.2d at 503-05 (holding the appellant waived the right to raise due process challenge on appeal of contempt conviction where, <em>inter alia, </em>he objected to the trial court\u2019s ruling on due process grounds prior to entry of the final order but specifically stated he was not asking the trial court to change the oral ruling already pronounced and the trial court never ruled on the objections he raised).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The court issued verbal rulings holding Scialdone, Taylor, and Jones in contempt on both July 12 and July 14. On July 12, Scialdone and Taylor both challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of contempt, arguing the evidence amounted to negligence at most. Scialdone also inquired about the nature of the proceedings and said, \u201cI may want a lawyer,\u201d which prompted a ruling from the trial court that the proceedings were for summary contempt. At the conclusion of the proceedings on those days, the men objected to those rulings only generally. These general objections, standing alone, were insufficient to preserve any specific objections for appeal. However, a court speaks through its written orders, <em>e.g. Walthall v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 674, 679, 353 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1987), and the court did not enter the written order finding appellants in contempt until July 19, 2006. Prior to that entry, each appellant filed a motion for stay of execution of sentence in which he averred that, although the proceedings were conducted in a summary fashion, \u201c[t]he conduct upon which the Court relied was not wholly contained within the record of the [underlying criminal] proceedings [against] Dulyea.\u201d Instead, each alleged, \u201c[t]he Court conducted an investigation that included the [summon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ing and] interrogation of witnesses who were not participants in the trial proceedings\u201d and the use of the court\u2019s deputy-sheriff to gather evidence from computers at counsel\u2019s law office. Appellants alleged that because the proceedings were not in fact summary proceedings, they should have been allowed time to obtain counsel and prepare a defense. Manifestly, the basis of the motions for stay of execution of sentence pending appeal constituted a claim of the likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Most importantly, the trial court stated on the record that, <em>prior </em>to entering the contempt order on July 19, it had received the motions to stay execution of sentence and <em>had, in fact, read the motions. </em>Thus, when the trial court entered the order finding appellants in contempt, it was well aware of their argument that the proceeding was not a summary one and that they believed the trial court erred in failing to afford them certain due process rights. Although the appellants had filed their notices of appeal prior to that time, these filings did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to act on the objections contained in their motions because the early filed notices of appeal did not take effect until the final order was entered on July 19. <em>See Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 154, 155, 402 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1991). In light of the trial court\u2019s admission that it read the motions for stay prior to entering the final order, it was irrelevant that the trial court did not formally rule on appellants\u2019 motions until after entry of the final order and after the Court of Appeals had acted to enter a stay of execution of their sentences. Thus, on the facts of this case, appellants\u2019 motions to stay execution of sentence and the supporting grounds alleged therein, filed before the trial court entered the final order, were more effective at alerting the trial court to the appellants\u2019 objections than would have been the commonly accepted practice of endorsing the final order \u201cseen and objected to\u201d for the same reasons. <em>See Kaufman, </em>12 Va.App. at 1204, 409 S.E.2d at 3-4. Accordingly, we hold that the goals of Rule 5A:18 were met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Nusbaum </em>does not compel a different result. <em>Nusbaum, </em>like this case, involved an attorney who was held in contempt under Code \u00a7 18.2-456. 273 Va. at 396, 641 S.E.2d at 499. Nusbaum\u2019s contempt stemmed from an incident in which he was alleged to have shoved another attorney in the presence of the jury, an incident that was seen by the bailiff but not by the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>at 390-95, 641 S.E.2d at 496-99. The court declared a mistrial and disqualified Nusbaum\u2019s law firm from further representation of the plaintiffs in that litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96, 641 S.E.2d at 499. At the conclusion of the hearing in which Nusbaum was held in contempt, his attorney noted only a general \u201cobjection to the determination of the [cjourt ... and to all of the rulings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 641 S.E.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Shortly after that hearing, Nusbaum moved the court to reconsider its ruling disqualifying his law firm, but in a memorandum accompanying the motion, Nusbaum \u201cadvised that he was not asking the court to reconsider any other part of its rulings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the hearing on the motion, the trial court amended its prior ruling to permit Nusbaum\u2019s firm to continue its representation of the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 397, 641 S.E.2d at 500. Also during that hearing, which was held more than two months after the court first found Nusbaum in contempt, Nusbaum\u2019s counsel indicated for the first time that he wanted to note a specific objection to the contempt finding since he had previously voiced only a general objection. <em>Id. </em>He</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">asked the circuit court to recite in its order Nusbaum\u2019s objection to the summary determination of contempt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>court on the grounds that, \u201cwhere the misconduct is not seen by the judge[,] the defendant has a right to be accorded a trial on that particular issue, and the lack of a trial is a denial of due process.\u201d Nusbaum\u2019s counsel, however, stated, <em>\u201cI am not asking [the courtj at this time to change [its] ruling. </em>I am simply going to make sure ... that I have preserved any right of appeal with respect to the contempt finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">During the \u201cfinal hearing\u201d six days later, \u201c[a] discussion again arose concerning the objections to the contempt of court finding that Nusbaum wanted to recite in the final order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the course of that discussion, Nusbaum\u2019s counsel <em>\u201cagain stated that he was not requesting the circuit court to reconsider its ruling </em>\u201d and was merely making sure that the court\u2019s final order would \u201cinclude the \u2018particulars\u2019 of his objection\u201d to the contempt conviction. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). When the final order was entered, Nusbaum noted a more detailed due process objection on the final order, contending the conviction violated his rights because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cit was a summary proceeding with no notice, rule to show cause, or attachment; the alleged contempt was indirect and not personally witnessed by the trial judge, and the contempt charge was not brought by the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398 n. 4, 641 S.E.2d at 500 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The Supreme Court concluded that Nusbaum\u2019s due process objections were barred under that Court\u2019s Rule 5:25. <em>Id. </em>at 403-06, 641 S.E.2d at 503-05. The Court relied on dual grounds for that ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 641 S.E.2d at 504. It emphasized that Nusbaum did not raise his due process objections for the first time until more than two months after the court found him in contempt and that he never requested a ruling on those objections, stating instead each time he asserted his objections that he was not asking the court to change its ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 641 S.E.2d at 504. The Court also emphasized that the trial court in fact never ruled on any aspect of the due process objections Nusbaum attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>raise on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04, 641 S.E.2d at 504. Because \u201cNusbaum did not afford the circuit court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the due process issues that he now raises,\u201d the Court held those issues were \u201ctherefore waived on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 641 S.E.2d at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The holding in <em>Nusbaum </em>is readily distinguishable from appellants\u2019 cases. Here, during the very first stage of the contempt proceedings, conducted on July 12, Scialdone specifically inquired about the nature of the proceedings, whether the contempt was civil or criminal, and said, \u201cI may want a lawyer.\u201d In response, the trial court ruled that the proceedings were for summary contempt. Although Scialdone did not pursue the issue further at that point, the men objected generally to the contempt findings and punishment pronounced orally on July 14. Further, within four days after the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of appellants\u2019 contempt sentences and two days before the trial court had entered the order finding the men in contempt, appellants filed motions challenging the contempt findings on the merits based on the specific due process claims they assert on appeal\u2014that the court\u2019s decision to proceed summarily -violated their rights. Although these challenges were made via motions to stay execution of their sentences, the contents of the motions made clear that appellants challenged the validity of their convictions and specifically articulated their reasons for that belief. Further, unlike Nusbaum, who twice specifically disclaimed a desire to have the trial court rule on his objections, the appellants never indicated that they did not wish to have the trial court consider their due process arguments and in fact attempted to obtain a prompt ruling on the motions by the trial court, albeit in the context of seeking a stay of execution of their sentences. Finally, and key in distinguishing the two cases, in a proceeding held on the record, the trial court made clear it read those motions\u2014and, thus, was aware of the appellants\u2019 due process claims\u2014before it entered the July 19, 2006 order finding appellants in contempt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, unlike in <em>Nusbaum, </em>appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cafford[ed] the circuit court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the due process issues that [they] now raise[ ],\u201d <em>id., </em>thereby satisfying the requirements of Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">B.

Assuming for the moment that the absence of the copyright and print dates was sufficient, without more, to support a finding that the document had been fraudulently altered, the contempt was complete when Scialdone offered the document into evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because \u201c \u2018all of the essential elements of the misconduct [occurred] under the eye of the court [and] [were] actually observed by the court,\u2019\u201d <em>Pounders, </em>521 U.S. at 988, 117 S.Ct. at 2362, 138 L.Ed.2d at 982 (quoting <em>Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 275, 68 S.Ct. at 509, 92 L.Ed. at 695), the court had the authority to punish Scialdone summarily at that time if the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>sufficient to establish someone had altered the document by removing the dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">However, the trial court did not in fact punish Scialdone summarily at that time and did not indicate at that time that it was even entertaining the idea of holding him in contempt. Instead of proceeding summarily against Scialdone, the court ordered Scialdone to telephone Taylor, his law partner, and Wendy Suttlage, one of the firm\u2019s secretaries, and \u201c[g]et [them] over here____Right now.\u201d The trial court then questioned Suttlage, Taylor, Jones, and Scialdone extensively to determine who had printed the document and when. Under questioning from the court, no one admitted having altered the document. Only then did the trial court make an express finding that someone had \u201cwhite[d] out\u201d and \u201ccop[ied]\u201d the chat room rules in order to remove the date; observe that Scialdone was lead counsel; and indicate it was finding Scialdone, Taylor, and Jones all in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The court did not stop there, however. It asked Suttlage to try to generate a copy of the chat room rules that were identical in format to the ones Scialdone had offered into evidence, and it had the court deputy accompany Suttlage back to the firm\u2019s offices for this purpose. When that trip failed to yield a copy of the rules identical to the ones Scialdone had offered, the trial court sent Suttlage back to the firm to try a second time, saying, \u201cI need you to try to get ... this exact page[,] [g]et it looking just like this and print it out[,] [b]ecause ... when you do, I think it\u2019s going to have the copyright here and it\u2019s also going to have [the date] at the bottom.\u201d Thus, although the court had already found \u201c[i]t is so obvious that this document has been altered,\u201d it was attempting to obtain additional evidence to prove that the document had been altered. After Suttlage generated a document from Taylor\u2019s computer that the court found was \u201cthe exact replica of the one that was introduced into evidence except for the copyright is gone\u201d where \u201ca piece of paper [was] placed over it and copied off,\u201d the court recessed for the evening. Following the conclusion of Dulyea\u2019s trial, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>found Scialdone attempted to perpetrate a fraud on the court by offering a fraudulent document to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Thus, assuming without deciding that the absence of the copyright and print dates was sufficient, without more, to support a finding that the document had been fraudulently altered, the contempt was complete when Scialdone offered the document into evidence. To the extent the trial court had the authority to punish Scialdone summarily without hearing any additional evidence, it did not do so. Because the court did not proceed to punish Scialdone summarily and engaged in extensive efforts to obtain more evidence on the issue, Scialdone was entitled to the due process rights available in a nonsummary contempt proceeding. Further, the degree of Scialdone\u2019s culpability was not discernable without the court\u2019s examination of Taylor and Jones to determine their respective levels of culpability, as well. Thus, \u201c[u]nder the particular facts and circumstances here, we are of the opinion that even though the alleged misbehavior ... by [Scialdone] was committed in the presence of the court [when he offered the allegedly fraudulent exhibit into evidence], the [court] should have had a rule specifying the alleged contemptuous acts served on [Scialdone], to be followed by a full hearing in the matter, instead of exercising [its] discretionary summary power under Code \u00a7 [18.2-456].\u201d <em>Higginbotham, </em>206 Va. at 296, 142 S.E.2d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Accordingly, we reverse Scialdone\u2019s contempt conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\n<em>2. Finding of Contempt Against Taylor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Applying the principles set out above, we hold the trial court had no authority to punish Taylor summarily. Scialdone and law student Jones were the only people who made formal appearances at Dulyea\u2019s trial. Taylor did not formally appear for Dulyea\u2019s trial and was not present in court when Scialdone offered the allegedly fraudulent exhibit into evidence. At that time, the court had no knowledge, other than the fact of Taylor\u2019s status as Scialdone\u2019s law partner, that Taylor was involved in any way with the preparation of the document at issue or the submission of the document into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>evidence at trial. Thus, it was not true that \u201c \u2018all of the essential elements of [Taylor\u2019s] misconduct [occurred] under the eye of the court [and] [were] actually observed by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pounders, </em>521 U.S. at 988, 117 S.Ct. at 2362, 138 L.Ed.2d at 982 (quoting <em>Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 275, 68 S.Ct. at 509, 92 L.Ed. at 695).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Before learning of Taylor\u2019s involvement, the court questioned Scialdone about who used the screen name \u201cwndydpooh.\u201d Scialdone said he could not answer that question and that he had not even seen the exhibit \u201cuntil lunchtime.\u201d The trial court then asked Scialdone what his secretary\u2019s name was, and when he answered, \u201cWendy,\u201d the trial court responded, \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I thought. Get her over here.\u201d The court had Scialdone call his law firm from the courtroom to tell Wendy Suttlage to come to court, and it authorized Scialdone to tell Suttlage only \u201cto come over here.\u201d As the trial court listened to Scialdone make the telephone call, it said, \u201cTell [Taylor] to come too.\u201d Scialdone responded Taylor had \u201ca room full of people at the office\u201d but said he would \u201ctell [Taylor] to leave them there\u201d and come to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">When Taylor and Suttlage arrived, the trial court excluded Taylor from the courtroom and questioned Suttlage under oath. The court then brought Taylor back into the courtroom, placed him under oath, and questioned him, as well. Only after questioning Taylor did the trial court learn of his involvement in procuring the document at issue. Thus, Taylor\u2019s role in the alleged contempt could not properly be punished summarily. Taylor surely knew his actions would result in the submission of the document into evidence, and this fact is relevant to whether his behavior was contemptuous, but it is not the test for determining whether his contemptuous acts, if any, could be punished summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Thus, we reverse Taylor\u2019s contempt conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">\n<em>3. Finding of Contempt Against Jones</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">The trial court found Jones in summary contempt under Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) and (3). Based on our constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>al due process analysis above, we hold these subdivisions of the statute may be constitutionally applied to permit summary punishment for contempt only to the extent that they proscribe behavior Jones engaged in \u201cunder the eye of the court\u201d and that was \u201cactually observed by the court.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 275, 68 S.Ct. at 509, 92 L.Ed. at 695. \u201cIf some essential elements of the offense [were] not personally observed by the judge, so that [she had to] depend on statements made by others for [her] knowledge about these essential elements, due process require[d] ... that [Jones] be accorded\u201d his procedural due process rights. <em>Id. </em>at 275-76, 68 S.Ct. at 509, 92 L.Ed. at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Plainly, the act of offering into evidence a document bearing the screen name \u201cwestisanazi\u201d could be found to constitute both the type of \u201c[misbehavior in the presence of the court\u201d punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) and \u201c[v]ile, contemptuous or insulting language\u201d meeting the additional requirements of subsection (3) of that same code section. Thus, the person offering the document bearing that screen name into evidence could have been subject to summary punishment for contempt on that basis. As with the case of the document alleged to be fraudulent, the offeror was charged with \u201cknowledge of] the contents of [the] document[] he presented] ..., and presentation [was] a representation that this duty ha[d] been performed.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>9 F.2d at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">However, here, the trial court did not summarily convict the <em>offeror </em>of the exhibit, Scialdone, for contempt based on the presence of the \u201cwestisanazi\u201d screen name on the exhibit. Instead, it placed Suttlage, Taylor, Scialdone, and Jones under oath and sought to elicit an admission from one of them about who had devised the derogatory screen name and caused it to be included on the exhibit. It was upon the direct question of the trial court\u2014\u201cYou [said you] ran ... off [that copy of the chat room rules], Mr. Jones. Did you do it?\u201d\u2014that Jones indicated he had in fact typed the derogatory screen name. The trial court did not observe Jones\u2019s use of the screen name and had to rely on Jones\u2019s confession to establish his involvement in the contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>As set out above, a court has the power to punish summarily <em>\u201conly </em>charges of misconduct ... [of which] <em>all of the essential elements ... are under the eye of the court [and] are actually observed by the court.\u201d Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 275, 68 S.Ct. at 509, 92 L.Ed. at 695 (emphases added). In cases of misbehavior for which the judge lacks personal knowledge of any of the \u201cessential elements\u201d and <em>\u201cis informed thereof only by the confession of the party, </em>or by the testimony under oath of others,\u201d the court may not punish the contempt summarily. <em>Savin, </em>131 U.S. at 277, 9 S.Ct. at 702, 33 L.Ed. at 153 (emphasis added); <em>see Groppi, </em>404 U.S. at 504, 92 S.Ct. at 587, 30 L.Ed.2d at 639 (\u201cWhere a court acts immediately to punish for contemptuous conduct committed under its eye, ... there is no question of identity____\u201d). Because the trial court had personal knowledge of the derogatory language, which was contained in an exhibit offered into evidence, but did not have personal knowledge of Jones\u2019s status as a participant in the use of that language, it was not entitled to punish him summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Thus, we reverse Jones\u2019s contempt conviction and remand for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">\n<em>Ip. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support Scialdone\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AaM\">Although we reverse on procedural grounds, we address Scialdone\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence arguments<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> insofar as necessary to assure that their retrial on remand will not violate double jeopardy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">If the evidence adduced [in the contempt proceeding] was insufficient to convict [either appellant], he is entitled to an acquittal; if he is so entitled, a remand for retrial would violate the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy.

The trial judge found Taylor intentionally \u201calter[ed] the document that was to be presented to this court\u201d by removing the print and copyright dates and that Scialdone actually \u201coffer[ed] that fraudulent document to the court.\u201d For purposes of assessing application of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we hold the evidence supports those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The evidence supported a finding that when Frankie Dulyea retained Scialdone and Taylor to represent him, he provided Taylor with a two-page copy of the Yahoo chat room rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>dated 2005 and bearing a screen name of \u201cpdulyea.\u201d Taylor admitted he was very familiar with the rules generally because while \u201c[they] were in preparation for the case, [they] had looked at [the rules] multiple times because ... [the rules were] crucial to [the] case.\u201d Additional evidence established that on the Sunday prior to trial, Taylor had his secretary, Wendy Suttlage, print a one-page copy of the rules for him <em>from </em>Yahoo and that she used the screen name \u201cwndydpooh\u201d in order to do so. When preparing for trial, Scialdone and Taylor had been unable to locate the copy of the rules their client had given them. As a result, at trial on the morning of July 12, 2006, Scialdone first offered into evidence a copy of the rules bearing a print date of July 11, 2006, and the screen name \u201cwestisanazi.\u201d Scialdone testified that after the trial court rejected the rules he originally proffered and said he would \u201chave to have the rules that were in place in 2005\u201d if he wished to pursue a particular line of questioning related to the rules, he \u201crealized we needed to find the [copy of the rules the client had provided],\u201d and he \u201casked [Taylor] to look in the file to see if they could find it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Taylor admitted Scialdone called him at the office on July 12, 2006, and asked him to look for \u201cthe [copy of the rules] that the client ... dropped off,\u201d although Taylor later claimed he thought any copy of the rules would suffice. Taylor then provided to Scialdone a one-page copy of the rules that had been retrieved and printed by someone using the screen name \u201cwndydpooh,\u201d the screen name used by Suttlage. That copy of the rules, when offered into evidence, bore no print date or copyright date, and the trial court found, \u201cyou can see a line [on the second copy of the rules offered into evidence] that is clearly where the copyright was and it\u2019s been altered,\u201d where \u201csomething was laid over on the copyright date and it was copied on a copier or it was whited out or something.\u201d Scialdone, Taylor, Jones, and Suttlage all denied altering the subject \u201cwndydpooh\u201d chat room rules in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The trial court had Ms. Suttlage retrieve and print copies of the Yahoo chat room rules from each of the computers in the firm\u2019s office. All those printouts bore print and copyright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>dates. By comparing the various rules printouts Ms. Suttlage generated to the second set of rules offered into evidence, the trial court determined the only printout that matched the spacing, margins, and other formatting of the second set of rules was the printout generated on Taylor\u2019s computer. The judge found this printout was an \u201cexact replica\u201d of the second set of proffered rules except for the presence of the copyright and print dates. This evidence, taken as a whole and viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supported a finding that Taylor, although he denied doing so, intentionally removed the copyright and print dates from the copy of the chat room rules he provided to Scialdone to offer into evidence as the 2005 rules, behavior \u201c \u2018in disrespect of the court or its processes, or which obstructs the administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 4A Michie\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">This same evidence supported a finding that Scialdone\u2019s behavior also constituted contempt. Whether Scialdone knew the document had been altered was not dispositive. <em>See Ford, </em>9 F.2d at 991-92 (holding that submission of a document containing falsehoods is punishable as contempt and that \u201clack of actual knowledge [of the falsehoods] does not constitute a defense, but only an extenuating circumstance in mitigation\u201d). Further, if Scialdone had made reasonable inquiry of his client prior to offering the second set of rules into evidence, he could have ascertained based on the different screen names and the fact that the second set of rules comprised one page rather than two that the second set of rules was not the set his client had printed in 2005 and provided to his attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Thus, remand for retrial of Scialdone and Taylor does not offend double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">For these reasons, we hold each of the appellants was denied rights to due process, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion if the trial court and the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\">.

No Virginia appellate court has ever held, until now, that a motion to stay a jail sentence pending appeal preserves issues never once raised either prior to the conviction or in a motion to set aside after the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">To be sure, the Virginia Supreme Court rejected just this sort of reasoning in <em>Nusbaum v.

After hearing the lawyer\u2019s specific objections to the contempt finding, the trial court entered a final order confirming its previous bench ruling finding the lawyer in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">On appeal, the lawyer argued that, \u201chaving made the circuit court aware of his objections, he had no obligation to ask the court to reconsider any matter since the court had the opportunity, within 21 days of entering the final order, to vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>that order and change its rulings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 641 S.E.2d at 503.

The lawyer could not complain on appeal that the trial court erred in not vacating its contempt finding on due process grounds, <em>Nusbaum </em>held, because the lawyer never once asked the court to do so. \u201cThose issues, whether the circuit court violated his due process rights by summarily convicting him of indirect criminal contempt, with no notice of the charge, no plenary criminal hearing, and no substitution of the Commonwealth as the prosecuting party, are therefore waived on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 641 S.E.2d at 505 (citing Rule 5:25).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In our case, the defendants made even less of an effort to preserve the due process issues than the lawyer did in <em>Nusbaum. </em>Here, the defendants raised their due process arguments only in support of their motion for a stay of the jail sentence pending appeal. At no point did they ever ask the trial court, either orally or in writing, to set aside its contempt findings based upon these objections. As in <em>Nusbaum, </em>the trial court did not vacate its contempt findings based upon the after-the-fact due process objections because, quite simply, it was not asked to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The majority\u2019s contrary view imposes upon a trial court the <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to vacate a conviction on grounds raised for the first and only time during a motion for stay pending appeal when the party standing to benefit from the vacature, the defendant, conspicuously chooses <em>not </em>to seek that relief. That the defendant does not ask the trial court to vacate the conviction does not matter\u2014the court should grant it anyway. I find this conclusion hard to understand and harder still to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Equally unconvincing is the effort at distinguishing <em>Nusbaum. </em>\u201cMost importantly,\u201d the majority reasons, the trial court in our case <em>\u201chad, in fact, read </em>\u201d the defendant\u2019s due process arguments and thus was \u201cwell aware\u201d of the specific objections being asserted. <em>Ante, </em>at 706, 660 S.E.2d at 331 (emphasis in original). That is \u201ckey\u201d in distinguishing our case from <em>Nusbaum, </em>the majority emphasizes. <em>Ante, </em>at 709, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>660 S.E.2d at 332. In <em>Nusbaum, </em>however, the lawyer specifically advised the trial court in open court of each of his due process objections. It could have just as easily been said in <em>Nusbaum </em>that the trial court <em>had, in fact, heard </em>the due process arguments and thus was <em>well aware </em>of the lawyer\u2019s due process arguments. What the majority sees as the \u201cmost\u201d important and \u201ckey\u201d difference between our case and <em>Nusbaum </em>is, to me, no difference at all. <em>See Ante, </em>at 706, 709, 660 S.E.2d at 331, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In short, if procedural default applies to the lawyer in <em>Nusbaum, </em>it applies all the more to the defendants in our case. The majority\u2019s holding to the contrary is as unpersuasive as it is unprecedented.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
