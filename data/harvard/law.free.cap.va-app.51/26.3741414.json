On appeal, he claims the trial court should have merged the three charges into one. Not doing so, De\u2019Armond argues, violated Code \u00a7 19.2-294 and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">On appeal, \u201cwe review the evidence in the \u2018light most favorable\u2019 to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Pryor v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 1, 4, 628 S.E.2d 47, 48 (2006) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003)). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The evidence at trial showed that De\u2019Armond sexually abused his eight-year-old granddaughter after she returned home from school one afternoon. While in his bedroom using his computer, De\u2019Armond took the child\u2019s hand and \u201cput it between his legs ... on his penis.\u201d She quickly left his bedroom and went into another room of the house to do homework.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The child later returned to her grandfather\u2019s bedroom. De\u2019Armond was still on his computer. She noticed that his penis was \u201csticking out\u201d of his pants, and she told him so. He stuck it back in his pants. Later, he again took her hand and put it on top of his penis. The child moved her hand away; he moved it back. This occurred about five or six times. At some point he asked her whether she \u201cwanted to play with his penis.\u201d The child testified De\u2019Armond \u201ctook out his penis and put my hand on it and made me squeeze it.\u201d De\u2019Armond then put his hand into the child\u2019s pants and touched her vagina for about four or five seconds. After that, De\u2019Armond rubbed the child\u2019s prepubescent breasts for about five or ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">De\u2019Armond told his granddaughter that \u201cthis was just between [her] and him.\u201d Upset and confused, the child immediately told her mother. The mother confronted De\u2019Armond, and he agreed to leave the house. When questioned by police, De\u2019Armond confessed and admitted that his granddaughter was \u201ctelling the truth\u201d about what he had done to her. At trial, however, De\u2019Armond repudiated his confession. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>child, he alleged, must have \u201cinadvertently\u201d brushed against his penis. De\u2019Armond also testified he may have \u201ctickled\u201d her \u201cbetween her navel and her panty line\u201d and \u201cpatted her on the bottom\u201d as she left the room, but he did not touch her vagina or her chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Pursuant to separate indictments, finding instructions, and verdict forms, the jury found De\u2019Armond guilty of three acts of aggravated sexual battery: (i) De\u2019Armond\u2019s placing the child\u2019s hand on De\u2019Armond\u2019s penis, (ii) De\u2019Armond\u2019s touching of the child\u2019s vagina, and (iii) De\u2019Armond\u2019s touching of the child\u2019s prepubescent breasts. The trial court adopted the jury\u2019s recommended sentences on each conviction, imposing the incarceration terms consecutively. Both before and after trial, De\u2019Armond argued that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment required that all three charges be merged into one. The trial court rejected the argument and entered final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">On appeal, De\u2019Armond repeats his claim that the three convictions violate his rights under Code \u00a7 19.2-294 and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Like the trial court, we find the arguments meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">A. <em>Code \u00a7 19.2-294\u2014\u201cSame Act\u201d Reprosecution Bar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294 states that a \u201cconviction\u201d under \u201ctwo or more\u201d statutes or ordinances \u201cshall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding\u201d when the underlying criminal event involves the \u201csame act.\u201d Because the text imposes the bar only <em>after </em>a conviction, the statute applies just to successive, not simultaneous, prosecutions. <em>Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 548, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00a7 19.2-294 also limits its statutory bar to successive convictions under \u201ctwo or more\u201d statutes or ordinances, thus making the bar inapplicable when a defendant suffers convictions under a <em>single </em>statute or ordinance authorizing multiple units of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In this case, De\u2019Armond was convicted in a simultaneous prosecution for multiple violations of a single statute. Either circumstance, by itself, undermines his reliance on Code \u00a7 19.2-294. The trial court, therefore, did not violate Code \u00a7 19.2-294 by refusing to consolidate De\u2019Armond\u2019s three convictions into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">B. <em>Double Jeopardy\u2014Statutory Unit of Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">De\u2019Armond next argues that the trial court violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment by not consolidating his three convictions into one. Here again, we find De\u2019Armond\u2019s argument inconsistent with settled principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In a simultaneous prosecution, the role of the Double Jeopardy Clause is \u201climited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 58, 62, 557 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2002) (quoting <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977)); <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001). The legislature retains plenary discretion to \u201cdetermine the appropriate \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 \u201d and to punish each violation separately. <em>Nelson v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 716, 740, 589 S.E.2d 23, 35 (2003) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>268 Va. 665, 604 S.E.2d 76 (2004); <em>see Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 39, 46, 636 S.E.2d 480, 483 (2006). In determining the statutory unit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>prosecution, \u201cthe controlling factor is legislative intent.\u201d <em>Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 197, 199, 308 S.E.2d 104, 104 (1983). The multiple punishments prohibition, therefore, remains from start to finish wholly dependent on statutory interpretation. <em>See </em>John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 51.3-4, at 688-90 (3d ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In this case, the jury convicted De\u2019Armond of three violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1). Under that statute, an accused \u201cshall be guilty of aggravated sexual battery if he or she sexually abuses the complaining witness, and ... [t]he complaining witness is less than 13 years of age\u201d at the time of the offense. Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1). \u201c \u2018Sexual abuse\u2019 means <em>an act </em>committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person\u201d in situations where, for example, the accused intentionally touches the victim\u2019s \u201cintimate parts\u201d or causes the victim to touch the accused\u2019s \u201cintimate parts.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(a) to 18.2\u201467.10(6)(d) (emphasis added). \u201c \u2018Intimate parts\u2019 means the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, or buttocks of any person.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">When coupled with its definitional provisions, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1) creates a unit of prosecution for every act of sexual abuse and, at a minimum, contemplates separate acts for each of the separate \u201cintimate parts\u201d described in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2). This interpretation parallels our understanding of the appropriate units of prosecution under other sex crime statutes. <em>See, e.g., Nelson, </em>41 Va.App. at 740, 589 S.E.2d at 35 (holding that the forcible sodomy statute \u201cindicates that the legislature intended each act constitute a discrete unit of prosecution\u201d); <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 118, 128, 428 S.E.2d 34, 42 (1993) (concluding that a defendant should not be permitted \u201ca \u2018free rape\u2019 merely because he chooses to repeat his crime on the same victim within a short period of time\u201d); <em>see also Mason, </em>49 Va.App. at 48, 636 S.E.2d at 484 (holding the \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d for possession of child pornography \u201ccorresponds to the number of individual items of sexually explicit visual material\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Tracking the indictments, the trial court separated the finding instructions and jury verdict forms into three prosecutorial units: (i) De\u2019Armond\u2019s placing the child\u2019s hand on De\u2019Armond\u2019s penis, (ii) De\u2019Armond\u2019s touching of the child\u2019s vagina, and (in) De\u2019Armond\u2019s touching of the child\u2019s prepubescent breasts. This segregation of offenses properly recognized the separate acts of touching separate intimate parts. The trial court, therefore, did not divide De\u2019Armond\u2019s culpability beyond the indivisible units of prosecution contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1). It necessarily follows that the trial court likewise did not impose multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">De\u2019Armond finds this analysis inconsistent with the rule of lenity\u2014a canon of statutory construction which, he claims, requires that we strictly construe Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1) in his favor to permit only one prosecution when multiple acts of sexual abuse \u201call occurred in one distinct, continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct bounded closely in terms of place and time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. We believe this suggested statutory construction, however, asks far more from the rule of lenity than it can deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Only when a \u201cpenal statute is <em>unclear </em>\u201d do courts apply the rule of lenity and strictly construe the statute in the criminal defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Waldrop v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 210, 214, 495 S.E.2d 822, 825 (1998) (footnote omitted and emphasis added). \u201cAbsent ambiguity, the rule of lenity is not applicable to guide statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 59, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 1118, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000); <em>see also Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 593, 598, 587 S.E.2d 561, 564 (2003) (\u201cWe do not agree that the statutory language is ambiguous. Hence, we construe the language according to its plain meaning without resort to rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u201cThe simple existence of some statutory ambiguity,\u201d moreover, \u201cis not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 138, 118 S.Ct. 1911, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>1919, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). And the \u201cmere possibility of articulating a narrower construction\u201d does not by itself make the rule of lenity applicable. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 239, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2059, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). Nor can the rule be \u201cinvoked by a grammatical possibility\u201d that raises a manifestly \u201cimplausible reading\u201d of the legislative purpose. <em>Caron v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 308, 316, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 2012, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Instead, the rule of lenity serves only to resolve genuine, plausible ambiguities and \u201cdoes not abrogate the well recognized canon that a statute ... should be read and applied so as to accord with the purpose intended and attain the objects desired if that may be accomplished without doing harm to its language.\u201d <em>Cartwright v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 368, 372, 288 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1982) (citation omitted). Despite the rule of lenity, \u201ccourts are nevertheless bound by the plain meaning of <em>unambiguous </em>statutory language and \u2018may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gunn v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 580, 587, 637 S.E.2d 324, 327 (2006) (citations omitted and emphasis added); <em>Dugger v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 586, 593, 580 S.E.2d 477, 480-81 (2003) (recognizing the rule of lenity only when applied to a genuine \u201cambiguity or reasonable doubt\u201d in the statutory text).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Read together with its definitional provisions, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1) is unambiguous. Its language creates \u201can offence that can be committed <em>uno ictu </em>\u201d rather than one inherently \u201ccontinuous in its character.\u201d <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 302, 52 S.Ct. 180, 181, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) (citation omitted). It clearly defines \u201csexual abuse,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1), as \u201can act\u201d involving an \u201cintimate part\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the body, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6), which includes \u201cthe genitalia, anus, groin, breast, or buttocks of any person,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2). De\u2019Armond\u2019s proffered statutory construction\u2014aggregating as a single unit of prosecution multiple acts involving distinct intimate parts of the body at distinct times\u2014does not clarify ambiguous statutory language, but rather rewrites unambiguous statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Finding no violation of either Code \u00a7 19.2-294 or the Double Jeopardy Clause, we affirm De\u2019Armond\u2019s convictions for sexually abusing his granddaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\">. <em>See also Jefferson v.
