On appeal, father claims that the trial court erred by exempting the debt from bankruptcy discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the prevailing party in the trial court and grant to that party the benefit of \u201call reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Mother and father were divorced on October 14, 2004. Pursuant to the final decree of divorce, mother was granted sole legal and primary physical custody of the parties\u2019 minor child. On January 20, 2005, the trial court entered an amended order of child visitation by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Subsequently, mother filed a petition for reinstatement asking that the trial court order father to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for violations of the amended order. In an affidavit filed with the petition, mother averred that father had told her that the terms of the amended order did not apply to him. Mother further averred that on December 28, 2005, father failed to return the minor child to mother at the time, date, and place set forth in the amended order. Despite mother\u2019s attempts to contact father, father remained out of touch with mother, neglected to obtain her consent to extend the visit, and returned the minor child a day late. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>May 29, 2006, father again failed to contact mother or obtain her permission to extend the visit, and returned the minor child a day late causing the child to miss a day of school. Mother\u2019s petition also requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees she had incurred in pursuing the contempt action for violations of the visitation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On September 22, 2006, having conducted a hearing on mother\u2019s petition for which father did not appear, the trial court found father in contempt, ordered him to show cause why he should not be imprisoned for contempt for violating the amended visitation order, and also ordered that he pay mother\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees in \u201cthe amount of $3,330.00.\u201d A show cause hearing was set for October 16, 2006. At that hearing, the trial court overruled father\u2019s motions and objections to the issuance of the rule to show cause and to the contempt finding, found that if father further violated any previous orders of the trial court, he would be incarcerated, and reaffirmed its order that father pay mother\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">When father failed to timely pay mother\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, the trial court scheduled another hearing on December 7, 2006. Father, however, filed a bankruptcy petition on December 6, 2006. In his petition, he designated mother as a creditor to whom he owed the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded pursuant to the trial court\u2019s orders. At the December 7, 2006 hearing, the trial court asked that the parties brief the issues presented by father\u2019s bankruptcy petition and continued the matter. At a hearing on January 25, 2007, the trial court stayed its contempt proceedings until the close of father\u2019s bankruptcy and continued the matter until May 10, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">On March 12, 2007, the bankruptcy court granted father a discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727. The reverse side of the bankruptcy court form issuing the discharge, entitled \u201cExplanation of Bankruptcy Discharge in a Chapter 7 Case,\u201d contained a subsection entitled \u201cDebts that are Not Discharged.\u201d Within that subsection, \u201cdebts that are domestic support obligations\u201d were deemed not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>On May 10, 2007, the trial court reaffirmed that father was in contempt, ordered that he pay mother\u2019s previously awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, and further ordered, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">That the debt herein of [father] is not discharged by 11 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]727 as the debt is in the nature of custody, visitation and support of the minor child and [father] is in violation of the following orders of this Court, namely:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">a. the Order entered on January 2[0], 2005;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">b. the Order entered on September 22, 2006;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">c. the Order entered on October 18, 2006; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">d. the Final Decree in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">The Court hereby further finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">That the debt owed herein by [father] in the amount of $3,300.00 is excepted from discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. [\u00a7]523(a)(5). That the bankruptcy case has been closed and that this Court retains its jurisdiction through its police powers to enforce its orders entered by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">This appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">Father contends that the trial court erred by exempting the attorneys\u2019 fees from bankruptcy discharge. To support that contention, he claims that the debt was \u201cfor a contempt violation of a visitation order\u201d and that the order was \u201cclearly not for [s]upport or [a]limony.\u201d Thus, he argues that the debt does not qualify as a \u201cdomestic support obligation\u201d exception to discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). We disagree with father.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">While \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to [the facts of a case] <em>de novo,\u201d </em>the trial court\u2019s \u201cfactual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Collins v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>272 Va. 744, 749, 636 S.E.2d 442, 446 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>As a preliminary matter, father contends generally that the trial court \u201clacked jurisdiction to enter the May 10, 2007 Order.\u201d It is well established, however, that \u201c[b]ankruptcy courts and state courts maintain concurrent jurisdiction to decide ... exceptions to discharge arising under [11 U.S.C. \u00a7] 523(a), including [11 U.S.C. \u00a7] 523(a)(5).\u201d <em>Monsour v. Monsour (In re Monsour), </em>372 B.R. 272, 278 (Bankr.W.D.Va. 2007); <em>see also In re Carter, </em>156 B.R. 768, 772 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1993); <em>Brogan v. Brogan, </em>31 Va.App. 769, 775, 525 S.E.2d 618, 621 (2000); <em>Douglas v. Douglas, </em>17 Va.App. 380, 382, 437 S.E.2d 244, 245-46 (1993). To the extent that father\u2019s contention can be read as a claim that the trial court had no authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees incident to a contempt proceeding for violations of a child visitation order, it is equally well established that in cases \u201cwhere the custody of a child, or child support, is involved,\u201d a court \u201chas the discretionary power to award counsel fees incurred by an aggrieved party incident to contempt proceedings instituted and conducted to obtain enforcement of an order of the court.\u201d <em>Carswell v. Masterson, </em>224 Va. 329, 332, 295 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1982); <em>see also Edwards v. Lowry, </em>232 Va. 110, 114, 348 S.E.2d 259, 262 (1986); <em>Sullivan v. Sullivan, </em>33 Va.App. 743, 752-53, 536 S.E.2d 925, 930 (2000). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court had jurisdiction to enter the May 10, 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u201cA debtor may obtain a general discharge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code from \u2018all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Bell (In re Bell), </em>357 B.R. 167, 171 (Bankr.M.D.Ala.2006) (quoting 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b)). Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), however, \u201cdomestic support obligation[s]\u201d are exempted from discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 11 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u00a7 101(14A) defines \u201cdomestic support obligation\u201d as debt that is (1) owed to or recoverable by the parent of a child of the debtor, (2) in the nature of support of the child or the child\u2019s parent, even if not expressly so designated, (3) established in a court order, and (4) not assigned to a nongovernmental entity, unless the obligation is assigned voluntarily by the child\u2019s parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In this case, father challenges only whether the debt he owes mother satisfies the second criteria contained in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14A), that is, whether the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to mother in a contempt proceeding arising out of father\u2019s violations of the child visitation order are considered \u201cin the nature of support of the child or the child\u2019s parent, even if not expressly so designated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\u2018\u201cWhether a debt is a support obligation, and not dischargeable ... is a matter of federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>27 Va.App. 209, 218 n. 5, 497 S.E.2d 916, 920 n. 5 (1998) (quoting <em>Mosley v. Mosley, </em>19 Va.App. 192, 196, 450 S.E.2d 161, 164 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\u201c[M]ost courts hold that fees \u2018inextricably intertwined with proceedings affecting the welfare of the child,\u2019 such as custody and visitation, should be deemed support.\u201d <em>Wedgle &amp; Shpall v. Ray (In re Ray), </em>143 B.R. 937, 940 (Bankr.D.Colo.1992) (quoting <em>Peters v. Hennenhoeffer (In re Peters), </em>133 B.R. 291, 295 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1991)). Indeed, \u201c[t]he majority of courts have held that a determination of child custody or visitation is a vital element of \u2018support\u2019 and, therefore, that an ancillary award of attorney\u2019s fees in connection with a custody or visitation dispute is in the \u2018nature of support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spear v. Constantine (In re Constantine), </em>183 B.R. 335, 336 (Bankr. D.Mass.1995); <em>see also Jones v. Jones (In re Jones), </em>9 F.3d 878, 882 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201c[C]ourt-ordered attorney\u2019s fees arising from post-divorce custody actions are deemed in the nature of support under [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 523(a)(5) as being incurred on behalf of the child.\u201d); <em>Bell, </em>357 B.R. at 174 (attorney\u2019s fees awarded in litigation to enforce, in part, a child support obligation are in the nature of support); <em>Hayden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>v. Farrell (In re Farrell), </em>133 B.R. 145, 148 (Bankr.S.D.Ind.1991) (attorney\u2019s fees imposed, in part, to punish debtor for disobeying court order in proceeding to compel return of child held nondischargeable); <em>Holtz v. Poe (In re Poe), </em>118 B.R. 809, 812 (Bankr.N.D.Okla.1990) (attorney\u2019s fees incurred in child custody litigation exempt from discharge); <em>Dellapa v. Vazquez (In re Vazquez), </em>92 B.R. 533, 535 (S.D.Fla.1988) (attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigation pertaining to visitation, custody, contempt, and child support nondischargeable); <em>York v. Castro (In re Castro), </em>74 B.R. 38, 40 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1987) (attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses relating to debtor\u2019s abduction of child and denial of visitation rights held nondischargeable); <em>Hicks v. Hicks (In re Hicks), </em>65 B.R. 227, 229 (Bankr.D.N.M.1986) (attorney\u2019s fees awarded in dispute to recover child from debtor who violated custody order held nondischargeable).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Here, mother\u2019s petition for reinstatement sought contempt findings in conjunction with an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against father for his violations of the child visitation order. In the affidavit filed with mother\u2019s petition, she averred that on two occasions, father had delayed returning the minor child to her for over a day without her consent or without communicating the visit\u2019s extension to her. In one of those instances, the child missed a whole day of school. At the September 22, 2006 hearing on mother\u2019s petition, the trial court found father in contempt, ordered him to show cause why he should not be imprisoned for contempt for violating the amended visitation order, and also ordered that he pay mother\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. The trial court conducted subsequent hearings on the matter, ultimately reaffirming its prior orders, making clear that the attorneys\u2019 fees were debt \u201cin the nature of custody, visitation, and support of the minor child,\u201d and exempted the fees from discharge in bankruptcy. It is clear, therefore, that mother\u2019s petition and request for attorneys\u2019 fees and the trial court\u2019s resolution of the matter dealt exclusively with the welfare of the parties\u2019 minor child by seeking and awarding relief from father\u2019s violations of the child visitation terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Under these circumstances, we agree with the trial court that the attorneys\u2019 fees were \u201cin the nature of support of the</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>child\u201d and, thus, fit within the second criteria contained in the definition of \u201cdomestic support obligation\u201d pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14A). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in exempting the fees from bankruptcy discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Father further contends that the trial court\u2019s order violated the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727, 524(a)(1), and 524(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Father also asserts that mother and mother\u2019s attorneys violated the bankruptcy court\u2019s injunction by conducting a collateral attack in the trial court. The validity of father\u2019s contentions, however, is contingent upon our resolution of whether the debt he owed mother was a dischargeable debt. Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the attorneys\u2019 fees were not debt discharged in bankruptcy, father\u2019s additional claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\">. Because the referenced amount of attorneys\u2019 fees originally awarded pursuant to the September 22, 2006 order conflicts with the amount in the trial court\u2019s final order entered on May 10, 2007, we remand this case to the trial court for the limited purpose of correcting this apparent clerical error in the final order if appropriate. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), effective October 17, 2005, replaced the lengthy text of former 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5) with the simple phrase \"domestic support obligation\u201d and provided a corresponding definition for that phrase in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14A). Because the language of the former 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5) and new definition in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14A) are similar, the pre-BAPCPA case law applicable to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5) is relevant and persuasive in determining if a debt fits within the definition of a \"domestic support obligation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">Except as provided in section 523 of this title [11 USCS \u00a7 523], a discharge under subsection (a) of this section discharges the debtor from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief under this chapter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">In addition, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(1) voids any judgment of the debtor\u2019s personal liability from debts discharged and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) enjoins the commencement or continuation of an action to collect any debt discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
