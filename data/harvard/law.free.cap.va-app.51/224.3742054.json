For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">On appeal, the facts in this case are viewed in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). Exiting a taxicab, Wubneh pulled out a BB gun, stating, \u201cI have a gun,\u201d and demanded money from the cab driver. Wubneh then repeatedly hit the driver in the head -with the gun and took his money. The gun appeared to the driver to be a \u201cblack pistol.\u201d A witness described the gun as looking like a \u201cnine millimeter.\u201d The gun was C02 operated, expelling a projectile by pneumatic pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Wubneh was charged with robbery, and the use of a firearm during the robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>statute does not define the term \u201cfirearm.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury as to the definition of a firearm as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEW\">A firearm is a weapon designed to expel a projectile by the explosion of gunpowder, by spring mechanism, or by pneumatic pressure. It is not necessary that the object actually have the capacity of firing a projectile, provided that it retains enough of its parts that it has not lost its appearance as a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Commonwealth submitted this instruction, taken from the Virginia Model Jury Instructions, without objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury convicted Wubneh on both the robbery and firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Wubneh challenged his firearm conviction in a motion to set aside the verdict. He contended in his motion that the jury instruction defining a firearm erroneously encompassed a BB gun such as the one he used in the robbery. The term \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, according to Wubneh, encompassed only objects having a capacity to propel a projectile by \u201cforce of gunpowder.\u201d Thus, Wubneh concluded, the instruction allowed for his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 even though he was, in fact, not in possession of a firearm. The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">As a preliminary matter, the Commonwealth asserts Wubneh is procedurally barred from challenging the firearm instruction on appeal. Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that, because Wubneh acquiesced to the instruction when given to the jury, his post-trial objection to the instruction was untimely, and thus waived under Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wubneh contends that, to the extent it was an untimely objection, he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>entitled to invoke Rule 5A:18\u2019s \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Generally, when a jury instruction, though erroneous, is given without a contemporaneous objection at trial, the instruction becomes \u201cthe law of the case,\u201d <em>Ulloa v. QSP, Inc., </em>271 Va. 72, 80, 624 S.E.2d 43, 48 (2006) (citations omitted), and, any objection to the instruction on appeal is waived. Rule 5A:18. The \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to this rule is, as always, \u201cnarrow and is to be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Bazemore v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 203, 219, 590 S.E.2d 602, 609 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This includes cases \u201ceven where such faulty instructions improperly stated the elements of an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 590 S.E.2d at 610. However, as we explained in <em>Bazemore:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has held that the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception applies to permit review when a \u201cgranted instruction omitted some essential elements of the offense\u201d and \u201cno evidence was produced relating to those elements.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 251, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681-82 (1991). In <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 994, 421 S.E.2d 652, 656 (1992), this Court similarly held that the exception applies to permit our review of an instruction that \u201callows a jury to convict a defendant without proof of an essential and necessary element of the charged offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In this case, the Commonwealth was required, under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, to prove that Wubneh used a \u201cfirearm\u201d in the commission of the robbery. It is undisputed that Wubneh possessed a BB gun at that time. Wubneh argues his BB gun was not a \u201cfirearm\u201d under the statute, as that term has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>defined under Virginia law\u2014i.e., a weapon fired by the explosion of gunpowder. According to Wubneh, the subject jury instruction erroneously included weapons fired \u201cby spring mechanism, or by pneumatic pressure\u201d within the definition of a \u201cfirearm,\u201d thus allowing for his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Because we conclude the jury instruction correctly defined a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, there is \u201cno miscarriage of justice\u201d in this case that would warrant application of the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18. <em>Bazemore, </em>42 Va.App. at 224, 590 S.E.2d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Challenging the firearm instruction, Wubneh argues that \u201c[ojbjects which are not designed to expel a projectile by means of an explosion of gun powder or combustible material are not firearms, even though they give the appearance of having that capacity.\u201d Thus, Wubneh contends, even though the BB gun he used in the robbery appeared to have such a firing capability, it was \u201cnot, in fact, a firearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 since it did not expel a projectile by explosive means. This Court rejected the same argument in <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 681, 492 S.E.2d 460 (1997), on nearly identical facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">As in the instant case, the defendant in <em>Thomas </em>robbed a taxicab driver using a \u201cBB pistol,\u201d having the appearance of a \u201csmall handgun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 492 S.E.2d at 461-62. The defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to prove he used a firearm in the commission of robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, as he committed the robbery with a BB gun, not a \u201cfirearm.\u201d We disagreed, holding there was sufficient evidence for his firearm conviction \u201c[bjecause the evidence proved that the BB pistol gave the appearance of having a firing capability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 492 S.E.2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In reaching our decision in <em>Thomas, </em>we explained that, while Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 does not define the word \u201cfirearm,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court has construed its \u201cintended meaning\u201d and \u201cset forth parameters of what does and does not constitute a \u2018firearm\u2019 under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 492 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>462 (citing <em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198-99, 269 S.E.2d 356, 357-58 (1980)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">First, because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cis aimed at preventing actual physical injury or death,\u201d the term \u201cfirearm\u201d includes any instrument that is capable of expelling a projectile by the force of gunpowder. <em>See [Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 198-99, 269 S.E.2d at 357-58],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">In addition, the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 includes some objects that are not capable of firing projectiles by an explosion of gunpowder. In <em>Holloman, </em>the Supreme Court held that any instrument that \u201cgives the appearance\u201d of having the capacity to propel a bullet by the force of gunpowder is a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. <em>See id. </em>at 199, 269 S.E.2d at 358 (holding that a BB pistol that fires BBs by the force of a spring but resembled a .45 caliber handgun was a \u201cfirearm\u201d because it \u201cgave the appearance of having a firing capability\u201d)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Thomas, </em>25 Va.App. at 685, 492 S.E.2d at 462. We then explained the Supreme Court\u2019s twofold rationale for this \u201cexpanded meaning of \u2018firearm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">First, it reasoned that the word \u201cfirearm\u201d included instruments that merely appear to have a firing capability because the General Assembly intended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cto discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm\u201d and the victim of a crime \u201ccan be intimidated as much by a revolver that does not fire bullets as by one that does.\u201d In addition, the Supreme Court reasoned that, as a practical matter, a crime victim \u201ccannot be required to distinguish between a loaded pistol and a spring gun when it is brandished during the commission of a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 685-86, 492 S.E.2d at 462 (quoting <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The same, of course, is true for a BB gun fired by pneumatic pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Wubneh argues, however, that <em>Holloman </em>was overruled by the Supreme Court in <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994), meaning that <em>Thomas </em>was wrongly decided. <em>Yarborough, </em>according to Wubneh, limited the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to a weapon fired by gunpowder. We disagree. In <em>Yarborough, </em>the defendant, with both hands in his pocket, approached the victim and stated, \u201cthis is a stickup; give me all your money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 441 S.E.2d at 343. The victim testified that \u201c[s]he saw \u2018something protruding ... from [defendant\u2019s] right hand pocket of his jacket,\u2019 and she \u2018thought [there] was a gun in his pocket.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant then took the victim\u2019s money and fled. Shortly thereafter, defendant was arrested for the robbery. He possessed only an unopened can of beer in one of the pockets of his jacket, and no weapon was found. He was subsequently convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. The Supreme Court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction, holding that the fact \u201cthe victim is made <em>to feel </em>that an assailant has a firearm\u201d is not sufficient for a conviction. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Rather, the Commonwealth is required to prove the defendant was actually in possession of a firearm. In doing so, the Supreme Court relied on its holding in <em>Holloman, </em>making clear that a \u201c \u2018firearm\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1\u201d included an instrument having the appearance of a firing capacity even though it \u201cwas fired by a spring [in the case of the BB gun in <em>Holloman </em>] rather than by gunpowder.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>247 Va. at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344 (citing <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 199, 269 S.E.2d at 358).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Furthermore, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the <em>Holloman </em>decision in <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 562 S.E.2d 139 (2002), where it construed the meaning of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, proscribing possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In contrasting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 with Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Supreme Court reiterated that the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201c \u2018is [not only] to deter violent criminal conduct ... but also ... to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm\u2019 \u201d to a victim from an \u201c \u2018instrument that gives the appearance of having a firing capability.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 562 S.E.2d at 144 (quoting <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358). Because such perception of a victim is not an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the Supreme Court explained, the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in that statute would not \u201cwarrant ... the same broad construction\u201d as \u201capplicable to the same term in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 562 S.E.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to the definition of the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Thus, there is no miscarriage of justice in this case warranting application of the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18, and the issue on appeal is procedurally defaulted. Accordingly, we affirm Wubneh\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-11\">.
