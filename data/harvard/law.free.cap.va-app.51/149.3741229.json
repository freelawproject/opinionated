On appeal, Saponaro argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the evidence. For the following reasons, we reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Kenneth Weaver, a building contractor, employed Saponaro as a subcontractor for a number of commercial contracts. Weaver provided Saponaro with a business credit card to make purchases for Weaver\u2019s construction business. Saponaro was in possession of the credit card for a period of approximately five months. During that time period, Saponaro charged several thousand dollars worth of personal items on the card, knowing it was to be used for business purposes only. On multiple occasions, Weaver confronted Saponaro about his personal use of the card, which Weaver discovered from the monthly credit card statements, and each time Saponaro agreed to reimburse Weaver for those purchases. Weaver finally took the credit card from Saponaro and then terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Saponaro was indicted for credit card fraud under Code \u00a7 18.2-195. His indictment specifically charged that he \u201cdid unlawfully and feloniously obtain money, goods, or services in excess of $200.00 by representing without the consent of the cardholder that he is the holder of a specified card or card holder.\u201d At the end of his trial, Saponaro moved to strike the evidence against him, arguing the Commonwealth had failed to prove the elements of the offense. The trial court denied the motion, finding him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Because this case presents \u201ca question of law ... involving] the interpretation and application\u201d of Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>195, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006); <em>see Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Code \u00a7 18.2-195 provides, in relevant part, as follows: \u201c(1) A person is guilty of credit card fraud when, with intent to defraud any person, he: ... (b) Obtains money, goods, services or anything else of value by representing (i) without the consent of the cardholder that he is the holder of a specified card or credit card number.... \u201d \u201cCardholder\u201d is defined as \u201cthe person or organization named on the face of a credit card to whom or for whose benefit the credit card is issued by an issuer.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-191. No definition is provided for the term \u201cholder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In this case, it is undisputed Saponaro had the consent of the cardholder (Weaver) to hold the credit card during the entire period he was making his personal purchases on the card. The Commonwealth nevertheless argues that Saponaro violated Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014195(1)(b)(i) because he only had Weaver\u2019s consent to use the card for business purposes. While that is correct, this provision does not proscribe in any way an accused\u2019s use of a credit card that he holds with the cardholder\u2019s consent. Because the statute does not define \u201cholder,\u201d we must give the word its \u201cordinary meaning unless the word is a term of art.\u201d <em>Conkling v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 518, 521, 612 S.E.2d 235, 237 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A \u201cholder\u201d is generally defined as \u201c[o]ne that holds as: ... [o]ne that possesses something.\u201d <em>American Heritage College Dictionary </em>647 (3rd ed.1997). Similarly, as a term of art under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201cholder\u201d means a \u201cperson in possession\u201d of either a negotiable instrument or a negotiable tangible document of title. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201(21)(A) and (B); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.3A-404.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>thus conclude that a \u201cholder\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-195(1)(b)(i) simply refers to one in possession of the cardholder\u2019s credit card. Accordingly, the threshold issue under this provision is whether Saponaro, when engaged in the subject transactions, had the cardholder\u2019s consent to possess the card. The fact that Saponaro had such consent is, therefore, dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Indeed, Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014195(1)(b)(i) does not specifically address the actual use of a credit card, but rather one\u2019s representation regarding his or her status as a holder of the card or card number when \u201c[ojbtaining,\u201d by whatever means, \u201cmoney, goods, services or anything else of value.\u201d It is subsection (l)(a) of the statute which, in fact, addresses credit card fraud where one \u201c[u]ses [a credit card or credit card number] for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-195(1)(a). There, such use is a crime if the card or card number was \u201cobtained or retained in violation of \u00a7 18.2-192 [credit card theft],\u201d or the user \u201cknows\u201d the card or number \u201cis expired or revoked.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Furthermore, one\u2019s misuse of a credit card lawfully possessed <em>(see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-111 (embezzlement)), as in the instant case, is distinct from one\u2019s misuse of a credit card wrongfully in his or her possession, which is the focus of Code \u00a7 18.2-195(1)(a) and (b). The Commonwealth contends that the former, as well as the latter, is a criminal act under subsection (1)(b)(i) of the statute. However, the Commonwealth conceded at oral argument that its interpretation of this provision would require us to read words into the statute such that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201cholder\u201d is holding the credit card \u201cfor a specific purpose.\u201d In other words, the Commonwealth would have us rule that credit card fraud occurs under this provision where the cardholder gives his or her consent for the accused to use the card only for a specific, limited purpose, and the accused violates that limitation. This we cannot do. That is to say, \u201c \u2018[cjourts cannot read into a statute something that is not within the manifest intention of the legislature as gathered from the statute itself. To depart from the meaning expressed by the words is to alter the statute, to legislate and not to interpret.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 234, 245, 616 S.E.2d 754, 759 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Jordan v. South Boston, </em>138 Va. 838, 844-45, 122 S.E. 265, 267 (1924)), <em>aff'd, </em>272 Va. 481, 634 S.E.2d 305 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The trial court thus erred in denying Saponaro\u2019s motion to strike the evidence at the end of his trial as the Commonwealth failed to prove the charge against him under Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014195(1)(b)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">For these reasons, we reverse Saponaro\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. Code \u00a7 8.3A-404, addressing \"impostors\u201d and \"fictitious payees,\" further confirms that no specific legal parameters can be ascribed, for purposes of this case, to the term \"holder,\" in looking to the UCC for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>guidance, other than it being a reference to one in possession of the subject item. Under certain circumstances involving the misuse of a commercial instrument, as set forth under subsection (b) of this statute, the \"holder\u201d is simply defined as \"[a]ny person in possession of the instrument.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.3A-404(b)(1). As then explained in Official Comment 2 to subsection (b), the holder may be lawfully or wrongly in possession of the subject instrument. As an example, a \"Thief\u201d may be the \"holder\u201d of an instrument, e.g., a forged check, \"because Thief is the person in possession of the instrument ... even though Thief does not have title to the check and is in wrongful possession of it.\u201d Then a depository bank \"that takes the check in good faith\u201d becomes the \"holder\u201d of the same check.
