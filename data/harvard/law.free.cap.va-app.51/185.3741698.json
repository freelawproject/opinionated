Dowden, Jr. (claimant) appeals a decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) terminating his temporary partial disability benefits because he did not timely cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment offered by Hercules, Inc. (employer). On appeal, claimant contends the commission erred in determining he did not partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) when he timely procured selective employment paying less than the selective employment originally offered by employer. On May 8, 2007, a divided panel of this Court agreed with claimant and reversed the commission\u2019s decision. <em>Dowden v. Hercules, Inc., </em>49 Va.App. 668, 644 S.E.2d 93 (2007). On July 3, 2007, we granted appellees\u2019 petition for a rehearing en banc, stayed the mandate of the panel decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing en banc, we reverse the decision of the commission and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">I. BACKGROUND .</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Claimant began working for employer in 1969. After thirty years of employment, he voluntarily applied for early retirement on August 23, 2000, pursuant to a buy-out offer designed to assist employer in reducing its workforce. On January 31, 2001, while his application for early retirement was pending, claimant injured his back at work. Prior to his injury, claimant earned an average weekly wage of $1,243.64 per week. Upon returning to light-duty work with employer, he earned a wage of $1,002 per week. The commission subsequently awarded claimant temporary partial disability benefits from February 1, 2001, and continuing, at a rate of $161.10 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">After claimant returned to light-duty work, he was notified that his application for early retirement had been approved. Claimant accepted employer\u2019s offer of early retirement and retired effective May 1, 2001. Employer continued to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>claimant $161.10 per week in temporary partial disability payments through July 13, 2003. On or around that date, employer discovered claimant had accepted employment as a sales associate with a friend\u2019s seafood company on March 10, 2003, earning $200 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">On July 24, 2003, employer filed an application with the commission seeking termination or suspension of claimant\u2019s award and credit for benefits paid from March 10, 2003, through July 13, 2003. Employer argued that claimant unjustifiably refused selective employment by voluntarily retiring and that he failed to cure his unjustified refusal. Claimant filed a change-in-condition application on September 5, 2003, seeking a continuation of his temporary partial disability wage-loss benefits of $161.10 per week. Claimant argued that he did not refuse selective employment when he retired, but, if the commission found he did, he cured that refusal on March 10, 2003, when he procured other selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finding that claimant\u2019s voluntary retirement constituted an unjustified refusal of selective employment pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A) and that claimant did not effectuate a cure within six months from the date of his retirement as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-510(0, the deputy commissioner granted employer\u2019s application and denied claimant\u2019s change-in-condition application. Upon review, the full commission agreed with the deputy commissioner that claimant unjustifiably refused selective employment when he voluntarily retired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It disagreed, however, that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C)\u2019s six-month statute of limitations to cure the unjustified refusal began running on the date of claimant\u2019s retirement. Accordingly, the full commission remanded the case \u201cfor determination of the date the claimant\u2019s cure requirement began ... and whether the claimant cured the unjustified refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">On remand, the deputy commissioner determined that, because claimant failed \u201cto report his return to work on March 10, 2003,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C)\u2019s six-month statute of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tions to cure claimant\u2019s unjustified refusal began to run on that date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner then found that claimant failed to cure his unjustified refusal by September 10, 2003, and, thus, was not entitled to temporary partial disability benefits beyond March 10, 2003. In reaching that decision, the deputy commissioner found that claimant\u2019s employment paying $200 per week did not cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment because it was not comparable to the employment paying $1,002 per week he had refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Appealing the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision to the full commission, claimant asserted that his return to work selling seafood on March 10, 2003, constituted a cure of his unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). He argued that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) did not require him to obtain employment at a wage \u201ccomparable\u201d to the wage he would have earned had he continued the selective employment offered by employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">A majority of the full commission disagreed with claimant, holding that the employment an injured worker procures \u201cmust be at a wage comparable to that of the previously refused position\u201d to constitute a cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510. Accordingly, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision that claimant failed to cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment, noting as follows: \u201cThe claimant was earning $1,002 per week in his selective employment, and after his refusal, he began earning $200 per week. The evidence does not indicate that the employment he procured was comparable and effectuated a cure of his unjustified refusal of selective employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">This appeal by claimant followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether claimant\u2019s acceptance on March 10, 2003, of selective employment paying $200 per week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>was sufficient under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment offered by employer paying $1,002 per week. Relying on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Newsome, </em>80 Va.App. 21, 515 S.E.2d 317 (1999), and <em>Clements v. Riverside Walter Reed Hospital, </em>40 Va.App. 214, 578 S.E.2d 814 (2003), the commission concluded that claimant\u2019s procurement of the $200-per-week selective employment was not sufficient to cure his unjustified refusal because the wage he earned at that employment was not comparable to the wage he earned at the selective employment offered by employer. We hold that our decision in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home v. Underwood, </em>35 Va.App. 31, 542 S.E.2d 785 (2001), and the express language of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) control the outcome of this case and require the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is well settled that an injured employee who unjustifiably refuses selective employment offered by the employer is not \u201centitled to receive disability compensation during the continuance of the refusal.\u201d <em>Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc. v. Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. 74, 78, 435 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1993); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A). However, \u201conce an employee has cured an unjustified refusal of selective employment, he ... is entitled to reinstatement of benefits,\u201d <em>Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 25, 515 S.E.2d at 319 (citing Code \u00a7 65.2-510), as long as the cure is effectuated within \u201csix months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to [Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A)],\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C). The calculation of the employee\u2019s benefits following a timely cure depends on whether he fully cured the unjustified refusal or only partially cured it. <em>Compare Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 25-26, 515 S.E.2d at 319-20 (addressing compensation following a full cure under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-510 and 65.2-502), <em>with Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 39, 542 S.E.2d at 788, 789 (addressing compensation following a partial cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">A full cure occurs when the injured employee procures \u201cother selective employment at a wage equal to or greater than\u201d the wage of the refused selective employment. <em>Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 23, 26, 515 S.E.2d at 318, 320. If the employee fully cures his unjustified refusal, he is entitled to \u201ca weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages ... <em>he is able to earn thereafter.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-502 (emphasis added); <em>see Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 25, 515 S.E.2d at 319 (\u201cOnce an employee cures an unjustified refusal of employment, Code \u00a7 65.2-510 returns the parties to their pre-refusal status, and Code \u00a7 65.2-502 obligates the employer to pay partial incapacity benefits.\u201d). Accordingly, we held in <em>Newsome </em>that, although the injured employee was unemployed for seven-and-one-half weeks during the post-refusal period for which he sought compensation, because he had already fully cured his refusal and marketed his full residual work capacity during the period of unemployment, the employer\u2019s liability was not limited \u201cto the difference between [the employee\u2019s] refused selective employment wage and his pre-injury wage.\u201d 30 Va.App. at 25-26, 515 S.E.2d at 319-20. In other words, having fully cured his refusal of selective employment, the employee was entitled to compensation for a full cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-502(A), rather than compensation for a partial cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A partial cure occurs when the injured employee procures other selective employment \u201c \u2018at a wage less than that originally offered\u2019 \u201d by the employer. <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 39, 542 S.E.2d at 788, 789 (quoting and citing Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)). If the employee partially cures his unjustified refusal, he is entitled to \u201ca weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B); <em>see Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 39, 542 S.E.2d at 788, 789. Accordingly, the employer\u2019s liability under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) is not based on the difference between the employee\u2019s pre-injury wage and the wage he could or does earn, but rather on the difference between his pre-injury wage and the wage he would have earned had he not refused the selective employment offered by the employer. This approach does not defeat the purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-510\u2014to the contrary, it encourages the injured employee to return to work, any work, and limits the employer\u2019s liability to the same liability it would have had if the employee had not refused the employer\u2019s offer of selective employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Big D. Homebuilders v. Hamilton, </em>228 Va. 378, 382, 322 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1984) (\u201cThe legislative intent [of Code \u00a7 65.1-63 (recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-510)] is to encourage injured employees to seek selective employment rather than to remain unemployed....\u201d); <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Lee, </em>16 Va.App. 616, 619, 431 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1993) (\u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-510 was enacted ... to encourage employers to procure employment suitable to partially incapacitated employees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Nothing in Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) limits the application of that subsection to only injured employees who procure selective employment at wages comparable to the wages they would have earned had they not refused the originally offered selective employment. <em>See Britt Construction v. Magazzine Clean, LLC, </em>271 Va. 58, 62-63, 623 S.E.2d 886, 888 (2006) (\u201cWhen statutory language is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Therefore, when the General Assembly has used words of a definite import, we cannot give those words a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly meant something other than that which it actually expressed.\u201d (citations omitted)). Indeed, the only wage-related provision that limits Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s application is the subsection\u2019s express requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that the wage of the selective employment procured by the employee be \u201cless than that originally offered\u201d by the employer. Thus, contrary to the commission\u2019s conclusion, an employer may not escape liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) simply because the employee procures selective employment that pays substantially less than the selective employment offered by the employer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (\u201c[W]e will withhold the deference we normally accord the commission\u2019s statutory interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act when the commission\u2019s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of the statute.\u201d); <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 39-40, 542 S.E.2d at 789 (applying Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>the claimant suffered a compensable injury by accident that limited her work capacity and prevented her from continuing in her full-time, full-duty position. 35 Va.App. at 34-35, 542 S.E.2d at 787. The employer offered the claimant part-time selective employment, which the claimant accepted. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 542 S.E.2d at 787. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Thereafter, the employer offered the claimant full-time selective employment, which the claimant unjustifiably refused. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 38, 542 S.E.2d at 787, 789. The claimant continued to work part-time for the employer and took no apparent steps to market her full residual work capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 542 S.E.2d at 787. Considering the claimant\u2019s request for benefits for the period following her refusal of the full-time selective employment, the commission determined that the claimant \u201cpartially cured her ... [unjustified] refusal of full-time selective employment by simply continuing the part-time, light duty work that predated the offer\u201d of full-time employment. <em>Id. </em>at 39, 542 S.E.2d at 789. \u201c[T]he commission reasoned that, \u2018although it was the claimant\u2019s decision to work the reduced hours, the effect was the same as if she, in an attempt to cure, had obtained alternate employment at a reduced wage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the commission awarded the claimant partial disability benefits \u201cpursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the commission\u2019s judgment, noting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\"><em>If claimant had refused the offer of full-time employment, resigned and thereafter immediately accepted part-time, light duty work with employer or elsewhere, at reduced wages, she would have partially cured such refusal. </em>Likewise, continued part-time, selective employment with [the employer], following the full-time offer, constituted a partial cure of her prior unjustified refusal of such employment within the intendment of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). A contrary result would deny benefits under circumstances evincing little substantive difference in conduct, thereby thwarting the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.... Accordingly, the commission correctly determined that \u201cclaimant would still be entitled to temporary benefits based on the difference between her pre[-]injury average weekly wage and the wage she would have earned had she accepted [the] full-time hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 39-40, 542 S.E.2d at 789 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In this case, claimant did just what we spoke of in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing </em>Home\u2014he refused employer\u2019s offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of continued full-time selective employment, resigned in order to take voluntary retirement, and thereafter timely accepted selective employment with a different employer at reduced wages. Accordingly, we hold that <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home </em>is applicable to this case and requires the conclusion that claimant partially cured his refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Moreover, we are aware of no controlling precedent since Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s enactment in 1995 that supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant did not partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) because the position he procured was not \u201cat a wage comparable to that of the previously refused position.\u201d As noted above, <em>Newsome </em>was decided under the full cure provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-510 and 65.2-502. <em>See </em>30 Va.App. at 26, 515 S.E.2d at 320 (\u201c[BJeeause Newsome properly cured his refusal of selective employment, as long as he fully markets his residual capacity, we find no authority to limit the employer\u2019s liability to the difference between Newsome\u2019s refused selective employment wage and his pre-injury wage.\u201d). In <em>Clements, </em>we cited Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) and <em>Hillcrest Man- or Nursing Home </em>for the proposition that a claimant may \u201cpartially cure a refusal\u201d but expressly stated in a footnote that the claimant in that case \u201cnever argued that she partially cured her refusal.\u201d 40 Va.App. at 225 &amp; n. 7, 578 S.E.2d at 819 &amp; n. 7. Similarly, we expressly noted in <em>Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Lusby, </em>41 Va.App. 300, 315 n. 8, 585 S.E.2d 318, 325 n. 8 (2003), that, although Code \u00a7 65.2-510 \u201cwas amended in 1995 to allow for a \u2018partial\u2019 cure[, it was] clear from the full commission\u2019s opinion that it proceeded under the former statute, which was in effect at the time of [the claimant\u2019s] injury, because it [did] not contemplate or consider partial cure as a basis for recovery in [the] case.\u201d Thus, none of these cases was decided under the partial cure provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We hold, therefore, pursuant to <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home </em>and the express language of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B), that claimant\u2019s acceptance on March 10, 2003, of selective employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ment paying $200 per week was sufficient under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) to partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment paying $1,002 per week. Consequently, having timely partially cured his unjustified refusal of selective employment, claimant was entitled to a continuation of his temporary partial disability wage-loss benefits in accordance with Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">III.

In 2000, he applied for early retirement. While the application was pending, Dowden injured his back at work. After his accident, Dowden returned to work with Hercules in a light-duty job earning $1,002 a week, about $241 less than his pre-injury weekly wage. The commission awarded Dow-den $161 a week in temporary partial benefits. Several months later, Hercules approved Dowden\u2019s early retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>application. Dowden retired in May 2001. Despite Dowden\u2019s retirement, Hercules continued to pay him $161 a week in compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In 2003, Dowden starting working for a friend\u2019s seafood company earning $200 a week. Hercules filed an application with the commission seeking a termination of benefits, arguing that Dowden failed to mitigate his damages by quitting his light-duty job. Dowden\u2019s position with his friend\u2019s seafood company, Hercules argued, did not cure his earlier decision to quit his light-duty job. The commission agreed that Dowden\u2019s early retirement amounted to an unjustified refusal of \u201cselective employment\u201d and he did not \u201ccure\u201d that refusal by taking the <em>de minimis </em>job with his friend\u2019s seafood company. Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A) &amp; (B). The commission concluded the $200-a-week job could not be a statutory cure because the job was not \u201cat a wage comparable to that of the previously refused position.\u201d <em>Dowden v.

While the wages of a cure job need not be \u201cidentical\u201d to those of the refused job, the commission reasoned, \u201cthey certainly must closely approximate them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">On appeal, Dowden argues that the commission misinterpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). As a matter of law, Dowden contends, <em>any </em>job paying <em>any </em>wage constitutes a \u201ccure\u201d job under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). Under his view, Dowden concedes, even a job paying $1 a week would suffice. Hercules, on the other hand, defends the commission\u2019s reasoning in full. Only a cure job paying wages that \u201cclosely approximate\u201d the refused job satisfies Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). We agree with neither position.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The duty to mitigate damages represents a universal maxim adopted by every branch of law in one form or another. Workers\u2019 compensation law is no exception. A partially disabled worker cannot use his misfortune as an excuse to malinger or to semi-retire at his former employer\u2019s expense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>One who has \u201cvoluntarily removed himself from the labor market\u201d cannot obtain wage loss benefits. <em>Crystal Oil Co. v. Dotson, </em>12 Va.App. 1014, 1022, 408 S.E.2d 252, 255 (1991). The injured worker must make reasonable efforts to find\u2014 and, if he does find, to take\u2014suitable employment within his capacities. <em>See Virginia Natural Gas, Inc. v. Tennessee, </em>50 Va.App. 270, 282-85, 649 S.E.2d 206, 212-14 (2007); <em>Nat\u2019l Linen Serv. v. McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. 267, 272, 380 S.E.2d 31, 34 (1989). If he fails to do so, all compensation benefits will be suspended until he does. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-510 regulates just one aspect of the duty to mitigate: the consequences of refusing a mitigation job offered by the former employer hoping to get the injured worker back to work and to thereby moot the need for all or part of the continuing compensation benefits. If the mitigation job qualifies as employment \u201csuitable to his capacity,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A), the injured worker must take the job unless some reason justifies his refusal to do so. If he unjustifiably refuses to take the mitigation job, compensation benefits are suspended. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The suitable-to-his-capacity qualification in subsection A defines the scope of the injured worker\u2019s mitigation duty. A mitigation job is not suitable if the worker\u2019s injuries limit his physical ability to do the work. A mechanic with a hand injury, therefore, does not breach his mitigation duty by refusing a job that requires full use of both hands. For the same reason, a mitigation job can be unsuitable if the worker can physically do the job, but the job itself is beyond his vocational abilities\u2014as when an injured mechanic with full use of his hands is offered a mitigation job as a surgeon. The surgeon\u2019s job is not \u201csuitable\u201d for a mechanic, and thus, Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A) would place no duty on the mechanic to take a job he obviously cannot perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The same suitability principle operates in the inverse. An injured surgeon with a physical impairment that affects only the number of hours he can work (but nothing else) could not be offered a mitigation job as a part-time clerk at a conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ience store. He may have the physical capacity needed for the job, but he would not be at risk of losing his right to compensation benefits if he refused to take a job so demonstrably beneath his vocational capacities. Such a job would be too far below the surgeon\u2019s vocational potential to be considered a <em>bona fide </em>offer of selective employment. The suitability qualification in Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A), therefore, serves both as a ceiling and a floor for the range of mitigation jobs that can be offered to an injured worker. Whether a job is \u201csuitable\u201d under subsection A necessarily depends on the worker\u2019s physical as well as vocational capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Subsection B of Code \u00a7 65.2-510 uses exactly the same language\u2014employment \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d\u2014to determine when an injured worker who has violated subsection A\u2019s duty to mitigate has cured this breach. Under subsection B, \u201can injured employee cures his unjustified refusal by accepting employment <em>suitable to his capacity </em>at a wage less than that originally offered.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) If the injured worker misses his first opportunity at a mitigation job (and, as a consequence, loses his compensation benefits), he may restore the benefits in part by taking a different job at a lower wage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The putative cure job, however, must also be \u201csuitable to his capacity.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Under subsection B, suitability will rarely act as a ceiling because an injured worker will not likely take a job he knows he is ill equipped to keep. But suitability plays an important role in setting the vocational floor, below which the cure job cannot go. So, if an injured surgeon unjustifiably refuses a mitigation job as a part-time surgeon and loses compensation benefits based upon his prior job as a full-time surgeon, he cannot \u201ccure\u201d that breach of the mitigation duty by taking a job as a part-time convenience store clerk. For the same reason he could have refused the convenience store clerk job as unsuitable had it been offered to him by his former employer under subsection A, the employer can refuse the exact same job as unsuitable when offered by the injured surgeon as a cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It follows, then, that the statutory requirement in subsection B that the employment be \u201csuitable\u201d to the injured worker\u2019s capacities means the same thing as the identical requirement in subsection A. To be suitable, the employment cannot be more than the injured worker can be expected to perform or demonstrably less than he can be expected to perform. The text of subsection B confirms this conclusion by calculating the worker\u2019s post-cure disability benefits \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 65.2-502.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). Code \u00a7 65.2-502(A) specifically computes the worker\u2019s lost wage claim based upon what he earned before the accident and what he \u201cis <em>able </em>to earn thereafter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A worker\u2019s <em>ability </em>to earn wages necessarily takes into account his physical as well as vocational capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">For these reasons, we reject both Dowden\u2019s and the commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). Coming from opposite analytical extremes, each interpretation involves a monocular focus on the issue of wages. The question is not simply whether the cure job pays <em>any </em>wage (which could be as little as $1 a week, as Dowden argues) or even whether it pays a less, but still <em>comparable, </em>wage (which \u201cmust closely approx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>imate\u201d the wage of the refused job, as the commission held). The question involves a far broader set of circumstances for the factfinder to consider. No itemized list of suitability factors appears in the workers\u2019 compensation statute. But the General Assembly, in an analogous provision of the unemployment compensation statute, left no doubt as to the relevant considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">In determining whether or not any <em>work </em>is <em>suitable for an individual, </em>the Commission shall consider the degree of risk involved to his health, safety and morals, his physical fitness and prior training, his experience, his length of unemployment and the accessibility of the available work from his residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Code \u00a7 60.2-618(3)(b) (emphasis added); <em>see generally </em>4 <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 85.01, at 85-1 - 85-3 (2005) (noting that workers\u2019 compensation cases \u201cresemble in general effect the more numerous unemployment cases\u201d addressing a claimant who \u201chas refused suitable work\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The definition of suitability under the unemployment compensation statute closely tracks the considerations governing an injured worker\u2019s duty to market his residual capacity under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, which requires the injured worker to look for \u201csuitable employment <em>commensurate with his abilities.\u201d Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. v. Lawrence, </em>38 Va.App. 656, 664, 568 S.E.2d 374, 378 (2002) (citation omitted and emphasis added). This formulation of \u201cresidual capacity\u201d takes into account the \u201cnature and extent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of the injured worker\u2019s physical impairments; his \u201ctraining, age, experience, and education;\u201d his discernible \u201cintent\u201d in finding <em>bona fide </em>work; the availability of employment in his job market; and any \u201cother matter\u201d affecting his ability to find suitable employment. <em>Metro. Washington Airports v. Lusby, </em>41 Va.App. 300, 317, 585 S.E.2d 318, 326 (2003) (quoting <em>Nat\u2019l Linen Serv., </em>8 Va.App. at 272, 380 S.E.2d at 34). Even when an injured worker\u2019s marketing effort lands him a job, he still cannot satisfy his mitigation duty if the job is demonstrably below his full residual capacity. <em>See Virginia Natural Gas, Inc., </em>50 Va.App. at 282-85, 649 S.E.2d at 212-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">To be sure, the definition of residual capacity brings us full circle to the injured worker\u2019s duty to cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510 because \u201cemployment \u2018suitable to [the employee\u2019s] capacity\u2019 <em>means </em>employment within the employee\u2019s <em>residual capacity </em>resulting from the industrial accident.\u201d <em>Am. Furniture Co. v. Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 42, 334 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1985) (emphasis added); <em>see also Ballweg v. Crowder Contracting, </em>247 Va. 205, 209, 440 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1994) (requiring cure job be suitable to the worker\u2019s \u201cresidual capacity\u201d); <em>Talley v. Goodwin Bros., </em>224 Va. 48, 52, 294 S.E.2d 818, 820-21 (1982) (asking whether the job was within the worker\u2019s \u201cresidual capacity\u201d). When the mitigation duty involves <em>looking </em>for a job, the definition of residual capacity requires a broad factual examination of the worker\u2019s physical and vocational capacities. Exactly the same can be said when the mitigation duty involves <em>getting </em>a job. Residual capacity, therefore, means the same thing in both contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Neither Dowden\u2019s nor the commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s suitability requirement is fully consistent with these principles. Dowden\u2019s any-job-will-do interpretation falls far short of the full meaning of residual capacity. The commission\u2019s interpretation, on the other hand, collapses residual capacity into a single factor\u2014whether the wages of the putative cure job \u201cclosely approximate\u201d the wages of the refused job. Suitability under Code \u00a7 65.2-510 requires an examination of the injured worker\u2019s residual capacity. <em>See Am. Furniture Co., </em>230 Va. at 42, 334 S.E.2d at 550; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Ballweg, </em>247 Va. at 209, 440 S.E.2d at 615. Whether a particular job constitutes \u201csuitable selective employment\u201d presents a \u201cquestion of fact\u201d to be determined under the circumstances of each case. <em>Gallahan v. Free Lance Star Pub. Co., </em>37 Va.App. 114, 118, 554 S.E.2d 685, 686 (2001) (examining suitability under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In sum, the commission\u2019s use of an incorrect legal standard to determine the suitability of Dowden\u2019s job at his friend\u2019s seafood company truncated the factfinding task necessary under the correct legal standard. We thus reverse and remand for the commission to consider all facts relevant to whether Dowden\u2019s job at his friend\u2019s seafood company at $200 a week was \u201cemployment suitable to his capacity\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). This fact-specific examination should take into account Dowden\u2019s physical and vocational capacities as well as any other consideration pertinent to his residual capacity for gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">. Claimant does not challenge this determination on appeal. Accordingly, it is not before us here. Also not before us is the issue of whether taking voluntary retirement, in and of itself, would preclude a future cure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\">. As the full commission noted, neither party contested this determination on review to the full commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">If an injured employee cures his unjustified refusal by accepting employment suitable to his capacity at a wage less than that originally offered, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee during his partial incapacity pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-502, a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\">. Indeed, an employer that offers an injured employee selective employment at a wage equal to or greater than the employee's pre-injury wage would have no liability under the partial cure provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">. Nor do we find anything else in Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) that precludes the application of that subsection to claimant in this case. As set out in his attached opinion, Judge Kelsey reads Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s \"employment suitable to his capacity\u201d language as permitting a partial cure only where an injured employee procures employment that makes maximum use of his remaining vocational skills, thereby prohibiting a surgeon, for example, from effecting a partial cure by taking a job at a convenience store. However, the phrase \"employment suitable to his capacity\u201d has been defined by our Supreme Court as meaning nothing more, in the context of the Workers' Compensation Act, than \u201cemployment within the employee\u2019s residual capacity <em>resulting from the industrial accident.\u201d American Furniture Co. v. Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 42, 334 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1985) (emphasis added). In other words, the phrase simply refers to employment that does not exceed the partially disabled employee's work restrictions and limitations caused by the compensable injury, and is often used interchangeably with such terms as \"selective employment,\u201d <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 42\u201443, 334 S.E.2d at 550, and \"suitable light-duty [employment],\u201d <em>see, e.g., M &amp; S Auto Parts, Inc. v. Presgraves, </em>45 Va.App. 455, 464, 611 S.E.2d 655, 659 (2005) (emphasis omitted). We may not extend the import of the phrase beyond its obvious meaning. <em>See Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 251, 563 S.E.2d 368, 373 (2002) (\"[Courts may not] extend the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s provisions beyond their obvious meaning ... [nor] hold that the legislature did not mean what it actually expressed. If such a change is to be made, it is for the legislature to undertake, not us.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">. The \"cure\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) involves suitable employment \"at a wage less than that originally offered\u201d by the employer under subsection A. From the injured worker's perspective, therefore, a subsection B job will always be a partial cure. No matter what the wage of the cure job, the worker\u2019s compensation benefits are still calculated at \u201c66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). The General Assembly added subsection B to Code \u00a7 65.2-510 in 1995. See 1995 Va. Acts, ch. 319. The purpose of the new provision was to supersede caselaw that calculated the post-cure benefits for wage loss based upon the cure-job wages, rather than (as subsection B now requires) the refused-job wages. <em>See, e.g., Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc. v. Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. 74, 80, 435 S.E.2d 156, 160 (1993); <em>Vernon v. Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist., </em>No. 129-91-70, 1989 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 55 (Aug. 22, 1989); <em>Lawhorne v. H.F.
