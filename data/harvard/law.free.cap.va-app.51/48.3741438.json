Appellant argues that these statements were taken in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. For the reasons stated, we agree and reverse appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On July 28, 2005, police officers stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle in the town of Altavista, which is located in Campbell County. These officers detained appellant in his vehicle until police officers from the neighboring jurisdiction responded to the scene, since appellant\u2019s vehicle matched the description of a vehicle involved in a breaking and entering of a home in Pittsylvania County.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">When Investigator Hagerman of the Pittsylvania County Sheriffs Department arrived on scene, he asked appellant to go with the officers to the police department in the Town of Hurt in Pittsylvania County to \u201ctalk.\u201d This police department was located approximately one-half of a mile from where appellant\u2019s vehicle was stopped. Appellant drove his vehicle to the police department, followed by five police officers in their police vehicles. Three of those police officers, including Investigator Hagerman, accompanied appellant into the police department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The interview began at 1:25 p.m. Investigator Hagerman told appellant that they were interviewing him \u201cin reference to a B &amp; E that occurred at the Mark Worley residence\u201d the previous day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Investigator Hagerman then asked appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>for permission to search his vehicle. Appellant responded, \u201cNah, I want a lawyer, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Investigator Hagerman replied, \u201cOkay. But anyway----\u201d Investigator Hagerman then read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and asked appellant to sign a document acknowledging that he had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Investigator Hagerman continued the conversation with appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">Hagerman: Michael, I\u2019ll just tell you what the offense was that we were talking about uh, do you want to go ahead and talk with me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">[Appellant]: Uh, my moma [sic] said that if I get in any more trouble I need a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Hagerman: Okay, well, you don\u2019t have to talk to me. Let me talk to you now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Investigator Hagerman did not ask appellant any questions regarding his request for counsel, but instead proceeded to talk to appellant about the instant offenses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">Hagerman: I\u2019ve got positive identification of your car as it was pulling out of that house yesterday. Uh, there was about four thousand dollars worth of items stolen. Now, if you\u2019re willing to talk. If you want to go ahead and talk to me about this fine, if you don\u2019t, you know you\u2019re in trouble right now. Uh, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not playing with you. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">[Appellant]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">Hagerman: [Unintelligible] straight out. Uh, the only hope you\u2019ve got right now is to come clean as you can get. Let me try to get this stuff back that was stolen, that was taken, and uh, if, you know, you\u2019re on probation, I mean you need to think for yourself, you\u2019re twenty years old. [Unintelligible] saw the vehicle come down the hill right behind your car when you was [sic] pulling out spinning wheels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">[Appellant]: I don\u2019t nothing [sic] about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">Hagerman: Okay. Where was [sic] you at yesterday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>[Appellant]: I was with my daddy up at the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Investigator Hagerman then obtained from appellant his address, his father\u2019s name, and whether any of his Mends were with him the day before. Investigator Hagerman questioned appellant\u2019s alibi, saying, \u201c[Y]ou think your daddy is going to say that you were home all day yesterday?\u201d He also asked appellant about his employment status and how he got his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Investigator Hagerman then turned off the tape recorder, and told appellant that if he returned to Pittsylvania County in the future, Investigator Hagerman would put him in jail. Investigator Hagerman left the room with Deputy C.W. Glass, asking Chief Brian Marr of the Hurt Police Department to stay in the room with appellant. Chief Marr knew appellant, through appellant\u2019s mother, prior to his interaction with him that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">For twenty minutes, Chief Marr and appellant sat in silence in the room. Appellant then stated either \u201cI messed up\u201d or \u201cThis is messed up.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Chief Marr testified that they then began to discuss appellant\u2019s family and his job status, and Chief Marr told appellant that \u201che needed to help his [sic] self.\u201d About 10 minutes of discussion occurred between appellant and Chief Marr before Chief Marr asked Investigator Hagerman to return to the room. At that time, Chief Marr began recording the second part of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The transcript of the second part of the interview indicates a portion of what appellant and Chief Marr discussed before the tape began recording. At one point, Chief Marr stated, \u201cI\u2019ve adivsed [sic] you that you can help yourself, okay.\u201d Later in the statement, Chief Marr acknowledged part of the earlier, unrecorded conversation, \u201c[J]ust like I\u2019ve told you before, we know more than what you\u2019re telling us____Help yourself out. You come [sic] this far man. You want me to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>help you and you want the investigator to help you.\u201d Chief Marr also alluded to promises made by himself and Investigator Hagerman that were not recorded, saying \u201cThe man [Investigator Hagerman] has already given you his word to help you. I\u2019ve give [sic] you my word to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Chief Marr read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights again, and \u201casked him would he speak with [Chief Marr] rather than Investigator Hagerman, would he feel more comfortable with that.\u201d Appellant indicated that he would. Appellant gave a statement regarding the offenses at approximately 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">After making these statements, appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The trial court determined that appellant made a clear and unambiguous request for counsel, and suppressed any statements made to Investigator Hagerman before he left the room. However, the trial court found that appellant \u201creinitiated the conversation\u201d after police officers stopped questioning him. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements made to Chief Marr. Appellant then entered a conditional plea of guilty pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254, preserving for appeal the alleged violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Appellant contends that, after he \u201cclearly asserted his right to counsel,\u201d police officers engaged in \u201ccoercive tactics,\u201d failed to provide counsel, and continued to interrogate him, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant argues that, as a result, any statements he made must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>On appeal from a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, the appellant must show that the trial court\u2019s decision constituted reversible error. <em>See Stanley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 873, 874, 433 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1993). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). We review the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact only for clear error. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 697, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>The Fifth Amendment Right to Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u201cThe right of a criminal suspect to have an attorney present during custodial interrogation was first articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 469-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1625-27, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hilliard, </em>270 Va. 42, 49, 613 S.E.2d 579, 584 (2005). The Court in <em>Miranda </em>\u201cheld that before interrogating a suspect who is in police custody, law enforcement officers must inform the suspect of certain rights, including the right to the presence and assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. \u201cMiranda </em>conditioned the admissibility at trial of any custodial confession on warning a suspect of his rights: failure to give the prescribed warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 608, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 2608, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), the Court \u201cestablished a second layer of prophylaxis for the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel[,]\u201d <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 2208, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991), holding that, \u201can accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ties until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. at 1885.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">Thus, the prophylactic protections that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings provide to counteract the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation and to \u201cpermit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self[-]incrimination,\u201d are implemented by the application of the <em>Edwards </em>corollary that if a suspect believes that he is not capable of undergoing such questioning without advice of counsel, then it is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the authorities\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d and not the purely voluntary choice of the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\"><em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 681, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 2098, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Only if the accused initiates further \u201ccommunication, exchanges, or conversations with the police,\u201d and only if those communications result in the accused changing his or her mind and freely and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel, may the police resume interrogation without violating the <em>Edwards </em>rule. <em>Roberson, </em>486 U.S. at 682, 108 S.Ct. at 2099.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In evaluating the admissibility of a statement under the <em>Edwards </em>rule, we apply a three-part analysis. First, the trial court must determine whether the accused</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cunequivocally\u201d invoked his or her right to counsel. Second, the trial court must determine whether the accused, rather than the authorities, initiated further discussions or meetings with the police. Third, if the accused did initiate further discussions or conversations with police, the trial court must then ascertain whether the accused knowingly and intelligently waived the previously invoked right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 527, 532, 507 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">Once an accused asserts his or her right to counsel, subsequent waiver of that right is not sufficient to make admissible any incriminating statements thereafter obtained, even if investigators have re-Mirandized the accused, unless the statements are initiated by the defendant and shown to be based on a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 531, 507 S.E.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>Request for Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We must consider the first prong of the <em>Edwards </em>analysis: whether appellant made an unequivocal request for counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The Commonwealth contends that appellant\u2019s first request for counsel \u201crelated solely to the issue of consent to search\u201d and that appellant\u2019s second request for counsel \u201cwas merely a restatement of his mother\u2019s advice.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that neither \u201ccomment\u201d would have been \u201cunderstood by a reasonable police officer under the circumstances to be a request to have counsel present during the interrogation.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u201c[Wlhether an accused \u2018clearly requested an attorney during a custodial interrogation is a mixed question of law and fact.\u2019\u201d <em>Medley v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 19, 30, 602 S.E.2d 411, 416 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>264 Va. 321, 326, 568 S.E.2d 695, 697 (2002) (plurality opinion)). \u201c \u2018The determination of what [the accused] actually said is a question of fact that we review only for clear error----Whether those words are sufficient to invoke the right to counsel is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 327, 568 S.E.2d at 698).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u201c[The Supreme] Court has consistently held that a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to counsel is necessary to invoke the <em>Edwards </em>rule.\u201d <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 266, 462 S.E.2d 112, 115 (1995). \u201c[A] suspect must state his desire to have counsel present with sufficient clarity that a reasonable police officer under the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for counsel.\u201d <em>Hilliard, </em>270 Va. at 49, 613 S.E.2d at 584 (citing <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2355, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994)). If, however, a suspect\u2019s reference to an attorney is either ambiguous or equivocal, such that a reasonable officer under the circumstances would only have understood that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking his right to counsel, the officer is not required to stop questioning the suspect. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2355, 2356; <em>Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 328-29, 568 S.E.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">At the outset of the interview, Investigator Hagerman asked appellant for consent to search his vehicle. Appellant responded, \u201cNah, I want a lawyer, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d In context, appellant clearly wanted an attorney before he was interrogated. Police officers told appellant he was being interviewed in connection with a breaking and entering. Further, nothing in appellant\u2019s first statement indicated that he wanted a lawyer only if the police were going to search his vehicle. Appellant denied consent to search his vehicle, and then he stated his request to have counsel present.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We find appellant\u2019s first request for counsel clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We hold that a reasonable officer under the circumstances would understand that appellant was invoking his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>Initiation of Discussion After Request for Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">As appellant asserted his right to counsel, we then turn to the second prong of the <em>Edwards </em>analysis: whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>police officers or appellant initiated farther discussions after appellant invoked his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>made clear that \u201c \u2018[i]f the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation <em>must cease </em>until an attorney is present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Gregory, </em>263 Va. 134, 146, 557 S.E.2d 715, 722 (2002) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 474, 86 S.Ct. at 1628). \u201cThe <em>Edwards </em>rule provides a \u2018relatively rigid requirement\u2019 that police and prosecutors must observe.\u201d <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 218, 221, 450 S.E.2d 403, 404 (1994) (quoting <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 718, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 2568, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979)). \u201c[T]he rigid rule [was fashioned to announce] that an accused\u2019s request for an attorney is <em>per se </em>an invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, requiring that all interrogation cease.\u201d <em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. at 719, 99 S.Ct. at 2569; <em>see also Gregory, </em>263 Va. at 147, 557 S.E.2d at 722 (\u201cThe prophylaxis of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>provides the right to have counsel present during interrogation as an additional safeguard in the exercise of the right against self-incrimination.\u201d). Thus, the rule in <em>\u201cEdwards </em>focuses on the state of mind of the suspect and not of the police.\u201d <em>Roberson, </em>486 U.S. at 687, 108 S.Ct. at 2101.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The facts in the instant case are markedly similar to those in <em>Hines, </em>19 Va.App. 218, 450 S.E.2d 403. There, detectives from two different jurisdictions were present in the interview room with Hines in order to question him about separate criminal offenses that had occurred in their respective cities. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 450 S.E.2d at 403. The Hampton detective read Hines his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and then began questioning him about a criminal offense in Hampton. <em>Id. </em>Hines became aggravated and stated that he wanted to return to his jail cell and to speak to his attorney. <em>Id. </em>In response, the Hampton detective said, \u201c \u2018All I wanted to know is whether you\u2019re going to be a witness or a defendant in the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Hines asked the detective what he meant by \u201cwitness,\u201d and the discussion between the two continued. <em>Id. </em>Hines made inculpatory statements regarding the Hampton offenses. <em>Id. A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Newport News detective was present in the room for this entire exchange. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">When the Hampton detective concluded his interview, he exited the room, leaving Hines with the Newport News detective. <em>Id. </em>The Newport News detective then asked Hines if he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Hines stated that he did. <em>Id. </em>Hines then made incriminating statements regarding the Newport News offenses, and these statements and offenses were the subject of the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 450 S.E.2d at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">After finding that Hines made a \u201cspecific and unambiguous request to consult with his lawyer,\u201d this Court analyzed the conversation that occurred after his request under the second prong of <em>Edwards. </em>This Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">[b]y asking Hines \u201cwhether [he was] going to be a witness or a defendant in the matter,\u201d the officer continued the conversation that he was bound to cease. This inquiry was a reinitiation of the dialogue that Hines sought to terminate____Thus, the ensuing \u201ccommunication, exchanges, or conversation with the police,\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485, 101 S.Ct. at 1885, was initiated by the police officer\u2019s further inquiry to Hines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\"><em>Hines, </em>19 Va.App. at 221, 450 S.E.2d at 404 (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In <em>Hines, </em>this Court did not evaluate whether the defendant\u2019s subsequent responses \u201creinitiated\u201d the conversation with police, nor did they parcel out the conversations between the two different detectives. Instead, this Court found that, \u201c[w]hen the officer continued the dialogue without first giving Hines access to his lawyer, the statements that he elicited did not follow upon a valid waiver of Hines\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 450 S.E.2d at 405. We ruled that Hines\u2019 statement to the Newport News detective should have been suppressed on those grounds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Here, as in <em>Hines, </em>despite appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel, the interview never ceased. Investigator Hagerman and Chief Marr continued questioning appellant as if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>request for counsel had never been made. Investigator Hagerman ignored appellant\u2019s initial request, saying, \u201cOkay. But, anyway----\u201d When appellant made a second statement referencing an attorney, Investigator Hagerman acknowledged that appellant sought to terminate the interview, saying, \u201cOkay, well, you don\u2019t have to talk to me. Let me talk to you now.\u201d Chief Marr was present during this entire exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Investigator Hagerman\u2019s continued inquiry was interrogation. \u201c[T]he term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v.

The <em>\u201cInnis </em>standard\u201d thus presents a question of law, \u201crequiring a determination whether an objective observer would view an officer\u2019s words or actions as designed to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Blain v.

Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 352 S.E.2d 352 (1987), appear to be factually analogous to the instant case. Both <em>Correll </em>and <em>Mundy </em>involve situations where, during the course of interrogation, a suspect requests counsel and police officers continue to question the suspect in complete disregard of this request. However, a closer reading of each case reveals legally significant distinctions between those cases and the one presently before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In <em>Mundy, </em>police officers were questioning Mundy at the police department about his involvement in a robbery and shooting. <em>Mundy, </em>11 Va.App. at 467, 390 S.E.2d at 528. During the initial interrogation, officers advised Mundy of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and Mundy made two requests for counsel. <em>Id. </em>Officers ignored these requests, and continued their interrogation without providing Mundy with an attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 468, 390 S.E.2d at 528. After making the first statement, where he confessed to participating in the robbery but denied any involvement in the shooting, Mundy was transferred to a different area of the building. <em>Id. </em>Three hours later, Mundy asked to speak with the officers again, and, after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Mundy made a second statement. <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>next day, while in court, Mundy expressed his desire to talk to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. <em>Id. </em>After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights again, Mundy made his third statement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">At the hearing on his motion to suppress his statements, Mundy argued only that he was coerced into making the three statements. <em>Id. </em>at 469, 390 S.E.2d at 529. As to the first statement, Mundy contended that officers denied him the use of the bathroom, resulting in his personal discomfort. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, Mundy maintained that the officers\u2019 refusal to provide him with an attorney at his request coerced him into making his first statement. <em>Id. </em>Further, Mundy argued that, because he had \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d in making the first statement, the coercion present in the first statement caused the second and third statements to be coerced. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth in <em>Mundy </em>conceded that the first statement was inadmissible, but denied that there was any coercion present when Mundy made any of the statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Mundy framed his argument to the trial court, and on appeal, under the third prong of the <em>Edwards </em>analysis, namely whether his waivers of his <em>Miranda </em>rights were voluntary. <em>Id. </em>Mundy did not contend that police officers reinitiated interrogation in violation of <em>Edwards; </em>indeed, an argument based on the third prong of the <em>Edwards </em>analysis <em>presumes </em>that the defendant reinitiated the interrogation. <em>Giles, </em>28 Va.App. at 532, 507 S.E.2d at 105 (\u201cThird, <em>if the accused did initiate further discussions or conversations with police, </em>the trial court must then ascertain whether the accused knowingly and intelligently waived the previously invoked right to counsel.\u201d (emphasis added)). In <em>Mundy, </em>this Court based its analysis solely on the arguments before the court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and evaluated Mundy\u2019s statements under the third prong of <em>Edwards. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Mundy, </em>11 Va.App. at 470, 390 S.E.2d at 529 (\u201cWe, therefore, must decide whether the waivers of the <em>Miranda </em>rights obtained before the two statements were knowingly and intelligently given.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In <em>Correll, </em>a Roanoke police officer questioned Correll following his arrest for robbery and murder. <em>Correll, </em>232 Va. at 460, 352 S.E.2d at 355. During that questioning, Correll requested counsel, \u201cbut said he could not afford to hire a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Correll did not consult with an attorney, \u201cbut discussions continued between Correll and the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Correll was questioned on the day of his arrest, as well as on the following day, but the statements Correll made on these days were not offered into evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>On the third day, Correll took a polygraph test and was returned to the jail in Franklin County. <em>Id. </em>There, he told a Franklin County police officer that he wanted to talk to him and to explain the polygraph results; this officer was unaware that Correll had requested an attorney when he was incarcerated in Roanoke. <em>Id. </em>The Franklin County officer read Correll the warnings under <em>Miranda, </em>and Correll waived his rights. <em>Id. </em>Correll then confessed to the crimes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On appeal, Correll never alleged that his request for counsel on the first day of interrogation was linked to any subsequent violations of his Fifth Amendment rights. Instead, Correll argued that his conversation with the Franklin County officer on the third day was \u201can extension of the interrogation that began that morning ... [with] a polygraph test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 352 S.E.2d at 357. However, the opinion contains no information about the circumstances surrounding Correll\u2019s polygraph test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the Court had only the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Franklin County police officer and Correll that indicated that Correll initiated the third interview. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 352 S.E.2d at 356. Based on the information before the Court on appeal, the Court held that Correll had initiated the third interview and proceeded to analyze whether Correll\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was knowing and voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 352 S.E.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Here, as in <em>Hines, </em>Investigator Hagerman and Chief Marr violated appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights by continuing to interrogate appellant after he invoked his right to counsel. <em>See McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 602, 607, 518 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s suppression motion because \u201cthe detective gained [the defendant\u2019s] confession by continuing the interrogation after [the defendant] had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel\u201d). Investigator Hagerman told appellant that someone had identified his car leaving the crime scene. Investigator Hagerman said that if appellant did not want to talk to him \u201cabout this,\u201d that appellant knew that he was \u201cin trouble right now.\u201d Investigator Hagerman stated that appellant\u2019s \u201conly hope\u201d was to confess, and mentioned appellant\u2019s probationer status. Investigator Hagerman questioned whether appellant\u2019s alibi would hold up, and inquired as to how he had any money when he was not working at the time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Then, as in <em>Hines, </em>Investigator Hagerman left appellant in the company of Chief Marr, who knew appellant prior to their interaction that day. Chief Marr was present during the entire exchange between Investigator Hagerman and appellant, and had heard appellant\u2019s request for counsel. Appellant had the opportunity to consider Investigator Hagerman\u2019s statements while he sat in silence for twenty minutes with Chief Marr. After a conversation with Chief Marr about appellant\u2019s family and after Chief Marr and Investigator Hagerman promised to \u201chelp\u201d appellant in the case, appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and made incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Appellant\u2019s incriminating statements were the direct result of Investigator Hagerman\u2019s continued interrogation of appellant after he invoked his right to counsel and the ensuing period of silence in the custody of Chief Marr. \u201c[I]f the accused has invoked his or her right to counsel and has remained in continuous custody, the statement is inadmissible unless the trial court finds that the statement was made at a meeting with the police that was initiated by the defendant or attended by his lawyer.\u201d <em>Quinn v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va. App. 702, 712, 492 S.E.2d 470, 475 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Since appellant was in the continuous custody of police officers from the time he first invoked his right to counsel until he made incriminating statements to Chief Marr, his confession to Chief Marr is presumed to be involuntary and is inadmissible at trial. <em>Gregory, </em>263 Va. at 148, 557 S.E.2d at 723. As in <em>Hines, </em>we need not address whether appellant\u2019s statement to Chief Marr that broke the period of silence \u201creinitiated\u201d a dialogue with police; Investigator Hagerman\u2019s continued interrogation of appellant after he invoked his right to counsel initiated the dialogue with appellant under the second prong of <em>Edwards.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Hines, </em>19 Va.App. at 222, 450 S.E.2d at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Because Investigator Hagerman failed to cease his questioning and interrogation of appellant after appellant made an unequivocal request for counsel, \u201cthe statements that he elicited did not follow upon a valid waiver of [appellant\u2019s] Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we find that appellant\u2019s statements should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We hold that appellant, while in police custody, made a clear and unequivocal request for counsel. Police officers did not cease their interrogation in honor of that request, violating appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. This violation tainted any subsequent confession made by appellant while he remained in the continuous custody of police officers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he made to the officers. Accordingly, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions and remand the case for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">. Although appellant noted an appeal to the revocation of his suspended sentence, he never challenged this revocation in his petition or in his brief on appeal. Therefore, this issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\">. The Hurt Police Department is located in the town hall building, and the interview with appellant occurred in the chamber of the town council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\">. The conversation between appellant and the police officers was recorded, and a transcript of that recording was entered into evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">. Chief Marr testified that he did not know exactly what appellant said that broke the silence, and appellant testified at the suppression hearing that appellant had said that he \"[didn\u2019t] want to go to jail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b100-11\">. Appellant, in his question presented, also argued that his statements were taken in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. However, appellant did not make any argument, nor did he cite to any authority, in support of his contention. As such, we do not consider this issue on appeal. Rule 5A:20(c); <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992) (\"Statements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit appellate consideration.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-12\">.

Because we find appellant's first request sufficient to invoke his right to counsel, we need not consider whether his second statement referring to an attorney was clear and unequivocal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">. In fact, the Court in <em>Mundy </em>could not consider whether the officers reinitiated the interrogation under the second prong of the <em>Edwards </em>analysis, as that argument was not presented to the trial court and was not before them on appeal. <em>See Belmer v.

It is of no consequence that appellant did not make any inculpatory statements during his first discussion with Investigator Hagerman. As the Supreme Court of Virginia observed in <em>Gregory, </em>\"it is not the fruits of the investigation that are at issue; rather, it is the coercive atmosphere of the custodial interrogation itself.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>263 Va. at 147-48, 557 S.E.2d at 723 (holding that the Court of Appeals erred in utilizing a harmless error analysis as to the defendant\u2019s first interrogation as nothing inculpatory came from that interrogation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">. Indeed, the analysis under <em>Edwards </em>presupposes that police will cease all interrogation after a suspect invokes his right to counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>When police do not cease interrogation, their statements constitute an \"initiation\" of further discussions with a suspect, and any incriminating statements gained during that discussion are deemed inadmissible. <em>Hines, </em>19 Va.App. at 221, 450 S.E.2d at 404. Explicitly, any consideration of whether a defendant \"re-initiated\u201d the dialogue with police necessarily presumes that police officers have stopped the interrogation upon a defendant\u2019s request for counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b113-11\">. We do not suggest that the taint of an <em>Edwards </em>violation can <em>never </em>be attenuated under any circumstances; however, it is clear from the case law that the circumstances here could not and did not dissipate the taint in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b113-8\">Kelsey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">This case illustrates well Justice Frankfurter\u2019s aphorism that \u201cthe right answer usually depends on putting the right question.\u201d <em>Estate of Rogers v. Helvering, </em>320 U.S. 410, 413, 64 S.Ct. 172, 174, 88 L.Ed. 134 (1943). I respectfully disagree that \u201cwe need not address whether appellant\u2019s statement to Chief Marr that broke the period of silence \u2018reinitiated\u2019 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>dialogue\u201d with Chief Marr. <em>Ante </em>at 68, 654 S.E.2d at 338. That seems to me the very question this case must answer. And the answer given by the trial judge, who heard from both Ferguson and Chief Marr on this subject, was that Ferguson\u2014after about 20 minutes of total silence\u2014reinitiated the dialogue. I agree with the trial court and would affirm its denial of Ferguson\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">To begin with, Ferguson does not argue (and I would not accept it if he did) that Chief Marr\u2019s unbroken silence was the functional equivalent of an interrogation. It would take a remarkably potent\u2014and, to date, unprecedented\u2014legal fiction to deem an utterly mute police officer as the functional equivalent of an interrogator. Police officers, after all, \u201cdo not interrogate a suspect simply by hoping that he will incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Mauro, </em>481 U.S. 520, 529, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 1937, 95 L.Ed.2d 458 (1987); <em>see also Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 453, 423 S.E.2d 360, 365 (1992). Nor is the \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d of being confined to an \u201cinterview room,\u201d by itself, the functional equivalent of a <em>Miranda </em>interrogation. <em>Gates v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 352, 356, 516 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1999). \u201c \u2018Interrogation,\u2019 as conceptualized in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300, 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690, 1691, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (rejecting an interpretation of <em>Miranda </em>\u201cequating \u2018subtle compulsion\u2019 with interrogation\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Kimbrough, </em>477 F.3d 144, 149-50 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">To his credit, Ferguson advances his argument on appeal along a far narrower path. Ferguson admits he \u201cdid speak first\u201d and thereby broke the long silence. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He does not claim his remark was <em>in reply </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>something Investigator Hagerman may have said prior to leaving the room. Instead, Ferguson contends only that his silence-breaking remark was simply not \u201ca request to waive his rights or to be interrogated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>My response to Ferguson\u2019s argument is equally simple: It does not have to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The prophylactic bar on further interrogation lifts away when \u201cthe accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Medley v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 19, 31, 602 S.E.2d 411, 416 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Gregory, </em>263 Va. 134, 146-47, 557 S.E.2d 715, 722 (2002), in turn quoting <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981)). The reinitiating remark by the suspect need not <em>itself </em>be an express waiver of the suspect\u2019s rights. It is enough that the remark evinces \u201ca willingness and a desire for a generalized discussion\u201d about the investigation. <em>Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 527, 535, 507 S.E.2d 102, 107 (1998) (quoting <em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 167, 174, 380 S.E.2d 12, 16 (1989), in turn quoting <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1045-46, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 2835, 77 L.Ed.2d 405 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Under this standard, \u201ca request for a drink of water or a request to use a telephone\u201d would not qualify as a reinitiating remark. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. at 1045, 103 S.Ct. at 2835. But any other kind of remark would qualify if it could be \u201cfairly said to represent a desire on the part of an accused to open up a more generalized discussion relating directly or indirectly to the investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So, an uninvited statement like \u201cWell what is going to happen to me now?\u201d constitutes a reinitiating remark. <em>Id. </em>at 1042, 103 S.Ct. at 2833. Similarly, a suspect\u2019s mere inquiry into \u201cwhat was going to happen to him\u201d would be enough to reinitiate a dialogue with police officers. <em>Harrison v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 576, 582-83, 423 S.E.2d 160, 164 (1992). When police officers hear such remarks, they have every right to confirm the suspect\u2019s true intentions and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>inquire whether he \u201chas changed his mind about speaking to them without an attorney.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>28 Va.App. at 535, 507 S.E.2d at 107 (quoting <em>Foster, </em>8 Va.App. at 174, 380 S.E.2d at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In short, Ferguson\u2019s argument on appeal\u2014that his silence-breaking remark did not constitute a \u201crequest to waive his rights or to be interrogated,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10\u2014assumes too much. Under settled principles, a reinitiating remark need not go that far. It need only express \u201ca willingness and a desire for a generalized discussion\u201d about the investigation. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. at 1045-46, 103 S.Ct. at 2835. Ferguson\u2019s uninvited remark, breaking a complete silence of about 20 minutes, fully satisfied this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">I also find no relevance in the assertion that Investigator Hagerman, prior to leaving Ferguson alone with Chief Marr, continued to question Ferguson after he invoked his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. <em>Ante </em>at 62-64, 67-69, 654 S.E.2d at 335, 337-338. The trial court <em>suppressed </em>all of Ferguson\u2019s answers to these questions. The trial court\u2019s suppression order fully remedied any ostensible violation of Ferguson\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights by Hagerman.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nothing in <em>Miranda </em>or any variant of the tainted-fruit doctrine requires the suppression of Ferguson\u2019s later confession given <em>after </em>he reinitiated a dialogue with Chief Marr and <em>after </em>he expressly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Sitting <em>en banc, </em>we have reaffirmed that \u201cthe <em>Miranda </em>case, though requiring suppression of admissions unlawfully obtained, does not require that subsequent statements or their fruits be discarded as inherently tainted.\u201d <em>Mundy v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 461, 473, 390 S.E.2d 525, 531, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>11 Va.App. 461, 399 S.E.2d 29 (1990) (adopting <em>en banc </em>\u201cthe reasons stated in the panel\u2019s majority opinion\u201d). Instead, <em>Mundy </em>explained, \u201cthe admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 390 S.E.2d at 532 (quoting <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985)). Thus, even in situations where an \u201cofficer\u2019s question during processing was improper interrogation,\u201d the fact that the suspect \u201cinitiated the later police contact eliminates any taint that might have arisen from the earlier questioning.\u201d <em>Savino v. Murray, </em>82 F.3d 593, 599-600 (4th Cir.1996) (rejecting habeas collateral attack of conviction upheld by <em>Savino v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 534, 391 S.E.2d 276 (1990)); <em>see also Height v. State, </em>281 Ga. 727, 642 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Properly framed, then, the issue we face \u201cis whether a statement made in violation of <em>Edwards </em>taints a subsequent confession not made in violation of <em>Edwards.\u201d See Howard v. Moore, </em>131 F.3d 399, 414 n. 16 (4th Cir.1997). Absent some evidence that the subsequent confession was truly involuntary\u2014and none is alleged here\u2014the answer is no.</p>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">. This fact alone distinguishes <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 218, 221, 450 S.E.2d 403, 404 (1994), which involved an <em>Edwards </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>violation followed by a conversation \u201cinitiated by the police officer\u2019s further inquiry\u201d directed to the suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">. I assume <em>arguendo </em>that Ferguson was in custody to the degree required by <em>Miranda, </em>that his request for counsel was clear and unequivocal, and that some (but not all) of Investigator Hagerman\u2019s questions after the invocation of counsel could be characterized as continued interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">. Reinitiation by <em>a suspect </em>can take place after an <em>Edwards </em>violation, even by a suspect held continuously in custody. <em>See Height v. State, </em>281 Ga. 727, 642 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2007) (holding that any \" \u2018taint\u2019 of the prior <em>Edwards </em>violation\u201d was overcome when the accused \u201cinitiated the further discussions with police leading to the statement in question, was re-apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in full, and signed a written waiver prior to giving his statement\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544, 565 (1997) (\"if the statement made after an <em>Edwards </em>violation is voluntary, 'the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made\u2019 \u201d citation omitted).
