And that the said defendant has, since he took possession of the said sawmill, used therein about one hundred and fifty thousand feet of logs and timber in running the said sawmill, and has used the sums realized from the lumber produced from said logs and timber for Ms own uses and purposes and has paid nothing to plaintiff on account of said logs or timber; that all of the representations of defendant made to plaintiff to induce him to place the said defendant in possession of the said sawmill and furnish him with the said logs and lumber to the effect that he could and would procure the money to. pay for the same within a reasonable time, were and are false and fraudulent, and were designedly, falsely, and fraudulently made by defendant to plaintiff, with the intention and for the purpose of inducing plaintiff,- and did induce plaintiff to place the defendant in the possession of said sawmill and permit the defendant to use the said logs and timber.\u201d There is a further allegation that defendant is wholly insolvent and is threatening and intends to remain in possession of said sawmill, and to cut and use the plaintiff\u2019s said timber to plaintiff\u2019s great damage and loss, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>defendant is now wrongfully and unlawfully, and without right, withholding the possession of said sawmill from the plaintiff. There was a demurrer to the complaint upon the ground \u201cthat said complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action against the defendant herein.\u201d The demurrer was overruled, and defendant declining to answer, judgment by default was entered for plaintiff, from which the appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> While the complaint is somewhat inartificially drawn, it is quite manifest that it states a cause of action, and that the general demurrer was properly overruled. Viewing the complaint in one aspect, we find the allegation of an agreement to sell on the part of plaintiff and to purchase by defendant a certain sawmill belonging to the former for they sum of five hundred dollars, and also certain logs and growing timber on the land of plaintiff for the consideration of one dollar per thousand feet; that the purchase price was to be paid within a reasonable time; that in pursuance of said agreement defendant took* possession of said property and has not paid any part of the purchase price. The only element of the agreement that is at all-uncertain is as to the time when the purchase price was to become due. It appears, however, that the agreement was entered into in January or February of 1918, and the action was commenced on August 29th of the same year. This period might very properly be determined by the court to constitute a reasonable time; in other words, the facts were sufficient for the court to conclude that the obligation to pay the purchase price had matured. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If there were any special considerations that would tend to rebut or to controvert this theory, it was incumbent upon the defendant to set them up in his answer. The question of \u201creasonable time\u201d is generally a question of fact and depends upon the circumstances of each particular case. <em>(Luckart </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>30 Cal. 547.) Again, the pleader has attempted to set up fraud, which would avoid the entire contract of sale and purchase. The facts are hardly alleged according to the accepted rules of pleading, but they are probably sufficient as against a general demurrer. Upon this theory the contract could be treated as entirely void and plaintiff could recover the possession of the property thus fraudulently obtained by defendant. In another view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>of the complaint it may be regarded as an action to prevent and enjoin a threatened injury to real property in the nature of waste. <em>(Hatton </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>4 Cal. App. 545, [88 Pac. 594].) At any rate, since there was no demurrer for uncertainty, we are satisfied that the ruling of the lower court was correct and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Ellison, P.
