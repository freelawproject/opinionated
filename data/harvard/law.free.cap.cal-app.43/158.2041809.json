As the defendant\u2019s default was not denied it would seem that this sole denial of the defendant for want of information and belief did not present a material issue. The plaintiffs, nevertheless, moved the court on July 3, 1916, to set the cause for trial. The defendant appeared in opposition to said motion by one of his attorneys of record, who announced in court that he intended to file an amended answer setting up fraud in the obtaining of said note. The court set the cause for trial on October 25,1916, in order to allow the defendant ample time to prepare, serve, and file said amended answer if he so desired. A few days before the said date of trial an assistant in the office of an attorney, who was not one of the attorneys of record for said defendant, made an effort to have the trial of the cause further postponed on the ground that his principal expected to be employed to try the cause on behalf of the defendant. This effort was unsuccessful. On the morning of October 25,1916, when the cause was called for trial, one of the attorneys of record for the defendant appeared to suggest that another of his attorneys of record could not be present, but had arranged with the above-mentioned attorney who was not of record to try the cause, and the latter could not do so because he was engaged in a trial in another court. The court\u2019s attention was then called to the fact that said last-named absent attorney was not an attorney of record in the case, and furthermore that no amended answer had ever been served or filed. The attorney of record for the defendant who was then present in court, and who had previously announced the defendant\u2019s purpose to present such an amended answer, made no statement or offer indicating that the defendant intended or desired to amend his pleading, whereupon the court set the cause peremptorily for trial for the hour of 1 o\u2019clock P. M. of said day. At said hour the aforesaid attorney not of record for the defendant was present to ask a further postponement of the case, which request the court refused to grant. The trial then proceeded, and after a witness for the plaintiff had been sworn, one of the attorneys of record appeared with an affidavit and amended answer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the defendant which he then asked leave to file. The affidavit presents no sufficient reason whatever as an excuse for the defendant\u2019s delay in presenting his amended answer, and the amended answer presents no sufficient averments of fraud in respect to the transaction in the course of which said note was executed by the defendant to constitute a defense thereto. The court, after an examination of said affidavit and answer, refused permission to the defendant to file the same and ordered the trial to proceed. The defendant presented no evidence upon the further hearing of the case, and judgment accordingly went for the plaintiff for the recovery of the full amount due upon the note, with counsel fees and costs. The defendant appealed to the supreme court, the notice of appeal being filed on November 15, 1916. The appellant\u2019s opening brief was filed February 16, 1917. The respondents\u2019 brief, filed March 19, 1917, directed attention to the foregoing facts as disclosed by this record, and urged that the appeal was frivolous and taken for delay. No reply brief on behalf of the appellant has ever been filed. The cause was transferred to this court for hearing on May 19, 1919, and was set for argument on August 11, 1919. No appearance was made by appellant on said date, and the cause was submitted without argument for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the merits of the case it is obvious that the trial court committed no error or abuse of discretion in refusing defendant leave to file his belated and insufficient amended answer; and it appears to us equally obvious that the whole procedure of the defendant herein, from the time of his first appearance in the case down to the present moment, has been marked with a deliberate design to delay the operations of justice in respect to the enforcement of his just and legal obligation, and to persist in and consummate such purpose by the taking and prosecution of a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The judgment is affirmed with the added penalty of five hundred dollars hereby imposed upon the appellant for the taking and prosecution of a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">[Waste, P.
