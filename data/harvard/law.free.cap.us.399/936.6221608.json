See <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>357 U. S. 449 (1958). Consequently, this case may well present important issues that ought to be decided, particularly if the result of the New York holding is that a worker must decide between a deeply felt belief that falls in the First Amendment area, and crucial unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Industrial Commissioner, if we are to place any weight on his response here, has shown that he considers the petitioner bound to accept a job tender even when his acceptance requires union membership that is repugnant to him. It may be that on plenary consideration we would conclude that the Constitution requires the respondent to provide employment that does not conflict with the worker\u2019s freedom of association, as might be indicated under <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U. S. 398 (1963). In that case we held unemployment benefits could not be denied because of refusal to accept employment that required a member of the Seventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Day Adventists to work on her Sabbath. See also <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>371 U. S. 415, 438 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I would grant the writ because I believe that the petitioner has presented a substantial question and possibly one of important constitutional dimensions that warrants plenary \u2014 not summary \u2014 consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
