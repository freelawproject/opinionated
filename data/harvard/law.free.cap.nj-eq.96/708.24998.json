I am unable to discern that the contract between the predecessor in title of complainant herein and defendant's predecessor in title touching the lane, railway station and siding, or the circumstance that complainant herein owns land on either side of and adjacent to the railroad right of way, in any way removes the fundamental objection that the purely legal rights in land asserted by complainant herein are doubtful and unsettled in this state, and that the injury threatened is not irreparable <em>in </em>its nature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b744-10\">\u201cI will advise an order sustaining the motion against the bill.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b744-11\"><em>Messrs.
