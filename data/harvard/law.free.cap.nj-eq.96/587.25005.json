I so consider it, and the contention therefore urged before me is out of this court\u2019s jurisdiction'. Nothing can be lost to the estate by awaiting the determination of the prerogative court, since the permanent <em>situs </em>of the former trustee in this jurisdiction subjects it with certainty to compliance with any decree which may be made against it; and no question is now made as to the solvency and financial ability of such trustee to respond to the requirements of any decree which the prerogative court may make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-5\">\u201cThis court intervened in this matter only for the purpose of supplying the estate with a new trustee in view of the expressed desire of the former trustee to resign from the further execution of the trust, and the desire of the present trustees, who are residuary legatees, to assume its obligations. That. situation having been dealt with by the former order entered herein appointing the present trustees, all future proceedings which the present trustees may deem necessary to the proper execution of their trust, when not involved in the pending appeal, must be presented to the judge of the orphans court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-6\">\u201cThe order to show cause will therefore'be discharged, without costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b624-7\"><em>Mr. Edward </em>Beam, <em>Mr. John G.
