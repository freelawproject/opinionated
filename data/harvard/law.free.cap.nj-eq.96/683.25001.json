He said that Mr. Mapes had offered to handle the association eggs on a basis of 3 per cent., or 1% cents a dozen for all eggs sold in New York City, and 1 cent a dozen for all those sold outside of Newi York. Mir. Mapes stated that so far as he was concerned he felt that they could make better arrangements at any time during the year they should be flee to accept, and that so far as he was concerned lie would be willing to handle the eggs without a contract. Motion was made that the association accept Mr. Mapes\u2019 offer of 1% cents :pier dozen for those outside of New York. Motion lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-9\">\u201c \u2018Motion was made that the association offer Mr. Mapes 1% cents per dozen for all eggs sold in New York, and % cent for all sales on the outside. Carried unanimously. President Whetsel and Mr. Ells were requested to inform Mr. Mapes of the association\u2019s action, and obtained his answer. President Whetsel reported as follows: Mr. Mapes had offered the services of the W. PI. Mapes Company to handle all eggs sold by the association whether they came to New York or were sold outside of New York for the first eight calendar months of the year at 1 cent per dozen; for the last four calendar months of the year the rate shall be 1% cents for all eggs sold in New York and 1 cent a dozen for those sold outside of New York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-10\">\u201cMoved and seconded that the offer of Mr. Mapes, as reported by President Whetsel, should be accepted. Carried unanimously. The secretary was requested to draw up an agreement with Mr. Mapes.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-11\">\u201cAt a special meeting held on April 8th, 1922, an election was held for the purpose of electing seven members of the board of directors to- fill vacancies caused by the resignation of the following directors from district No. 1: James Whetsel, Elmere Wene, B. S. Ells, John H. Weed, H. Tradelius, Fred G-illis, A. E. Spear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cOne of the most important arguments used in the securing of the membership agreement was that the corporation could for the members save the expense of a broker or middle man. The agreement provided that the association must not deduct more than, two cents per dozen for expenses of operating the association, any amount remaining nnused of that sum to he returned to the producer. An additional one-half cent per dozen could be deducted for the working fund, but producers to he given credit therefor. It was provided further in said agreement that the association may, in its clisoration, sell to hotels, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-5\">\u201cThe minutes of the board of directors of February 14th, 1922, are very illuminating as to complaints of members:</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-6\">\u201c \u2018We, the members of the New Jersey Poultry Producers\u2019 Association of the third district, feeling that the association is not accomplishing the aims for which it was organized, offer the following criticisms and recommendations to the board of directors of the association, feeling that these criticisms and recommendations will he received in the same spirit in which they are offered</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-7\">\u201c \u2018Briticisms\u2014We believe the payment to Mr. Mapes of from $15,000 to $25,000 per year to sell our eggs to the same trade we formerly sold to direct before the association was formed is an unnecessary expenditure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-8\">\u201c \u2018Wie do not believe Mr. Mapes should receive a commission for all eggs sold, regardless of whether eggs are sold by him or by the association direct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-9\">\u201c \u2018We believe that the salary of $4,800 per year paid to our general manager is exorbitant when considering his present duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-10\">\u201c \u2018We feel that the total expenses to the association of from $20,000 to $30,000 per year for salaries and commissions, plus expenses for candling, grading and packing the egg's, &amp;e.. is greater than necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-11\">\u201c \u2018We feel that no financial benefits come to the individual members of the association through the expenditure of this large sum of money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-12\">\u201c \u2018We feel that the eggs are not being graded uniformly, which causes direct loss to the individual members, and makes it impossible to make a reputation for the association\u2019s eggs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-13\">\u201c \u2018We feel that directors did not have the authority to order that candling be discontinued, as this is contrary to our by-laws. Paragraph No. 5, marketing agreement, specifically states: \u201cThe association shall pool the eggs of the producer with eggs of like grade and quality.\u201d Htow is the quality of an egg determined except by candling?</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201c \u2018And we further feel that the association as now conducted offers no inducements, from a financial standpoint, for poultrymen to become members of the association and to the members already in the association to continue to sell their eggs through it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-5\">\u201c \u2018Recommendations\u2014We recommend that all eggs be carefully candled and correctly graded, and graded, if possible, by mechanical moans to insure uniform grading at all packing houses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-6\">\u201c \u2018We recommend that all eggs be stamped with our trade-mark to identify them to consumers, as this will enable the association to create a real reputation for its product.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-7\">\u201c \u2018We recommend that the association hire a competent sales manager, who shall be solely in the employ of the association. One who has the ability and knowledge to sell to retail dealers. His salary to be, in part, on a commission basis in order to give \u00a1him an incentive to sell our eggs at the best price obtainable under existing marketing conditions. <em>It </em>might also be possible for the sales manager to have supervision over packing houses and the Trenton office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-8\">\u201c \u2018We recommend that a sales office in Hew York City be opened by a sales manager for the distribution of our eggs to the retail trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-9\">\u201cWe recommend that in seasons of over-production the association\u2019s eggs be stored in bonded cold storage warehouses in order to stabilize the market.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-10\">\u201cWe recommend that the total selling and grading costs be not over two cents per dozen, and we further recommend that an additional one cent per dozen be deducted. This money to be used solely for \u201cdirect to consumer\u201d advertising, in order to stimulate the sale of the association\u2019s eggs. This would make a total of three ceiits <em>per dozen </em>deducted for selling, grading, packing and advertising costs, but does not include cost of cases and transportation.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-11\">\u201cIt is proven and not disputed that Tradelius did not comply with the terms of the agreement signed by him, but from December 13th, 1921, did dispose of his. output of eggs to others than the complainant company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-12\">\u201cThe complainant prayed for a, preliminary injunction against the defendant, which was denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-13\">\u201cTradelius\u2019 successor as director was elected on April 8th, 1922, although his resignation was tender\u00e1 some tima prior thereto, and the last meeting of the directors at which he was present appears to he November 8th, 1921.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-14\">\u201cThe relief now prayed for is a decree for discovery and an accounting for the liquidated damages provided for in subdivision (c) of paragraph 18 of the agreement, which is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u201c \u2018Inasmuch as it is now and ever will be impracticable and extremely difficult to determine the actual damage resulting to the association should the producer fail to deliver to the association all of the eggs herein agreed to be delivered, the producer hereby agrees to pay to the association seven cents for each dozen eggs sold, consigned, delivered or marketed by or for him in violation of this agreement, as liquidated damages for the breach of this contract in that regard, all parties agreeing that this contract is one of a series dependent for its true value upon the adherence of each and all of the contracting parties to each and all of the said contracts.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-5\">\u201cThe answer filed sets np the following defenses:</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-6\">\u201c1. That the contract, which the complainant is seeking the specific performance of, was procured by misrepresentations and fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-7\">\u201c2. That complainant made breaches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-8\">\u201c3. That the contract is in restraint of trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-9\">\u201c4. That the contract is hard and oppressive and destitute of all equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-10\">\u201c5. That the contract lacks the mutuality of obligation as well as the mutuality of remedy, and is therefore unenforceable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-11\">\u201cIf the second point is found in favor of the defendant, it is unnecessary to consider any of the other points, raised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-12\">\u201cAn examination of the evidence is necessary to determine the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-13\">\u201cDid the complainant make such breach of ihe contract-on its part as to release the defendant from the obligation of it r</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-14\">\u201cThe evidence is convincing that the company did retain mote than two cents per dozen for expenses of operating the association.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-15\">\u201cSales were made through a sales agent or broker at great expense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-16\">\u201cThe complainant contends that it is and was authorized to do so, and to pay for same, by subdivision (c) of section 8 of tlie marketing agreement-.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-17\">\u201cIt is evident that this clause does not empower the sale to a broker, or the employment of a broker or middleman .[as such agent was called]. The association recognized this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>.statement, as since this suit was instituted this clause has been amended to include \u2018dealers/</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-5\">\u201cThe explanation of this section is\u2014-that hotels, restaurants and large users of eggs might be induced to- pay a premium for a higher class of goods than is usually found on the market, and that any additional expense in making such sales would bo more than offset by the premiums received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-6\">\u201cWith this explanation in mind, a sale to a broker at regular rates certainty could not be included in the terms of this section, even if its language was not clear, as it is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-7\">\u201cThis association was <em>to </em>grade and classify the eggs This was not properly done. It was admitted that grading was too severe in 1921.' It ceased candling the eggs, and sometimes candled only samples.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-8\">\u201cIt was also conclusively shown that the defendant received for his eggs an amount very much less than he would have received had he made sales in the general market.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-9\">\u201cAn examination of the returns made by the association to Tradelius shows payments by it in some instances of as high as seventeen cents per dozen less than the market quotations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-10\">\u201cFinancially, the association was in a precarious condition, and it was conducted in an unbusinesslike manner. Bach monthly report of the financial condition, made from October, 1921, to May, 1922, showed checks drawn in excess -of cash balances of from $870.77 to $11,136.63..</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-11\">\u201cThe report for September 10th, 1921, to. November 30th, 1921, showed a net loss in the Yineland district of $4,347.75, and a total net loss of the association of $4,996.83.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-12\">\u201cThe report of the advisory committee of the Toms Bive-r Local, No. 3, made at the request of the president of the association at a meeting of the board of directors held February 14th, 1922, while not evidential of the facts contained therein, is very illuminating as <em>to </em>the condition and conduct of the business of the association as recited above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-13\">\u201cIt will also be noticed that organization expenses were $8,574.92, as per the report in the minutes of the executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>committee meeting of December 16th, 1921. While as per the same report, the amount paid in for membership fees amounted to $4,440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-5\">\u201cWithout now further restating the testimony, I am satisfied that the complainant is not now in a position to obtain equitable relief against the defendant, unless he [the defendant] is estopped from setting up a claim that the contract has been rescinded or waived by his acquiescence or laches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-6\">\u201cWhile it is true that Tradelius was a director of the association and participated in manjr of the meetings of the directors, particularly in the contract with Mapes, concerning which he cannot be heard to complain, I am convinced that otherwise he is not barred from setting up the defenses claimed by him, and that the bill must be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-7\"><em>Mr. Loi\u00fas II.
