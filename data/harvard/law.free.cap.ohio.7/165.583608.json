It was a <em>scire </em>facias, reciting that, in the lifetime of E. Granger, the plaintiff recovered a joint judgment against Pierce, Granger, and Scovil which remained unsatisfied \u2014 reciting also the death of Granger, and the grant of administration to Goddard, and demanding that Goddard show cause why he should not be made a party to the judgment, and why execution should not issue against Goddard, as administrator, with Pierce as principal debtoi*. The defendants severed in their pleadings \u2014 Goddard pleaded that his testator was a security only in the original contract, and that, therefore, he was not liable to be charged jointly with the surviving principal. Pierce also pleaded that he was surety. To their pleas, the plaintiff dem urred, upon which arose the question adjourned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-9\">Goddard, in support of the demurrer, insisted that, in ease of a \u2022joint contract, if one of the parties die, the survivor only can be proceeded against, the executor or administrator of the deceased party being discharged from liability at law. 1 Chit. PL 39.

Converse, for the plaintiffs:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">In England, the heir is the representative of the realty of the-deceased defendant. In this state the executor or administrator is, <em>quoad </em>creditors, the representative of the realty, according to-the decision of this court. Piatt <em>v. </em>St. Clair\u2019s Heirs, 6 Ohio, 237; <em>vide </em>see. 29 of \u201c act defining duties of executors, etc.,\u201d 29 Ohio-Stat. 236.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">The <em>scire facias </em>in this state, therefore, must issue ^against the executor or administrator, and can not be brought against the-heirs. In the <em>scire facias </em>against heirs which <em>formerly </em>prevailed in-this state, this court has decided that the writ must contain a description of the lands sought to be charged. The writ in the case before the court contains no such description, nor is'it necessary that it should, being against the administrator. It is the <em>land </em>which descends to an heir that fixes his liability for the satisfaction of the judgment. In other words, it is the <em>land in his </em>hands, and <em>not </em>him<em>self as </em>heir, that is bound by the judgment. If <em>no land </em>descends to the heir, <em>no </em>judgment can be rendered against him. The writ against the heir must, therefore, show <em>something </em>in his hands to be charged, otherwise th\u00e9re is no grounds for a judgment against him. But it is otherwise with an administrator. He can not show that he has <em>no assets. </em>By our law, <em>flene administravit </em>is an immaterial plea. Abbot <em>v. </em>Cole, 5 Ohio, 87. It is not necessary to ascertain that there are <em>assets </em>in his hands, <em>before </em>judgment can be rendered against him as administrator, as it is <em>before </em>judgment can be rendered against the heir. It is not the fact that he has assets that fixes his liability, but that a debt or demand is due from the estate. Whether there be assets or not, the creditor is entitled to-judgment against the administrator. The question as to assets comes up in another form, and at another time, when the creditor seeks satisfaction of his judgment already obtained. It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>therefore, necessary to set forth the lands in the writ against an .administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-4\">But there is another, and, as we think, abetter and more correct view of the case, which settles the first question presented by the \u25a0demurrer. By section 69 of the practice act 29 Ohio, Stat. 71, it is provided \u201c that if in any such suit or action \u201d <em>(i. e., </em>such as do not .abate by the death of the parties), \u201c there be two or more plaintiffs,\u201d \u201cor defendants, and one or more of such plaintiffs or defendants, shall die before final judgment, such suit or action \u25a0shall not thereby abate, but the cause of action shall survive to the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs, and against the surviving \u25a0defendant or defendants, and such death being suggested on the , record, the suit, or action, shall proceed in the same manner as if \u25a0such death had not happened.\u201d And the law in force when the original suit was brought contained the same provision. 2 Chase\u2019s Ohio Stat. 966, ch. 384, sec. 70. And by section 70 of the practice act, 29 Stat. 71, it is provided, \u201c that after final judgment, the ^surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs may, by writ or writs of <em>\u25a0scire facias, </em>cause the executor or administrator of any such deceased defendant or defendants to be made parties to said judgment.\u201d 2 Chase\u2019s Ohio Stat. 966, ch. 384, sec. 70. This provision gives a <em>scire facias </em>when the death of one of several defendants happens <em>after </em>commencement of suit and <em>before </em>final judgment. The plaintiff may have a <em>scire facias </em>under this provision \u2022of the statute when the death takes place, while his demand is matter <em>in pais, </em>and the subject of litigation. The reason and equity \u2022of the case require that the plaintiff should have <em>at least </em>the same remedy when death takes place <em>after the </em>matter <em>in pais </em>is reduced to matter of record, and the subject of dispute between the parties forever put at rest by the solemn judgment of the court. Will not the law furnish a special <em>scire facias </em>in analogy to that furnished after the <em>elegit </em>was given, although the statute does not give, expressly, such writ? The objection to the- form of the execution \u2022on a judgment against some of the defendants in their own right, ,and others in their representative capacity, is put at rest by the \u25a0recognition of such execution by the statute, when it gives it where \u25a0the death happens <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">The second point raised by the demurrer- is, does the fact that \u25a0the deceased defendant was a surety in the judgment constitute a bar ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The relation of principal and surety ceases at law when judgment is rendered. After judgment, <em>all are principals.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-5\">C. C. Converse, for the plaintiffs:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">Section 26 of the act regulating judgments and executions, 29 Ohio Stat. 108, continues this relation after judgment for <em>one </em>pur* pose <em>only; </em>that is, for the purpose of first exhausting the property of the principal for the satisfaction of the judgment, before that of the surety shall be taken. As to <em>all other </em>purposes the defendants <em>are principals.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">The fact pleaded existed before judgment, and was then no answer to the original action ; and no fact which existed before the judgment can be pleaded to the <em>scire facias, </em>much less a fact which could not be pleaded in bar in the original suit. But it is said a court of chancery will give no relief when death of surety happens <em>after </em>judgment. This, however, is <em>not </em>a suit in chancery. But, in South Carolina, it is held, \u201cThough a bond be a joint bond, the obligors are bound *in- equity, so that on the death or insolvency of one of them, the other and his representatives are liable.\u201d Smith et al. <em>v. </em>Martin et al., 4 Des. Equity, 148. This court has said \u201c it would hesitate before it adopted the doctrine cited from 2 Was. 134; Hen <em>v. </em>Munf.\u201d Buell <em>v. </em>Cross, 4 Ohio, 330; Again, by reference to the charter of the plaintiffs, it will be seen that they are a <em>banking </em>company. 14- Ohio Stat. 298-300, secs. 7, 11, 13, 14. By the act in force at the time when the original suit was brought, it was enacted that if the bank should institute a separate action against drawer and indorser, no cost should be recovered ; although the contract was a <em>several </em>contract by the common law. 2 Chase\u2019s Ohio Stat. 1135, ch. 482, sec. 8. This court has said, in reference to this provision of the statute, that \u201c a court of chancery would probably be open to the complainants \u201d (a banking company against the administrator of a deceased surety), \u201c when they shall have exhausted their legal remedies, if a balance still remains due upon the judgment.\u201d Bank of Chillicothe <em>v. </em>Yoe, Adm\u2019r of McKay, 4 .Ohio, 125. The only operation, the fact that Granger, was a surety can have, is to authorize the court to direct the clerk to certify that fact on the record when the judgment is entered up.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-8\">Judge Collett</author>\n<p id=\"Amn-\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">At common law, when a judgment was rendered against two, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and one died before execution, the judgment was held to subsist as. several against the survivor. <em>No </em>process was recognized <em>to </em>maka the representatives of the deceased a party to the judgment. If the deceased was a surety, it was held that the defect in the law to charge him \u00abould not be aided in equity. Our legislature seem to-have considered these rules of decision as not in accordance with, justice. In this view they have made statutory provisions to supply the defects. By the practice act of 1816, it is provided that where there are two or more defendants and one or more die pending the action, it should proceed against the survivors ; and if the cause of action survived against the representatives of the deceased, they might be made parties to a final judgment when obtained by <em>scire facias. </em>This provision has in substance been ever since continued in force. We believe it changes the common law rule as well in respect to judgments ^rendered as to suits pending. It gives full remedy at law and embraces as well the case of sureties as of principals. All may be made defendants in one joint process, which is a safe and convenient mode of proceeding, introduced by legislative provision to expedite the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
