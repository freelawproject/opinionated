On that day, they forwarded 38 bales of shirting to the defendants, commission merchants in the city of New York, to be sold by them for the benefit of the drawers. On the same day, said Farnum &amp; Wright drew the bill declared on, and sent, per mail, an invoice of the goods, with notice of the said bill, to the defendants, who were domiciled in New York. On the same day, said Farnum &amp; Wright offered the said bill, indorsed in blank by Peter Farnum, one of the drawers, at the banking-house of the plaintiffs, for discount, stating all the foregoing facts, and assuring the plaintiffs that the bill would be duly honored. They had previously, at sundry times, drawn bills on the defendants, which had been discounted by the plaintiffs under the same circumstances, which the defendants had accepted and paid. Whereupon the plaintiffs discounted the bill declared on, of which $ 500 were paid to the drawers, and the balance was carried to their credit as a deposit. The next week, $500 more were paid to the drawers, as part of their said deposit. The balance has never been paid nor demanded; the drawers becoming bankrupts soon after the second payment, to wit, on the 10th or 12th of said March. On the 16th of said March, the plaintiffs, not knowing of the writing or the existence of the letter of acceptance hereafter mentioned, indorsed the bill, by their cashier, and transmitted it to a bank in New York, and that bank caused said bill to be protested for non-acceptance, and, at the maturity thereof, caused it to be protested for nonpayment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">On the 8th of March 1842, the defendants wrote the follow ing letter to the drawers: \u201cNew York, March 8th 1842, Messrs.

Because the bill in question was a foreign bill, (12 Pick. 483,) and that <em>St. </em>was intended to apply only to inland bills. The words are, \u201c no person within this State shall be charged,\u201d &amp;c. It would be mischievous to legislate so as to disturb the law merchant in other States. The English <em>St. </em>1 and 2 Geo. IV <em>c. </em>78, requiring an acceptance to be in writing on the bill, extends, in terms, only to inland bills. Such also is the true construction of the New York statute. 2d. Because, if that <em>St. </em>applies to foreign bills, it relates only to the evidence by which an acceptance is to be governed, or the remedy, or the time within which the remedy is to be sought; and all this is merely local, and does not touch the validity of the acceptance.

In Story on Bills, \u00a7\u00a7 158, 166, 167, fault is found with some of these decisions. But it is upon the gratuitous assumption, that by the understanding of the parties, a note, payable generally, is, by the law of the contract, payable where it is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>1 Met. 82, which may be relied on against this third position, it does not appear that the indorsee, whose rights were held to depend on the law of Illinois, was not a citizen of that State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">The acceptance now in question was not made in New York, but here ; so that the law of New York, whatever it is, does not apply. The acceptance by letter operated as such when it was received here. The defendants might have taken back the letter, which they sent to Providence to be mailed, oefore it reached the drawers. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>1 Dowl. &amp; Ryl 38, and 5 Barn. &amp; Aid. 474. <em>Bentinck </em>v. <em>Dorrien, </em>6 East, 199. Or the drawers might have refused to take that accept anee, and have insisted upon an acceptance on the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">The protest of the bill for non-acceptance, while the holders were not aware that it had been accepted, does not prevent their now insisting on the acceptance. Bayley on Bills, (2d Amer. ed.) 172, 183. <em>Fairlee </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>3 Bing. 625.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">The count on the promise to accept does not come within the New York statute, provided the plaintiffs relied on the promise. They negotiated the bill to a bank in New York for the purpose of presenting it for acceptance, and they relied on the letter for <em>payment </em>by the acceptors, though the letter was not seen by them before they discounted the bill. The difficulty,- if there be one, on this count, is that the promise was not made directly to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-9\"><em>Bacon, (Barton </em>was with him,) for the defendants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIs\">If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>letter distinguished the bill from all others, sufficiently to make it a binding acceptance, within the rule in 2 Met. 406 \u2014 which -is denied \u2014still it was not a promise to accept. When it appears, from the whole of a letter, that an acceptance was not intended, it will not be construed as an acceptance, though the word \u201c accept \u201d be used. <em>Musgrove </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>2 Stew. 464. See also 1 Stephens Nisi Prius, 827, 828. The letter, in this case, was an acknowledgment of having received advices, &amp;c. The goods had not been received ; and the drawees meant to say that if the goods should arrive, and things remained as they were, they <em>should accept. </em>They were advised of the drawing of the bill, but they were not requested to accept, and did not intend to accept, unless they should be in funds. And if their letter was an acceptance, as to the drawers, yet the plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of it, as they did not take the bill on the credit of the letter. <em>Miln </em>v. <em>Prest, 4 </em>Campb. 393. Neither the letter nor the bill shows (as was shown in <em>Carnegie </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>2 Met. 381) that the promise was intended for the benefit of a third party. See <em>McEvers </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>10 Johns. 214. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>15 Johns. 12. <em>Ontario Bank </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>12 Wend. 598. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>2 Story R. 213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">If the letter was a promise to accept, it was to accept in New York, and advance money on goods- consigned. If it was an acceptance, it was a promise to pay, and to pay in New York, where'the consignees resided; and such must have been the understanding of both parties. Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7317, 347. The contract, if any-, was made in New York, where the ultimate consent of the defendants was given ; and must be governed by the laws of that State. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>3 Met. 207.

Chit, on Bills, (6th ed.) 169, 170. Beawes Lex Hercatoria, as cited in 5 East, 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">The count on the promise to accept cannot be maintained. The promise was made, if at all, to the drawers, and the indorsees cannot sue for a breach of it. <em>Johnson </em>v. Collings, 1 East, 104. Chit, on Bills, (6th ed.) 169.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-6\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGk\">Upon the facts agreed, the general question is, whether there has been a valid acceptance of the bill declared on; and that depends on two other questions, which have been ably argued by the counsel. The first is, whether the contract of acceptance was made in this Commonwealth, or in the State of New York: The second is, whether the validity of the contract of acceptance is to be determined by the law here, or by the law of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The first question is, we think, settled by the principles laid down in <em>Carnegie </em>v. Morrison, 2 Met. 381. In that case, the defendants\u2019 agent in Boston contracted, in their behalf, with John Bradford, that they would accord a credit in his favor, on the usual terms and conditions, for the sum of \u00a33000 sterling. The letter of credit was forwarded to the plaintiffs, who were merchants in Gottenburg, requesting them to draw on the defendants, who were bankers in London, for that amount; which was accordingly done. That case, and another involving the same principles, were ably argued by counsel and fully considered by the court. It was decided that the letter of credit was a contract made in this State; and we consider that decision, and the principles laid down therein, as conclusive of the present question. If this case differs from that, the difference is more favorable t\u00f3 the defendants; for in that case the contract was to be performed in a foreign country, and in this, the defendants\u2019 contract was made and to be performed in New York. It was argued, for the plaintiffs, that the defendants\u2019 letter, promising to accept the bill, was not a completion of the contract, until it was received by the drawers, Farnum &amp; Wright. But we do notjso consider it. When the defendants agreed to their request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and put their letter in the mail, the contract, we think, was complete. If the defendants made any binding promise, it was made in New Fork, and to be performed there. A presentment of the bill for payment here would not have been a good presentment. If the validity of the contract is to be determined by the law of New York, it is clear that the defendants are not liable as acceptors. By the statute referred to, a promise to accept,- in a letter, or on any other paper than the bill itself, is not an acceptance, where the party has not taken the bill on the faith of such promise. And it is agreed that this bill was discounted by the plaintiffs without any knowledge of the letter of acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The second question to be decided is, whether the validity of the contract is to be determined by the <em>lex loci, </em>or the <em>lex fori, </em>and this question, we think, is clearly settled, although there have been conflicting decisions as to the revenue laws of a foreign State. But those decisions are distinguishable from cases of other contracts. They refer to contracts made in on 3 country, to be executed in contravention of the revenue laws of a foreign State, and not to contracts made in a foreign State, to carry on smuggling against its laws. Judge Story is of opinion that contracts of the latter description would be void every where, and his opinion seems to us to be founded on well established principles, and is only seemingly inconsistent with the doctrine that a court cannot take notice of the revenue laws of a foreign State. The cases in which this doctrine has been held were not founded on contracts made in contravention of its laws, and therefore are not inconsistent with the general principle, that a contract, void by. the law of the place where it is made, is void every where. Judge Story remarks, that this is as clearly settled as any thing can be; and we think the remark is fully supported by the authorities and well established principles. Story on Bills, &lt;\u00a7. 137, and Conflict of Laws, \u25a0\u00a7&gt; 242 In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>1 Met. 82, it was decided that a note made in Illinois and indorsed there, was a contract to be gov erned by the law of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We are therefore of opinion that the defendants are not by law iable as acceptors; and it is quite certain that the plaintiffs cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>maintain their action on the defendants\u2019 promise to accept. That is a chose in action, not negotiable or assignable, so as to enable the assignees to maintain an action In their own names.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
