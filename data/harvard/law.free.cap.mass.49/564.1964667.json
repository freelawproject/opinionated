It was also proved that, on the day when said notice was given, the supplies which the plaintiffs had furnished to the pauper amounted to $19-50 only; but that the pauper was, on that day, and for some time after, a continuing charge upon the plaintiffs, until the whole sum expended by them for his relief amounted to $66-33, on the 9th of April 1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-9\">The defendants contended that, if liable at all, they were liable only for $19-50, for the supplies furnished within three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>months next before they received notice, and that a new notice should have been given, in order to charge them with the supplies furnished subsequently to the first notice. But the court ruled otherwise, and instructed the jury accordingly, who found a verdict for the plaintiffs for the whole sum claimed by them. The defendants thereupon alleged exceptions to the said ruling and instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-5\"><em>Ward, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abp\">cited Rev. Sts. c. 46, \u00a7 13; <em>Inhabitants of Sidney </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Augusta, 12 </em>Mass. 316; <em>Inhabitants of Hallowell </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Harwich, </em>14 Mass. 186; and <em>Inhabitants of Walpole </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Hopkinton, </em>4 Pick. 358.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-6\"><em>N. J. Lord, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARh\">This precise question has never been directly decided ; but in <em>Inhabitants of Westfield </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Southwick, </em>17 Pick. 68, it was taken for granted that expenses were recoverable which were incurred after notice, and before any suit brought or any provision made by the defendants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-7\">Dewet, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">The cases cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel do not sustain the position assumed by him, that the recovery for expenses incurred in support of a pauper is to be limited to expenses incurred prior to the notice. The case of <em>Sidney </em>v. <em>Augusta, </em>12 Mass. 316, only applies to a case where, upon notice being given, the town that was liable for the support of the pauper had made provision for him, and assumed the liability. In such case, upon a subsequent necessity occurring for relief to the pauper, a further notice was held requisite. In <em>Hallowell </em>v. <em>Harwich, </em>14 Mass. 186, and <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Hopkinton, </em>4 Pick. 358, the question was that of the necessity of a new notice, in order to recover expenses accrued after suit brought; and it was held, that for any new cause of action, there must be a new notice, and that the claim for expenses incurred after action brought was a new cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The claim of the plaintiffs, therefore, for which they are enti tied to judgment, is not to be limited to the expenditures made before the date of the notice, but will embrace the whole sum demanded. <em>Exceptions overruled</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
