These admissions were made by said Beach after the dissolution of the partnership between him and the defendant Bowen, and were contained in a schedule of debts which said Beach filed before a master in chancery, on application for the benefit of the insolvent law of 1838. The counsel for Bowen objected to the reception of these admissions as evidence against him ; but the judge ruled that they should be received in evidence^ as well against said Bowen as said Beach, and they were received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>accordingly. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and said Bowen alleged exceptions to the said ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-5\"><em>Bacon, </em>for Bowen.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXo\">The draft, on the face of it, showed a debt due to the partners, and not from them ; and the admissions of one partner, after the dissolution of the partnership, are not admissible to charge the other. This was not the case of a closing of the concerns of the firm, but was, to all intents, the creating of a new debt by the admissions of one of the firm. This cannot be done by admissions made after the partnership was dissolved. The original debt must be proved by other evidence. The draft is not declared on, and of itself it proves no debt of the firm, or of either of the partners. Story on Part. \u00a7 324, <em>&amp; note.

It purports on its face to be so, and is conceded to have been such. The effect of the contract is controverted. \u25a0 It is denied that it creates any joint debt or liability. It is said that the acceptance of this draft by the plaintiff proves that he had funds of the drawers in his hands to pay the same. However this may be, and whether such acceptance does or does not, <em>prima facie </em>at least. import the having funds of the drawers adequate to meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>same when called for, it is quite certain that the draft which is the subject of controversy was a joint draft, drawn while the partnership existed, and this is all that is material in deciding the question of the competency of the admissions of one of the copartners. The partnership being proved by other testimony, and the contract being shown to have been made during the copartnership, and not barred by the statute of limitations, the admissions, made by one of the partners after the dissolution, in relation to such contract, are competent evidence. The case of <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>11 Pick. 400, is also to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
