Mr. Benjamin Mumford. Dear Sir: As it is your request that Mr. Tillinghast should have the notes renewed that you have against me, I write to you that I will renew the forty and twenty dollar notes, with interest, and the ninety dollar note, without the interest since given, to be paid not short of six years to come ; for there is no way open for me to pay, as I see now. You should have had every cent due you this last voyage that I made in the Roman, if I had got any where from seventy to ninety cents for the oil. As I got but fifty cents, my voyage amounted to but $800, and after my family\u2019s and my expenses were paid, and $ 100 for insurance on the voyage was paid, I had $37 left. But you shall have your pay, if I live and the whaling business don\u2019t fail. Grieves me to think I can\u2019t and couldn\u2019t pay you before. Now, if you will agree to do this, I will renew, or else you must do the next best. Yours, &amp;c. John Freeman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">The notes referred to in this letter are the notes in suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-7\"><em>Eliot, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5b\">cited <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Hall, 2 </em>Pick. 378; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>4 Pick. 110; and <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, 22 </em>Pick. 293.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-8\"><em>Colby, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH-\">cited <em>Wetzell </em>v. <em>Bussard, </em>11 Wheat. 309; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Bank of Columbia, </em>6 Pet. 92; and <em>Fries </em>v. <em>Boisselet, </em>9 S. &amp; R. 128.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-9\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AjS\">The acknowledgment and promise to renew the notes on certain terms were conditional, and the terms were not acceded to.
