The declaration contained a count for money had and received, and also a special count on said agreement. After the decease of said Seth, the present plaintiff took upon himself the prosecution of the suit, and the parties submitted the case to the court on the agreed statement which follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>On the 7th of June 1833, the defendants, being partners in business, under the firm of Edgarton, Priest, &amp; Co. gave the following promissory note to the plaintiff\u2019s testator: \u201c For value received, we promise to pay Seth Ramsdell, or order, one hundred dollars on demand with interest. Edgarton, Priest, &amp; Co.\u201d On the 24th of January 1834, the defendants, being insolvent, assigned their property to N. F. Cunningham &amp; I. Longley, in trust for the benefit of such of their creditors as should become parties to the assignment. In the instrument of assignment, the creditors who executed it fully released the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">On the 2d of July 1834, and within the time prescribed by said assignment for creditors to become parties thereto, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, at the request of Edgarton, one of the defendants, became a party to the assignment, by signing and sealing the same. And if it is competent for the plaintiff to prove the fact, it is to be taken as true that said testator executed the assignment, under the following circumstances : He</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">was not one of the preferred creditors, and he objected, for that reason, to signing the assignment, unless the defendants would give him a written engagement to pay his note, in case it should not be paid by the property assigned. To this the said Edgar-ton agreed, and thereupon said testator signed and sealed the assignment, and said Edgarton made and delivered to him the following writing: \u201cShirley, July 2d 1834. Whereas Seth</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">Ramsdell holds a note against us of <em>$ </em>100, dated June 7th 1833, which note of right ought to have been amongst .our preferred debts, but by mistake or accident was omitted, and placed on our other list of debts; now therefore, if, in the disposition and division of our property by our assignees, said note should not be paid in full, we hereby promise said Ramsdell to pay him the residue and remainder of said note, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">\u201c Edgarton, Priest &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">\u201c Witness: David Livermore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-10\">After the executing of said assignment by the defendants, they did no business as partners, except such business and action as above mentioned ; and there was no formal dissolution of the partnership, not any advertisement of the same, except what resulted from the facts herein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The said assignees have made more than one dividend amongst the defendants\u2019 creditors, but have not yet been able to close the business of the assignment. But apparently nothing will ever be received by the creditors who were not preferred; and so the said Seth Ramsdell was informed, in April 1841, by one of said assignees. Said Ramsdell then communicated this information to the defendant Edgarton, and requested payment of the note, or fulfilment of said written engagement ; but said Edgarton refused. Thereupon this action was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">When the aforesaid assignment was executed by said Rams-dell, and said written agreement made and delivered to him, Edgarton was the only one of the defendants who was present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">It was further agreed, by the parties, that the defendants should have the same benefit of the statute of limitations which they might have had on a trial by jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agv\">It is very clear, we think, that this action cannot be maintained on the note of June 7th 1833, because it is barred by the statute of limitations, and probably by the release contained in the assignment. And it seems equally clear, that assumpsit for money had and received would not lie, on the agreement of July 2d 1834, because it was a promise upon a condition or contingency ; and an action could be maintained on it, only by setting out the special promise, and averring the happening of the contingency. But as this would only go to the form of the action, we have considered it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">It is extremely doubtful whether Edgarton had authority, as a partner, to bind the defendants by the agreement of July 1834 : but it might require a more particular statement of facts, to decide whether the partnership still existed. But there is another point, which we think decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">It is found that this memorandum, promising to pay the balance of the debt in full, as far as the assigned property should fall short, was made as an inducement to the plaintiff to sign the assignment, and that he objected to signing it till this was done. If the memorandum could be considered as made before signing the assignment, then the obligation created by it would have been discharged by the general release contained in the assignment. But the true way is, to consider them as made at the same time, and the one act as the inducement to the other. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>is then precisely within the principle of <em>Case </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>15 Pick. 49. It was a secret agreement, made at the time of the assignment, and repugnant to its terms. By the assignment, the creditor professed to unite with other creditors in discharging the common debtor, on receiving an equal distribution of his property. This was wholly counteracted by the secret agreement. It was an unwarrantable coercion upon the debtor, and a fraud upon the other creditors, and so was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The cases cited for the plaintiff, where it has been held that an express promise to pay the balance of a debt discharged by an act of bankruptcy is a good foundation to support an action, have no application. They proceed on the ground that the debt thus discharged leaves a moral obligation, which is a good consideration for an express promise. The distinction is obvious. The discharge is past; and the conscious moral obligation is the real consideration for the express promise. Here the consideration for the promise is, that the creditor will execute a nominal and formal release, which may influence others, but which is intended to be counteracted by the agreement, so as to operate as no discharge of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">There can be no doubt that the evidence of the extraneous agreement, made at the time of the execution of the contract, was admissible. It is trae that parol evidence of what was done, at the execution of the assignment, would not be admissible to vary or alter its terms; but parol evidenc\u00e9 is always admissible to show that an instrument was obtained by fraud or duress, and so to avoid it; and for this purpose it is admitted in the present case.
