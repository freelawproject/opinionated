And, as a bill of discovery, it is ill. 1st. Because it does not allege that any action is pending or is intended to be brought, nor state for what purpose a discovery is sought. Story Eq. PI \u00a7317. <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>21 Pick. 361. 2d. The plaintiff proceeds, as administratrix, both for real and personal estate,, and has not stated enough to entitle her so to do. . 3d. No title of the plaintiff to the property, which is mentioned in the bill, is shown. Nor does it appear that there is no other mode ot obtaining the evidence which the plaintiff seeks. There is no distinct statement of facts, or description- of property. Story Eq. PI. \u00a7\u00a7.318, 319.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-9\"><em>Coffin, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAr\">The interests of the heirs and creditors of the intestate, and also the interest of his administratrix, are concerned, and the administratrix seeks a discovery, to enable her to administer the estate. As administratrix, she is trustee for the intestate\u2019s creditors, and for others entitled to his estate through her. She is a trustee, as well for the real estate as for the personal. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Cruft, </em>20 Pick. 321, 328. <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>9 Pick. 73. Rev. Sts. c. 71. Discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>will be granted, when it is sought by a trustee, to enable him tc perform his. trust, though it is not wanted to aid in a suit pending. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 121. See also <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Bluck, </em>and <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>1 Vern. 106, 399 and <em>note </em>(1.) <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Eq. Cas. Ab. 132, pl. 15. <em>Dulwich College </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Vern. 49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">The bill is sufficiently certain, the ship, notes, land and mortgage being sufficiently described therein. Story Eq. PI. \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28, 33, 37, 38. The plaintiff was unable to set out the sums, dates, &amp;c., because the papers, &amp;c. are in the defendants\u2019 possession. See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Plumptre, </em>3 Mad. R. 481. The defendants\u2019 objections to the bill are to mere matters of form, which are not the subject of <em>general </em>demurrer. Cooper Eq. PI. 118, 181. Story Eq. PI. \u00a7\u00a7 455, 528. If the defendants had demurred <em>ore tenus, </em>and pointed out the defect, the court would have granted leave to amend. <em>Durdant </em>v. <em>Bed-man, </em>I Vern. 78.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-6\">Hubbard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYm\">The court are of opinion that the demurrer to this bill ought to be sustained. The bill seeks a discovery as to the conveyance of certain real estate, alleged to have been conveyed to the defendants by means of their unjust and unfair practices upon the intestate. But the plaintiff does not set out, in her bill, that she has obtained license to sell said real estate for the payment of the debts of the deceased, nor does it even appear that the estate is needed for that purpose. She, consequently, can maintain no action for the recovery thereof; (Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>71, &lt;\u00a7&gt;&lt;\u00a7&gt; 12, 13;) and she has no right <em>to </em>enter upon the estate, nor has she any interest in or control over it, as such administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The plaintiff is not a trustee in regard to the real estate of the deceased, and no action could be maintained by her in regard to it, in aid of which, treating the present suit as a bill of discovery, the discovery, if made, could avail her; so that the case is not sustained by the principle maintained in <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Cruft, </em>20 Pick. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">If there were' no other objections to the bill, we should think the demurrer ought not to be sustained, as being too broad. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>should have been confined to that part of the bill which seeks a discovery as to the real estate. But we think the demurrer is good to the whole bill, as a bill of discovery merely, because it does not aver that any suit at law has been brought, or is intended to be brought, to the support or defence of which the discovery that is sought is material. Story Eq. PI. \u00a7\u00a7 318, 319. <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Slack, 21 </em>Pick. 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Again ; treating it as a bill for relief as well as discovery, it is bad, because no relief is prayed for in the bill. But we think the bill may be amended by a suitable prayer for relief, setting out more specifically the claims of the plaintiff\", as it respects the personal estate. See <em>Gibbens </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>8 Pick. 254. Or, if the plaintiff chooses to pursue her remedy at law, in regard to the personal estate, she can then amend and show such fact in her amended bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
