ORS 161.270; ORS 813.010. The trial court sentenced defendant to 21 months\u2019 incarceration on the felon in possession conviction. Pursuant to ORS 137.750, the court also ordered that defendant not be considered for sentence modifications on that sentence, other than sentence reductions under ORS 421.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the police officer who arrested him for DUII lacked objective probable cause to do so and that the trial court therefore erred in denying his motion to suppress the resulting evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject that argument without discussion. Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in denying him consideration for sentence modifications based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by him, in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000). He concedes that he failed to raise that issue below but urges us to address it as plain error. Our rejection of the same argument in State <em>v. Vigil, </em>197 Or App 407, 106 P3d 656, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>199 Or App 525, 112 P3d 441, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 156 (2005), is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> The trial court made that ruling in Case Number 035450FE. Defendant\u2019s DUII conviction in Case Number 031356MI is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
