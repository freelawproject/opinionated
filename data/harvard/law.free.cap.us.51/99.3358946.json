Wilson, Appellant, <em>v. </em>George A. Sandford and Robert G. Musgrove.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-10\">The seventeenth section of the act of 1836 gives the right of appeal to this court, when the sum in dispute is below the value of two thousand dollars, \u201c in all actions, suits, controversies on cases arising under any law of the United. States, granting or confirming to inventors the exclusive right to their inventions or discoveries,\u201d provided the court below shall deem it reasonable to allow the appeal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-11\">But a bill filed on the equity side of the Circuit Court to set-aside an assignment, \u2019 upon the ground that the assignee had not complied with the terms of the contract, is not one of these enumerated cases; and the value in dispute being less than two thousand dollars, this court has no jurisdiction over the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-12\">This was an appeal frpm the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-13\">The appellant had filed his bill in the court below, setting forth a patent to William Woodworth, dated December 27th, 1828, for a planing machine ; .also an extension,, in. 1842, of said patent for seven years, granted to William W. Woodworth, administrator of the patentee ; an assignment of all right and interest in said extended patent throughout the United States (except Vermont) to complainant, Wilson; and a license from Wilson to the defendants to use one machine upon payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of $ 1,400, as follows, viz. $ 250 .in cash, and the remainder in nine, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-foiir months, for which promissory notes were given, dated 23d April, 1845, one for \u00a1\u00a7 150, and four for $ 250 each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">The license was made an exhibit in the case, which, after setting forth the consideration of $ 1,400 above mentioned, and the promissory notes for part thereof, contained the follow-lowing provision: \u2014 \u201c And if said notes, of either of them, be not punctually paid upon the maturity thereof, then all and singular the rights hereby granted are to revert to the said Wilson, who shall be reinvested in 'the same 'manner as if this license had not been made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">. The first two of said notes were not paid when they fell due, payment having been demanded and refused before the filing \u2022of the bill. The bill further insisted, that the license was forfeited by the failure to pay the notes, and that the licensor was fully reinvested at law, and in equity, with all his original rights. That the defendants, nevertheless, were using the machine, and thus were infringing .the patent. Prayer for an injunction, <em>pendente </em>lite, for an account of profits since the forfeiture of the license, for a perpetual injunction, for a reinvestiture of title in'-complainant, and for other and further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">The defendants demurred to the whole bill, and also (saving their demurrer) answered the whole bill. They admitted all the facts alleged; and averred, on their part, that the contract set forth in the bill had been modified and varied by a new contract, which the complainant had broken, and that the respondent, being in the lawful use of a planing-machine at the expiration of the patent, had'the right to use such machine without license, apd consequently that the \u00bfotes were without consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">There was a general\u2019 replication, and the cause was heard first on bill and demurrer, and afterwards (the demurrer having been overruled) on bill, answer, and replication. Whereupon the bill was dismissed, with costs, and an appeal to this .court taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-9\">The cause was argued by Mr. <em>Seward, </em>for the appellant, no counsel appearing for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhY\">As, however, the appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the argument of Mr. Seward, which was wholly upon the merits, is not inserted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-10\">Mr. Chief Justice TANEY</author>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"A2ql\">The. bill in this case was filed by the appellant aghinst the appellees in the Circuit Court of the United States for the, District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The object of the bill was to set aside \u00e1 contract made by the appellant with the appellees, by-which he had granted them permission to use, or vend to others to be used, one. of Woodworth\u2019s planing-machines, in the cities of. New Orleans and Lafayette; and also to obtain an injunction against the further use of the machine, upon the ground that it was an infringement of his patent rights. The appellant states th\u00e1t he was the assignee of the monopoly in that district of country, and that the contract which he had made with -the appellees had been forfeited by their refusal to comply with its conditions. The license in question was sold for fourteen hundred dollars, a part of which, the bill admits, had been paid. The contract is exhibited with the bill, but it is not necessary-in this opinion to set out more, particularly its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The appellees derqurred to the bill, and at the final hearing the demurrer was sustained, and the bill dismissed. And the case is brought here by an appeal from that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The matter in controversy between'the parties arises upon this contract, and it does not appear that the sum in dispute exceeds two thousand dollars. On the contrary, the. bill and contract exhibited With it show that it is below that sum. An appeal, therefore, cannot be taken from the; decree of th\u00e9 Circuit Court, unless it is authorized by the last clause in the seventeenth section of the act of 1836.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The section referred to, after giving the right to a writ of error or appeal in cases arising under that law, in the. same manner and under the same circumstances as provided by law in other cases, adds the following provision: \u2014 \u201c And in all other cases in which the court shall deem it reasonable to allow the same.\u201d The words \u201cin all other cases\u201d evidently refer to .the description of cases provided for in th\u00e1t section, and where the ' matter in dispute is below two thousand dollars. In such suits, no appeal could be allowed, but for this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Th\u00e9 cases specified in the section in question are, \u201c all actions, suits, controversies on cases arising under any laW bf the United States, granting or confirming to inventors the exclusive right to their inventions or discoveries.\u201d The right of appeal to this court is confined to cases, of this description, when the sum in'dispute is belo.w two thousand dollars. And the peculiar privilege given to this, class of cases was intended to secure uniformity of decision in the construction\u2019 of the act. of Congress in relation to patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Now the dispute in' this case does not arise under any act of Congress; nor' does the decision depend upon the construction of any law in relation to patents. It arises out of the contract stated in the bill-; and there is no act of Congress pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>viding for or regulating contracts of this kind. The rights of the parties depend altogether upon common law and equity-principles. The object of the bill is to have this contract set aside and declared to be forfeited; and the prayer is, \u201c that the appellant\u2019s reinvestiture. of title, to the license granted to the appellees, by reason of the forfeiture of the' contract, may be sanctioned by the court,\u201d and for an injunction. But the injunction he asks for is to be the consequenc\u00e9 of the decree of the court sanctioning the forfeiture. He alleges no ground for an injunction unless the contract is set aside. And if the case made in the bill was a fit one for relief in equity, it is very clear that whether the contract ought to be declared forfeited or not, in a court of chancery, depended altogether upon the rules and principles of equity, and in no degree' whatever upon any act of Congress concerning patent rights. And whenever a contract is made in relation to them, which is not provided for and regulated by Congress, the parties, if any dispute aqises, stand upon the same ground with other litigants as to the right of appeal; and the decree of the Circuit Court cannot be revised here, unless the matter in dispute exceeds two thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">This appeal; therefore, must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">This cause came on to be. heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for .the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel; on consideration. whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that this cause be, and the same is hereby, dismissed for the .want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
