Brant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-5\">Where the Commissioners who acted under the act of Congress passed on the 3d of March, 1807, for the adjustment of land titles in Missouri, decided in favor of a claim, and issued a certificate accordingly, this decision settled two points \u00a1 namely, first, that the claimant was the proper person to receive the certificate,- and second, that the title so confirmed was better, than any other Spanish title.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-6\">But between the presentation and confirmation of the claim, the claimant had a property which was subject to seizure and sale under execution according to the then laws of Missouri; and the subsequent confirmation by the Commissioners will not destroy the title held under the sheriff\u2019s deed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-7\">Neither will a patent subsequently taken out under the title of the original claimant avoid the sheriff\u2019s deed:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-8\">The claim was. founded on a settlement for ten years prior to the 20th of December, 1803; and in such cases the decision of the Commissioners was final against the United States, and entitled the party to a patent, which gave a perfect legal title, and went back, by relation, tg the original presentation of the petition. It consequently enured to the benefit of the alienee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-9\">A patent .was required in' cases of final confirmations, <em>founded on settlement rights; </em>before its issuance the title was still equitable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-11\">The original claimant being .dead, a patent was afterwards issued to his representatives. But an act of Congress, passed on the 20th of May, 1836, declared that, in such cases, the title should enure to the benefit of the assignee. Upon this ground, also, the sheriff\u2019s deed conveyed a valid title in preference to an heir or devisee. The patent, when issued, conveyed, by virtue of this law, the legal title to the person who held the equitable title.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-12\">The circumstance, that the.sheriff\u2019s deed was not recorded, was o/ no consequence as between a party claiming under, that deed and the devisees of the original claimant; nor was it of any consequence as between the party claiming under that deed .and an assignee or those devisees, provided such assignee had notice of the existence of the de\u00e9d from the sheriff. And an open and notorious possession under that deed was a circumstance from which the jury might presume that the assignee had notice, not only of the fact of possession, but of the title under which it was held.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-13\">So, also, where the lands of the deceased debtor (the original claimant) were after-wards sold under a judgment against his executors (conformably to the laws of Missouri), and afterwards acquired by the same party who had purchased under the first sheriff\u2019s sale, a refusal'of the court below to instruct the jury that this sale was void, was correct.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-14\">In error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Missouri.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-15\">Isaac Landes, a citizen of Kentucky, brought an action of ejectment in the court below, at the' October term of 1845, against Joshua -B.

The court refused to instruct the jury that the deed from the sheriff was void for uncertainty in the description of the property. It is a sale under execution. Hart <em>v. </em>Rector, 7 Mo.

The plaintiff\u2019s ninth and defendant\u2019s second instructions relate to the second record, judgment, execution, and sheriff\u2019s sale. The plaintiff submits there is error in these instructions, as also in the refusal to give the instructions refused. An exception was reserved to this deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">1st. It was a suit and judgment against an executor, \u201c and that fib have his execution against the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, which were of said Jacques Clamorgan,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\">The execution follows the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-9\">Although the judgment may be simply erroneous, and therefore not now to be called in question, it can not/justify the-execution. The Revised Code of Missouri, 1825, p. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 49,50, provides for the classification of debts, and, p. 563, for the classification or marshalling of the assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-10\">The personal estate should have been first subjected. Gantly\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Ewing, 3 Howard, 707 ; 1 Blackf. 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-11\">2d. If the execution was properly issued, the deed did not describe the property with reasonable; certainty. No deed from Gabriel Dodier to Clamorgan is shown to help out the defective description, nor was there in fact any such deed. See cases above. Besides, the land had then been'laid off, divided into-blocks and squares, and.lots, and-streets and alleys, and the description was wholly delusive'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-12\">3d. The property sold for $ 33 to satisfy $ 27.88, leaving a surplus of $ 5.12. The property was worth $ 10,000, if free from encumbrance. It was capable of division, and was, in fact, divided. It was evidently, taken in connection with the previous sale under another execution, intended to get up all. the interests of all Glamorgan\u2019s heirs in all his property within the jurisdiction of the court. Taking all the circumstances together, it was strong evidence of fraud, and ought to have been, left to the jury on that ground. Tiernan <em>v. </em>Wilson, 6 Johns.. Ch. 417 ; 4 Cranch, 403; 18 Johns. R. 362; 6 Wend. 522 ; 3 Black. 376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-13\">Fourth Point. The instruction granted by the court, as to adverse possession, left to the jury a mixed question of law and fact. The plaintiff submits that it is erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>1st. Because it submitted to the jury to find whether the possession was adverse, without qualification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">The defendant claimed under the two sheriff\u2019s deeds. If those deeds were void, no length of time would create an adverse possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">A sheriff\u2019s deed which is void for want of jurisdiction in the court under whose judgment the sale took place, is not such a conveyance as that a possession under it will be protected by the statute of limitations. Walker <em>v. </em>Turner, 9 Wheat. 541\u2014551; Powell\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Harman, 2 Peters, 241; Hoskins <em>v. </em>Helm, 4 Litt. 310; Brooks <em>v. </em>Marbury, 11 Wheat. 90; 9 Johns. 167 ; 1 Johns. 157.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">2d. The deed from Sheriff Walker to O\u2019Fallon and Lindell is within twenty years of the bringing of the suit. By claiming under that deed, the defendant is estopped to deny that the title was then in the heirs of Clamorgan. 14 Johns. 225, and note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">The court had previously ruled these deeds to be good. If they were void, no adverse possession could arise. Yet the whole question of adverse possession was left to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-9\">Adverse possession is a legal idea, admits of a legal definition, of legal distinctions, and is therefore correctly laid down to be a question of law. Bradstead <em>v. </em>Huntington, 5 Peters, 402, 438.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">The judge did not define the legal properties necessary to constitute an adverse possession, and the facts.'stated in his instruction do not of themselves constitute such adverse possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-11\">3d. The statute of limitations of Missouri cannot avail the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-12\">1. The deed of 10th August, 1826, admits the title of plaintiff\u2019s ancestor, and there is no proof of actual adverse possession for twenty years before, and continuously down to suit brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-13\">2. Louis and Henry Clamorgan, under whom the plaintiff claims, are within the saving of the statute of 1818. Territorial Laws, 598.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-14\">Finally. The plaintiff maintains, that, although there may have been an equitable title in the defendant, and under the statutes of Missouri an action of ejectment may be maintained on an equitable title in that State, yet such-title cannot prevail against the leg\u00e1l title. It is conceded that the legal title is in the plaintiff, and it is insisted by defendant that it is held in trust for him. This is an implied trust. If it exists at all, it arises from some wrongful act of the plaintiff, or those under whom' he claims. But it is begging the question to say the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>act was wrongful, and must enure to the. benefit of defendant. It was the object of the commission to settle the rights of conflicting claimants. It was entirely within the power of McNair or Connor to have brought this question before them. The transactions were then fresh, and no difficulty would have occurred in adjusting any controversy, between them. On these grounds, effect is given to the confirmation to pass the legal title. A conclusive effect is necessarily given to such confirmation, unless it be in cases of fraud and wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">If there be an equity in those claiming under the said judgments, it cannot prevail in a court of law as against the legal title\"; and the substance of the instructions, given by the court is, it is respectfully submitted, wrong in that particular. Chouteau <em>v. </em>Eckhart, 2 Howard, 375; Hickey <em>v. </em>Stewart, 3 Howard, 750; U. States <em>v. </em>King, 3 Howard, 787; Les Bois <em>v. </em>Bramell, 4 Howard, 449.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Gamble, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">Clamorgan had filed his claim with the Recorder of Land Titles, and the same was pending before the Board of Commissioners, prior to the year 1808. . The fifth section of the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1807 (2 Stat. at Large, 440), had limited the time for the exhibition of claims to the 1st of July, 1808. There was no mode provided by law for substituting for the claimant an heir, devisee, or assignee, who had acquired the right of the claimant after, his claim was filed. Clamorgan claimed to be the legal representative of Gabriel Dodier, by purchase from Esther, who purchased from Brazeati, who purchased from Dodier, the original grantee. In July, 1808, the sheriff, under execution, sold the interest of Clamorgan in the land, and executed his deed to McNair, the purchaser. The thing itself, so filed, in which Clamorgan claimed an interest, whilst it was <em>sub judice, </em>was sold; and his interest, as it then existed, was sold, namely, a Spanish claim which had been- filed. The sheriff\u2019s deed is declared by the law under which it was made to be effectual \u201c to pass to the purchaser all the estate and interest which the debtor had, or might lawfully part with, in the land, at the time the judgment was obtained.\u201d Edwards\u2019s Territorial Laws, p. 121, \u00a7 45. The purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale held a conveyance which was as operative to pass Glamorgan\u2019s interest in the land, as any instrument which Clamorgan himself could have made. He was by that deed constituted the sole representative of Gabriel Dodier, the original grantee of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">As to the objection of want of an appearance, the Supreme Court of Missouri have decided that hardly any state of cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cumstances would justify them to set aside a sheriff\u2019s sale, where possession had followed the deed. Tindell <em>v. </em>Bank, 4 Mo. R. 228; Landis <em>v. </em>Perkins, 12 Mo. R. 254; Day <em>v. </em>Kerr, 7 Mo. R. 426. It is then the settled law of Missouri, that, under the recital contained in this judgment, the defendant will be held to have appeared. No matter whether Glamorgan was in \u2019Mexico or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">If we look to the practice under the Spanish authorities, and since, we shall find that these claims were not a contingent interest separate from the estate, (as was the case in Blanchard <em>v. </em>Brooks, 12 Pick. 52,) but were a present existing interest in the land, and were susceptible of transfer and every form of conveyance. And in whatever form the claimant\u2019s interest was conveyed, his claim to the confirmation was conveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">It is said that the purchaser should have filed his sheriff\u2019s deed with the Board, and claimed the confirmation to himself. But this could not be done. The law limited the time within which claims could be filed. That time had passed before this sale was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-7\">The patent which conveyed the legal title, being issued in the name of Glamorgan, who was then dead, passed the legal title to the person who was then the holder of the equitable title previously in Glamorgan, and the purchaser of that equitable title would take the legal title, under the patent, in preference to a devisee of Glamorgan. 5 Stat. at Large, 31; Act of 3d March, 1807 (2 Stat. at Large, 440).</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">The language of the Commissioners has probably induced misapprehension. They \u201cgrant,\u201d &amp;c., although they had no power to grant. The acts of Congress make the grant, and the Commissioners were only to ascertain, by rules of evidence,, whether the claim was a valid one, according to the laws of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-9\">The language, then, which may be employed by.the Board, does not, in any manner, affect the. operation of the confirmation. If the words in this case had been, \u201cthe claim filed by Jacques Glamorgan is confirmed,\u201d or, \u201c the Board are of opinion that the claim filed by Jacques Glamorgan is a valid claim,\u201d the effect would have been precisely the same as is produced by the language actually employed, \u201c the Board grant to Jacques Glamorgan,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-10\">The doctrine of relation applies here with all its force., The Commissioners act upon the claim as filed. They act upon it as it was when filed. The Commissioners in this case having to decide upon claims throughout what is now Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin, the adjudication would necessarily be long delayed, and would present just such' a case as would make the doctrine of relation applicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>A judgment relates to the first day of the term at which it4s rendered.

How can that be inquired into collaterally in the case of a sheriff\u2019s sale ? What has th\u00e9 purchaser to do with the question wkether the sheriff has made proper search for goods and chattels before he sells the land ? There is no <em>evidence </em>here that there was any personalty at all. The objection is raised merely from the form of the precept.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\">It was objected to the instruction as to possession, that the court ruled, that from open and notorious possession, \u201c connected with other circumstances,\u201d the jury might, infer that the plaintiff had notice, &amp;c. In Missouri, circumstances are considered sufficient to prove actual notice. Before .a jury it would be competent to contend that circumstances made out a case of notice. Possession is one circumstance. A list made out in Glamorgan\u2019s handwriting (this lot being omitted) is another. And so on. The gist of the instruction was, that the jury might find from circumstances that the plaintiff had actual notice; not that the circumstances detailed were proof of notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">A questiori was made in the court below in relation to the sufficiency of the description contained in the sheriff\u2019s deed to McNair. The plaintiff contended that the deed was void for uncertainty, and objected to its being admitted in evidence, and afterwards moved for instructions to the jury to the same effect. In the fourth instruction, the court was asked to declare, as a master of law, that the deed was void. This instruction the court very properly refused, as it required the court to pass upon all the facts in evidence before the jury, relating to the description contained in the deed. The thirteenth- instruction, which applies to the same subject, was refused by the court in the form in which it was asked, but in lieu of it the court instructed the jury, \u201c.that it was their duty to find whether the land <em>described </em>in the sheriff\u2019s \u2022 deed is the land in dispute in this action, and the'same land that was confirmed to Glamorgan, and if the land in dispute is not the same land conveyed by the sheriff\u2019s deed, and confirmed as aforesaid, then said deed cannot furnish a defence to this defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-8\">This instruction' refers the question to-the jury, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>description in the sheriff\u2019s deed covers the land in dispute. They are to take the deed with'its description, and all the evidence describing the land in dispute, and to determine whether the description in the deed embraces the land in controversy. The Supreme Court of Missouri, in the case of Landis <em>v. </em>Perkins, 12 Mo. Rep. 260, say: \u201c Whether the description of the premises sold was sufficient, would depend Upon extrinsic circumstances. If the lot was known by the description given, the sale would be valid, according to the principles settled in the case of Hart <em>v. </em>Rector, 7 Mo. Rep., and parol evidence was admissible to establish that fact.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">The Circuit Court, undoubtedly, gave the proper instruction, to direct the attention of the jury to the question of fact upon which the validity of the deed depended, and very properly refused to instruct the jury that this deed was void for uncertainty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">If it were necessary to cite authorities to show that descriptions, as general as that used in this deed, have been held to be sufficient, I would refer the court to 4 Dev. &amp; Bat. 414; 1 Humphreys, 80 ; 3 Yerger, 171; 7 Yerger, 490; 8 Gill &amp; Johns. 349 ; 2 N.

In the former case, if the deed under which the claim is set up is void, it nevertheless admits the title of the other. That is the case here. If we show that the deeds of the sheriff are void, they purporting to convey Glamorgan\u2019s title, do we not thereby confirm as against them the title under which they claim ? Is it not an admission that our title is good, unless it has been divested by the machinery on which they rely ? The cases cited show that possession under' a void deed is a possession consistent with, and subordinate to, the title of the true owner, and can never give rise to an adverse title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-9\">Now as to what passed by the sheriff\u2019s deeds, I maintain that nothing passed but the naked possessory title; \u2014 All the estate and interest which the debtor had, or might lawfully part with, in the land, at the time the judgment was obtained.\u201d See Edwards\u2019s Ter. Laws, p. 121, \u00a7 45. Now what had Clamorgan at that time which he \u201c might lawfully part with \u201d in this land ? I do not ask to what he might by proper covenants bind himself. But what had he which could have passed by a mere quitclaim deed <em>1</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-10\">He had then an equitable interest in the land, which is said</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>to ha\\e been the subject of seizure and sale. He had, also, a claim pending before the Board of Commissioners, for' a confirmation of that interest, so as to create in him a legal estate. Was that, also, the subject of seizure and sale ? Would that pass by a quitclaim deed ? The claim was before the Board. It is said the time for filing claims had passed. Was there airy thing to prevent the assignee, if he were such, from filing his assignment made subsequent to the filing of that claim ? Clearly he might have done so. Clamorgan was there. His was a mere possessory title, with an inchoate right to the legal estate. His possessory right was the subject of seizure and sale. It was a valuable thing, and, unless some one else procured the legal estate, it might be perfected.. The means of perfecting it were within his reach. The law of this court is, that however, strong the possessory right, however clear the equity, a grant or confirmation to a stranger claiming the land would have passed the legal estate to such stranger. There was, then, every motive to induce him to present his claim to a confirmation, if he had one, and it might then have been decided, when every thing was fresh, and the parties on the spot. The law provided for legal representatives, and embraced as well those who were assignees before, as after, the claim filed. It was confirmed to Clamorgan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnZQ\">It is supposed the legal title enured to the benefit of the intermediate assignee of Clamorgan, that is, to the forced assignee, after the claim filed. Upon what principle ? Was Clamorgan bound by any legal or moral obligation to perfect the title ? The sh\u00e9riff had sold his possession; no more. Illustrations ar\u00e9 drawn from the law of relation, which is supposed to be clearly expounded in the books, and cases are put forth to show its operation; a deed executed in performance of an agreement, a judgment, a sheriff\u2019s deed, the acknowledgment of a deed, are put; to which may be added the case of Graham <em>v. </em>Graham, 1 Ves. jr. 275, and Garnons <em>v. </em>Knight, 8 Dowl. &amp; Ryl. 348. In these and like cases, where a man, by his own voluntary act, has passed an imperfect title to another for a full consideration, and afterwards seeks to transfer the property to another, or that interest is sought to be subjected by process to his debts, or he has, after a full consideration received, or under covenant, received a good title, in such case, the law, to prevent injustice, interposes, and by relation secures the title to the first vendee. But there is a wide distinction between voluntary and compulsory acts, between a naked quitclaim and a covenant for title, between a mere right to present possession and enjoyment and an absolute estate in fee. In the case of a naked quitclaim, an after-acquired title will never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>relate back, so as to vest in the vendee of the quitclaim. 1 Cow. 613. Nor would any court tolerate for a moment, that a squatter who has the bare possession, and sells that, should be debarred from acquiring for himself the absolute estate in fee. And there is a substantial reason for this distinction. He who buys an imperfect title pays a proportionate price for it. He has no right to look to his vendor to complete it. He takes it for what it is worth ; no more. I admit that the same rule of relation applies to sheriff\u2019s deeds, and to others acting in a fiduciary or executive capacity, where the title to' the property has passed by the sale, and the de.ed is a mere formal execution of the power. In some States, Maryland, for instance, the deed from the sheriff is not necessary, nor is it in eases of chancery sales; and when executed, it relates back to the time of the sale. But what does it convey? Has it ever been supposed to carry with it any thing more than the actual title or interest which the party had at the time of such sale ? If this rule prevails as between vendor and vendee, where they deal together, and treat of the actual right or possession, the thing <em>in esse </em>not <em>in posse, </em>it should apply with still greater force to a case where the sale is wholly <em>in invitum. </em>The policy of the law and the rules of courts are much more stringent in such cases than' in those where the parties act voluntarily.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">Here the whole proceeding against Glamorgan was compulsory. He had an interest which could be taken in execution. The confirmation was most uncertain, at best. The claim was not appraised. It was not in. any manner referred to. The purchaser was bound to know that he was buying but a naked possession, and he must, of course, have regulated his price by that. There was, then, no foundation even for equity to interpose to compel a deed from Glamorgan. And will it be pretended, that courts of law will make a deed enure by relation,. when equity would not interpose to compel the party to make it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">The great questions in this case are as to the effect of the confirmation and patent; whether or not the confirmation and patent enure to the purchasers at the sheriff\u2019s sale, or, the deeds of the sheriff being void,, whether the title does not subsist in the heirs and devisees -of C\u00cdamorgan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\">The cases cited from the fourth and sixth volumes of the Missouri Reports differ from this. In the first there was process served and an appearance by attorney. In the last there was service of process on one of the defendants. Here' there was no service of process; no appearance;</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">But it is thought the def\u00e9cts are cured by the- entry, that \u201c the parties come by their attorneys,\u201d &amp;c., and the record is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>not to be contradicted; it. binds parties and privies, is a solemn judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, .final and conclusive until reversed. If it is a record, it must stand or fall by itself. It does not require the aid of the maxim cited for its support. But is it a record, and as such entitled to conclusive force ? The judgment begins with <em>\u201c </em>Therefore it is considered,\u201d &amp;c. The rest is recital. No court can have jurisdiction except under, certain statutes, unless the defendant is before it. On the return of process, an attorney may appear if the defendant is in court, -b,ut I know no case in which an attorney has been allowed to appear <em>suo motu, </em>unless the party was in court. There must be an authority, clear and explicit, naming the attorney, or there must be a party in court under process. Here there is neither. It is a mockery of justice, not error, but absolutely void, to allow a voluntary appearance by attorney without any authority of record, or the presence of the party in court. There is nothing in the whole proceedings from which it can be inferred that the defendant had notice, actual or constructive, of this proceeding, and without this the judgment is a nullity. See the cases on the brief, and also Buckmaster <em>v. </em>Carlin, 3 Scam. 104, and Crane <em>v. </em>French, 1 Wend. 312. A case in 6 Miss. 50, and one in 7 Miss. 426, are relied on to show that such a recital binds the parties. But these cases, if they are in conflict with, are clearly overruled by, 7 Miss. 465. If the rule is so inflexible, it would - never be in the power of the defendant to show that he had no notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">Nor does the maxim, \u201c <em>Ex diurnitate iemporis omnia presumuntur, rite et 'solemniter esse acta\u201d </em>apply to such a case. That can avail only where there is a defect in the proof, and to supply the imperfect record. But when the proof is itself a matter of record, and no suggestion is made of a defect in it, not evanescent, but fixed and public, courts must deal with it .alone, and not with presumptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">Nor is the ruling of the court sustained by the passage in Greenleaf, nor the case in Wendell, on which the defendant relies. It is not a case of an erroneous judgment; but of a judgment utterly void for want of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, for want of an appearance under process, or by any voluntary authority. It is not sought to reverse or vacate it, but to treat it as a nullity; and this may be done in a collateral proceeding as well as in any other mode.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-7\">Mr. Justice CATRON</author>\n<p id=\"AxXc\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The first title paper offered in evidence by the plaintiff was a patent from the United-States to Jacques Clamorgan, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>June 18,1845, which purports to grant \u201cto said Clamorgan (under Gabriel Dodier), and to his heirs,\u201d the land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The patent is founded on <em>a </em>certificate made by the first board of commissioners established at St. Louis, which declares, that Clamorgan, cl\u00e1iming under Dodier, original claimant, was entitled to a patent under the provisons of the second section of the act of Congress of 3d March, 1807; and it was ordered that the same should be surveyed conformably to the metes and bounds established in the report of a survey made for said Gabriel Dodier, \u201c and found in Livre Terrien, No. 2, folio 15; by virtue of ten consecutive years\u2019 possession, prior to the 20th December, 1803.\u201d The confirmation and certificate bear date November 13th, 1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">According to the former decisions of this court, all. controversy was concluded by the confirmation as regarded two- questions:\u2014 First, it settled that Clamorgan was the true and proper assignee under Dodier, through the various mesne conveyances by which Clamorgan claimed. Bissell <em>v. </em>Penrose, 8 How. 330. Secondly, that Clamorgan had the oldest and best claim to the land, as against every other claimant under the Spanish government. In explanation of our former decisions, it is proper.to remark, it is held, that, as between two claimants under that government, setting up independent imperfect claims, the courts of justice had no jurisdiction; that in such cases it appertained to the political power to decide to whom the perfect title should issue; and when this was done, no controversy could be raised before the courts of justice impeaching the first confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The only question decided in Chouteau <em>v. </em>Eckhart, 2 Howard, 345, and in Les Bois <em>v. </em>Bramell, 4 Howard, 449, was, that when Congress confirmed and completed an imperfect\u2019 claim, and then confirmed another and different claim for the same land, the older confirmation defeated the younger one; nor could a court of justice go behind the first confirmation, and ascertain from facts arid title papers which claimant had the better original equity. That if this was allowed, then the first confirmation could, be overthrown by the courts; and the action of the political department (in all cases of double confirmation) would have no conclusive- force whon the court? were resorted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">In the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery cannot be questioned on the face of his title; and the controversy depends on the defendant\u2019s claim of title. In 1808, Sarpy recovered- a judgment against Clamorgan in the District Court at St. Louis, for $ 2,393. The objection to the judgment is; that no process seems to have been served on Clamorgan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>and it is proved that he was absent in Mexico at the time ;.but the record of the judgment states, that \u201c now at this day came the parties by their attorneys, and neither of said parties re.quiring a jury, but this case with all things relating to the same being submitted to the court, for that it appears to the court that said Sarpy has sustained damages,\u201d &amp;c. And then a judgment follows.,</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">A defendant\u2019s being beyond the jurisdiction of a court is not conclusive evidence that the judgment was'void; he may have left behind counsel to defend suits brought against him in his \u2022 absence, by which means his property could be reached by attaching it; and the proof shows it to be probable enough that such was Glamorgan\u2019s condition when the judgment was rend\u00e9red. But the validity of the judgment does not depend on this consideration. If it was voidable for want of notice, and a false statement on its face, \u201cthat the parties appeared by their attorneys and dispensed with a jury, and submitted the facts to the court,\u201d then it should have been set aside by an <em>audita querela, </em>or on petition and motion; such being the familiar practice in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Furthermore: This suit'in ejectment is collateral to the judgment; and it cannot be impeached collaterally. So the Supreme Court of Missouri held'in 1848, in the case of Landes <em>v. </em>Perkins (12 Mo. R. 254), on-the same title, and a similar record in all respects to that before us, and with the views on this point there expressed we ent.\" ^ly concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In the same case it is held that Glamorgan\u2019s interest in the . land by virtue of his imperfect Spanish claim was subject to seizure and sale under execution, according to the then laws of Missouri; that the proceeding was not void, but passed to the purchaser at execution sale all th\u00e9 title that would have passed from Glamorgan, had he made a quitclaim deed to McNair, the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">That such was the force and effect of a regular sheriff\u2019s deed under the local laws of the then Missotiri Territory is not open to question; nor is it controverted. And the only remaining consideration on this branch of the case is, whether the sheriff\u2019s deed can be set up as a defence at law, notwithstanding the confirmation and patent, both of which are of subsequent date to the sheriff\u2019s sale and deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The court below held, that the title set up in defence, under the sheriff\u2019s sale was a valid, legal title; and so charged the jury; which instruction was excepted to; and this presents the principal matter of controversy now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Glamorgan\u2019s claim to the land sold had existed for many years before the United -States acquired Louisiana. It had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>been regularly surveyed, by order of the Spanish government, and the survey was filed with the recorder, according to the act of 1805; Clamorgan had held possession under the claim of Dodier, to the extent of his survey, for more than ten consecutive years, before the 20th of December, 1803; he was on that day in possession, and then a resident of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The second section of the act of March 3,1807, declares, that any person thus claiming and holding land shall be confirmed in his title to the tract thus held. The confirmation was to be made by the commissioners; and by section fourth their decision was to be final against the United States- in cases within the foregoing description. And section sixth provides that a patent shall issue on a certificate of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In the case of Landes <em>v. </em>Perkins, the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the conclusive legal title vested in Glamorgan by the confirmation of 1811; and that, being the date of the legal title, a court of law could not go behind it; nor did the confirmation, or patent, relate.to any previous step taken to acquire title; and the sheriff\u2019s deed, being a mere quitclaim, did not estop Clamorgan or his devisees from setting up the legal title against such a deed. And it is intimated that a court of equity could be resorted to, and through its aid the sheriff\u2019s sale might be set up. by decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">How far a court of equity would interfere in such a case we are not disposed to inquire, as it is apprehended that the Supreme Court of Missouri was mistaken in the effect it .attributed to the confirmation of 1811, and the patent founded on it. Glamorgan\u2019s petition asking a confirmation (under the act of 1805) was filed with his title papers with the recorder; and they were recorded (December 10,1805).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The imperfect title as then filed was-subject to seizure and sale by execution; the ultimate perfect title demanded and granted was a confirmation and sanction by the political power of the imperfect title, and gave it complete legal validity; and to protect purchasers, the rule applies-, \u201c that where there are divers acts concurrent to make a conveyance estate, or other thing, the original act shall be preferred; and to this the other acts shall have relation,\u201d \u2014 as stated in Yiner\u2019s Abr., tit. <em>Relation, </em>290. The doctrine of relation is well illustrated in Jackson <em>v. </em>M\u2019Michael, by the Supreme Court of New York, 3 Cowen, 75, and recognized by the Supreme Court of Missouri in the case of Crowley <em>v. </em>Wallace, 12 Mo. R. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Cruise on Real Property (Vol, V. pp. 510, 511) lays down the doctrine with great distincthess. He says: \u201c There is no rule better founded in law, reason, and convenience than this, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>all the several parts and ceremonies necessary to complete a conveyance shall be taken together as one act, and operate from the substantial part by relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">For the purposes of this case, (without proposing to apply the rule to every other,) we may assume that the first act of Clamorgan was that of filing his title papers and claim with the recorder of land titles, according to the fourth section of the act of March 2, 1805; this was regularly done, and the papers recorded. He- claimed under the second section of the act of 1805, which was amended by the act of April 21, 1806, and again by the act of March 3,1807. As already stated, by the fourth section of this last act, the decision of the board of commissioners appointed to investigate such .claims is made final against the United States, and he was entitled to a patent. His claim was fully within the provisions of the acts of 1805 and 1807.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Applying the doctrine of relation, and taking all the several parts and ceremonies necessary to complete the title together, \u201c as one act,\u201d then the confirmation of 1811 and the patent of 1845 must be taken to relate to the first act; that of filing the claim in 1805. On this assumption, intermediate conveyances made by the confirmee, or by the sheriff on his behalf, of a date-after the first substantial act, are covered by the legal title, and. pass that title to the alienee. And on this ground the deed made by the sheriff to McNair is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">But there is another consideration equally conclusive in favor of the sheriff\u2019s deed in the present instance. Clamorgan died in 1814; and by his will devised, his lands to his illegitimate children, under whom the plaintiff Landes claims title. In 1845, a patent \u2022 issued purporting to convey to Clamorgan, in fee simple, the land in dispute; according to common law rules, the patent was void for want of a grantee ; and to supply this defect, Congress passed a general law (May 20,1836), declaring, \u201c That, in all cases where patents for public lands have been,.or may hereafter be, issued, in pursuance of any law of the United States, to a person who had died, or who shall hereafter die, before the date of such patent, the title to the -land designated therein shall enure to, and become vested in, the heirs, devisees, or assignees of such deceased patentee, as if the patent had issued to the deceased person during life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Of course the assignee by a <em>bona fide </em>conveyance would come in before a volunteer, such as an heir or devisee. Here the assignee of the devisee is suing the alienee of the devisor. The patent issued in 1845 is the ultimate and conclusive evidence of title in this instance; as the board of commissioners had no power to grant and communicate the fee-held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>United States. Their decision was final, to this extent; the officers of government- were bound to award the patent to Clamorgan, without any further action on the part of Congress. But'this adjudication does not stand on the footing of cases where the commissioners were ordered to report, and Congress reserved the power to confirm the report, and thus to grant the fee by act of Congress; in such cases, this court has held that Congress had granted the ffee, and that no patent was required as a further assurance of title. To what description of assignee, then, did the title enure according to -the act of <em>18361 </em>Necessarily to one claiming, not the legal, but the equitable title, existing when the patent issued; and in him the legal title is vested by the patent. The same rule was applied in the case of Stoddard <em>v. </em>Chambers, <em>2 </em>Howard, 316. In 1800 a concession was made to Mordecai Bell; in 1804, Bell conveyed' to James Mackay; and in 1805, Mackay conveyed to Amos 'Stoddard, whose heirs were the plaintiffs. The claim was filed with the board in 1808, .and in 1836 it was confirmed to Mordecai Bell <em>\u201c </em>and his legal representatives.\u201d This court held, on the foregoing state of facts, <em>\u201c </em>that when, under the act of-1836, the report of the commissioners was confirmed to-Bell and his-legal representatives, the legal title vested in him, and enured by way of estoppel to his grantee, and those who claim by deed under him.\u201d There was no covenant for title in either the assignment from Bell to Mackay, or in that from Mackay to Stoddard, each being quitclaim assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u25a0 So, again, in the case of Bissell <em>v. </em>Penrose, 8 Howard, 317, the same principle was maintained. In- August, 1800, Tillier filed his claim with the board, and asked a confirmation for 800 arpents; and it continued before the different boards sitting at St. Louis until 1836, when it was confirmed by Congress. In 1818, Tillier assigned his claim to Clement B. Penrose; and- in 1820, Penrose assigned his claim, acquired from Tillier, to' Mary B. and Anna Penrose,, who were the plaintiffs in the ejectment suit, and who recovered the land, under their deed of 1820.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In every case when this court has been called on to investigate titles, where conveyances of lands- had been made during the time that a claim was pending before a board of commissioners, and where the claim was\u2019 ultimately confirmed in- the name of the original claimant, the intermediate assignments have been upheld against the confirmee, and his heirs or devisees, in the same manner as if he had been vested with the legal title at the date of conveyance. We are -therefore of opinion, that the sheriff\u2019s deed made to McNair in 1808 must be supported on this ground also.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The second objection to the sheriff\u2019s deed is, that it was not recorded when Landes purchased from Glamorgan\u2019s devisees. The Circuit Court instructed the jury, that, as between the devisees and those claiming under McNair, the deed was valid without recording, but that it'was not valid to defeat a subsequent <em>bond fide </em>purchaser without notice of its existence ; and further instructed the jury, that \u201c the deed on which the plaintiff relies was made in April, 1845, and if the plaintiff then had actual notice of the deed of 1808, it was valid also as to him, without having been recorded. And if the jury find that the defendant Brant was in the open and notorious possession and occupation of the premises when the deed of 1845 was made, and had been so for years before that time, continuously holding under the deed .of 1808, then this is evidence from which, connected with other circumstances, the jury may find that the plaintiff had actual notice of the existence of the deed of 1808, when he took hi's deed in 1845.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The material objection to the charge is, that other circumstances taken in connection with the adverse holding were required to exist, in the opinion of the court, and that these circumstances are not enumerated. And our opinion is, that if more had been required tha\u00f1 the open and notorious adverse possession and occupation of the premises, and the court had given an instruction in general terms as above set .forth, it would be erroneous. If, however, the possession alone was sufficient, then the general -terms \u201c connected with other circumstances \u201d were prejudicial to the defendant, and fall within the general rule \u201c that a man cannot reverse a judgment for error, unless he can show that the error was to his disadvantage.\u201d 3 Bac. Abr., Error, K. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">And this brings us to the question, whether open and notorious occupation and adverse holding by the first purchaser, when the second deed is taken, is in itself sufficient to warrant a jury or court in finding'that a purchaser had evidence before him of a character to put him on inquiry as to what title the possession was held under; and that he, the subsequent purchaser, was bound by that title, aside from all other evidence than such possession and holding. It is conclusively settled in England, that open and notorious adverse possession is evidence of notice; not of the adverse holding only, but of the title under which the possession is held. Hiern <em>v. </em>Mill, 1 <em>j </em>Ves. 120; Daniels <em>v. </em>Davison, 16 Ves. 253; per Eldon, Lord Chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">And in the United States we deem it to be equally settled. The cases in New York will be found in Gouverneur <em>v. </em>Lynch, 2 Paige, Ch. R. 300, and in Grimstone <em>v. </em>Carter, 3 Paige, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Ch. R. 436, per Walworth, Chancellor. In Kentucky, in Brown <em>v. </em>Anderson, 4 Littell, 201, and Buck w.Holloway, 2 J. J.. Marshall, 180. Nor are we aware that a contrary dpctrine is held in any State in the Union. We are therefore of opinion, that the charge given on this point was correct, so far as the plaintiff in error is allowed to call it in question.</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">Thb .next inquiry arises on the refusal of the Circuit Court to. charge the jury that the sheriff\u2019s sale made by John K.' ' Walker (sheriff), in 1836, was- void. The executors of Glamorgan were sued, and a recovery h\u00e1d against them, as executors, -by Rufus Easton'; and the premises in dispute were sold, and under this sale the defendant also claims title.. That the lands of the deceased debtor could be.seized and sold under the judgment according to the then laws of the State of Missouri, we hold to be free from doubt; so the Supreme Court of that State held in the case of Landes <em>v. </em>Perkins (12 Mo. R.) above . referred to, and in which case all the points in controversy on this branch of the title were discussed,, and in our judgment properly decided; the opinion there given is in conformity to the instructions given and refused, in the court below, in this Case, and in which we hold there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">There is no other question presented by the record requiring examination, and it is therefore ordered that the judgment of .the Circuit Court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\"><em>. </em>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United .States for the District; of Missouri,' and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
