St. John, Claimant of the Steamboat Neptune, Appellant, v<em>. </em>Zebulon A. Paine, Sarah Norwood, John Bucknam, Andrew Bradford, and Augustus Norton, Libellants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-10\">The following are the rules which ought to-govern vessels when approaching each other:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-11\">1. <em>Of Sailing Vessels. </em>\u2014 A vessel that has the wind free,'\"or sailing before or with the wind, must get out of the way of the vessel that is close-hauled, or sailing by or against it; and the vessel on the starboard tacE has a right to keep her course, and the one on the larboard tack must give way, or be answerable for the consequences.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-12\">So, when two vessels are approaching each other, both having the wind free, and consequently the power of readily controlling their movements, the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and each pass to the right. The same rule governs vessels sailing on the wind, and approaching each other, when it is doubtful which is to windward.'</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-13\">But if\u2019the vessel on the larboard tack is so far to windward that, if both persist in their course, the \u2018other will strike her on the lee side, abaft the beam or near the stern, in that case, the vessel on the starboard tack should give way, as she can do so with greater facility and less loss of time and distance than the other.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-14\">When vessels are crossing each other in opposite directions, and there is the least doubt of their going clear, the vessel on the staiboard tack should persevere in her course, while that on the larboard tack should bear up or keep away before the wind.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-15\">These rules have their exceptions in extreme cases, depending upon the special circumstances of the case, and in respect to which no general rule-can be laid down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>or applied. Either vessel may find herself in a position at the time When it would be impossible to conform to them, without certain peril to herself or a collision with the approaching vessel. Under such circumstances, the master must necessarily be thrown upon the resources of his own judgment and skill in extricating hie own vessel, as well as the vessel approaching, from the impending peril. These cases cannot be anticipated, and therefore cannot be provided for by any fixed regulation. They can only be examined, and the management of the vessel approved or condemned, as the case may arise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b568-5\">2. <em>Of Steam- Vessels meeting Sailing </em>Tassels. \u2014 Steam-vessels are regarded in the light of vessels navigating with a fair wind, and are always under obligations to do whatever a sailing, vessel going free or with a fair wind would be required to do under similar circumstances. Their obligation extends still farther, because they possess a power to avoid the collision not belonging to sailing vessels, even with a free wind, the master having the steamer under his command, both by altering the helm and by stopping the engines. As a general' rule, therefore, when meeting a sailing vessel, whether close-hauled or with the wind free, the latter'has a right to keep her course, and it is the duty of the steamer to adopt such precautions as will avoid her.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b568-6\">3. <em>Of Steamers meeting each, other. </em>\u2014 It is the duty of each vessel to put the helm a-port.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b568-7\">4. <em>Of keeping Watch. </em>\u2014 The pilot-house of a steamer is not the proper place at which to station a watch at night. A competent and vigilant look-out stationed at the forward part of- the vessel, and in a position best adapted to descry vessels approaching at the earliest moment, is indispensable to exempt the- steamboat from blame, in case of accident in the night-time, while navigating waters on which it is accustomed to meet other craft.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b568-8\">The owner is responsible for damage resulting not only from want of care and attention on the part of the persons in charge of the vessel, but also from the want of proper knowledge and skill to enable them to manage her according to established nautical rules.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-9\">This was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-10\">The circumstances of the case will be best explained by inserting the libel and answer, which were as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-11\">\u201c To the Honorable Samuel B.

And the respondent, as to the allegations of the said libellants, and each of them, in the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth articles of the said libel contained, says that he is ignorant of and not informed concerning the same save by the said libel, and cannot therefore admit or deny the same to be true, but leaves, the same to be proved according to the custom and practice of this court.

That, immediately on s\u00e9eing the said schooner Iole, the course, of the said Steamboat Neptune was changed to windward of the said schooner, for the purpose of giving said schooner the course she was then running.- That when the said steamboat was about ten or twelve lengths from the said schooner, it was observed that the latter had changed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>course, and was luffing up so as to cross the.bows of the said steamboat. That, when first seenj said schooner was running west by south, from which she changed suddenly to about northwest. That, on seeing that said schooner had changed her course, the bell of the steamboat was immediately rung to stop her, and all efforts made to avoid the collision; but the said schooner came directly across the bows of the said steamboat, and, the latter having some headway, a collision could not be avoided. That the said schooner was struck about midships, and her crew at once jumped from the rigging on board the said steamboat. That the first report was, that no one was left on board the schooner; the next was, that a female and child were left on board, upon hearing which a small boat was immediately lowered from the Neptune, and sufficiently manned, and every other possible effort wap made for the. purpose, of saving the persons on board of the said schooner; but that, before or about the time the boat could be lowered, the said schooner disappeared; but whether any person or persons were in her at the time she sunk, this respondent is not informed, save by the said libel, and cannot state.

That the reason why the said schooner was not seen earlier than at the distance of one quarter of a mile was, that a heavy black cloud shut her out from view, and she had no lights visible on board which could enable the captain, or pilot, or the other wheelsman, or any of the crew of the said steamboat, to discover the said schooner sooner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">\u201c7th. That, as soon as the said schooner was seen, .the course of the said steamboat was immediately changed, according to the rule customary in such 'cases, so as to give the schooner the course she was pursuing. That this threw the broadside of the Neptune to view from the schooner, so that the man at the wheel on board the schooner saw the head and stern lights of the steamboat more distinctly, and her course was plainly seen by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">\u201c 8th. That the wind was blowing fresh, and the luffing up of the schooner so as to cross the bows of the steamboat, when the position and course of the latter were so evident to those on board the schooner, could not have been expected by any person on board the steamboat, and was contrary to all proper and lawful rules of navigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHE\">\u201c 9th.

That,, on the occurrence of the said'accident, the captain of the said steamboat, -with a sufficient number of his crew, manned the small. boat, and went in her, so as to afford every possible assistance to the persons or property on board the said schooner; and the \u2022 allegations in the third article of the said libel, that no captain could be found on board of said steamboat,- and that no assistance was offered or given to save the lives of those pn board of the said schooner, are false.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-10\">\u201c 11th. That the accident aforesaid was- occasioned by the great negligence and want of care of the officers and crew of the schooner Iole, in riot providing powerful lights on deck, so .that the said schooner could be discerned at a distance, and in changing the course of said schooner right across the bows of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the said steamboat when the latter was in full view of the said officers and crew, and that it was not occasioned by the fault, carelessness, or unskilful management, or by any malice or evil design on the part of the said captain, pilot, or any of the crew on board the said steamboat Neptune, as is falsely alleged in the fourth article of said libel, and that the owner of the said steamboat Neptune is not therefore liable to pay the damages by the libellant sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">\u201c 12th.

Left, New York about five, P. Mi Captain Henry Harris was also pilot on board. Thomas Davis was captain of the boat, and she had her full complement of men, as he believes ; was not on board the trip before. Witness had watch fore part of the night. Weather was clear, except black cloud at east. Between nine and ten the cloud was about, two hours high, or at height of sun at two hours above horizon, and closed down to horizon, and spread northeast and southeast. Neptune was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>running east by north. Witness stood in front part of wheelhouse, midships, on the look-out. Driver had the wheel. Witness was at middle window of wheel-house, about the middle of the boat. Wheelsman was under his directions. Could then see ahead from one fourth to three eighths of a mile, so as to d rn an object; should not think could see any thing, except a Hgnt, farther off. Neptune was going at about ten miles the hour. About twenty-five minutes before ten, first saw schooner (Iole), north; was then about one mile and a half from light-boat, Stratford shore light bearing east by north one half north. Schooner was then directly ahead; could just discern her by side of flag-pole. Wind was about north; quite a strong breeze. Could not tell what course of schooner was; could not see her plain enough. She was trimmed close aft, or nearly so; might have had her sheets a little eased off, that brought her sails edgewise towards him, and could not tell whether she was a sloop or schooner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">\u201c Witness ordered the wheel hove hard a-starboard immediately.; and in less than half a minute ordered bell rung to stop the engine, seeing we were coming very near; and then rang to back engine, and by that time were close to schooner, and soon struck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">\u201c The effect of heaving wheel a-starboard was to bring boat up to northward, and altered course of boat to about northeast.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-7\">\u201c Thinks schooner was heading about northwest. She was square across bow of Neptune when they came together. Schooner had no lights; customary for sailing vessels on Sound to show lights when steamboats are near. Thinks schooner could have easily fallen off with the wind, if she saw the steamboat. If she had altered her course a Very trifle, by falling off at any time within a mile, she could have easily cleared the Neptune. As soon as struck, crew of schooner got on board Neptune. Boat of Neptune was immediately lowered, and sent out to see if could find any body. It returned without finding any person; and captain took it himself, with lantern, and went out again, and was out with it about twenty-five minutes. Came back without finding any person. She was then hoisted up, and Neptune started, first northward, and directly across the Sound; from collision three quarters to one hour Neptuneiay by before going on; found Neptune leaking some; and, after consultation, it was thought more prurient to return to New York. Got back to New York at half past three to four, A. M.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-8\">\u201c Schooner ought to have set a light or altered her course.

No time was specified nor'wages. Witness was at that time, employed on board Massachusetts, and it was understood that both boats belonged to same concern. Witness was transferred to -the Neptune. Both boats had been running to same places. Does not know that they'had been in opposition. Does not know that Harris, second pilot, had been on this boat before. He was also transferred from Massachusetts. Thinks that was Captain Davis\u2019s first trip at that period. Captain Rollins had been master before; understood that he and his pilots had been transferred to the Oregon that day; thinks it was-about first of flood when he left New York; but does not recollect about it. Did not notice that particularly. Light-boat about fifty-five miles from New York.

Judges his. position from what had observed days going through the Sound. Did not at time see the shores. Thinks discerned Connecticut shore, but not plainly. No recollection of looking at Long Island side. Connecticut shore about five miles off; could see it plainest above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-7\">\u201c Could see light-boat, probably three or four miles off, and Stratford light about five miles. When he first saw schooner, she bore east by north from the Neptune, directly ahead. Could riot tell how she was steering, or whether going up or down the Sound. Did not look at her with his night-glass ; had no time; his whole attention was directed to attempting to clear her; \u2022 and took what he thought proper measure, by throwing wheel starboard. Judged she was going up or down the Sound, and that was the precaution always taken to clear them ; probably \u2022one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards off when discovered how she was heading, but could not tell distance with any certainty. Put his wheel hard a-starboard, and thinks that altered his course four to four and a half points, and got his wheel so before saw how schooner was heading. As wind was, judged she must be going up or down the Sound; and besides, if running across So'und, sails would have shown differently. Steamer struck stem on, supposes starboard side of her stem, as that was more indented than the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">\u201c Thinks schooner would be running six or seven miles per hour. Hit her on larboard side, nearly between her two masts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">\u201c Should 'judge schooner was heading about northwest when they struck.

To- enable the owners of the Iole to recover in this, case, there must have been wilful misconduct on the part of the Neptune, or negligence on her part, accompanied with freedom from blame on the part of the Iole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-14\">There is no pretence for a charge of wilful misconduct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-15\">II. No blame or negligence can be imputed to the Neptune.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-16\">1. She was sufficiently manned with skilful and experienced seamen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-17\">2. She was well and sufficiently lighted, and in the proper, place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-18\">The court erred in assuming that the atmosphere was thick, as well as cloudy, ahead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-19\">3. The Neptune had a good look-out. The night not being foggy or hazy, a look-out on her deck below was unnecessary. The look-out in tji\u00e9 pilot-house was proper and sufficient The court erred in supposing a closed window intervened- on the said 14fh of July.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-20\">4. She was properly navigated as to speed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-21\">Though she went faster at daylight, and in the early part of her voyage, at the period in question she was going at the rate of ten miles the hour; which Was not too fast, taking into view the general well-known usage in this country, and the character of the evening, which enabled the Iole or any other, -vessel approaching her to see her at a great distance, and on their: showing a light would enable her to see them. .

The Neptune was properly navigated, as to course, which was east by north, by the compass, and continued so until she discovered the Iole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-5\">The Iole was approaching her on a west course, by the compass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-6\">Allowance being made for lee-way of both vessels, which amounted to about half a point, they were going the same course reversed, with a variation of about half a point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\">III. The Neptune first perceived the Iole at a distance from her of one quarter to three eighths of a mile, and could not see her at a greater distance, by reason of the eioud in the east.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-8\">IV. At this time the Iole appeared to the Neptune to be approaching or receding in nearly the same line, her sails being seen edgewise, and the Neptune appeared to be in the act of crossing her line to the northward, she being seen over the starboard bow of the Neptune, which is fully established' by the specific observations of the witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-9\">V. The evidence that the Neptune, at the distance of six miles from the Iole, was on a line south of that of the Iole, and so as to pass the Iole to the south of her, is too weak to overcome the clear and decisive evidence on the last point, even assuming them to be competent witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-10\">These witnesses were interested and incompetent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-11\">To hit the Iole as she did, \"(the Iole keeping her course,) and to come up directly towards her, the Neptune' must have changed her course to due north, or north by west, which is' not only improbable, but contradicted decidedly by the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-12\">VI. Assuming it to be true, and that the Neptune changed her course to the northward, some five or six minutes prior to the collision, it was so changed as to bripg her in the position stated in the fourth point; and she was in that position when the Iole was first discovered by her, as the evidence decisively shows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-13\">VII. If the Neptune changed her course five or six minutes before the collision,.so as to bring her in the position stated in the fourth point, she was not in fault in making the change, because she did not (and could not) then see the Iole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-14\">VIII. And it was the duty of the Neptune, when she first perceived the Iole, to endeavour to pass her, and not to stop or slack her speed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-15\">1. By stopping her course, she would have been in danger of being run into while at rest- by a moving body, thereby endangering the lives of her.passengers; it being the duty of passenger vessels to use every precaution of diligence, industry, and skill to save the lives of their passengers. <em>2 </em>Kent\u2019s\" Com. 601, 602 ; Christie <em>v. </em>Griggs, 2 Camp.

By slackening her course she would have been less able to avoid collision than by continuing, or even accelerating, her speed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">IX. The Neptune, when in the position stated in the fourth point, was correct in putting her helm a-starboard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">1. It was highly expedient that both vessels, on account of the proximity, should be active in endeavoring to avoid collision, and that neither should keep her course, and the Neptune was bound to act on that supposition. The Friends, 1 Wm. Rob. 482.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\">2. It was proper that the Neptune should go to the windward ; the deviation in that direction on her part was easier, as she was crossing the line of the Iole in that direction, and the Iole could bear away to the leeward more readily than she could luff towards the wind. The Shannon, .1 Wm. Rob. 469, 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-8\">3.

The Neptune would have avoided the Iole, if the Iole had even kept her course; more especi\u00e1lly, if. she had borne away to the leeward, when she saw the change of course of the -steamboat, towards the north, by her lights. And it was her duty to bear away, as she could easily perceive the change of the Neptune\u2019s course. The Cynosure, 3 Carr. &amp; Payne, 529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-12\">XI. The Iole, \u00e1ccording to the preponderating weight of the evidence, neither kept her ctiurse nor bore away from the wind, but, from the agitation of her helmsman, or some other cause, she luffed into the wind, across the course then pursued by the Neptune. The blow was received by the steamboat on the starboard side of her bows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-13\">XII.

In not keeping a look-out, and discovering the clouds in the east; and in not forthwith showing a light when she discovered the Neptune, it being her duty, and the practice of the Sound, in such circumstances, to show a light.

The collision took place in Long Island Sound, on the ,14th of July, 1846,'between' nine and ten o\u2019clock, P.

The crew saved themselves by climbing upon the Neptune. \u2022 This position is not' disputed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-11\">2. The Iole, at the time of the collision, had passed about one mile south of the Middle Ground light-boat,-and was west of her. The Iole was steering directly west.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-12\">3. The wind was blowing fresh from the north, and the Iole was running close on the wind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-13\">4. The Iole did not change' her course or luff before the collision, but her sails were full when it took place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-14\">5. The steamboat changed her course to th\u00e9 windward by putting her wheel- hard a-starboard when within a quarter to three eighths of a paile from the schooner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-15\">6. The steamer would have cleared the schooner, if the former had-, not changed her course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-16\">7. There is no custom requiring a schooner in the Sound to carry lights when sailing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-17\">8. The night was not so dark as to render lights at all necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-18\">9. It is the duty of a steamboat, when a schooner is sailing on the wind, if necessary to avoid collision, to change her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>course so as to avoid the latter, and it is not the duty of a schooner to change to the leeward.</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">10.

The schooner was struck near midships, on the larboard side, and immediately sunk, carrying with her a woman and child, who were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The libel charges that the schooner was on her voyage up the Sound to New York; and that about a.'mile south of the light-boat stationed off the Middle' Ground, a shoal at that place, and nearly opposite Stratford Point, some sixty miles from New York, she was steering about a west course, the wind being from the north, and the night clear, so that a vessel could be descried at a considerable distance; and that while sailing upon this course with a fresh wind, going at from six to eight knots an hour, and a short time after the schooner had passed the light-boat, between the hours of nine and ten o\u2019clock at night, she was negligently run down by the Neptune, which vessel was proceeding down the 'Sound from New York, and struck against her hull, head on, between the fore and main rigging on the larboard side, with such force and violence as to break open her hull, and cut her nearly in two, so that she filled and sunk immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The allegations of the answer are, that the Neptune had sailed from New York at five o\u2019clock of the' afternoon of that day, bound for Newport and Providence (R. I.), and had proceeded on her voyage until within about a mile from Stratford light-boat, when, at or about eight or ten o\u2019clock in the evening, a vessel was descried about a quarter of a mile ahead, which turned out to be the Iole in question. That immediately on seeing the vessel, the course of the Neptune was changed to windward for the purpose of giving her the course she was running. That when the Neptune was about ten or twelve lengths from the schooner, it was seen that she had. changed her course, and was luffing up into the wind so as to cross the bows of the steamboat. That when first seen, the Iole was running west by south, from which she changed suddenly to about northwest; that, on seeing she had changed her course, the bell of the Neptune was immediately rung to stop her, and all efforts made to avoid the collision; but that the schooner came directly across the bows of the steamboat, and, the latter having still some headway, a collision could not be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">It will be seen from these allegations of the respective parties, that the issue between them, and upon which the case must turn in favor of the one or the other, is a very simple one, whether we have regard to the law or to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The statement of the Iole is, that she was proceeding on a west course up the Sound, nearly close-hauled to the wind, with her starboard tacks on board, at the rate of about seven knots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>an hour; and that, while keeping on this course, the Neptune, in an improper manoeuvre to cross her trail, and pass to the windward, struck her near midships on the larboard side, and sunk her.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The allegation of the Neptune does not vary substantially from this statement, except that it charges the collision to the fault of the Iole in not keeping on her course, but suddenly changing it by throwing her head into the wind, and thereby placing her athwart the track of the steamboat as she was in the act of passing to the windward.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The general question involved in the case is, which of these vessels has been in fault; and this will depend upon the evidence produced by each in the court below, together with the application of the rules of navigation to be observed by them at the time of the collision, and with a view to avoid it, having regard to their relative position and course ; and, more especially, the application of these rules under the facts and circumstances, in a case where the colliding vessel is propelled by steam, and the other by sails.</p>\n<p id=\"ASh\">Among the nautical rules applicable to the navigation of sailing vessels .are the following, yiz.: \u2014 A vessel' that has the wind free, or sailing before or with the wind, must get out of the way of the vessel that is close-hauled, or sailing by or against it; and the vessel on the starboard tack has a right to keep her course, and the one on the larboard tack must give way, or be answerable for the consequences. So, when two vessels are approaching each other, both having the-wind free, and consequently the power of readily controlling their movements, the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and each pass to the right. The same rule governs Vessels sailing on the wind and approaching each other, when it is doubtful which is to windward. But if the vessel on the larboard tack is so far to windward that, if both persist in their course, the other will strike her oh the lee side abaft the beam or near the stern, in that case the vessel on the starboard tack should give way, as she can. do so with greater facility and less loss of time and distance than the other.. Again, when vessels are crossing each other in opposite directions, and there is the least doubt of their going clear, the vessel on the starboard tack should persevere in her course, while that on the larboard tack should bear up, or keep away before the wind.

Either vessel may find herself in a position at the time when it would be impossible to conform to them without certain peril to herself, or a collision with the approaching vessel. Under such circumstances, the master must necessarily be thrown upon the resources of his own judgment and skill' in extricating his own vessel, as well as the vessel approaching, from .the impending peril. These cases cannot be anticipated, and therefore cannot be provided for by any fixed regulation. They can only be examined, and the management of the vessel approved or condemned, as the case may arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">But no one can look through the reports in admiralty in England without being struck with the steadiness and rigor with which these general nautical rules have been enforced in cases of collision, under the advice of the Trinity masters of that court, or fail to be impressed with the justice and propriety of such application, and the salutary results flowing from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In the case of the. Traveller, an exception was set up by the colliding vessei, on the ground that the other, when .first descried, was about two points on her lee bow. This was denied. But the court declined to enter into a minute examination as to which of the statements was correct, observing that it had been distinctly laid down, over and over again, that when two vessels on opposite tacks are approaching each other, and there is-a probability of collision, it is the duty of the vessel on the larboard to give way at once, without considering whether the other vessel be one or more points to leeward. And, in the case of the Friends, the court, where an exception was attempted to be engrafted on the Trinity rules, in submitting the case to the Trinity masters, recommended that, for the sake of the safe navigation of the Thames and the great interests which are daily and hourly there at stake, the exception, if any were to be made, should be clear, definite, and intelligible, in order that it might, at the first glance, be known to the mercantile and maritime world; that unless it were, so, it was obvious that persons in' all cases would endeavor to form exceptions for themselves, and instead of certainty they would have uncertainty; instead of security, danger. And in the case of dhe Ann and Mary, decided in 1843, the. Trinity masters observed to the court, speaking'of the rule that the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and where they had applied it with great rigor, that the golden rule. so long established must-be strictly adhered to, which was, that the vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>on the larboard tack is to give way and the vessel on th\u00e9 starboard tack to hold on; and that the new rule which had been lately made for steam-vessels, namely, each to put the helm a-port, under all doubtful circumstances, assimilated with it. The vessel on the starboard tack puts her helm a-port to keep the wind, and the vessel on the larboard tack does the same to bear away. That the same rule applied to sailing, as well as steam vessels, and .if it should be strictly adhered to, there would not be one thousandth part of the accidents which had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">These rules, which are the results of the practical experience and wisdom of navigators, cannot be too suongly impressed upon the observance-of those engaged in the management of vessels on our rivers, or other waters where the course of business and trade naturally confines the navigation to a particular tract or route; and it is the obvious duty of the courts to apply them strictly in all cases of collision, unless where a clear exception is established by the party seeking to excuse himself for a-departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Our examination thus far has been confined to the nautical rules governing the navigation o.f sailing vessels. We have thus confined it, because it will be found that they are generally applicable as ruFs regulating the navigation in cases where one of the vessels xs propelled by steam.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u2022 \u25a0 The striking difference is, that steam-vessels are regarded in the light of vessels navigating with a fair wind, and are always under obligations to do whatever a sailing vessel going free or with a fair wind would be required to do under similar circumstances. Their obligation extends still further, because they possess a power to avoid the collision not belonging to sailing vessels even with a free' wind, the master having the steamer under his command, both by altering the helm and by stopping the engines; They are. also of vast power and speed compared .with craft on our rivers and internal seas propelled by sails, exposing the latter to inevitable destruction in case of collision, and rendering it at all times difficult, and not unfrequentiy impossible, to get out of their way. Greater caution arid vigilance are therefore naturally to be exacted of those in charge of them, to .avoid the dangers of the navigation. This justly results from the superior power to direct and control the course and speed of the vessel, and the serious damage consequent upon a failure to avoid the dangers. As a general rule, therefore, when meeting a sailing vessel, whether close-hauled or with the wind free, the latter has a right to keep her course, and it is the duty of the steamer to adopt such precautions as will avoid her. The Shannon, 2 Hagg. Adm. 173; The Perth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>3 Ib. 414 ; The Rose, 2 Wm. Rob. 1; Hawkins <em>v. </em>The Duchess and Orange Steamboat Co., 2 Wend. 452; 3 Kent, Com. 230; Abbott on Shipping, p. 228 (Boston ed. 1836).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">By an adherence to this rule on the part of the sailing vessel, the steamer with a proper look-out will be enabled, when approaching in an opposite direction, to adopt the necessary measures to avoid the danger, as she will have a right to assume that the sailing vessel will keep her course. If the latter fails to do this, the,fault will be attributable to her, and the master of the steamer will be responsible- only for a fair exertion of the power of his vessel to avoid the collision under the unexpected change. of the course of the other vessel, and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Recurring now to the facts attending the collision, as disclosed in the court below, and applying the rules of navigation as above stated, and which should have been observed by the respective vessels, we shall be enabled to determine without much difficulty which of them has been in fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The Iole had on board her starboard tacks, and was nearly .close-hauled to the wind, and, as we have seen, had a right, and indeed was bound, to keep on her course; and it was the duty of the Neptune to adopt the proper measures to \u00bfvoid her. There is some discrepancy in the evidence, but the clear weight of it is, that she kept hef course till the collision occurred. She was not descried by the hands on board the 'Neptune till the two vessels were from one fourth to three eighths of a mile apart, with a combined speed of sixteen or seventeen miles the hour. She was. then, as they supposed, directly ahead. The wheel of the Neptune was immediately put hard a-starboard, with a view to pass the schooner to the windward; and it is supposed by the hands on board that this manoeuvre would have cleared her, had she not at the same time changed her course by heading more into the wind. As we have already said, this allegation is hot borne out by the evidence. On the'contrary, the strong probability is, according to the testimony, that the hands on board the Neptune at the time they first descried the schooner mistook her position, and, instead of being, on a line with her, that the Neptune was to the. leeward, and that, in changing her course and coming up to pass to the windward, they naturally supposed the schooner had changed her course also.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Besides, she was in fault in attempting to pass the Iole to the windward. Even admitting that she was not mistaken in the position of this vessel, and that sh\u00e9 was dead ahead, it was the duty of the Neptune to bear away; and to pass on the. larboard side. As .we have seen, the observance of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>one of the rules of navigation is more strongly recommended, or more steadily enforced, in the admiralty, than this one, where two vessels are approaching in opposite directions, and there -is danger of a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">It is observable in this connection, that the pilot in charge of the Neptune seems not to have been properly instructed in his duty in the emergency after the schooner had been discovered ahead, or if he had, that he neglected it; for we find .him testifying that, if he had known her course, (which he did not when he.gave the order,) he should have thrown his wheel as he did, because the schooner might have hauled off on the wind. And the other pilot on board expressed the opinion, that there was Yio difficulty whatever in her keeping away and avoiding the Neptune,' after seeing her two or three miles off. They seem to have entertained the opinion, that, according to the rules of . navigation, it was the duty of the sailing vessel to give way when meeting a vessel propelled by steam; and this even when she was on the starboard tack and nearly close-hauled to the wind. Now,\u2018the owner is responsible for damage resulting not only from want of care.and attention on the part of those in charge of the vessel, but also from the want of proper knowledge and skill to enable them to manage her according to established nautical rules. Error of judgment will be no defence, especially if resulting from incompetency. And erroneous opinions of duty on the part of those in the immediate management and control of the vessel naturally turn a doubt, arising from conflicting evidence upon a question whether or not a proper direction was given in'the emergency, against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We are also satisfied, that the steamboat was in fault in not keeping at the time a proper look-out on the forward part of the deck; and that the failure to descry the schooner at a greater distance than half a \u00ednil\u00e9 ahead is attributable to this neglect. The pilot-house, in the night,- especially if dark, and the view obscured by clouds in the distance, was not the proper place, whether the windows were up or down. The view of a look-out stationed there must necessarily have been partially obstructed. A competent and vigilant look-out stationed at the forward part of the vessel, and in a position best adapted to descry vessels approaching at the earliest moment, is indispensable to exempt the steamboat from blame in case of accident in the night-time, while navigating waters on which it is accustomed to meet other water craft.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">There is nothing harsh or unreasonable in this rule; and its strict observance aftd enforcement will be found as beneficial to the interest of the owners as to the safety of navigation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a remark equally true in respect to every other nautical rule, which the results of experience have shown enter so materially into the proper management of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">It has been insisted, that the schooner was in fault in not carrying a light, so as to enable the vessels approaching to see her at a greater distance. But all agree that it was a clear, starlight night, and hence there could be no difficulty, with a proper look-out, in seeing to a sufficient distance to enable the. steamer to make the proper movement to avoid her. It is not. usual for sailing vessels to carry lights on such a night..</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">It is true, some of the witnesses on the part of the Neptune speak of a black cloud in the'eastern horizon, which obscured the view from vessels going in that direction: But the allegation is not maintained ,by the evidence to an extent that would justify us in attributing to it any material importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Upon the whole, we are satisfied the decree below is right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b596-9\">Mr. Justice DANIEL</author>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">dissented from the opinion of the court in this case, and also in that of Newton <em>v. </em>Stebbins.
