Subsequently to such location, viz. on the 27th of November, 1840, Thomas, by notarial act, transferred to Poindexter all the right which Thomas then had, or thereafter might have, to the land so located, and authorized Poindexter to obtain a patent in his own name. The patent,.however, .was issued to' Thomas, and not to Poindexter. This did not vest in Poindexter a <em>legal </em>title, which would enable him to recover in a petitory action, which corresponds with an action 6f ejectment.

The following bill of exceptions was taken, viz.: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-10\">\u201c Be it remembered, that, on the trial of this cause, plaintiff offered in evidence a paper purporting to be articles of agreement between plaintiff and one Felix Huston, and. to have been signed and sealed by them, and purporting to bear date November 20th, 1835 ; said paper also purported to have been signed by one William Burns, as subscribing witness. No testimony was offered as to the sealing or delivery of said paper, ^r the time when it was made; the subscribing witness .was 'riot called to testify, but a witness was examined who testified that the names of said Poindexter and Huston, subscribed to said paper, were in the handwriting of said parties. Witness knew nothing of the execution of said instrument. Defendant, by his counsel, objected to the reception of said paper in evidence, on the ground-that there was no proof whatever of the time when it was signed, nor of the sealing, and delivery of the same. Defendant objected also to the admissibility of said paper in evidence, even if the due execution thereof were duly proved, on the ground that it was a private act, not recorded, to which defendant was not a party, or of which he had notice; and on the further ground, that the effect of said paper in evidence would be to contradict, qualify, and explain the positive and direct admissions of plaintiff, made in his conveyance, by authentic act, to said Huston, on the 20th day of November, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>1835; which said authentic act of conveyance had been offered in evidence by the defendant.

The plaintiff has shown no title for the lands sued for. Those; described in the petition, and those claimed by his 'deed of transfer from General Thomas, and those de'scribed in the patent to Thomas, are all different; and. in this, a petitory action, the plaintiff must show title as in ejectment. 3 La. R. 134,150 ; 14 La. R. 16 ; 7 La. R. 45; 8 Mart. N. S. 105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-11\">Second Point. On the full disclosure of titles on both side's, as'shown in the record, the defendant Gilmer has shown a complete legal title in himself. Freeman\u2019s Ch. R. 203; 2 Wheat. 197, 198, 199, 205. Or if not a legal title, a perfect equity protected as a legal title by estoppel, and by enuring of the patent in Thomas\u2019s name, to the use and support of the equity sold by him. 2 Howard, 316, 317; 6 Howard, 291; 12 La. R. 172, 173; C. C. art. 2451; 4 Yerger, 96; 2 How. (Miss.) 915; Walker\u2019s R. 97; Freeman\u2019s Ch. R. 181; 8 La, R. 109 13 La. R 132.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-12\">Third Point. The.partnership \u00a1agreement between Poindexter and Huston, referred to in defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions, was inadmissible evidence for the plaintiff Poindexter; because a mere secreted counter-letter, contradictory of Poindexter\u2019s recorded conveyance to Huston, under which Gilmer claims (13 La. R. 132); and because equally contradictory and inconsistent with 'the title which Poindexter sets forth in his petition; and wholly impertinent to- the issue made in the pleadings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>And also because there was no evidence of the execution of the said agreement admissible in law, \u2014 the subscribing witness not being-called, or'his absence accounted for, or any acknowledgment of the instrument by the parties present, or evidence of the fact of sealing and delivery. <em>2 </em>Phil. Ev. 202, 203 ; McKinder <em>v. </em>Littlejohn, 1 Tred. 66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">Fourth Point. It is a manifest and palpable error, that the court below refused to permit Gilmer, under his. plea in reconvention, to prove the value of his improvements as a purchaser in good faith, and which good faith is a presumption of law in Louisiana. C. C. art. 3447; C. P. art. 375; 17 La. R. 183; 4 La. R. 273; 8 La. R. 119, 120.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">Fifth Point. It is error patent upon the face of the record, and independent of the evidence in the cause, or of the bill of exception filed, that the court has given no judgment affecting the party cited in warranty. C. C. art. 2493, 2494; C. P. art. 378 to 384. And the court had no right or discretion to postpone or to pretermit this judgment. C. P. art. 385 ; 10 La. R. 120 ; 2 Rob. 199, 200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">Sixth Point. It is error patent on the pleadings and judgment, that the court has awarded a recovery of lands not sued for or demanded in the petition. 1 Poth. Oblig. part 4, ch. 3, art. 2, \u00a7 1, p. 425; 1 Partidas, part 3, tit. 22, laws 15, 16, pp. 278, 279.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">Seventh Point. It is error patent on the judgment, that no sort of reason is assigned for its rendition. Constitution of La. of 1845, art. 70; 5 Mart. 687 to 689 ; 4 Mart. 463, 464, 465; 11 La. R. 162.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-9\"><em>Mr. Coxe </em>and <em>Mr. </em>Crittenden, for the defendant in error, contended, \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">1st. That the bill of exceptions was not taken in time. From the record it appears that it was not taken until after the trial had been concluded for some time, after motions for a new trial had been made, argued, and overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-11\">The uniform practice upon this subject requires that the bill of exceptions must be tendered at the trial. 2 Tidd, 788; 4 Dall. 240 ; 1 Binney, 38 ; 10 Johns. 312.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-12\">This .proceeding, introduced into the English law by the -Statute of Westminster, 13 Edward I-., is Unknown to civil law, and to the courts which administer that system. It was introduced'into the courts of Louisiana by special legislation, ' and, being thus borrowed from the English law, is-taken with all its accompaniments and limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-14\">There are several provisions in the Code.-of Practice relating to bills of exceptions;</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Art. 487. If one of the parties calls upon the court to express an opinion on a point of law arising in the cause, such opinion may be excepted to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">Art. 488. The party 'excepting to the opinion of the court must draw a' bill of exceptions, in which the question of fact or of law, on which such opinion,has been demanded, may.be concisely set forth, as well as the grounds of the exception so taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">Art. 489. The bill of exceptions must be exhibited to the adverse party, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">In this ease it does not appear that the adverse party knew any thing of the matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">The objection, as stated, is inferred torn the language of the bill of exceptions, but is given, not in the form of an objection, but as a statement- of facts. Now, as it' does not appear what other evidence had been given, the bald question is raised whether, under any circumstances, a sealed instrument is admissible in evidence on proof of the handwriting of the parties. Carroll <em>v. </em>Peake, 1 Peters, 22, 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\">Upon the principle that the opinion of the court below must be regarded as sound until its incorrectness is made to appear, the plaintiff in error cannot prevail, unless he can show that no case could have existed in which the paper objected to could be considered in the light of an original document.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-10\">In that' case, the court, to sustain the judgment, would suppose that a paper, confessedly a copy, had been proved to be equal in credit to\" an original. Here they will presume it necessary that evidence was given which showed that the subscribing witness was dead or beyond the reach of the court, and that his handwriting could not be proved. In such a case, proof of the'handwriting of the parties was the only evidence which could be given, and the best the circumstances of the case permitted, and was therefore competent. Long <em>v. </em>Ramsay, 1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 72;</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-11\">It was held that a subscribing witness was not necessary to the validity of a deed, and that proof of the handwriting of the obligor was sufficient. 2 T. R. 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-12\">Where a'deed has come out of the hands of the other party, no proof of execution is' necessary. 7 Taunt. 251; 8 Gill &amp; Johns. 511.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-13\">In Maryland, the execution of an instrument in writing, to which there-is a subscribing witness, may be proved without calling said subscribing witness, though present iii court (this by statute). The case here was in Louisiana, where the rigid rules of the coipmon law are not recognized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-14\">3. This does\" not, however, seem to have been made a ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of objection; the specific objection is, that no proof is given of the time when the paper was signed, nor of the sealing and delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">The answer to this is, the paper, being proved, it proves the time by its date, and the sealing and delivery. The objection would be equally applicable in a case where, the death of the subscribing witness being proved, his handwriting was proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">The next distinct objection is, that it was a private act, not recorded, to which defendant was not a party, and of which he had notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">How far these objections were sustained in point of fact must depend upon the evidence which had been given. As we are utterly uninformed upon that point, it is impossible for this court to say that any error has been committed.\u2019 It is clear that such a paper needed no record to give it validity, as between the parties and those who, before they purchased and paid the purchase-money, were apprised of its existence. The language of the bill of exceptions is so ambiguous, that it is by no means clear that any notice had at any time been given to defendant, when such notice was given, or merely that he was not notified at the date of the execution of the paper.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-8\">Mr. Justice DANIEL</author>\n<p id=\"A8b\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">This is a writ of error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louitiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The defendant in error instituted a petitory action in the court just mentioned, to recover certain lands in Louisiana in the possession of James B. Gilmer, the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The petition of Poindexter sets forth, that by an act of Congress approved on the 30th day of May, 1834, entitled \u201c An Act granting to General Philemon Thomas a tract of land in consideration of military services, &amp;c.,\u201d the said Thomas was authorized to. enter, without payment, two sections of land on any of the.lands of the United States in Louisiana. That Thomas, on the 30th of January, 1835, sold to the petitioner this right of entry, and authorized him, or his substitute, to make the location in the name of Thomas. That the petitioner afterwards caused said location to be made on two sections of land in Louisiana,.north of Red River, one of which (de-' scribed in parcels) contained 619-,^ acres, and is the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">That after this location, viz. on the 27th of November, 1840, Thomas by notarial act transferred to the petitioner all the right, title, &amp;e., which he, Thomas, then had,.or thereafter might have, to the two sections so located, and authorized the petitioner to obtain a patent therefor in his own name.' That on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the 26th of March, 1841, a patent was issued for the lands to Thomas, by virtue of which, and of the sale and transfer of the 27th of November, 1840, the petitioner avers that he became the legal owner of the lands claimed, and is entitled to the possession thereof. That Gilmer has taken unlawful possession of one section of the land in township 19, range 14, and refused to surrender it to the petitioner, who therefore prays judgment for possession of the land, and for rents and profits. The agreements between Thomas and Poindexter of the 30th of January, 1835, and of the 27th day of November,, 1840-, and the patent to Thomas of the 26th day of March, 1841, referred to in the petition, were filed as exhibits therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The tenant in possession, Gilmer, after a general denial in his answer of any right or title to the land in the petitioner, alleges that he is the possessor and true owner of the land claimed, by purchase in good faith for valuable consideration from James W. Patten, by a notarial act executed in New Orleans on the 28th of May, 1844; that Patten\u2019s conveyance to him was with general warranty, and he therefore avouches Patten in warranty; and prays that, in the event of his eviction, he may have a recovery over against his warrantor, Patten, for the value of the land and improvements made by the defendant. This cause, according to the practice in the State- of Louisiana, was tried by the court, without the intervention of a jury, and the court, after hearing the parties, by its opinion expressed on the 10th day of May, but signed on the 28th of June, 1848, and considered as of the day last named, gave the following judgment, viz.: \u2014 \u201cIt is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, George Poindexter, and against the defendant, James B. Gilmer, for the premises described in the plaintiff\" petition, and that the said Gilmer surrender to the plaintiff the possession of the following described parcels of land, &amp;c., and that the plaintiff have a writ .of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>to place him in legal possession' thereof. The right of the plaintiff for mesne'profits' and of the defendants to sue for improvements, is reserved respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In addition to the documents above mentioned, filed as exhibits with the plaintiff\u2019s petition, there was offered in evidence on the part of the petitioner, and admitted by the court, an instrument of writing executed on the 20th day of November 1835,. between Poindexter and one Felix Huston, in which it was amongst other things recited, that the parties to that instrument had formed a partnership for the purposes of purchasing lands of the United States, or preemption rights, or en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tries of individuals, for the joint and mutual benefit of the parties ; and that the said Poindexter, having purchased of General Philemon Thomas his right to locate the quantity of twelve hundred and eighty acres of land on any of the public lands in Louisiana, granted by an act of. Congress passed on the 30th of June, 1834, and having .obtained of the said Thomas, on the 30th of January, 1835, a conveyance of his said right of entry, which yet remains unlocated, the said Poindexter agreed to convey to the said Huston his right of entry derived under the said deed, in the sanie, manner as he acquired the same from the Baid Philemon Thomas, so that the said entry may be made in the name' of the said Felix Huston, to be held by him for the joint and equal benefit of him the said George Poindexter, &amp;c. This instrument,' being a private declaration of trust between Poindexter and Huston, not evidenced by any record or other public acknowledgment of the, parties, was attested by a single witness, William Burns, who was not called at the trial to prove its execution, was received in evidence by the court without such proof, and its reception was excepted to for that caus\u00e9. It does not appear, moreover, that a knowledge of this instrument was brought home either to Patten or to Irwin, his attorney in fact, from whom Patten purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The plaintiff in error relied in the Circuit Court on the following proofs: \u2014 1st. On the act of Congress granting the right of entry to Thomas. 2dly. On the public act and conveyance from Thomas to Poindexter, as recited in the petition. 3dly. The plaintiff in error next adduced in proof a public and authentic act of sale and conveyance, on the 20th of November,' 1835, to Huston, in. absolute right, of all his, Poindexter\u2019s, title, interest, and estate in the grant to Thomas, then vested, or Which might vest at any future period. 4thly. The public authentic act of Huston, conveying the land in controversy with general warranty, on the 20th of January, 1844, and reciting in its terms the conveyance from Thomas to Poindexter of the 30tb of January, 1835, and that of Poindexter to Huston of the 20th of November, 1835,- and describing the land so conveyed .as that \u201cwhich was located by said Huston according to the provisions of the above-mentioned act of Congress.\u201d 5thly.. The public authentic act of Patten, constituting Irwin his attorney in fact to sell and convey the lands purchased of Huston. And 6thly, and -lastly, the conveyance by Patten, by his said attorney, Irwin, of the lands in controversy to Gilmer, the tenant in possession in March, 1844, with warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In considering this case, it is. proper to carry with us' throughout,. as a standard by which to test the proceedings in the Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>cuit Court and the decision founded upon them, this controlling principle, \u2014 that the petitory action is a proceeding at law for' the recovery of property, and can be maintained in the courts of the United States only where the right of possession can be shown, and, according to the principles'and distinctions settled in this court, corresponds in character with the action of ejectment at common'law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The petitioner or plaintiff, therefore, in a petitory action, must recover upon the strength of his title, and that must be a legal, as contradistinguished from' an equitable title. See United States <em>v. </em>King et al., 7 How. 846, 847, and Livingston <em>v. </em>Story, 9 Peters, 632. Tried by this rule, w\u00e9 are unable to perceive how the claim of Poindexter, as set forth in his petition, even if unaffected by his transactions with Huston, can be maintained in this action. The petitioner alleges that he purchased of Thomas his right of entry in virtue of the act of Congress, and received from Thomas a power to make a location in the name of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">By this transaction, no legal title to any certain or specific land was conveyed, for nothing specific or certain was then vested in Thomas, and the power of locating alleged in the petition was a power to locate, not in the name of Poindexter, but in that of Thomas. The petitioner proceeds to state, that, after these locations made by him, Thomas, by an authentic act before a notary public, on the 27th of November, 1840 (a copy of which is filed with the petition), transferred to the petitioner all the right, title, &amp;c., which he then had, or thereafter might have,, to the sections of land located in his name, and authorized. the petitioner to obtain a patent therefor. He further alleges, that afterwards, viz. on the 26th day of March, 1841, .a patent issued to Thomas for the lands located as aforesaid in his name, and that by virtue of these proceedings, viz. the transfer by Thomas in 1840, and the patent in 1841, the petitioner became invested with the legal title to the land in dispute. This alleged investiture of the legal title must have been supposed to rest upon an estoppel operated by the transfer and patent before mentioned, for, independently of such an operation, and by the literal terms of the patent, the title would certainly be in Thomas, and not in Poindexter. But we are of opinion that in this instance no estoppel has been operated. This legal effect can occur only where a party has conveyed a precise or definite legal estate or right, by a solemn assurance, which he will not be permitted to vary or to deny. It can have no operation to prevent the denial of an equitable transfer or title, which is not identical with the legal title or muniment of title which it may be relied on either to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Iish or protect. An estoppel, it is said, should be certain to every intent, and therefore, if a thing be not directly and precisely alleged, it shall not be estopped. Co. Lit. 303 <em>a, </em>352 b. So, too, it is laid down, that to the success of an estoppel it is obviously necessary that the grantor\u2019s want of a present vested estate should not appear on the deed itself, which would else contain internal evidence of its invalidity. 2 Sim. &amp; Stu. 519; 3 Adol. &amp; Ell. 12. And with regard to the mode of using an estoppel, it is said that it must be pleaded if there he an opportunity; otherwise, the party omitting to plead it waives the estoppel. See 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 457, and the authorities there cited. Again, it is ruled, that an equitable title cannot be estopped by a verdict at law, for there is no such thing as an estoppel in equity. See Com. Dig. <em>Estoppel </em>(\u00a7 1). Even upon the hypothesis, then, that the title set up by Poindexter under his agreement with Thomas could be regarded as a legal title, still upon .a comparison of the description of the property contained in those agreements with that of the land granted by the patent to Thomas, there is not that certainty and identity that are required by an estoppel, or such as will cause the land granted by the patent to Thomas to enure to Poindexter. But the right set-up by Poindexter under his contracts with Thomas remains strictly an equitable right, and therefore neither Thomas nor his alienee could be estopped from averring a right in the land contained in the patent, in opposition to such equitable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">But in another aspect of the question, supposing the interest transferred to Poindexter by the agreements with Thomas of January 30th, 1835, and May 14th, 1839, could be so construed as to have passed to the former a legal title; and admitting, too, that the description of the property contained in those agreements accorded in precise terms witn that of the lands granted to Thomas by the patent of March 20th, 1841, it would still remain to be inquired, whether Poindexter has not parted with his title, and would not in this aspect of the ease be estopped from setting it up against his alienee, and all claiming under such alienee.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It appears from the evidence which was before the court, and already adverted to in the statement of this case, that on the 20th day of November, 1835, Poindexter sold and conveyed, by his public authentic act, and in absolute right and estate, to F\u00e9lix Huston, all the right, title, interest, and claim which he then had, or thereafter might have, in and by virtue of an act of Congress of the 30th of June, 1834, granting to Philemon Thomas the quantity of twelve hundred and eighty acres of fend, to be located on any lands of the United States in Lou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>isiana, which said land was conveyed by the said Philemon Thomas to the said George Poindexter on the 30th day of January, 1835; it further appears, that from Huston a regular title, by public authentic acts and written assurances, is deduced down to the defendant in possession, Gilmer. It is true that, in order to countervail the foree of this title, the petitioner offered in evidence the agreement between himself and Huston of the 20th of November, 1835, creating a partnership between themselves, and purporting to convey to Huston all the title of Poindexter to the right of entry granted by act of Congress to Thomas, to be disposed of and applied by Huston for the benefit'of the partnership; but it is equally true, that this instrument, which was objected to by the plaintiff in error, was received without legal proof of its execution, and therefore should not have been admitted and considered by the court; and there being no proof in this record of any knowledge of the contents, or even of the existence, of this instrument'on the part of the purchasers under the absolute and public deed from Poindexter to Huston, their title thus derived, for aught that appears, cannot be affected by the former instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Upon the whole ease, the petitioner in the Circuit Court, having failed to establish a legal title in himself to the premises demanded, could not maintain his action, and the judgment of the court should have been for the defendant. It is therefore the opinion of this court, that the judgment of the Circuit Court be, and the same is hereby, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for\u2019the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court, for further proceedings to be had therein, in conformity to the opinion of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
