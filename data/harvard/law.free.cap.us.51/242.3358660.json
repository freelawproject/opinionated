The goods were purchased in March and April, 1849, but not shipped until about the 24th of July, 1849, when the market prices had risen very considerably.

We are required to pay duties upon an estimated and fictitious value, amounting, with charges, &amp;c., to $47,662.95, and we are compelled to enter the goods at their estimated and fictitious value to-save penalties and forfeitures, and to get possession of our property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-8\">\u201c We protest against being committed to any thing by the form of the entry, which we submit to upon compulsion, insisting that they are not \u00e1ccording to the truths of the transactions.

That the payment made in this case by the plaintiffs .to the defendant was a voluntary, and not a coercive payment; and so that the plaintiffs could not maintain their action ; that th\u00e9 evidence showed that the collector had been entirely passive in this whole matter, and had done no act, and made no demand, which compelled the plaintiffs to-pay the entire amount, which they did pay upon their own advisement; that the collector merely received the sum tendered to him by the plaintiffs,' and never made the payment a condition precedent to the delivery of the goods, nor threatened to raise the valuation expressed on the face of the invoice ; all that was done was done by the plaintiffs themselves voluntarily, without the least coercion or action on the part of the defendant, and that the verdict should therefore be in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\"><em>2. </em>That the acts done by the collector were all done in obedience, to written instructions made by circulars addressed by the Secretary of the Treasury to the collector (which are set out in schedule Z, annexed to this case), and in compliance with the acts of Congress therein referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-8\">That these instructions had all the authority of law, so far as the collector was concerned, and he could not disobey them. That all the money received by the collector in this case was collected by him in obedience to law, and paid immediately into the Treasury of the United States under a like compulsion, and that the collector could not be made liable to refund any part of this money to the plaintiffs, even although the construction put upon the revenue laws by the Secretary of the Treasury may have been erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-9\">That the act of Congress approved February 26th, 1845, en-' titled \u201c An Act explanatory of an Act making appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of government for the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine,\u201d did not apply to this case the defendant being compelled, by laws passed by Congress subsequently to that year, to pay over without delay into the: Treasury of the'United States all moneys received by him as't\u00edollect\u00f3p.arid that by authority of the case of Carey <em>v. </em>Curtiss (reported'in\u2018the third of Hammond\u2019s Reports, page 236) the defendant cojfld'not be made liable in this, action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-10\">3. That there was. no error in the proceedings at the custom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>house, the valuation there made being the true valuation according to law, and hence this action could not be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">Whereupon the court then and there charged and instructed the jury, that by law duties were only to be assessed upon the actual market value of the said plantain bark, or hemp, and sugar, at the time of their purchase by the plaintiffs, and not upon such market value at the time of their shipment by them ; and that the payment of duties by the plaintiffs upon the increased amount, being the difference between such market value at the time of shipment and at the time of purchase, was, on the part of the plaintiffs, a -payment by coercion, and having been accompanied with the' protest, the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict for the sum paid as duties on .such increased amount, with interest thereon from the' date of its payment; that the fact that the defendant, in taking duties upon the market value pf the merchandise at the time of shipment, had acted in obedience to the circular instructions to that effect from the Secretary of the Treasury, did not render' such mode of assessment of duties legal, or preclude the plaintiffs from recovering the excess paid by them above the duties upon the market value of the merchandise at the time of its purchase. And the court further refused to charge or instruct the jury in conformity with the points insisted upon by the- defendant\u2019s counsel, and in conformity with which he had prayed the court to charge and instruct the jury as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">And thb counsel for said defendant then and there excepted ~to-the said charge of the court, and to the refusal of the court to charge the jury i-n conformity with which the said counsel had so prayed the court to charge the jury, as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">And thereupon the jurors of the jury aforesaid found a verdict for the plaintiffs for three thousand two hundred and six dollars and forty-four cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">And because the said several matters so offered and given in evidence, and the matters insisted upon by the said defendant, and the decision of the said court, and the charge of the said court, and the said exceptions taken to the same, do not appear by the record of the verdict aforesaid, the said defendant has caused the same to be written on this bill of exceptions, to be annexed to said record, and has prayed the said justice, holding the said court, to set his hand and seal to the same. Whereupon the said, the honorable Samuel Nelson, the associate jus-' tice before whom the said issue was tried, and the said exceptions were taken, has hereto set his hand and seal, this 2d day of January, in the year 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">S.

' The duties were exacted by coercion and duress, and were not a voluntary payment without condition or reserve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">II. The right to maintain this action under the act of 26th February, 1845, is not impaired or taken away by laws or circulars of a date prior or subsequent thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-10\">III. The dutiable value of the merchandise was illegally estimated and appraised by the appraisers and collector, at the market prices of the period of shipment, and their'acts, being illegal thereon, are not conclusive on the importer, but are null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-11\">1. The payment was coercive and by duress, and not voluntary and without reserve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-12\">The sovereignty of-the United States has, as its incident, the power to prohibit imports and lay impost duties, and in the exercise thereof has appointed officers to execute its regulations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-13\">Boarding officers are to search and seal boxes, &amp;c.- Act of 1799, c. 22, \u00a7 97. Masters and mates are fined 11000 for allowing merchandise to be landed without permit and in open day (1799, c. 22, \u00a7 27), and merchandise so landed is forfeited (1799,-c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 50).</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-14\">The collector and naval officers are to estimate the duties in gross, and indorse the amount on entry (1799, c. 22, \u00a7 21, 49), and no permit to land is granted until this amount is paid' (1799, c.- 22, \u00a7 62), and a bond for redelivery of the merchandise on demand of the collector is executed according to the act of. 1830, c. 147, \u00a7 8 (4 Stat. at Large, 411.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq6\">The entry, which is 'to be made before the goods are landed (1799, c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 27, &amp;c,), is to be sworn to by. the importer, and on it he has to make the additions, which, by \u00a7 8 of the tariff act of 1846, are authorized in the cases of purchased goods; and if the additions are not then made, th'e Secretary of the Treasury refuses to relieve under the act of 1797, March 3d, from any penalty that may be inflicted where the appraisers put up the value (see Circular of Secretary of the Treasury, 11th June, 1849), and in remitting the penalty, only the half of the United States would be returned, if the residue shall have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>been distributed' among the officers of the customs (Circular, 25th May, 1845).</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">The Circular of 6th July, 1847, had expressly directed all appraisements to be based on the market values at time of shipment, instead of the time of purchase, and under this and the subsequent circulars the importers would inevitably have suffered the penalty, had they not raised their invoice-purchase prices to the market values of shipment'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">Upon suspicion by the collector of intended fraud in stating the value, or otherwise, the importer is liable, after entry, to have the goods seized (Act of 1842, c. 270, \u00a7 21, 5 Stat. at Large, 565; 1799, e. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 66, 67; Rankin <em>v. </em>Hoyt, 4 Howard, 333); and if the importer succeeds in establishing his good faith, he still cannot recover from the United States the costs expended by him. See 3 Howard, 252, opinion of Justice Story; Shaw <em>v. </em>Woodcock, 7 Barn. &amp; Cres. 73, 84; Irving <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 T.

The right to maintain this action, under the act of 26th February, 1845, e. 22 (5 Stat. at Large, 729), is not impaired or taken hway by laws and circulars of a date prior or subsequent thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">The power given to the Secretary of the Treasury, under \u00a7\u00a7 23, 24 of the tariff act of 1842, to establish \u201c regulations not inconsistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d <em>to </em>secure just and impartial appraisals of goods, is a special and very guarded power, and is but a repetition of former similar provisions.

Tracey <em>v. </em>Swartwout, 10 Peters, 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-11\">The act of 1839, March 3d, \u00a7 2, was in effect but the reiteration of former provisions of law (1799, c. 22, \u00a7 21, 1 Stat. at Large, 644); nor is there any act subsequent to 1839 that overrules the act of February 26th, 1845.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-12\">The second clause or the act of 26th February, 1845, provides for the maintaining of actions'and trials by jury for subsequent extortions, and any enactment to repeal this provision must be wholly repugnant to and inconsistent with it, or the two Laws must, consist together as part of an entire system; and the courts will jealously restrict the construction of laws exempting officers from responsibility for oppression in the exercise of powers which tend to produce fines and penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>(Jones <em>v. </em>Estis, <em>2 </em>Johns. 379), which derogate from the common law (19 Vin.

Such steps were taken by the collector in the cases reported in 2 Mason, and 4 Howard, 327.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">The fluctuation of the markets in foreign countries makes the period when the value is estimated a matter of substance, and is of far more importance than the non-compliance with requirements of form alone, which have been adjudged sufficient to destroy the validity of acts, and subject the actors to damages jin suits at law when executing specially delegated powers or summary proceedings, the performance of which must be strictly carried out, because they tend to produce fines and p\u00e9names,' to derogate from the common law, and from the rights of property, and to appropriate private property to public use, which, being, contrary to natural right and justice, is only tolerated in cases of necessity, and upon full compensation.

In respect to the first one, which related to the proper time for fixing the value of goods imported from -the country of their growth or manufacture, this court there held it was the time of their procurement when not purchased, and the time of their purchase when they had\" been actually purchased abroad, rather than the time of their \u2018 exportation or shipment. The goods in this case were valued at the' latter, time, though they had been previously -purchased, and at-a lower price. For the reasons assigned in the other case, the instruction given that this time was wrong, must be considered legal,</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">Another point decided in Greely <em>v. </em>Thompson et. al., and which is a ground of exception here, was, that though the ..money was collected in obedience to orders from the Treasury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Department, which the collector, so far as regards the Department, was bound to follow, yet this did not justify him as to others, or bar a recovery by third persons if not liable in law to pay so high duties. . For the reasons there Assigned, this exception is likewise one which cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The other points in that case do not arise here, but one does arise which did not exist there, and which we now proceed to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The importer had put in his invoice the price actually paid for the goods, with charges, and proposed to enter them at the value thus fixed. But the collector concluded in that event to have them appraised, and the value would then, by instructions and usage at New York, be ascertained as at the time of the shipment, which was consid\u00e9rably higher, and would probably subject the importer, not only to pay more duties, but to suffer a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The importer protested against this, but'in order to avoid the penalty, under such a wrong appraisal, adopted the follow-. ing course.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">This being a case of purchase of goods abroad; and not procurement, it came clearly within the eighth section of the act of 1846, and therefore the importer, as that act permits, was allowed to- make, and did make, an addition to his invoice, so as to escape the penalty, by means' of the addition, and the payment of the consequent increased duties. (Pamphlet Laws for 1846, p. 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">This increase of. duties, thus obtained, the present action is instituted to recover back, they having been paid under protest and unwillingly. The government, however, insist that this excess of duties was caused and paid voluntarily, and hence, though illegal, cannot be recovered back. If they were paid voluntarily, some precedents would seem to countenance the inability to sustain this suit. Elliot <em>v. </em>Swartwout, 10 Peters, 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">But the gist of the point is, were these increased duties in truth paid voluntarily, in the meaning of. that term as applicable to the present subject? We have already seen, that the importer did not at first propose to enter his goods of such a value as to justify these increased duties. On the contrary, he insisted on entering them at only the price for which he purchased them, with\u2019charges, and thus agreeing with his original invoice, while the collector' virtually insisted on having them appraised at their increased value as at the time of the shipment, such being the usage in.the custom-house at New York,' and such the requirement of the circular of the Secretary of the Treasury, November 24th, 1846, The importer, knowing that-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>this would subject him to a severe penalty, in order to avoid it, felt compelled to add to his invoice the amount which the price had risen between the purchase and the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">But this addition and consequent payment of the higher duties were so.far from voluntary in him, that he accompanied them with remonstrances against being thus coerced to do the act in order to escape a greater evil, and accompanied the payment with a protest against the legality of the course pursued towards him.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Now, it can hardly be meant in this class of cases, that, to make a payment involuntary, it should be by actual violence, or any physical duress. It suffices, iUthe payment is caused on the one part by an illegal demand, and made on the other part reluctantly and in consequence of that illegality, and without being able to regain possession of his property except by submitting to the payment. (See cases cited hereafter.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">All these requisites existed here. We have already decided, that the demand for such an increased appraisal was illegal. The appraisal itself, as made, was illegal. The raising of .the invoice was thus caused by these illegalities in order to escape a greater burden in the penalty. The payment of the increased duties thus caused was wrongfully imposed on the importer, and was submitted.to merely as a choice of evils.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">He was unwilling to pay either the excess of duties or the penalty, and must be considered, therefore, as forced into one or the other by the collector, <em>colore </em>officii, through the invalid and illegal course pursued in having the appraisal made of the value at- the wrong period, however well meant may have been the views of the collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The money was thus obtained by a moral duress, not justified by law, and which was not submitted to by the importer,except to regain possession of his property withheld from him. on grounds manifestly wrong. Indeed, it seems sufficient to sustain the action, whether under the act of February -26th, 1845, or under principles of the common law, if the duties exacted were not legal, and were demanded and were paid under protest. 5 Stat. at Large, 727; Clinton <em>v. </em>Strong, 9 Johns. 370; 11 Wheaton; 1 Miller, 536; 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 139; Irving <em>v. </em>Chitsowdt, 4 D. &amp; E. 485, 553 ; Cowp. 69, 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Ail these circumstances existed here, and hence the .judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of-the United States, for the Southern District of New York, and was argued by counsel.
