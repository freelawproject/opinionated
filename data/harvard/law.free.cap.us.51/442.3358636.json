Jehiel Brooks and others, Defendants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-5\">A supplementary article to a treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians', providing that certain persons \u201c shall have their right to the said four leagues of land reserved'for them and their heirs and assigns for ever. The said lands to be taken out of the lands ceded to the United States by the said Caddo nation of Indians, as expressed in the treaty to which these articles are supplementary. And the four leagues of land shall be laid off,\u201d &amp;e., \u2014 gave to the reservees a fee simple to all the rights which the Caddoes had in those lands, as fully as any patent from the government could make one. Nothing further was contemplated by the treaty to perfect the title.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\">This case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">The facts are very fully set forth in the opinion of the court, to which the reader is referred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-8\">It was argued by <em>Mr. Crittenden </em>(Attorney-General), for the United States, and <em>Mr. Walker\u00a1 </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-9\"><em>Mr. Crittenden </em>made the following points: \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-10\">I. That the first supplementary article of the treaty does not make a grant or reservation in favor of the Grappes of four leagues of land, but the true meaning and import is simply that the Grappes shall have <em>their right, </em>whatever it may be, to the four leagues of land stated as being reserved to them in 1801, in the preamble.: and there was, therefore, error in the refusal of the court to give the first instruction prayed for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-11\">This, it is contended, is the true construction. The language of the second supplementary article, relating to the donation to Edwards, is very different in its terms, and imports a present grant. \u201c There <em>shall be reserved </em>to Larkin' Edwards, &amp;c., one section of land.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-12\">II. That the recital of the reservation to the Grappes, in 1801 does not relieve the defendants from producing the primordial title on which they must rely, and the court, therefore, erred in refusing to give the second instruction prayed for, and in charging as it did on this point under the second head of the charge as given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-13\">The law of Louisiana, borrowed froth the civil law, is against the court below. The 2251st article of the Code declares that \u201c recognitive acts do not dispense with the exhibition of the primordial title, unless its tenor be there specially set forth.\u201d In this case its .tenor is not set forth, and the primordial title must therefore be produced. The recognitive act is no proof of the contents of the primordial, even when the latter is fully set forth, unless it also be shown that the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>is lost. 1 Evans\u2019s Pothier, \u00a7\u00a7 742,743, p. 443; Brooks <em>v. </em>Norris, 6 Rob. 181.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">Bat had the Spanish authorities in 1801 any power to authorize and sanction the reservation ? That they had no such power has been decided many times in this court, in-the case of the Perdido boundary. The country embraced within the limits of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi, stretched far beyond even the Sabine, and it was not until the treaty with Spain of 1819, that the -United States relinquished their claim to it, and ceded what lay west of that river to Spain. The United States claimed it from the first. In the act of 20th February, 1811 (2 Stat. at Large, 641), to authorize the people of the Temtory of Orleans to form a State government, the Sabine is declared to be the western boundary of the new State. Besides, it is to be remembered, that the fourteenth section of the act of 26th March, 1804 (2 Stat. at Large, 287),- declares that all grants, and every act and proceeding subsequent to the treaty of St. Ildefonso, of whatsoever nature, towards the obtaining of any grant, title, or claim to land in Louisiana, under whatsoever authority transacted or presented; shall be null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">In addition to all this, it may' here be mentioned that the Caddoes themselves never claimed Rush Island, or ever used it in \u2019 any way. It was occupied by whites, and was never intended by the Caddoes to be included in the treaty or given to the Grappes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-7\">TII. That by the law of Spain.the Caddo' Indians had no primitive title to any land, and had no power to alienate without consent of the Spanish authorities; and these authorities at Natchitoches had no right to sanction the donation mentioned in the preamble and supplementary article. Mitchel et al. <em>v. </em>The United States, 9 Pet. 714. The Spanish office'rs at Natchitoches had no control over the Caddoes, the territory they inhabited being within the jurisdiction of the post of Nacogdoches. See 2 Martin\u2019s History of Louisiana, 202,203,261, 262; see also House Doc. No. 49,1st Session, 24th Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-8\">IV. That there was error in the court refusing to give the fourth instruction prayed for, because the matters therein mentioned^ were part of the history and public archives of the country, on which it was the' duty of the court to inform the jury.' See the state papers above referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-9\">\u25a0 V. That the court erred in refusing to give the fifth instruction prayed for, and in charging as in the third point of the charge given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-10\">VI. That if there is no title in Brooks, there can be none in the purchasers under him</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>VII. That the court erred in not admitting as evidence in the cause the letter of General Cass to Mr. Garland, of the 17th-of March, 1836, and the memorial of the Caddoes to the Senate of the United States, of the 19th of September, 1837, and the report of the House and depositions therein, and in th\u00e9 case of Brooks <em>v. </em>Norris; and in admitting copies of the affidavits of David, Trichel, and D\u2019Ortlont.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-5\"><em>Mr. Walker's </em>points were as follows: \u25a0\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\">1. Defendants\u2019 title rests upon a grant by treaty to the Grappes, a <em>bona fide </em>sale by them to Jehiel Brooks, and a <em>bona fide </em>sale of part of the land by him to the other defendahts. The treaty of 1st July, 1835, being ratified and corr irmed by the President and Senate, becomes the supreme law, and cannot be set aside by the courts, on any ground whatever, not even upon an allegation of fraud. Const. U. S., art. 6, \u00a7 2; Story on Const., 684, 686; Foster &amp; Elam <em>v. </em>Neilson, 2 Peters, 254, 306, 307; 6 Peters, 711, 738; 3 Peters\u2019s Digest, 654, 655, Nos. 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12; 1 Kent, 286,287; 6 Cranch, 136, 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-8\">2. The boundaries of the Indian lands ceded to the United States by the treaty are fixed therein, and cannot now be disputed by either party thereto, nor can they be altered but by the consent of both parties; the right of the Indians to the lands ceded is admitted by the treaty, and by the general policy of the government in treating with them. Story on Const., 379 et seq., \u00a7\u00a7 532,535; 12 Peters, 516, 725; 14 Peters, 13, 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-9\">3. The boundaries cannot be varied by parol proof, because, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-10\">1st. The United States are parties to the treaty, which is</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-11\">in writing, and cannot be varied or contradicted by them. 2 Peters\u2019s Digest, 234 et seq., Nos. 898, 903, 904, 909, 921, 922, 933.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-12\">2d. The treaty is part of the supreme law of the land, and cannot be varied or contradicted by parol proof. 2 Peters\u2019s Digest, 153, No. 35; 161, No. 128; 172, No. 238.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-13\">4. The treaty, by its terms, declared that the Caddo Indians had previously donated the lands in dispute to the Grappes, the defendants\u2019 vendors, and confirmed that donation to them; which treaty having, the force of a law, it is equal in dignity and effect to a complete \u00bf/-ant by the United States, and they cannot go beyond that grant 9 Pet. 746; Johnson v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 571; 6 Peters, 342; 2 Howard, 344.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-14\">5. The motives that induced the President and Senate to ratify the treaty containing this grant, or the reasons, if any, that should have influenced them to reject that part of-the .treaty, are not proper Subjects of inquiry in any court, but all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>such acts must be received as conclusive on all subjects within the scope of their power. 6 Cranch, 129, 131; Story on Const. 567.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\">6. Congress cannot, by legislation in any form, divest a citizen of rights acquired under a treaty, or previous act of Congress. 6 Cranch, 132, 133, 135.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">7. Brooks is a <em>bon\u00e1 fide </em>purchaser from the Grappes, who acquired a good legal title under the treaty, which title cannot be questioned by the grantors of his vendors. 6 Cranch, 133, 134; Story on Const. 567.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">8. Fraud cannot be charged on Brooks, as United States commissioner, in negotiating the treaty, without charging the same on the President and Senate, for he was their agent, and they made his act their own by their confirmation of the treaty. Story on Const. 557.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">,9. Congress have not authorized the inquiry of <em>fraud </em>to be made, but expunged it from the House resolutions, 38. Resolution of Congress, 30th August: 1842 (5 Stat, at Large, 584).</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-9\">10. The fact of Brooks having been commissioner to negotiate the treaty did not disqualify him from purchasing long afterwards, and when his functions had ceased, land reserved in said treaty, and such purchase is no evidence of fraud in negotiating the treaty. 2 Peters\u2019s Digest, 357; 3 Wash. C. C. R. 556 et seq.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-10\">11. The question of fraud was, however, submitted by the court to the jury, and decided in favor of the defendants, as appears by the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-11\">12.

After the narrative*, our conclusion will be brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The case is brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisi\u00e1na.'</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It was a petition filed by the United States in consequence of the passage of the following joint resolution of both houses of Congress, on the 30th of August, 1842: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201c <em>Resolved, </em>&amp;c,, That the District Attorney of the United States for the Western District of Louisiana be, and is hereby, directed to institute such legal proceedings in the proper court as may be necessary to vindicate the right of the United States to Rush Island, which is alleged to have been improperly, included in the limits of the lands ceded by the Caddo .Indians to the United States, by the treaty of the 1st July, 1835, and reserved by said treaty in favor of certain persons by the name of Grappe.\u201d (5 Stat. at Large, 584).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6l\">The facts in the .case were these.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">On the 28th of January, 1835, the President of the United States received the following letter from the Caddo Indians: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201c. <em>To his Excellency the President of the United States.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">\u201c The memorial of the undersigned, chiefs and head men of the Caddo nation of Indians, humbly represents : \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">\u201c That they are now the same nation of people they were, and inhabit the same country and villages they did, when first invited to hold council with their new brothers, the Americans, thirty years (sixty Caddo years) ago ; and our traditions inform us that our villages have been established where they now stand ever since the first Caddo was created, before the Americans owned Louisiana. The French, and afterwards the Spaniards, always treated us as friends and brothers. No -white man ever settled on our lands, and we were assured they never should. We were told the same things by the Americans in our\u2019 first council at Natchitoches, and that we could not sell our lands to any body but our great father the President. Our two last agents, Captain Grey and Colonel Brooks, have driven a great many bad white people off from our lands; but now our last-named agent tells us that he is no longer our agent, and that we no longer have a gunsmith or blacksmith, and says he does not know what will be done with us or for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">\u201c This heavy news has put us- in great trouble. We have held a great council, and finally come to the sorrowful resolution of offering all our lands to you, Which lie within the boundary of the United States, for sale, at such price as we oan agree on in council one with the other. These lands are bounded on one side by the Red River, on another side by Bayou Pascagoula, Bayou and Lake. Wallace, and the Bayou Cypress; and on the other side by Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201c We have never consented to any reservation but one, to be taken out of these lands, and that was made a great many years- ago. The Caddo nation then gave to their greatest and best friend, called by them Touline, but known to all the white people by the name of Francois Grappe, and to his three sons then born, one league of land eaeh, which was to be laid off, commencing ait the lowest corner of our lands on the Red River, (as above described,) and running up the river four leagues, and one league from that line back, so as to make four leagues of land. We went with our friend and brother Touline (otherwise Grappe) before the Spanish authority, and saw it put down in writing, and gave our consent in writing, and the Spanish authority ratified our gift in writing. But, before the Americans came, our brother\u2019s house .was burned, and the writings- we have mentioned were consumed in it. Touline (otherwise Grappe) was a half-blood Caddo ; his father was a Frenchman, and had done good things for his son when a boy. When he grew to be a man, he returned among us, and continued near to us till he died. He was always our greatest counsellor for good. He was our\" French, Spanish, and American interpreter, for a great many years; our brother now is dead, but his sons live.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\"><em>\u201c </em>We, therefore, the chiefs and head men of the Caddo nation, pray that the United States will guarantee to the sons now living of our good brother, deceased, Touline (otherwise Grappe), the whole of our original gift, \u2014 four leagues to him and to them; and your memorialists further pray, that your Excellency will take speedy measures to treat with us,for the purchase of the residue of our lands, as above described, so that we may obtain some relief from our pressing necessities; and your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray,\u201d &amp;c.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">This letter was signed by twenty-four chiefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Upon the back of this memorial, the President made the following indorsement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201c The President incloses to the Secretary of War the memorial of the Caddo chiefs, for his consideration, whether it will not be proper to appoint a commissioner, to obtain a complete cession of their lands to the United States.

The said chiefs, head men, and warriors would further represent unto your honorable body, ttiat Jehiel Brooks told one of the chiefs that one Jacques Grappe requested him to ask the Indians for a piece of land on Red River, in the .bottom and on the east side of the Bayou Pierre (the western water of Red River); that the said chief told Mr. Brooks that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>it was not their land, and Mr. Brooks told him that it was their land. The chief then told Mr. Brooks that, if it was their land, he was willing to give Jacques Grappe a little piece; but that they never made any reserve to Francois Grappe, or any of his heirs or representatives, by the treaty, within the limits of land they claimed or sold to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201c In witness of the truth of the above statement the said chiefs, head men, and warriors have hereunto set their hands, the day of the date above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On the 22d of May, 1838, a committee of the Senate reported that Rush Island never belonged to the Caddo Indians, and recommended a confirmation of the titles of certain settlers who were living on it anterior to the treaty between the United States and Caddoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In 1840, memorials were again presented to Congress by these last-mentioned settlers, and much testimony was taken by the authority of Mr. Bell, chairman of the committee to whom the memorials were referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In April, 1842, a committee of the House of Representatives reported in favor of confirming the titles of these settlers, an\u2019d on the 6th of July, 1842, an act of Congress was passed confirming them.

The claim of the United States is thus set forth in the petition : \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">\u201c Petitioners allege, that they are the true and lawful owners of the above-described land and premises, and that the pretended claim of the said possessors is illegal, invalid, and fraudulent; that by the treaty of cession of the province of Louisiana by the French Republic to the United States of America, and by the treaty between Spain and the United States of America in 1819, the United States succeeded to all the rights of France and Spain, as they then were in and over said province, including all-lands which were not private property, and that the aforesaid tract of land, ever since the said treaties, remained vested in the said plaintiffs, who are now the true and legal owners of the same; that plaintiffs have suffered damage to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, by the disturbance and occupation of said land by said possessors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">On the 18th of March, 1846, Brooks answered the petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>He set forth the treaty, its ratification and proclamation; alleged that the heirs of Grappe acquired a perfect title under the reservation which he had since purchased, and that under the joint resolution of Congress the District Attorney of the-United States was not authorized to allege fraud against him. as commissioner; that he had sold and delivered sundry parts of the land to other persons, who were also defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On the 13th of April, 1846, the District Attorney of the United States filed the following notice to the defendants of certain evidence which he proposed to offer upon the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u201c United States <em>v. </em>Jehiel Brooks et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u201c The defendants in the above-entitled cause will take notice that the plaintiffs will offer, as evidence on the trial of this cause, so much of Report 1035 of the House of Representatives of the United States of the 27th Congress, second session, as is hereafter mentioned, to wit: The various reports of the '.committees embraced in this report, and the following depositions, that of Lewis Naville Rembin, Charles Rembin, Thomas Wallace, Jacob Irwin, Joseph Valentine, Sylvester Poi'ssot, Cesair Lafitee, John Joseph Le Bars, Michel Lattier, Francis Lattier, Pierre Rubio, Manuel Lafitte, D. M. Heard, Athanase Poissot, and all the depositions which were taken on the'part of the United States embraced in this report aforesaid ;\u2022 also, plaintiffs will offer in evidence the same depositions, embraced in a similar report and admitted by consent of parties in a suit between Jehiel Brooks <em>v. </em>Samuel Norris, in the District Court of the parish of Caddo, in said State, said Norris holding title under the United States, on Rush Island, in which the same issues were made as in this suit, and said'Brooks, plaintiff in that suit and defendant in this. Defendants are hereby notified to make objection, if any they have, on Friday the 17th instant, why the testimony aforesaid should not be admitted on the trial of this cause; said reports and depositions are herewith filed for reference,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">On- the 28th of April, 1846, the court overruled so much of the above motion as proposed to introduce, as evidence, the report made by a committee of Congress, and disposed of the remaining part of the motion, viz. that part of it which proposed to introduce certain .testimony, by the following order, applicable to that part of the motion : \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\u201c United States <em>v. </em>Jehiel Brooks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">\u201c <em>United States Circuit Court, District of </em>Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\u201cBe it remembered, that on the 13th of April, 1846, a rule \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>was taken in this cause by the plaintiffs, calling on the defendants to show cause on the 17th of the same month why the depositions of certain witnesses named in said rule, and taken as therein stated, should not be read in evidence in this cause, when the same shall come on to be tried, as appears in said rule, which is hereunto annexed, and made a part of this bill of exceptions; and on the said 17th of April, 1846, Jehiel Brooks, by his counsel, Thomas H. Lewis, appeared and showed cause against the said rule, and contended that the said rule ought to be dismissed and discharged on the following grounds:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201c 1st. The court cannot entertain this rule at the present stage of the suit, because the only law authorizing such a rule is an act of the legislature of- the State of Louisiana, entitled \u2018 An Act to amend the Code of Practice,\u2019 approved March 20, 1839, (see Acts 1839, page 108, section 17,) and said act does not apply to the present case, but is only applicable to depositions taken under commissions issued by the court, and in the suit in which such depositions are offered as evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\"><em>\u201c </em>2d. The court cannot be called upon to decide upon the admissibility of any evidence in a cause before the same shall come on for trial, except in the case pointed out in said act of 20th March, 1839, and these depositions do not fall within the exception provided for by that act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201c 3d. These depositions were not taken in any action or suit pending before any judicial tribunal, or by authority of any tribunal having power to decide upon title to property, or to bind parties litigant by its decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201c 4th. There is no evidence before the court of any such suit as that of Jehiel Brooks <em>v. </em>Samuel Norris, or that these depositions were read in evidence, by consent or otherwise, on the trial of such suit, and these facts are not admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\u201c 5th. If such a suit as Brooks <em>v. </em>Norris did exist, and if said depositions were read in evidence on the trial thereof, still they are not admissible in this cause, because the parties to this suit are not the same as the parties to that of Brooks <em>v. </em>Norris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">\u201c \"Which grounds of objection being sustained by the court, the counsel for plaintiffs tendered this bill of exceptions, which was signed and sealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">(Signed,) \u2022* Theo.

Durant). filed a .petition that the case might be tried by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">In the early part of the year 1848, the defendants, other than Brooks,, named in statement, filed their answers, averring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>they were <em>bon\u00e1 fide </em>purchasers for a valuable consideration, without notice of any fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On the 2d of May, 1848, the cause came on to be heard, and a jury was impanelled, who, on the 5th of May, found a verdict for the defendants, and judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The four following bills of exceptions were taken during the progress of the trial: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u201c No. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The United States <em>v. </em>Jehiel Brooks et al.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\" In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Fifth Circuit and District of Louisiana, Honorable T.

T. H.

That the first of the supplementary articles to the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians, made at the agency-house of the Caddo, nation on the 1st of July, 1835, does not amount in law to a grant of four leagues of land from the United States to Francois Grappe and his sons, nor does it amount in law to a reservation then made of said lands to. the said Grappes, but it is simply a reservation of whatever right the said Grappes may have acquired to said land by the donation mentioned in the preamble to the supplementary articles to the said treaty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\">\u201c Second. That the recital in the said preamble and supplementary articles, of a donation to the Grappes in 1801, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>not relieve the defendants from the necessity of producing tbe primordial title or donation of 1801, nor does said recital prove the existence of said donation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201c Third. That by the laws of Spain, which governed the <em>locus in quo </em>in 1801, the Indians had no primitive title to any' land on this continent; and that in 1801 the Spanish authority at Natchitoches had no legal right to ratify and confirm the donation recited in tlie aforesaid preamble and supplementary articles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c Fourth. That, by the laws and usages of the government of the United States, the Caddo Indians did not hold their land by the usual Indian title, but that they had been merely permitted to live upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201c Fifth. That the legal construction of the Caddo treaty of the 1st of July, 1838, is, that those Indians merely relinquished to the United States their permissive possession of the lands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Sixth. That, as all the other defendants, besides Brooks, are his vendees, and hold title under him, if the jury think from the evidence that Brooks has no title to the land, then that the other defendants stand in the same category, and are also without title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">\u201c But the court refused so to charge the jury, and did charge them as follows : \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\"><em>\u201c </em>First. That the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians on the 1st of July, 1835, and the articles supplementary thereto, having been ratified by the President and Senate of the United States, is part of the supreme law of the land, and as such must be respected and enforced by the courts of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">\u201c Second. That the first supplementary article to the said treaty, and the preamble thereof, contain a recognition of title in Francois Grappe and his three sons to the land described in said preamble and article, and dispensed them, and those who hold under them, from producing any other title to said lands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\"><em>\u201c </em>Third. That the United States, by treating with the Caddo Indians for the purchase of their lands, recognized in said Indians a right to said lands, similar to the rights to lands generally recognized in Indian tribes with whom the United States have made treaties. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">Fourth. That the testimony offered on behalf of the United States, to prove the lands reserved by the treaty in question to the Grappes had been fraudulently included within the limits of the territory ceded to the United States by the Caddo Indians, by the defendant, Jebiel Brooks, while acting as commissioner of the United States in making said treaty, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>properly admitted to be read to the jury, and they should consider the same; and if they found said Brooks guilty of fraud, they should find a verdict for plaintiffs against said Brooks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201c Fifth. That the other defendants stood in a different light before the court from Brooks, and the jury should inquire (if they found fraud in Brooks) whether said defendants had notice or knowledge of such fraud when they purchased the land held by them ; and if the.jury believed, from the evidence, that these other defendants (purchasers from Brooks) had notice or knowledge of such fraud, they should find also against them. But if, on the contrary, these purchasers had no such knowledge or notice, then the fraud in Brooks, their vendor, would not affect their title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201c Whereupon the attorney of the United States for the District of Louisiana excepted to the said refusal and charge, and tenders this as his bill of exceptions, which he prays may be signed and made part of the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(Signed,) Theo. H. McCaleb, <em>U S. Judge.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">A -writ of error, sued out on behalf of the United States, brought these several rulings before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Such is the history of this transaction before and since it was brought into court by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">All of us concur in opinion, that no exception was taken by the counsel of. the United States-to the rulings of the District Court in this cause, which can be sustained here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">- -We think that the treaty gave to the Grappes a fee simple title to ail the rights which the Caddoes had in these lands, as fully as any patent from the government could make one. The reservation to the Grappes, \u201ctheir heirs and assigns for ever,\u201d creates as absolute a fee as any subsequent act upon the part of the United States could make. Nothing further was contemplated by the treaty to perfect the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Brooks'being the alienee of the Grappes for the entire reservation, he may hold it against any claim of the United States, as his alienors would have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">We have nothing to do, in our consideration of the case, with the conjectural intimations, which were made in the argument of it, concerning the influences -which were used to secure the reservation, or the designs of the commissioner in having it done. The record shows that he became a purchaser for a valuable consideration. Whether for an adequate one is not for us to say. His right to the land against the claim of the United States, as that has been asserted in this case, we think good, and we shall direct the judgment of the, court below to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was' argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
