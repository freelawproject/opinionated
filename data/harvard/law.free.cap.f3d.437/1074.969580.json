Barnes filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996); therefore the provisions of that act govern his appeal. Barnes argues that the filing of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 motion for a new trial either became a part of the direct appeal of his conviction and sentence or, in the alternative, tolled the one-year limitation for timely filing his \u00a7 2255 motion. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-21\">On June 23, 2004, Barnes, a federal prisoner serving a 235-month sentence for knowingly enticing an individual to travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), filed a motion to vacate, correct, or set aside his federal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">The record reflects that- Barnes was convicted and sentenced on October 31, 2000, and filed a direct appeal on November 1, 2000. On December 12, 2001, while his direct appeal was still pending, Barnes filed a Rule 33 motion for a new trial in the district court based on newly discovered evidence. Shortly thereafter, on January 17, 2002, we affirmed Barnes\u2019s convictions and sentences in an unpublished opinion. Barnes then filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>with the Supreme Court, which was denied on October 7, 2002. <em>See Barnes v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 829, 123 S.Ct. 126, 154 L.Ed.2d 43 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">On August 1, 2002, after we had affirmed Barnes\u2019s convictions and sentences, but prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of <em>certiorari,. </em>the district court entered its order denying Barnes\u2019s motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing. Barnes appealed the district court\u2019s order, and we affirmed in an unpublished opinion dated May 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Based on the foregoing, the government argued that Barnes\u2019s conviction became final more than two years before he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion, making his application untimely under the AEDPA, and that Barnes\u2019s motion for a new trial did not stop the one-year clock from running. Barnes responded that, because his motion for a new trial was filed while his direct appeal was still pending, it was filed before the one-year limitation period began to run, and it would have wasted judicial resources to require him to file a \u00a7 2255 <em>motion </em>while awaiting the district court\u2019s ruling on his new trial motion. Barnes further argued that his Rule 33 motion should be treated as a direct, not collateral attack, on his conviction, should preserve his right to pursue a \u00a7 2255 motion, and, therefore, the one-year limitation period should be deemed to have begun on the date that we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial. In the alternative, Barnes requested that the court equitably toll the one-year limitation period while his motion for a new trial remained pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">The magistrate judge issued ,a report recommending that Barnes\u2019s motion be dismissed as time-barred, finding that nothing in AEDPA prevented a defendant from choosing between filing a Rule 33 motion for a new trial or filing a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate and that the standards for granting relief were different for each respective motion. The report noted that there already existed a mechanism by which certain motions for a new trial become part of the \u201cdirect appeal,\u201d tolling the one-year limitations period for filing \u00a7\u2019 2255 motions, and that a motion for' a new trial based on newly discovered evidence filed after the appellate process had begun was not one of them. Thus, the magistrate found that it was the filing of a Rule 33 motion <em>before </em>the direct appeal commenced, not the filing of a motion during the pendency of the appeal or after the appeal had been resolved, that was the distinction of merit, and ultimately, the magistrate concluded that Barnes\u2019s motion was time-barred by the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period. Lastly, it rejected Barnes\u2019s request for equitable tolling, finding that he had not established any ground that would warrant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">The district court adopted and affirmed the magistrate\u2019s report, noting that Barnes had not filed any objections to the report. The district court denied his motion, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>subsequently denied his request for a certificate of appealability (COA). After construing Barnes\u2019s notice of appeal as a motion for a COA, we issued a COA on the following issue only: \u201cwhether the district court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">On appeal, Barnes argues that AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period should have been' tolled while his Rule 33 motion was pending. Barnes asserts that, because his motion , for a new trial was filed before his direct appeal had been decided, the failure to treat that motion as part of the direct appeal results in a waste of judicial resources by requiring the court to consider similar claims raised in both a \u00a7 2255 motion and a Rule 33 motion for a new trial. Barnes argues that we should not require district courts to follow the \u201cglib remedial scheme\u201d of having to file motions under both Rule 33 and \u00a7 2255, even if the claims are related or identical. Barnes suggests a third option of requiring district courts to inform defendants of the existence of a \u00a7 2255 motion, which would allow defendants to file such a motion and consolidate it with a Rule 33 motion or defer adjudication of the Rule 33 motion until after the \u00a7 2255 motion is decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">We review a district court\u2019s determination that a motion to vacate is time-barred <em>de novo. Jones v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir.2002). The AEDPA \u201cestablished a mandatory, one-year \u2018period of limitation\u2019 for \u00a7 2255 motions, which runs from the latest of the following events:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-7\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-8\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-10\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-11\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\"><em>Jones, </em>304 F.3d at 1037-38 <em>(citing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(l)-(4)). The parties agree that the issue in dispute is the date on which Barnes\u2019s judgment of conviction became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">We have held that \u201ca conviction is final on the day that the Supreme Court denies a convicted defendant\u2019s <em>certiorari </em>petition or renders a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>304 F.3d at 1038 n. 5. Accordingly, barring an exception, when the Supreme Court denied Barnes\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari </em>on October 7, 2002, his convictions, for purposes of AEDPA, became final, and the one-year time limitation for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion began.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">Barnes argues that the filing of a Rule 33 motion for a new trial before his direct appeal was decided should serve to extend the date of finality to the date on which the denial of that Rule 33 motion is affirmed on direct appeal, or, in the alternative, should serve to toll the period in which to file a \u00a7 2255 motion pending a ruling on the Rule 33 motion. Barnes offers no precedent for this reading of AEDPA\u2019s requirements, but relies instead on policy arguments of judicial economy and unnecessary duplicative litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">In <em>Jones, </em>we discussed the holdings of other circuits in the context of deciding whether the petitioner in that case was entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 1039-1045. The is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>sue presented here is not exactly the one addressed in <em>Jones, </em>and is one of first impression in this Circuit. However, the cases cited by <em>Jones </em>\u25a0 support the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Barnes\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The case relied upon most heavily by the district court was <em>United States v. Prescott, </em>221 F.3d 686, 687 (4th Cir.2000), where the Fourth Circuit squarely addressed whether the pendency of a motion for a new trial under Rule 33 tolled the one-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 2255 motions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In rejecting the petitioner\u2019s argument that allowing \u00a7 2255 motions to be filed before the resolution of Rule 33 motions would clog the dockets, the Fourth Circuit noted that, while \u201cRule 33 and \u00a7 2255 overlap to some extent, there are critical differences which make it unlikely ... that Rule 33 will be eviscerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688. The court distinguished b\u00e9tween the discretion afforded to district courts under Rule 33 and the more stringent requirements for granting relief under \u00a7 2255, and concluded that the petitioner\u2019s \u201ccurrent predicament originated not in his decision to request a new trial ... but his inattention to the limitation period of \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Secondly, the court noted that, in some instances, a \u00a7 2255 motion could be filed while a Rule 33 motion was pending on appeal, but concluded that such an event would not impede courts from giving due consideration and process to a petitioner\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 689. Finally, the court concluded that the tolling provisions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) for state habeas proceedings indicated that Congress was aware of post-conviction relief proceedings and deliberately chose not to add any exhaustion requirements to \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Turning to the next case, in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>246 F.3d 655, 657 (6th Cir.2001), the Sixth Circuit addressed whether \u201ca timely motion seeking a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 serves to render a judgment of conviction as not final for purposes of the running of the one-year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d The petitioner there argued that direct review could not have been completed until post-trial remedies, such -as Rule 33 motions based on new evidence, had been resolved through the appellate level. <em>Id. </em>The Sixth Circuit concluded that a Rule 33 motion filed after- the 10-day period for seeking appellate review provided in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) was a collateral challenge separate from a direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 658-59. The court indicated that its holding furthered the AEDPA\u2019s \u201cstrong preference for swift and final adjudication of \u00a7 2255 motions\u201d and noted that the petitioner\u2019s proposed rule would mean that AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period could not begin to run until all delayed Rule 33 motions were resolved and the time period for bringing a delayed Rule 33 motion had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 659. The Sixth Circuit believed that such a rule would permit \u201cevery defendant seeking to file an untimely \u00a7 2255 motion [to] do an end-run around the AEDPA limitation period by filing a timely, but ultimately mer-itless, Rule 33 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In closing, the court.concluded that a delayed Rule 33 motion had no <em>per se </em>impact on the AED-PA limitation, although it recognized, as did the Fourth Circuit in <em>Prescott, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-7\">because related, if not identical, claims may be pursued under both Rule 33 and \u00a7 2255, .these two provisions overlap to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>some extent .... Nevertheless, nothing prevents a petitioner, upon discovering new evidence, from filing motions under both Rule 33 and \u00a7 2255. The district court may then consolidate the motions, or stay the timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion pending the outcome of the Rule 33 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">The First Circuit considered a nearly identical issue as in <em>Johnson, </em>and, like the Sixth Circuit, the court rejected the argument that a Rule 33 motion for a new trial was part of the \u201cdirect appeal\u201d process, unless it was incorporated under Rule 4(b), and explicitly held that the petitioner\u2019s one-year limitation period began to run on either the date the court\u2019s mandate in his original appeal issued or when the time for filing his petition for <em>certiorari </em>with the Supreme Court expired.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Trenkler v. United States, </em>268 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2001). Secondly, the <em>Trenkler </em>court, like the Sixth Circuit in <em>Johnson, </em>rejected the notion that the tolling provisions for state habeas petitions implied a similar exhaustion requirement or tolling provision for federal motions to vacate under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. The court noted that the petitioner was free to file his \u00a7 2255 motion without fear that it would be dismissed for failing to exhaust post-conviction remedies, but, like in <em>Prescott </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>noted the potential inefficiencies of dual motions and the overlap between \u00a7 2255 and Rule 33. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. However, the court held that AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations would sometimes require a prisoner to initiate duplica-tive proceedings, and district courts were well equipped to alleviate the problem through consolidation of motions for collateral relief. <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">We have not published an opinion directly addressing the issues raised by Barnes in this appeal. However in <em>Jones, </em>we cited <em>Prescott, Johnson, </em>and <em>Trenkler </em>favorably on the issue of equitable tolling, an issue not raised in this appeal. <em>See Jones, </em>304 F.3d at 1040-42. We are persuaded by the analysis of our sister circuits and now conclude that a Rule 33 motion for a new trial is neither a continuation or extension of a direct appeal, nor does it serve to toll AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">We conclude, therefore, that Barnes\u2019s motion for a new trial, even though it was filed while his direct appeal was pending, did not constitute a continuation or an extension of that direct appeal, but was, for the reasons set forth in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Trenkler, </em>a collateral motion on his conviction that the district court had jurisdiction to entertain notwithstanding the fact that Barnes\u2019s direct appeal was pending. <em>See United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 976 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990) <em>6citing United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 667 n. 42, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2051 n. 42, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). Therefore, Barnes\u2019s Rule 33 motion had no effect on when his conviction became \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of triggering AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, and he had one year following the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his petition for <em>certiorari </em>in which to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, we conclude that Barnes\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, filed nearly two years after the Supreme Court denied him <em>certiorari, </em>was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">Moreover, we note, as the Fourth Circuit did in <em>Prescott, supra, </em>that \u00a7 2255 does not contain the same exhaustion and tolling provisions as state habeas petitions filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2254. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>Accordingly, filing a Rule 33 motion for a new trial does not serve as a prerequisite to a \u00a7 2255 motion, nor does it toll the period of time for timely filing a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">Barnes alternatively requests that we consider a procedure suggested by the concurring opinion in <em>Prescott. </em>In that concurring opinion, one circuit judge agreed that the \u00a7 2255 procedures did not, as currently written, permit the tolling of the limitations period during the pendency of a motion for a new trial. <em>Prescott, </em>221 F.3d at 690 (King, J. concurring). Writing solely to \u201chighlight a few issues,\u201d the concurrence suggested that Congress take note of the absence of any provision concerning \u00a7 2255 motions that would take into account other collateral challenges to a conviction and perhaps enact a provision to resolve them either before a \u00a7 2255 motion is filed or to consolidate the various motions and require district courts to consider them together. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the concurrence suggested that district courts ask prisoners filing Rule 33 motions whether they intended to file \u00a7 2255 motions, giving those defendants and the district courts a chance to review all collateral challenges in one consolidated case. <em>Id. </em>Notably, however, the concurrence recognized that the present Congressional drafting of the statute prevented relief for the petitioner in that case, and we, similarly, decline to adopt a new procedure for \u00a7 2255 motion that has not been prescribed by Congress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Our sister circuits have summarized the potential pitfalls of permitting similar or identical claims to be pursued in Rule 33 and \u00a7 2255 motions, but we conclude that the system, as it has been set forth by Congress, is adequately dealt with by the district courts. The standards for granting relief under Rule 33 and \u00a7 2255 are, as explained in <em>Trenkler, </em>quite different, but the filing deadlines for each are, and for the time being remain, independent of one another. <em>Trenkler, </em>268 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Furthermore, as was discussed in the concurring opinion in <em>Prescott, </em>the remedy for the situation as it exists lies with Congress, not this Court. Until and unless Congress changes the scheme for \u00a7 2255 motions, prisoners such as Barnes must be aware of AEDPA\u2019s strict deadline on \u00a7 2255 motions. In the instant case, Barnes still had four months following our decision affirming the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 33 motion in which to timely file a \u00a7 2255 motion. Like the petitioner in <em>Prescott, </em>Barnes\u2019s \u201ccurrent predicament originated not in his decision to request a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, but his inattention to the limitation period of \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Prescott, </em>221 F.3d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Barnes\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely, and, therefore we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Barnes\u2019s motion as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">. It is noted that, in <em>Prescott, </em>the petitioner had filed a Rule 33 motion for a new trial in the \"interests of justice,\u201d not on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The analysis, however, is pertinent because nothing prevented Barnes from filing a timely \u00a7 2255 motion while his Rule 33 motion was pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">. At that time, the First Circuit had not decided when a conviction became final under \u00a7 2255(1) when a defendant opted not to seek <em>certiorari. Trenkler, </em>268 F.3d at 22 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
