J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMd\">Harold Douglas Goss appeals from a superior court judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate to direct the Department of Motor Vehicles to vacate its order suspending his driver\u2019s license for six months under Vehicle Code, section 13353.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">On December 9, 1966, San Diego Police Officer Riste arrested Goss for drunk driving (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23102, subd. (a)), and warned him his failure to submit to a blood, breath or urine chemical test would result in the suspension of his driver\u2019s license for six months (Veh. Code, \u00a7 13353). Goss refused Riste\u2019s request to submit to a chemical test. Under Vehicle Code, section 13353, the Department ordered Goss\u2019 driver\u2019s license suspended after receiving Riste\u2019s sworn statement describing the arrest, warning and refusal to submit to chemical testing. Goss requested \u201ca formal hearing to present evidence to show the cause of the suspension is not true.\u201d The Department replied January 18, 1967: the requested hearing would be February 2, 1967; Goss would \u201chave an opportunity at the hearing to present any evidence you may have or to make any statement relative to your driving privilege \u2019 \u2019; the suspension would be stayed until further notice; a request for a continuance of the hearing would vacate the stay, and the suspension would become effective on granting the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Before holding the hearing, Goss\u2019 attorney reviewed the. Department\u2019s file. At the hearing, attended by Goss and his attorney, Goss was immediately sworn and examined. Over Goss\u2019 objection of inadmissible hearsay and denial of his rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the hearing board admitted into evidence under Vehicle Code, section 14108, Riste\u2019s sworn statement and two police arrest reports. Without objection, however, the hearing officer inquired of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Goss about Eiste\u2019s statement. Goss freely and completely accounted in Ms own words for the arrest. Goss\u2019 own version of what happened provides substantial evidence supporting an inference that reasonable cause existed for his arrest. He testified that he had been offered the three tests specified in Vehicle Code, section 13353, and had the tests described to him. Goss acknowledged he refused to take a test at the scene of the arrest and refused any tests at the jail, although he had been advised that refusal meant a six-month suspension of his driver\u2019s license. Goss himself supplied each of the elements necessary to support suspending his license. After the hearing the Department suspended his driver\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The superior court\u2019s conclusions of law were that Eiste\u2019s sworn statement and the two police arrest reports were not official department records under Vehicle Code, section 14108 and were not admissible; Goss\u2019 own testimony and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it, however, established all the elements necessary to support the Department\u2019s suspension order. The superior court denied the petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Goss wanted a formal hearing for his expressed purpose of presenting \u2018\u2018 evidence to show the cause of the suspension is not true.\u201d Government Code, section 11513 provided the procedural format for the hearing. The hearing was not criminal in nature. <em>(Beamon </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>180 Cal.App.2d 200, 210 [4 Cal.Rptr. 396].) Goss did not call any witnesses. He was subject to being called and cross-examined by the hearing officer. This was done. Eiste\u2019s sworn statement and the two police arrest reports, all hearsay, would have been admissible to supplement and explain Goss\u2019 testimony, but not to impeach it (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513). However, wholly apart from any explanation in the Department\u2019s file, Goss\u2019 own testimony provided sufficient evidence to support the Department\u2019s suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
