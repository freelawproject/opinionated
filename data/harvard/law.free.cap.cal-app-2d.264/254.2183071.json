Code, \u2022 \u00a7 459)., and with two prior felony convictions. He admitted the priors. A jury found him guilty of the burglary as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u2022\u2022 The burglary in question occurred when the apartment of .Carl. Caldwell, was entered on the morning of September 16, 1964, while Mr. Caldwell was absent at work. A television set was'stolen..The only door to the apartment, which was located over, a garage, was at the head of an outside stairway on the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">.. The principal prosecution witness at the trial was Quincy Thomas, Mr; Caldwell\u2019s next door neighbor. Mr. Thomas testified. that on the day of the burglary he saw a male Negro carrying a television set down the stairway from the Caldwell apartment. The man walked to the street in front of the premises and disappeared over a hill, on foot and still carrying the television set. After a few minutes, Thomas saw the man return- on foot without the television set, enter an automobile which had been parked in front of the building where Caldwell lived, and drive away. At this point, Thomas jotted the automobile\u2019s description On a card he had in his pocket. Thomas gave -the description to the police on the following day,' and told them that he could identify the burglar. \u00a1.\u25a0\u2022Testifying to the events of September 16 at the trial, Thomas'\u00a1stated, that the-man he had seen was not wearing a sweater, and that his pants were dark in color. It was shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that he had testified at defendant\u2019s preliminary examination that the man was wearing a sweater, and that the witness could not then recall whether the pants were light-colored or dark. At the trial, however, Thomas positively identified defendant, in the courtroom, as the man he had seen leave the Caldwell apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Defendant is a Negro. He was arrested on December 29, 1964, three and one-half months after the Caldwell burglary. Shortly thereafter, Quincy Thomas identified him at a police lineup as the burglar. The prosecution had Thomas testify to the lineup identification, but offered no evidence concerning the circumstances under which the lineup had been conducted. Thomas, describing the lineup at the trial, testified that four men were exhibited to him together and that he immediately selected defendant as the burglar. Defendant was the only. Negro in the lineup: of the others, one was a \u201cMexican man\u201d and two were white.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The card upon which Thomas had noted the burglary car\u2019s description on September 16 was received in evidence at the trial. He had written that the car was a 1957 Pontiac, two-tone green in color, with license number PSV 719. Sergeant Calvert, a police officer, testified without objection\u2014and without specifies\u2014that he had conducted an investigation of a California license number PSY 719, and that the investigation had led him to the name \u201c George Hall. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Officer Mack testified that it was he who arrested defendant on December 29, 1964. At the time, a two-tone green Pontiac, license number PSY 719, was parked in front of the residence where defendant was arrested. Officer Mack further testified that, during defendant\u2019s interrogation which followed at a police station, Sergeant Calvert showed defendant a \u201cblown-up photograph of a driver\u2019s license,\u201d and that defendant admitted that the picture on it \u201cdoes look like me.\u201d The photograph was received in evidence without objection. Ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>cording to the driver\u2019s license depicted on it, the person licensed was <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 George Hall. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Defendant presented an alibi defense. He called two witnesses who testified that they had been with him almost all day on September 16, at a place seven or eight miles from the scene of the Caldwell burglary. According to these witnesses, the three spent the day worldng on an automobile owned by one of them, and defendant had not left the witnesses\u2019 presence at any time. Testifying in his own behalf, defendant joined in his witnesses\u2019 story concerning his whereabouts on September 16. He denied burglarizing the Caldwell apartment, or being in its vicinity on that day. He admitted that a woman with whom he had been living, and at whose home he was arrested, owned a green Pontiac which he had driven on occasion, but he denied driving it on the day of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Upon his original appeal, defendant asserted constitutional error in the admission of the testimony of Quincy Thomas that the latter had previously identified defendant, at the police lineup, as the burglar of the Caldwell apartment. Defendant invoked the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution (and sections 8 and 13 of article I of the Constitution of California) in this regard, but principally contended that the testimony violated his right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">After defendant had raised these arguments, and while his appeal was still pending in its first phase, his Sixth Amendment point was squarely upheld by the United States Supreme Court,  Where a pretrial lineup or other confrontation is conducted for the purpose of having or permitting an eyewitness to a crime to identify the accused as the person who committed it, the right of the accused to the assistance of counsel at the lineup is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 218, 236-237 [18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1162-1163, 87 S.Ct. 1926]; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 263, 272 [18 L.Ed.2d 1178, 1186, 87 S.Ct. 1951].)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">If an eyewitness has identified the accused at a lineup where this constitutional right was neither honored nor intelligently waived, an in-eourt identification by the same witness will be inadmissible at the trial without a showing\u2014 by \u201cclear.and convincing evidence\u201d\u2014that its \u201corigin\u201d was \u201cindependent\u201d of the lineup. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>388 U.S. 218 at pp. 236-237, 239-242 [18 L.Ed.2d 1149 at pp. 1162-1163, 1164-1166].) In the same event, evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>lineup identification itself is wholly inadmissible under a \u201cper se exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>388 U.S. 263 at pp. 272-273 [18 L.Ed.2d 1178 at p. 1186].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Thus, defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge of the Thomas testimony was valid under the <em>Gilbert </em>rule. But, pronouncing the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>rules on June 13, 1967, the United States Supreme Court also held that they would apply, in other cases, only prospectively and as to police lineups conducted after that date. <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 293, 296 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1203, 87 S.Ct. 1967].)  Our Supreme Court subsequently followed <em>Stovall </em>in this respect, holding that the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>rules would apply in California only as to lineups conducted after June 13, 1967. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feggans </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 444, 448 [62 Cal.Rptr. 419, 432 P.2d 21].) The lineup in the present case occurred at the end of 1964. Accordingly, and although defendant\u2019s point was both timely and well taken when he first asserted it in this court, the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>rules could not avail him.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In <em>Stovall, </em>however, the United States Supreme Court also stated that \u201c. . . [I] t remains open to all persons to allege and prove, as Stovall attempts to do in this case, that the confrontation [i.e., in the context of the present case, the police lineup] resulted in such unfairness that it infringed his right to due process of law. See <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Peyton </em>(4th Cir. 1966) 359 F.2d 199 . . . This is a recognized ground of attack upon a conviction independent of any right to counsel claim.\u201d <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>388 U.S. 293 at pp. 299, 302 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199 at pp. 1205, 1206].) Denied the benefit of his Sixth Amendment point because the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>rules were not to be retroactively applied, defendant urged on his still-pending appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the visibly interracial nature of the police lineup in this case \u201cresulted in such unfairness\u201d as to deprive him of due process within the meaning of <em>Stovall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Concluding the appeal in the first instance, we held adversely to defendant\u2019s due process point and affirmed his conviction. He petitioned the Supreme Court for a hearing. While his petition was pending, that court upheld a similar point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Caruso </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 183 [65 Cal.Rptr. 336, 436 P.2d 336], and transferred the present ease to us \u201cfor reconsideration in the light of\u201d the <em>Caruso </em>decision. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the record thus revisited and reconsidered, we now conclude that <em>Caruso </em>requires reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The <em>Caruso </em>court (68 Cal.2d 183 at pp. 188-189) explicitly cited and quoted <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>in condemning \u201cunfairly constituted lineups\u201d as vehicles for pretrial identification of an accused by eyewitnesses to a crime. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s extensive indictment of such lineups in the <em>Wade </em>decision unmistakably reached and included the procedure followed by the police in the present case. The <em>Wade </em>court stated (388 U.S. 218 at pp. 232-233 [18 L.Ed.2d 1149 atpp. 1160-1161]) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cWhat facts have been disclosed in specific cases about the conduct of pretrial confrontations for indentification illustrate both the potential for substantial prejudice to the accused at that stage and the need for its revelation at trial. A commentator provides some striking examples:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201c \u2018In a Canadian ease . . . the defendant had been picked out of a line-up of six men, of which he was the only Oriental. In other cases, a black-haired suspect was placed among a group of light-haired persons, tall suspects have been made to stand with short non-suspects, and, in a case where the perpetrator of the crime was known to be a youth, a suspect under twenty was placed in a line-up with five other persons, all of whom were forty or over. \u2019 (Footnote citation.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\u201cSimilarly state reports, in the course of describing prior identifications admitted as evidence of guilt, reveal numerous instances of suggestive procedures, for example, that . . . the other participants in a lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance to the suspect . . . (Footnoted citation.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Applying to the <em>Caruso </em>lineup the visual-contrast standard of \u201cunfairness\u201d as thus defined in <em>Wade, </em>our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe can only conclude that the lineup was \u2018unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u2019 <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1206]), and we hold that its grossly unfair makeup deprived defendant of due process of law. <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra.) </em>\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at p. 188.) The same standard requires the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Caruso was a big man, with a dark complexion and dark wavy hair. The eyewitnesses remembered that the robber had these characteristics. None of his four companions in the lineup was his size, none was dark-complected, none had dark wavy hair. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>187-188.) In the present case, Quincy Thomas had seen a Negro commit the burglary. Defendant was a Negro : the three men lined up with him for confrontation by Thomas were not, and this fact was immediately evident to Thomas. The <em>Caruso </em>court noted that the eyewitnesses had recalled the robber\u2019s conspicuous physical characteristics, and that \u201cif they were to choose anyone in the lineup, defendant was singularly marked for identification. \u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 187.) The contrasting composition of defendant\u2019s lineup was indistinguishable from that of Caruso\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><em>Caruso </em>is similar to this ease in other respects. The eyewitnesses who identified Caruso were uncertain concerning the clothing worn by the robber. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at p. 185.) As has been shown, Quincy Thomas was uncertain concerning the burglar\u2019s clothing. As the <em>Caruso </em>court pointed out <em>(id., </em>at p. 188), the in-court identification of Caruso persuaded the jury to disregard his alibi defense. The jury acted similarly here, and for the same reason. There was no evidence in <em>Caruso </em>which associated the accused with the property stolen in the robbery. Similarly, the TV set stolen in the burglary here was not produced or referred to at defendant\u2019s trial, nor was he otherwise associated with it in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In <em>Caruso </em>and here as well, there was evidence connecting the accused with the crime through an automobile. Caruso\u2019s car was seen in the vicinity of the robbery, and its license number was reported. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at pp. 185-186.) In the present ease, the description of the burglary ear as noted and reported by Thomas matched that of an automobile which was apparently accessible to defendant and which was nearby when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">This evidence is somewhat more substantial than its <em>Caruso </em>counterpart: Thomas testified that he saw both the car and defendant driving it, whereas the witness who saw Caruso\u2019s car near the robbery did not identify him as its driver. However, and as in <em>Caruso, </em>the eyewitness identification putting defendant at the scene of the crime (and putting him in the car at the same place) remains the essential feature of the People\u2019s ease. Without it, as in <em>Caruso, </em>the evidence otherwise associating the accused with the automobile would not be sufficiently substantial to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The Attorney General, rebriefing us in the appeal\u2019s current phase, attempts to distinguish. <em>Caruso </em>on several. grounds. Quoting both <em>Canoso </em>and <em>Wade </em>on the danger of mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>identification where \u201cthe witness\u2019 opportunity for observation was insubstantial, and thus his susceptibility to suggestion the greatest\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at p. 188), he points out that, while the <em>Caruso </em>witnesses\u2019 opportunity to observe the robber was \u201cinsubstantial\u201d (because they saw him only fleetingly), Mr. Thomas observed the burglar deliberately and at close range at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On the other hand, however, the <em>Caruso </em>witnesses selected the accused from a lineup within 24 hours after they had seen the robber. Mr. Thomas did not identify defendant until a lineup conducted more than three months after the burglary. That he had a more substantial opportunity to observe the culprit (than did the eyewitnesses in Caruso) is thus counter-weighted by the fact that his visual recollections were substantially less current when he invoked them at the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The Attorney General also points out that in <em>Caruso </em>the Supreme Court found that \u201cOther circumstances, moreover, lent credence to the defense.\u201d (68 Cal.2d 183 at p. 189.) The \u201cother circumstances\u2019\u2019 included the facts that Caruso had no apparent motive for the robbery because he was gainfully employed and was not in financial straits, and that he had no prior criminal record. The Attorney General urges that <em>Caruso </em>is thus distinguishable because of the evidence in this case of \u201cthe driver\u2019s license issued in a fictitious name, the registration of the vehicle used by the burglar in that same name, appellant\u2019s unemployment during the month of the burglary, and his two prior felony convictions. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">These attempted distinctions must also fail. The circumstances shown in the record concerning the \u201cGeorge Hall\u201d driver\u2019s license are suspicious but inconclusive. There is no evidence that the license was issued in a \u201cfictitious name.\u201d Defendant admitted to the police that the person photographed on the license resembled himself, but there is no evidence that the license had been issued to him or that he had it in possession. The fact of his current unemployment does not support an inference that he was criminally motivated where Caruso was not; his prior felony convictions do not strip his defense of \u201ccredence\u201d; and none of the circumstances mentioned would operate in any event to cure the constitutional defects in the evidence which identified him as the burglar.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In substance, the Attorney General\u2019s arguments upon reconsideration embrace many of the same factors which impelled us to reject defendant\u2019s due process contentions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the first instance. This being so, the definitive answer is that, viewed in the light of <em>Caruso, </em>our reasoning was wrong then and the arguments which reflect it are wrong now. Defendant \u201chas made a showing that the lineup was unfair, resulting in tainted in-court identification essential to the People\u2019s case. The People fail to demonstrate that the error was harmless <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824]), and the judgment must therefore be reversed. \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at p. 184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">If the People choose to try defendant again, the evidence that Quincy Thomas identified him at the constitutionally defective police lineup will be inadmissible as part of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>388 U.S. 263 at pp. 272-273 [18 L.Ed.2d 1178 at pp. 1186-1187, 87 S.Ct. 1951].) An in-eourt identification by the same witness will also be inadmissible unless, upon <em>voir dire, </em>the People show \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d that it is based upon the witness\u2019s observations of the accused at the scene of the burglary <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>388 U.S. 218 at pp. 239-240 [18 L.Ed.2d 1149 at pp. 1164-1165, 87 S.Ct. 1926]): and the showing to be made must meet the \u201crequisite level of proof\u201d which the <em>Caruso </em>court has specified in detail. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183 at pp. 190-191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The facts that defendant\u2019s original Sixth Amendment point was not available to him on this appeal, but that a due process point was, became apparent at a very late date during the appeal\u2019s pendency in its first phase. (See fn. 2, <em>supra.) </em>The urgency of this development imposed a difficult burden upon court-appointed counsel. He nonetheless pursued the due process point with tenacity and competence. We commend him for both.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Devine, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 18,1968.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Only Thomas testified concerning the lineup. He said that a police officer who was present did not point out defendant to him, and that he \u2022\u2014Thomas\u2014picked out the burglar \u201cfrom Ms features.\u201d The witness was present at the lineup \u201cnot too long, I don\u2019t recall how long but not over ten minutes. \u2019 \u2019 He \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>casually \u2019 \u2019 looked at all of the four men on display, but picked out defendant \u201cright off.\u201d No evidence was received at the trial concerning defendant\u2019s specific coloring or Ms features, as contrasted with those of any of the other three men. Such element of contrast appears, however, because Thomas unmistakably recognized\u2014and recalled in liis testimony\u2014that one of the men was a \u201cMexican man,\u201d that two others were \u201cwhite,\u201d and that defendant was the only Negro in the lineup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">As previously stated, the <em>Wade, Gilbert </em>and <em>Stovall </em>decisions were filed and published by the United States Supreme Court on June 13, 1967. This was two days before the present appeal was orally argued. Both parties re-briefed us by letter on defendant's surviving <em>Stovall </em>point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
