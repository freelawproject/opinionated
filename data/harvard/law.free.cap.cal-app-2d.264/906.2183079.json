Imprisonment for the first robbery count and the attempted murder count were ordered to run consecutively. Imprisonment under the second robbery count was ordered to be concurrent with the terms under the other two. He appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Count I</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">After dark on September 1, 1966, Robert Reed, Jr., a delivery man for Chicken Delight, proceeded to an address on Hernando Road in Sacramento County to deliver an order of food. He parked his vehicle and got out in order to determine which house was the one he was looking for. A man, subsequently identified as defendant, approached him and asked if he had the food. Reed said he was the man with the food and he turned to take it from the vehicle. Defendant placed a gun in his ribs and said, \u201cGive me your money.\u201d Reed gave him all his bills and most of the coin\u2014approximately $83. This robbery was one of many involving Chicken Delight delivery vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Count II</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">As part of an investigation of these robberies, Sergeant Richard Deeper of the sheriff\u2019s department, detective division, delivered an order which had been called into Chicken Delight' in the evening of September 29, 1966. Sergeant Deeper drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>the delivery vehicle to 2356 Church Street, arriving at about 8 :30 p.m. Defendant stuck his head inside the stopped vehicle and pointed a gun at Deeper, informing him that he was the object of a robbery. Deeper gave defendant his wallet and his change. Defendant, believing that Deeper was withholding money from him, ordered him out of the vehicle in order to search him. As defendant was searching, Deeper grabbed defendant\u2019s gun and at the same time reached for his own gun. During the scuffle Deeper was shot twice. Defendant fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">After the shooting, Officer Donald YanSkike was on his way to the scene when he noticed a 1956 Chevrolet being driven at an extremely slow rate of speed. He noticed that the young lady driving was paying close attention to an area on the eastern side of the road which was largely open field. The scene of the robbery and shooting was in this general area, and he thought she might be looking and waiting for the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">YanSkike stopped the Chevrolet. As he walked up alongside, he noticed in plain view on the back seat a set of men\u2019s clothing. He ran a check for warrants on the driver, Carol Ann Herschelman. There was nothing outstanding against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">While YanSkike was waiting for the results of the record check, he requested Officer Fonda, who had arrived in the interim, to get the registration certificate of the vehicle. In doing this Fonda was attacked by Carol. At this point she was arrested. The car was then searched, and a wallet was found in a pocket in the pants on the back seat. The wallet contained identification belonging to defendant\u2014a driver\u2019s license with his picture was in it. About an hour after the robbery Sergeant Deeper was shown the photograph on the license. The next morning he was shown five photographs. He identified defendant from this group.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Defendant first contends that the wallet with the identification was obtained by means of an unlawful search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">We hold there was probable cause for the arrest of Carol and the subsequent search of the vehicle was lawful and proper. The officer who observed Carol driving the vehicle in the area of the robbery as heretofore related was justified in stopping the vehicle and making the related inquiries. The attack on the officer provided probable cause for the search of the vehicle as an incident to her valid arrest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>62 Cal.2d 681, 683 [43 Cal.Rptr. 833, 401 P.2d 225].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Furthermore, there was no objection to the admission of the evidence claimed by defendant to have been illegally obtained. He may not now raise the matter for the first time on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>62 Cal.2d 889, 894 [44 Cal.Rptr. 762, 402 P.2d 834]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>51 Cal.2d 445 [334 P.2d 573].)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Defendant claims error in the refusal of the trial judge to dismiss his appointed counsel on the second day of the trial. The record discloses defendant sought the dismissal of the public defender and the appointment of counsel of his own choice. When the court ascertained defendant was without funds to engage private counsel and that defendant did not want to represent himself defendant\u2019s request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>57 Cal.2d 89, 98-99 [17 Cal.Rptr. 617, 367 P.2d 33], the Supreme Court stated: \u201cSection 987 of the Penal Code provides that \u2018If [the defendant] desires and is unable to employ counsel, the court must assign counsel to defend him.\u2019 While section 987a authorizes payment of compensation to private counsel appointed under section 987 from the general fund of the county, that authorization is declared to be operative only \u2018in a county or city and county, in which there is no public defender, or in a case in which the court finds that because of conflict of interest or other reasons the public defender has properly refused to represent the person accused, . . .\u2019 In all other instances\u2014including therefore the case at bench\u2014it is the statutory duty of the public defender \u2018upon order of the court\u2019 to represent any defendant who is financially unable to employ his own counsel. (Gov. Code, \u00a727706, subd. (a).)  Our constitutional guarantee that an accused \u2018shall have the right ... to appear and defend, in person and with counsel\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 13; Pen. Code, \u00a7686), substantially similar to that accorded federal defendants by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution [citation], is satisfied by the appointment and appearance of the public defender in behalf of the accused (the latter also being present). \u2018 There is nothing in the law which entitles an accused to have the court appoint any particular attorney to defend him, and the refusal of the court to name a particular counsel was not a denial of defendant\u2019s right to be represented by counsel for, as said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Manchetti </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 452, 458 [175 P.2d 533] : \u201c. . . defendant had no absolute right to be represented by a particular attorney.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Stroble </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 615, 629 [226 P.2d 330], affd. (1952) 343 U.S. 181 [96 L.Ed. 872, 72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>S.Ct. 599]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 428, 430 [310 P.2d 120]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 364,377 [3] [345 P.2d 47].) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Defendant urges as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to heed his claim that he had \u201can unjust trial.\u201d Defendant\u2019s statement was made to the court subsequent to his trial and at the time for hearing the report of the probation officer and imposition of sentence. The record shows the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-7\">\u2018\u2018 The Court : . . . Any comment that you wish to make, or your counsel on your behalf ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-8\">\u201cMr. Martinez: Yes. I figure I had an unjust trial. One of my jurors, the back one over there, was informed not to, had been instructed not to talk to any of the officers or anybody of the Court. Yet when I come up here on the elevator he was sitting in the control room, just carrying on like they are old pals, and he was the member of the jury that was on there to convict me, and yet my public defender here failed to bring it to the Court\u2019s attention. Some of my witnesses which he said was immaterial, but I didn\u2019t think it was immaterial. And just a lot of things like the way they obtained these confessions from these various witnesses, through threat, and promises. Well, that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">\u201cThe Court: You discussed these matters with Mr. Carroll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-10\">\u201cMr. Carroll : Yes, your Honor. In regard to the first matter he brought up, I talked with Lieutenant Parker about the possibility of there having been any exchange in regards with this case with any deputy under his command and any of the jurors and he assures me that, to his knowledge, there was no conversation in regards to any ease. He is not aware of any member of the jury being back in the area there, in the control room. However, the general public does go back there quite a bit; it is possible that a juror may have been there. I have been unable to obtain any evidence whatsoever to indicate to me that any juror talked to any deputy sheriff in regards to the case while the trial was in process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-11\">\u201cMr. Martinez: While I was coming up in the elevator everybody was noticing and brought it to my attention that he was a juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-12\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : Why do you assume he was doing anything improper ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-13\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Martinez : He shouldn\u2019t have been back there, talking like old pals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-14\">\u2018\u2018 The Court : Was he talking to anyone in this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>\u201cMr. Martinez: To the officer. He could have very well informed him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">\u201cThe Court: But you have no reason to assume he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201cMr. Martinez : The thing is he was instructed not to have any communication of that sort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-7\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : Do you know if their discussion was pertaining to this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-8\">\u201cMr. Martinez : I couldn\u2019t tell what he was telling exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-9\">\u201cThe Court: We\u2019d have to assume he was obeying the admonition of this Court, assuming he was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-10\">\u201cMr. Martinez : Then all the methods that were used to try to get me to cop out to these various counts, like throwing me in the hole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-11\">\u201cThe Court : You went to trial and you were found guilty, guilty by jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-12\">\u201cMr. Martinez : Methods used to try to get me to cop a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-13\">\u201cThe Court : But you didn\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-14\">\u201cMr. Martinez: No. There was no cause for me\u2014throwing me in such a place like that, just try to get a plea out of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-15\">\u2018\u2018 The Court : Well, you had a fair trial and you had a good representation ,\u2022 Mr. Carroll gave you very adequate representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-16\">\u201cMr. Martinez: As far as the Court knows, but behind those doors you don\u2019t know what goes on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-17\">\u201cThe Court: Any other comment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-18\">\u201cMr. Carroll [Public Defender] : No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-19\">A conversation between a juror and an officer of the court is not misconduct per se. There must be prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 310, 314 [303 P.2d 633].) Although wisdom might dictate a full investigation into the charge <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phelan, </em>123 Cal. 551, 567 [56 P. 424]), that decision is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 568.)  Where, as in this case, nothing appears showing that the conversation related to the ease, there is no abuse of discretion in the failure to investigate. (I<em>d. </em>at p. 568.) Furthermore, if this alleged misconduct occurred before the jury had finished its role in the case, defendant waived any objection by not stating it then. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quiel, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 674, 680 [157 P.2d 446].)  \u201cA defendant or his attorney, who possesses knowledge, during the progress of a trial, of the conduct of jurors which he deems to be prejudicial, may not fail to call the court\u2019s a.tten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>tion thereto, speculate upon receiving a favorable verdict, and then assign the conduct as prejudicial misconduct for the first time after an adverse verdict has been returned against him.\u201d (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Defendant contends he was \" denied his right to counsel and his right to appear and defend himself by the judge\u2019s refusal to allow a continuance because of appellant\u2019s illness. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">On the afternoon of the first day of trial defendant complained of being ill. The court made inquiry of defendant\u2019s symptoms and being satisfied the complaint was not serious denied the request and ordered that defendant be examined by a doctor prior to the resumption of the trial the next day. The medical report showed no serious illness warranting a trial delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">A motion for continuance creates a factual issue. In this case it is whether or not defendant was too ill to be tried. In the absence of a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court, its determination to this issue will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanz, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 793, 796-797 [12 Cal.Rptr. 282].)  There is nothing in the record to establish that defendant\u2019s condition at the time was such as to preclude him from effectively proceeding with his defense; in fact, the evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Defendant finally contends that he was erroneously sentenced. We find the sentence as to count I of the information is correct. As to count II, robbery, and count III, attempted murder, it is clear the shooting of the police officer occurred by reason of the discharge of defendant\u2019s gun during that robbery and was incident to the single objective of robbery. As such, the imposition of the latter two sentences is double punishment forbidden by Penal Code section 654, which reads, in part; \u201cAn act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished under more than one. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">In <em>In re Henry, </em>65 Cal.2d 330, the court said (at pp. 330-331 [54 Cal.Rptr. 633, 420 P.2d 97]) : \u201cPetitioner contends that the concurrent sentences inflict multiple punishment in violation of Penal Code section 654, and invokes the rule of <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 19 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839], that \u2018If all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one, \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 149, 179 [67 Cal.Rptr. 601], this court stated: \u201cWhen a series of connected crimes is incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for the most serious offense but not for more than one. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11,19-20 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">\u201cWhether a course of criminal conduct is divisible, giving rise to separately punishable crimes, depends upon the intent and the objective of the actor. <em>(Kellett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 822, 824-825 [48 Cal.Rptr. 366, 409 P.2d 206].) A number of decisions involve a completed armed robbery, followed by a separately motivated shooting, each of which is separately punishable (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Birdwell </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 621 [61 Cal.Rptr. 536]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Houghton </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 864 [28 Cal.Rptr. 351]). Others illustrate a robbery and shooting which are incident to the single objective of robbery. (E.g., <em>In re Henry </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 330 [54 Cal.Rptr. 633, 420 P.2d 97]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ridley </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 671 [47 Cal.Rptr. 796, 408 P.2d 124].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>atp. 179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Defendant by one \u201cact,\u201d the course of conduct constituting the robbery, simultaneously violated both statutes, to wit, Penal Code section 211 (robbery) and Penal Code section 664, subdivision 1 (attempted murder). Accordingly, although he violated both statutes, he can be punished under only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The sentence for attempted murder, count III of the information, the less serious crime, is suspended. It is not now vacated, however, since to do so would extinguish it beyond revival in the event of a subsequent reversal of the judgment under count II. The suspension should remain effective until completion of the sentence under count II and shall become permanent at that time. In other words, the permanency of the stay is contingent upon the continued validity of the conviction upon count II. In the event that the conviction upon count II is set aside, on proper proceedings the suspension of the sentence on count III should be terminated and that sentence then become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The sentence imposed upon defendant in count III for violation of section 664, subdivision 1, of the Penal Code is suspended pending further order of the superior court consistent with the views expressed herein. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Pierce, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
