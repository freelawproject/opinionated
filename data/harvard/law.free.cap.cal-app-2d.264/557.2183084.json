(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The grounds for appeal are essentially that (1) the evidence of appellant\u2019s concomitant intent to commit larceny or any felony was insubstantial; (2) his extrajudicial, highly incriminating statement to the police was improperly admitted in evidence to his prejudice. We reverse solely upon the second stated ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On May 25, 1966, at 3:20 a.m., Mrs. Rosalee Frances McLean was awakened by an intruder in her bedroom in the apartment she shared with her husband in Long Beach. The intruder was appellant, Boy Bdric Matthews, a career Navy enlisted man. Mrs. McLean screamed, appellant grabbed her by the throat but she managed to rise up in bed and start screaming for her husband. Appellant released his hold and fled through the well-lighted living room with Mrs. McLean in pursuit still screaming for her husband. Appellant ran into the kitchen from whence he escaped through a window above a sink. This window was the only means of external access to the apartment aside from the front door which had been chain-locked. Nothing was taken or missing from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">At approximately 4 a.m. that same morning two Long Beach police officers, searching for a prowler, observed appellant lying under a parked car in an alley a half block away from Mrs. McLean\u2019s apartment. One of them shined his flashlight directly into appellant\u2019s closed eyes and the other told him two or three times to get up. When appellant failed to do so but flinched his eyes, the two policemen, with the help of others who had joined them, lifted appellant out from under the car and stood him up in the middle of the adjoining backyard. At 4:10 a.m. another police officer advised appellant of his constitutional rights as required by <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338, 353-354 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361],* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and placed him under arrest for burglary. Appellant was then apparently placed in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">During the next 30 hours or so, appellant was taken once and possibly twice from the holding tank to a Long Beach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>police interrogation room to be questioned. The sole reported interrogation during this interval of time was conducted by Inspector Bennett in the presence of Sergeant Johnson. It lasted approximately 10 minutes. Appellant was advised of his constitutional rights along the lines of the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed. 2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], by Inspector Bennett who also had appellant repeat that advice to make sure he understood it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201c Bennett then asked appellant whether he understood these rights, as Bennett had told him of them previously. Appellant replied that Bennett had not. Bennett became \u201crather hot about it\u201d and commented \u201cYou have to get up early in the morning to fool me\u201d or something like that. .Appellant said he had been \u201cbrutalized.\u201d The two police officers told appellant to take off his clothing from the waist up. They inspected the exposed half of his body, particularly his back, about which they questioned him. Bennett then asked appellant, in a way which appellant regarded as insinuating his guilt, what had happened at the McLean apartment. Appellant would not talk and was therefore returned to the holding tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">About 11 a.m. the next day, appellant was taken by the aforementioned Sergeant Johnson from the holding facility in the courthouse to the courtroom of Municipal Judge Lilley for arraignment. While waiting in the jury box following his arraignment appellant motioned Sergeant Johnson over and said, \u201cI would like to clear things up,\u201d or something like that. Johnson told appellant to wait until court was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Appellant was arraigned before Judge Lilley in the presence and hearing of, among others, Sergeant Johnson. He was without counsel and the judge appointed the public defender to represent him. The judge also advised appellant of certain of his constitutional rights relating to his forthcoming trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Immediately after the arraignment and without any consultation with his just-appointed counsel, appellant was taken by Sergeant Johnson to the police station across the street. There he gave Sergeant Johnson and a police secretary a five-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>page statement, in question and answer form, which subsequently was introduced into evidence over objection as People \u2019s Exhibit No. 3. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After this statement had been typed up it was taken back to appellant in the holding tank to read and sign, page by page, which he did in the presence of Sergeant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Johnson and a Navy chief petty officer who was the liaison between the Navy and the Long Beach police and' who was requested by Sergeant Johnson to witness appellant\u2019s signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In the statement, appellant admitted that he had entered the McLean apartment through the torn screen of the kitchen window after having drunk a pint of whiskey and some beer earlier that night; that he did not know why he did so, that he continued through the house into a bedroom where a person awakened whom he attempted to quiet unsuccessfully, that he then fled but returned to the vicinity of the apartment looking for a pair of glasses which he had lost, that he saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>police and then dozed off and was subsequently awakened by them. The deputy public defender objected to the admission of this statement on the ground that the People had not shown an effective waiver by appellant of his right to counsel before he made the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">II. The Question op Appellant\u2019s Felonious Intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Turning to appellant\u2019s first contention on appeal, that the evidence of his felonious intent in entering the McLean apartment is insubstantial, we find it to be without merit. Appellant claims that he was so intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing when he climbed into the kitchen window. It is true that appellant had consumed a pint of whiskey and some beer during the evening hours before he was discovered in Mrs. McLean\u2019s bedroom and that a breathalyzer test by the police shortly after his arrest showed that the alcohol content of his blood was then .10. Moreover, appellant testified that he was intoxicated when he entered the apartment and did so without intent to commit larceny or rape. But one of the arresting officers testified that in his opinion, appellant was not drunk at the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This occurred within an hour of his entry into the apartment. Furthermore the trier of fact could properly infer from the time and the apparent manner of appellant\u2019s entry into the apartment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that he possessed a felonious intent at the time of such entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">III. The Nonadmissibilitt op Appellant\u2019s Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Appellant\u2019s highly incriminating statement to the police was taken by means of an interrogation immediately following his arraignment and the appointment of the public defender to represent him. The taking of this statement was occasioned by appellant\u2019s expressed desire \u201cto clear things up\u201d in the mistaken belief that he was not guilty of the crime with which he had just been formally charged. Under these circumstances, the question presented is whether appellant\u2019s statement was a voluntary self-incriminating statement beyond the protection of the constitutional privilege against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>compulsory,, self-incrimination and the safeguards- of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">. To answer this question we must determine whether.appellant\u2019s statement&lt;was the,product'of a;\u201c custodial interrogar tion\u201d as that term is defined in <em>Miranda, </em>This is so because, while <em>Miranda </em>recognizes that \u201cvoluntary statements\u201d are admissible without its safeguards,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> !'nbr statement may be deemed \u201cvoluntary\u201d \u00a1if it -is the product of a custodial interrogation 'carried oh in the absence of those safeguards. Thus tv\u00e9' turn to <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>definition of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and to its applicability to this ease. \u25a0 ' - - '</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The-\u2019definition is simple enough. At page 444 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 706] the Court state's: \u201cBy-custodial interrogation, we mean <em>questioning initiated </em>by law enforcement officers after a person' has been taken into Custody- or otherwise deprived of his' freedom of action in' any significant-way.\u201d (Italics added.) The' \u2019difficulty in this case is- that the suspect volunteered' \u201cto clear things up. \u201d All' of the elements of a custodial \u2018interrogation were present unless\"'- it 1 be .said that appellant, rather \"than the'police; initiated-'the'\" questioning. Thus the: critical \u25a0 question becomes \u2022\u2022 whether the word .'\u201cinitiated\u201d was used in the <em>Miranda </em>definition'\"-in the-sense of \u201coccasioned^ or \u201cbegun.\u201d ' o \u2018 <em>'&lt;\u25a0\u2022&gt; </em>.- -. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We think \u201cinitiated\u201d was used- by the' Supreme Court -in its primary-meaning of \u201cbegun\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that..there is no escape from the fact that Sergeant Johnson began the -questioning in this cage.. Appellant had stated, th|it he yanted \u201cto clear things' up\u201d but it was Sergeant Johnson who' independently, decided to1 take appellant back to the police\" station and to question, him in, the presence of a police secretary. What ensued was a custodial interrogation under <em>Miranda. </em>\u2022 ' ' \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>At first blush it may appear that to apply <em>Miranda, </em>as we do, to a statement essentially offered<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by a prisoner but which is elicited in question and answer form by a police officer is to place form over substance. If the police 'officer merely listens and records, the statement is \u201cvoluntary\u201d; if he'questions the prisoner, the statement is part of a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u2019\u2019 and will be '\"'involuntary\u201d if <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>safeguards are not completely followed. But where'the questioning is of the type involved here this difference is more than one of mere form; it goes to the root of the policy behind Miranda.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If, without questioning, a prisoner volunteers a statement and the police simply listen and record (or ask a neutral question such as.\u201cWhat do you want to'say?\u201d)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the statement is wholly voluntary. Anything the prisoner then says is plainly only that which he wants to say; his statement is entirely voluntary both in its origin and in its making. The police role is purely passive and there is'no exercise by the police of the compulsion and pressure which <em>Miranda </em>found to be inherent in all custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">On' the other hand, if the police choose to question the prisoner who has offered to make a statement they may well elicit inore incriminating matter than the suspect would have vdlunteered.- Their role has ceased to be passive and the statement produced by their interrogation is not likely to be wholly the prisoner\u2019s.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s statement by reason of the manner in which the police obtained it was not an entirely voluntary statement nor a volunteered one within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em> Therefore it was necessary for the People in this case to meet a heavy burden of proof to establish the admissibility of this statement by showing that appellant, before malting this statement, knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and his right to the presence of his court-appointed counsel. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 475 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 724].) This burden involved essentially proof that the police gave appellant full and timely warnings with respect to these two constitutional rights and that he then made an affirmative waiver of such rights before he made the statement under consideration. (384 U.S. 436, 475 [16 L.Ed. 2d 694,724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The record here leaves much to be desired in these respects. The trial court was under the erroneous impression that the <em>Miranda </em>requirements did not apply to appellant\u2019s interrogation because such interrogation occurred before the date of that decision and because appellant had received at least three different warnings as to his constitutional rights prior to the making of his statement. Consequently it unduly limited defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The warnings which were given appellant prior to his making the statement appear to have been deficient in at least two respects. Each of the warnings, with the possible exception of the second one, was inadequate in content. The first warning,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which was given appellant on the occasion of his arrest, was, regardless of his condition at the time, plainly insufficient in its coverage. (See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 479 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706, 726].) The third and last warning, given at the time of appellant\u2019s arraignment and upon which the trial judge particularly relied, was not directed toward custodial interrogation at all but was instead quite properly directed toward appellant\u2019s constitutional rights <em>at the trial.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The second warning, given by Inspector Bennett the day before appellant made his statement, was generally sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>in coverage,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but failed to make clear that appellant was entitled <em>to the presence </em>of his counsel before and during any custodial interrogation. (See 384 U.S. 436, 444, 471, 473, 479 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706, 721, 722, 726].) In any event, regardless of the sufficiency of this particular warning, the police failed to give appellant any warnings whatsoever just prior to taking his statement the next day.  A <em>contemporaneous </em>warning is required under <em>Miranda </em>at the outset of <em>each </em>interrogation. (See 384 U.S. 436, 469 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 720].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Moreover, prior to making his statement, appellant never <em>affirmatively waived, </em>his constitutional rights to remain silent and to be represented by counsel. It is true that he repeated Inspector Bennett\u2019s warnings the previous day but he said then that he did not understand them.  Under <em>Miranda, </em>silence in the face of the warnings, even if then followed by the making of a statement, is not enough to establish a knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights by the maker of the statement. An affirmative waiver is required. (See 384 U.S. 436, 475 [16 L.Ed.2d 694,724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Finally we come to the failure of the police to afford appellant a reasonable opportunity to consult with his court-appointed counsel, the public defender, before interrogating him when they knew of such appointment. In <em>Miranda </em>it was pointed out that the action of the police in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 480-482 [12 L.Ed.2d 977, 980-981, 84 S.Ct. 1758], in preventing Escobedo\u2019s attorney from consulting with him before he made his statement, in and of itself constituted a violation of Escobedo\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and excluded any statement obtained in its wake. (384 U.S. 436, 465 fn. 35 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 718].) Here, by whisking appellant across the street to the police station for interrogation immediately following the appointment of the public defender as his counsel, the police prevented the public defender from consulting with appellant before he made his statement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But in this case, unlike <em>Escobedo, </em>neither appellant nor his counsel attempted in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>to contact each other before appellant made his statement. In view of these circumstances and the other already discussed failures by the police and the trial court to comply with the requirements of <em>Miranda, </em>we need not decide whether the conduct of the police in this respect constituted an independent violation of appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Having found that the admission of appellant\u2019s statement in evidence constituted federal constitutional error, we must now decide whether we can declare our belief beyond a reasonable doubt that this error did not contribute to the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22-24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 709-710, 87 S.Ct. 824].) It is true that appellant testified on the stand to much of what he had already told the police in his statement, but he did so only after the statement had been admitted in evidence over his objection. Under these circumstances it is clear that the admission of the statement impelled his like testimony on the stand and therefore, such testimony must be disregarded by us in deciding whether this federal constitutional error constituted reversible error under <em>Chapman. </em>(Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stockman, </em>63 Cal.2d 494, 502 [47 Cal.Rptr. 365, 407 P.2d 277]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>66 Cal.2d 158, 163-169 [57 Cal.Rptr. 163, 424 P.2d 715].)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We conclude that under <em>Chapman </em>the admission in evidence of appellant\u2019s statement constituted reversible error,</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The judgment is reversed. The purported appeal from the order denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Moss, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Ford, P. J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 25, 1968. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition shoud be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-13\">The trial started as a jury trial but in the course thereof a waiver of Ms right to a jury trial was made by appellant. This waiver was taken \u201cin chambers\u201d following the trial court\u2019s ruling outside the presence of the jury that appellant\u2019s hereafter discussed extrajudicial statement to the police was admissible. In view of the presence at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of at least appellant, both counsel, and the reporter, this manner of taking appellant's waiver of his right to a jury trial was nonprejudicial error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Valenzuela, </em>opinion on denial of rehearing, 259 Cal.App.2d 826, 834 [66 Cal.Rptr. 825], hear, den.) On the motion for a new trial, the degree of burglary was reduced from first to second.

When I was on the east coast everything ran smoothly while I.was . in the Navy. Then, when I came to the west coast things just seemed to be completely different in the entire Navy. Ship life was differ- - ent. There was -a number of adjustments to make. On ship petty officers carried much more weight; they were different types of . individuals\u2014different people with different types of attitudes, different purposes and- objectives. And me not being a rated person it was rather hard to adjust to other people other than adjust to the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfY\">.1 was transfered a number of times .with the intention of setting up installation aboard ship for my rate which is a- Navy Accountant dealing with data processing and E.A.N. equipment. So it has been more or less a hassle back and forth because nothing substantial has come out of my transfers back and forth. I haven\u2019t been working in my rate and the training that I received I have not had an opportunity to put it to use on the west coast. I was rather optimistic for the Navy and the training they had to offer when I first got in but as time goes on things look \u00a1more., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>more dim. One reason is I have a leading first class that won\u2019t recommend me for the E-4 exam and I missed it twice already due to being transfered and temporary duty and I haven\u2019t had an opportunity to get my courses out. I had the intention of being E-5 Second Class before this enlistment was up, but not being recommended it made things look a little bit worse and I have to cope with him until the middle part of 1967 when he gets out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AINF\">Q: O.K. Did you take anything from the apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEW\">A: I haven\u2019t taken anything. The only thing I really touched was the sink and the window and that was it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0y\">Q: And the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALrr\">A: And the victim but I don\u2019t think that I hurt her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad8\">Q: Is this a true statement to the best of your recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEMA\">A: It is a true statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4R\">Q: Have you been previously advised of your Constitutional Eights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A649\">A: I was advised but my mind wasn\u2019t too conscious at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au0\">Q: Do you recall being advised in this office by Inspector Bennett and myself yesterday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXFP\">A: Yes, I recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAA\">Q: Has there been any promise of reward or immunity in order to get you to make this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-k\">A: No there hasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVJL\">Q: Would you be willing to sign this statement after it has been recorded into typewritten form as a true and voluntary statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx_\">A: Yes I would, but there was another thing I wanted to add. I haven\u2019t seen my brother for awhile. He is Airborne 139 in the Army and he was home on leave about a week or so ago. He is scheduled to be gone to Viet Nam within a month or so. Bealizing what danger he could possibly be going to, I wanted to take leave at the time also. I have a number of friends killed over there all ready. By him going to the same situation or more dangerous, I wanted to go home to be with him for awhile because there is always a possibility it might be the last time. Also I want to go home because at this particular time of the year the river terminal is busy longshoreing and stevedoring and for the length of time that I would be home with my brother I would have had the opportunity to make a great deal of money working there. But my leave was refused and I was scheduled to be transfered to the Naval Supply Center. I was transferred to the Naval Supply Center on the 24th to be a key punch operator for about two months. The Navy pulled my teeth about March and I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to get these dentures replaced and it is quite embarrasing not to have any teeth and the amount of teeth that I do have it is quite hard to eat with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEV\">Statement Ended at 11:45</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACJS\">/s/ Boy E.
