It comes to us on a settled statement under rule 7, California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">From the settled statement it appears that the following was uncontradicted or admitted at the trial. Plaintiff-appellant Reynold Lofberg asked \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d whom he met in a bar, to drive him home in plaintiff\u2019s car. Shortly after the trip started plaintiff \u201cpassed out.\u201d \u201cJohn Doe\u201d thereafter drove the vehicle into a telegraph pole, causing injuries to plaintiff. \u201cJohn Doe\u201d ran from the accident and disappeared. Plaintiff does not know the identity of the driver, \u2018\u2018 John Doe \u2019 \u2019 being a fictitious name.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">At the time of the accident plaintiff was the named insured and his automobile the covered vehicle of a liability insurance policy written by defendant-respondent The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, hereinafter called \u201cAetna.\u201d The policy specified that any person driving the automobile with plaintiff\u2019s permission was an \u201cinsured.\u201d \u201cJohn Doe\u201d never gave written notice of the accident or otherwise communicated with Aetna. Plaintiff, however, did give written notice to Aetna but the notice did not contain particulars sufficient to identify \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that Aet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>na\u2019s claims manager told him that <em>\u201c the policy did not provide coverage for this accident </em>and that [Aetna] was denying any liability to plaintiff on this accident.\u201d (Italics added.) The claims manager testified that he told plaintiff\u2019s attorney that Aetna \u2018\u2018 <em>had no liability since its policy did not cover this claim.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Plaintiff thereafter commenced an action against \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d but he could not be found and summons could not be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In his declaratory relief action plaintiff sought judgment: \u201c1. Ordering defendant to appear in and defend plaintiff\u2019s suit against JOHN DOB and pay any judgment therein up to $10,000.00, or in the alternative, [[[] 2. Ordering defendant to submit plaintiff\u2019s claim to arbitration under the \u2018uninsured motorist\u2019 provisions of said policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The judgment declared that Aetna \u201chas no obligations to plaintiff under the insurance policy defendant issued to plaintiff to either defend [the action] in this court or to arbitrate plaintiff\u2019s alleged uninsured motorist claim. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Plaintiff offers no authority in support of his contention that Aetna is legally obligated to appear in and defend the action on behalf of a defendant who has not been served with summons and who himself is under no obligation to appear. Such an appearance, if made, must be by an attorney. An attorney may not appear in an action without authority from the party on whose behalf he appears. Indeed, such an unauthorized appearance would be ground for disciplinary proceedings. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6104.) Under the circumstances, the determination of the trial court that Aetna was not required to defend, or to pay any judgment in, the \u201cJohn Doe \u2019 \u2019 action, was clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We now consider plaintiff\u2019s second contention which relates to bis right of arbitration under the \u201cuninsured motorist \u2019 \u2019 provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Section 11580.2 provides in part and as applicable here: \u201cNo policy of bodily injury liability insurance covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle, shall be issued ... to the owner ... of a motor vehicle, . . . unless the policy contains ... a provision . . . insuring the insured . . . for all sums . . . which he or they, as the case may be, shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury . . . from the . . . operator of an uninsured motor vehicle. ...\u201d The section also defines \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d as pertinent here, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u2018\u2018 a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, ... or use of which there is [bodily injury liability insurance] . . . <em>but the company writing the same denies coverage </em>thereunder. \u201d (Italics added.) It also states: <em>\u201cThe term \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 shall not include an automobile owned by the named insured.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The subject policy, following closely the statutory language of section 11580.2, states that the term \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d means \u201can automobile with respect to the ownership, ... or use of which there is, ... a bodily injury liability . . . insurance policy applicable at the time of the accident <em>but the company writing the same denies coverage thereunder.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The policy omits the statutory definition, \u201cThe term \u2018uninsured motor vehicle \u2019 shall not include an automobile owned by the named insured.\u201d It does, however, provide that the term \u201c \u2018uninsured automobile\u2019 shall not include an insured automobile.\u201d It then defines \u201cinsured automobile\u201d as the vehicle \u2018 \u2018 described in the schedule as an insured automobile to which the bodily injury coverage of the policy applies.\u201d The automobile described in the policy\u2019s schedule is plaintiff\u2019s ear which, of course, is an automobile owned by the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Since an insurer is permitted by the statute to exclude such an automobile, the language used by Aetna effectively eliminates plaintiff\u2019s automobile from its \u201cuninsured automobile \u2019 \u2019 coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The permitted statutory and policy exclusion we have just discussed clearly qualifies the more general language relating to the effect of an insurer denying coverage under its policy. Accordingly, we hold that the uninsured automobile coverage of plaintiff\u2019s policy is inapplicable to his accident and injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Both parties voluntarily submitted to the superior court for decision the issue as to whether \u201cJohn Doe\u201d was an \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d under Aetna\u2019s policy. Such an issue has been held to be arbitrable under the general arbitration provisions of an insurance policy such as Aetna\u2019s. (See <em>Esparza </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>257 Cal.App.2d 496, 499-500 [65 Cal.Rptr. 245], and eases there cited.) How. ever, the parties here, by submitting that particular. question for the court\u2019s decision must be deemed to have waived any right to arbitrate it, (See <em>Local </em>659, <em>I.A.T.S.E. </em>v. <em>Color </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Corp. of America, </em>47 Cal.2d 189, 194-195 [302 P.2d 294].) The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 6, 1968, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 18,1968.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
