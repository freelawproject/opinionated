He appeals from the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">At the hearing it was stipulated by counsel that one Augustine Potor was the owner of a 1956 Oldsmobile that had been parked by Potor in front of the Camino Hotel in Camino, and was removed without his permission either in the late evening hours of April 30, 1967, or the early morning hours of May 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The testimony established the appellant and his companion, Joseph Greco, had been reported as missing from Diamond Springs. The two boys had run away and made the 13-mile trip from Diamond Springs to Camino by hitching rides and walking. Upon their arrival in Camino, they went into the Antlers Club and tried to borrow some dimes so they could call home. Apparently being unsuccessful, the two boys then went to the front of the Camino Hotel where they located an automobile with an unlocked door. Greco opened the door, climbed in and started the car by \u201chot-wiring\u201d the ignition. After getting the ear started, they took turns driving until it ran out of gas about two miles away. Greco then opened the glove box in the vehicle with a screwdriver that was in the car and took out a pistol. The two boys then removed the remaining items of personal property from the car and left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Sergeant Wilson, of the sheriff's office in El Dorado County, testified that while on patrol on May 1, 1967, at about 2 a.m., he came upon the above-described Oldsmobile parked \u201ccrossways\u201d on Mace Road in El Dorado County with its headlights on. Upon cheeking the inside of the car, Wilson noticed that the glove box was open and that the ignition switch was missing from its place in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">From the vehicle registration, Officer Wilson learned that the ear was owned by Potor who was contacted and advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>that his car had been located on Mace Road. Wilson drove Potor to where the car had been located. Potor told the officer that the ignition switch had been in its proper place and the glove compartment locked when he parked his ear in front of the hotel. Potor also told the officer that certain items of personal property were missing from his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Officer Wilson then put out a broadcast to various law enforcement units advising them to be on the lookout for anyone walking along the road carrying a package or other items of property. Wilson then resumed his regular patrol. A short while later, the sheriff\u2019s office received a call from Potor to the effect that he had observed two boys back of the Antlers Club in Camino and asked that they be checked out. The two boys had told Potor that they were lost and. wanted to get back to the freeway. Potor gave them directions and watched them go down Carson Road and turn south on Snow Road toward Pleasant Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Officer Wilson proceeded toward Pleasant Valley and found the two boys walking on Snow Road. While walking down the road, appellant attempted to hide upon seeing a car coming. After the boys were stopped for questioning by Wilson, and while he was talking to them, another officer arrived and advised that there was a missing person\u2019s report out on the two boys. Wilson then transported the boys to the sheriff\u2019s office to be held pending the arrival of their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Upon arrival at the office, the officer separated the two boys. Officers Wilson and Smith then talked to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Officer Wilson, the only witness for the respondent, testified to the substance of what was said at the time by Officer Smith and appellant. Smith asked him about the ear in Camino, and appellant replied that he knew nothing about the car. Appellant was then asked if he could drive, and he replied in the negative. When Officer Smith stated that he knew he could on the basis of the information in the missing person\u2019s report, appellant said he could drive. Appellant was again asked about the car in Camino, and this time appellant stated that he and Greco had taken the car in Camino.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Officer Smith then advised appellant of his constitutional rights as prescribed in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.2d 974], which were read from a card. When asked, appellant replied that he understood these rights and was willing to waive them. Appellant also stated he did not want an attorney when asked whether he wished one. Officer Smith also asked: \u201cHaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to us now?\u201d Appellant responded affirmatively. Appellant then made a complete confession with regard to taking the ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Appellant took the stand in his own behalf. He stated that Greco was the instigator in taking the ear and he went along reluctantly. He also claimed that Greco was the one who actually \u201chot-wired\u201d the car, and that he never drove the car at any time. The boys abandoned the ear when it ran out of gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Appellant stated that he changed his story about taking the car when the officers told him that Greco had already admitted the theft. He denied having been advised of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Appellant contends that since neither he nor his parents were advised of the right to counsel or right to remain silent prior to the interrogation, the statements obtained are inadmissible. Appellant initially relies upon <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428], and <em>Gallegos </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>370 U.S. 49 [8 L.Ed.2d 325, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 87 A.L.R.2d 614]. <em>Gault </em>we will discuss in detail, <em>infra. Gallegos </em>is not in point since there is no element of coercion in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Appellant next contends that the principles set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694], were violated, thus making the statements of appellant inadmissible. The Attorney General agrees that the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>are applicable to minors and juvenile court proceedings, but not because of <em>Gault. </em>In his brief the Attorney General states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-10\">\u201cIt is the requirement of Welfare and Institutions Code, \u00a7701 that \u2018a preponderance of evidence, legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases, must be adduced to support a finding that the minor is a person described by Section 602\u2019 that brings <em>Miranda </em>into play. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">The Attorney General then contends that the appellant\u2019s statement (\u201cthey had taken the car in Camino\u201d) was properly admitted as a response to a general inquiry (\u201cWhat happened to the car in Camino?\u201d) by an officer commencing an investigation of an unsolved crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Appellant, however, contends his out-of-court statements were inadmissible in the juvenile court proceeding because of the failure to advise him of his constitutional rights prior to the time he made the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">We hold that appellant, at the time he was questioned and gave his answers, was a suspect and the questioning was custodial interrogation. The juveniles were in custody as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>\u2018\u2018 run-aways \u2019' and the officers were seeking information prior to the arrival of the parents. It is true that conduct of the officers during the 15-minute inquiry was neither oppressive nor coercive. However, the questioning was conducted under the conditions which invite coerced confessions and other evils of custodial interrogation and falls within the scope of the <em>Miranda </em>warning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, </em>68 Cal.2d 714, 717-718 [68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625], filed June 20,1968, the court stated: \u201cOn this appeal the sole issue is the admissibility of defendant\u2019s confession. The People insist that the confession was admissible because the record contains no suggestion of impermissible interrogation techniques on the part of the detective who conducted the interview. But the People misconceive the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>Miranda. </em>A principal objective of that decision was to establish safeguards that would liberate courts insofar as possible from the difficult and troublesome necessity of adjudicating in each case whether coercive influences, psychological or physical, had been employed to secure admissions or confessions. We need not review here the history that produced the <em>Miranda </em>decision since it has been analyzed in innumerable cases and commentaries. It is sufficient to reiterate the words of Chief Justice Warren: \u2018The current practice of incommunicado interrogation is at odds with one of our Nation\u2019s most cherished principles\u2014that the individual may not be compelled to incriminate himself. Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice. \u2019 <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 458 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 714, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1619, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u201cIt becomes our constitutional responsibility, therefore, to determine in every criminal ease that the full panoply of <em>Miranda </em>\u2018protective devices\u2019 is satisfied. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">\u201cWe must first ascertain whether in this case police authorities were under an obligation to give the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As that opinion makes plain, the procedural safeguards therein come into play only where \u2018 custodial interrogation \u2019 is involved, and by \u2018 custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. \u2019 <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].) While the defendant here had not been for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>mally arrested, we have long held that a suspect must be fully apprised of his rights upon being ushered into a police station and detained for questioning. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Furnish, </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 511, 516 [47 Cal.Rptr. 387, 407 P.2d 299]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chaney </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 767, 769 [48 Cal.Rptr. 188, 408 P.2d 964].) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">It is true Officer Wilson testified that the officers had no suspicion that appellant was involved in an auto theft. However, the record also contains the following statement elicited at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">\u201cA [By Officer Wilson] We got down to the sheriff\u2019s office and separated the two boys and asked them what time they were at different places. They were in Camino approximately. 12:30 a.m., and before we called the parents, Officer Smith, who had taken the missing person\u2019s report on the two boys from Diamond Springs, came in and we talked about the matter of the car being taken, talked it over, and we then went in and talked to the Teters boy. Officer Smith asked the Teters boy something on the line of \u2018What about the car?\u2019, \u2018What happened to the car in Camino ? \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Prom the record we conclude the two boys were suspects, and the only suspects, at the time the incriminating statements were made. The <em>Miranda </em>warning had not been given at the time, and thus the confession was invalid and should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Respondent next contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-11\">\u201cAssuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellant Teters\u2019 extrajudicial confession was inadmissible, the question on appeal is \u2018whether there is substantial evidence to support the juvenile court judge\u2019s determination that a preponderance of the evidence existed exclusive of the confession of appellant. \u2019 <em>In re Acuna, supra [ </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 388 (53 Cal.Rptr. 884)], p. 393.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">In a series of appellate cases beginning with <em>In re Castro </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 402 [52 Cal.Rptr. 469], it was held that invalid confessions though admissible in juvenile court, cannot be relied upon to support a finding that the minor committed a crime. In <em>Castro, </em>at page 411, the court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-14\">\u2018 \u2018 Thus, by the well-considered and specific provisions of the code section [\u00a7701, Welf. &amp; Inst. Code] regulating the receipt of evidence at the hearing, the trial court is directed to permit all evidence which bears.on the question.whether.the minor is \u00e1 person described in section 602 of the Welfare and- Institutions Code, but at the same time the court is specifically pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>vented from making a finding of wardship in a case of this kind unless there is a preponderance of evidence to that effect, which would have been legally admissible on the trial of a criminal case of this kind. All evidence bearing on the questions at issue is admissible by the express provisions of the sections, but the utilization of the evidence by the court is strictly controlled. In determining whether Castro should be named as a ward of the court, it is essential that the judge completely disregard all of the evidence relative to confessions to the police officers, because such confessions would not have been legally admissible on the trial of the case if a criminal charge against Castro had been brought in the adult court. There remains, therefore, the question whether entirely apart from this excluded evidence there was a preponderance of evidence legally admissible on the trial of an adult criminal in a case of this kind, which showed the commission of crime by Castro.\u201d (Accord, <em>In re Buros </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 55, 57 [57 Cal.Rptr. <em>124]; In re Acuna, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.2d at p. 393 [wherein this court states: \u2018\u2018 The question before us as an appellate court is whether there is substantial evidence to support the juvenile court judge\u2019s determination that a preponderance of the evidence existed exclusive of the confession of appellant.\u201d].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The evidence in the ease before us which would warrant a finding that appellant unlawfully took and drove a vehicle not his own, without the consent of the owner and with the intent of depriving the owner of possession (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851), was the result of appellant\u2019s in-court confession as well as the extrajudicial confessions. There was no evidence introduced exclusive of appellant\u2019s confessions. We hold his extrajudicial confessions impelled his testimonial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Subsequent to the holdings in <em>Castro </em>and <em>Acuna, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court, on May 15, 1967, decided <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428], in which it was held that a 15-year-old hoy committed as a juvenile delinquent was denied due process of law because juvenile delinquency proceedings which may lead to commitment in a state institution must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment, including application of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In <em>Gault, supra, </em>the court states, at pages 30-31 [18 L.Ed. 2d at pp. 547-548] : \u201cIn <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>[383 U.S. 541 <em>(16 </em>L.Ed.2d 84, 86 S.Ct. 1045)] we stated that the Juvenile Court Judge\u2019s exercise of the power of the state as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>parens patriae was not unlimited. We said that \u2018the admonition to function in a \u201cparental\u201d relationship is not an invitation to procedural arbitrariness. \u2019 With respect to the waiver by the Juvenile Court to the adult court of jurisdiction over an offense committed by a youth, we said that \u2018 there is no place in our system of law for reaching a result of such tremendous consequences without ceremony\u2014without hearing, without effective assistance of counsel, without a statement of reasons. \u2019 We announced with respect to such waiver proceedings that while \u2018We do not mean ... to indicate that the hearing to be held must conform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing ; but we do hold that the hearing must measure up to the essentials of due process of fair treatment. \u2019 We reiterate this view, here in connection with a juvenile court adjudication of \u2018 delinquency, \u2019 as a requirement which is part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of our Constitution.\u201d And, at page 44 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 555]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">\u201cIn reviewing this conclusion of Arizona\u2019s Supreme Court, we emphasize again that we are here concerned only with proceedings to determine whether a minor is a \u2018 delinquent \u2019 and which may result in commitment to a state institution. Specifically, the question is whether, in such a proceeding, an admission by the juvenile may be used against him in the absence of clear and unequivocal evidence that the admission was made with knowledge that he was not obliged to speak and would not be penalized for remaining silent. In light of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] we must also consider whether, if the privilege against self-incrimination is available, it can effectively be waived unless counsel is present or the right to counsel has been waived.\u201d And, at pages 47-48 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 557-558] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">\u2018 \u2018 It \"would indeed be surprising if the privilege against self-incrimination were available to hardened criminals but not to children. The language of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States by operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, is unequivocal and without exception. And the scope of the privilege is comprehensive. As Mr. Justice White, concurring, stated in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Waterfront Commission </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 52, 94 [12 L.Ed.2d 678, at p. 704, 84 S.Ct. 1594]: '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">\u201c \u2018The privilege can be claimed in <em>any proceeding, </em>be it criminal or civil, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory ... it protects <em>any disclosures </em>which the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ness may reasonably apprehend <em>could be used in a criminal prosecution or which could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) \u201d And, at pages 49-50 [18 L.Ed. 2d at pp. 558-559] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">\u201cIt would be entirely unrealistic to carve out of the Fifth Amendment all statements by juveniles on the ground that these cannot lead to \u2018criminal\u2019 involvement. In the first place, juvenile proceedings to determine \u2018delinquency,\u2019 which may lead to commitment to a state institution, must be regarded as \u2018criminal\u2019 for purposes of the privilege against self-incrimination. To hold otherwise would be to disregard substance because of the feeble enticement of the \u2018civil\u2019 label-of-convenience which has been attached to juvenile proceedings. Indeed, in over half of the States, there is not even assurance that the juvenile will be kept in separate institutions, apart from adult \u2018 criminals. \u2019 In those States juveniles may be placed in or transferred to adult penal institutions after having been found \u2018delinquent\u2019 by a juvenile court. For this purpose, at least, commitment is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one\u2019s will, whether it is called \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018 civil. \u2019 And our Constitution guarantees that no person shall be \u2018 compelled \u2019 to be a witness against himself when he is threatened with deprivation of his liberty\u2014a command which this Court has broadly applied and generously implemented in accordance with the teaching of the history of the privilege and its great office of mankind\u2019s battle for freedom.\u201d And, at page 55 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 561] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201cWe conclude that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable in the case of juveniles as it is with respect to adults. We appreciate that special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege by or on behalf of children, and that there may well be some differences in technique\u2014but not in principle\u2014depending upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of parents. The participation of counsel will, of course, assist the police, Juvenile Courts and appellate tribunals in administering the privilege. If counsel is not present for some permissible reason when an admission is obtained, the greatest care must be taken to assure that the admission was voluntary, in the sense not only that it has not been coerced or suggested, but also that it is not the product of ignorance of rights or of adolescent fantasy, fright or despair.\u201d And, at page 57 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 562] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">_ \u201cAs we said in <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>554 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 93, 86 S.Ct. 958], with respect to waiver proceedings, \u2018 there is no place in our system of law for reaching a result of such tremendous consequences without ceremony. . . .\u2019 We now hold that, absent a valid confession, a determination of delinquency and an order of commitment to a state institution cannot be sustained in the absence of sworn testimony subjected to the opportunity for cross-examination in accordance with our law and constitutional requirements. \u2019 \u2019 In <em>People </em>v. <em>Spencer </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 158 [57 Cal.Rptr. 163, 424 P.2d 715], the court considered whether the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession, erroneously admitted into evidence, caused prejudice to the defendant who also made a judicial confession. The court stated (at p. 163) : \u201cWe have held that use of a confession violative of <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Dorado </em>necessarily compels reversal of the resulting conviction since a confession so completely shatters a defendant\u2019s ease that its erroneous use at his trial works incalculable damage and precludes a finding of harmless error notwithstanding overwhelming extrinsic evidence of guilt. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\u201cThe State contends that, since the jury in this case heard the defendant admit his guilt on the witness stand, the use of defendant\u2019s unlawfully obtained confession should be deemed harmless error on the theory that defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement probably played little if any role in the jury\u2019s deliberation. [Citations.] Even if we assume that the United States Constitution would permit the application of a harmless error rule under such circumstances, we could not rest affirmance of the judgment solely upon our evaluation of the minor effect of defendant\u2019s confession upon the jury; we must still weigh its impact upon defendant\u2019s <em>trial.\u201d </em>And, at pages 167-169: \u201cHere, as in <em>Fahy, </em>the precise issue which we are therefore called upon to resolve is \u2018whether there is a <em>reasonable possibility </em>that the evidence complained of\u2019 (italics added) (375 U.S. at p. 86 [11 L.Ed.2d at p. 172])\u2014in this case, the extrajudicial <em>statement\u2014\u2018might </em>have contributed to the conviction\u2019 (italics added) <em>(id., </em>at pp. 86-87 [11 L.Ed.2d at pp. 172-173] )\u25a0\u2014in this case, by inducing the defendant\u2019s judicial confession of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of the instant case, we cannot realistically ignore the possibility that defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession <em>might </em>have impelled his subsequent confession in court. We recognize that no court has ever \u2018gone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use, perpetually disables the confessor from mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>ing a usable one after those conditions have been removed. \u2019 <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bayer </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 532, 540-541 [91 L.Ed. 1654, 1660-1661, 67 S.Ct. 1394].) Nonetheless, .the courts have not been blind, to the fact that \u2018 after an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no- matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed. He can never get the cat back in the bag. The secret is out for good.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 540 [91 L.Ed. at p. 1660].) In this sense, a later confession may always be viewed in part as fruit of the first. [Citation.] We must therefore recognize that it is always <em>possible </em>that an improperly obtained confession will induce the defendant to render a later admission of guilt. \u2018Admittedly, it is difficult to determine whether there is a connection between the two confessions. But, human nature being what it is, we must recognize a presumption that one is the fruit of the other. \u2019 <em>(Killough </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1962) 114 App.D.C. 305 [315 F.2d 241, 249] (Wright, J. concurring) ; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d 601, 609-610 [150 P.2d 801].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-4\">\u201cTo overcome the likelihood that the erroneous introduction of defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession impelled his.testi-. monial one, the State bears the burden of showing that the causative link between the two confessions had been broken. \u2018 [T]he beneficiary of a constitutional error [must] prove <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 (Italics added.) <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>388 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824].) The prosecution has failed t\u00f3 do so here. Instead, the prosecution urges us to speculate upon the defendant\u2019s motives for testifying and to infer, from a record which leaves the issue completely unexplored, that his decision to confess in court did not emanate from the erroneous receipt in evidence of his extrajudicial statement of guilt. We cannot posit so important a determination upon so conjectural a base.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">\u201cAlthough substantial evidence other than defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession connected him with the crime, hjs case had been shattered by the \u2018 evidentiary bombshell \u2019 of that confession. [Citations.] In light of the overwhelming damage thereby inflicted by the prosecution, we must surely acknowledge at least a \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that the defendant took the stand in part because a confession which he erroneously believed admissible had completely demolished his prog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>peets for a favorable verdict. In recognizing such a possibility here, we do no more than heed the admonition of Justice Cardozo; \u2018 The springs of conduct are subtle and varied. One who meddles with them must not insist upon too nice a measure of proof that the spring which he released was effective to the exclusion of all others. \u2019 <em>(DeCicco </em>v. <em>Schweizer </em>(1917) 221 N.Y. 431, 438 [117 N.E. 807].) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">As noted in <em>Gault, supra, </em>the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is as applicable to juveniles as it is to adults. We, therefore, conclude, as the court did in <em>Spencer, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 169, \u2018\u2018 that the record in this case fails to dispel beyond a reasonable doubt the possibility that the defendant took the stand in an attempt to mitigate the explosive impact of a confession which had left his case in ruin.\u201d Counsel for defendant vigorously opposed the introduction of the confession at the wardship hearing, and it is reasonable to assume appellant took the witness stand in an attempt to mitigate the damage resulting from its erroneous introduction. Thus, the <em>Castro </em>line of eases is completely distinguishable since absent the invalid confession there was <em>no </em>evidence which was legally admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The order of wardship is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Pierce, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 5, 1968, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 3, 1968. McComb, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
