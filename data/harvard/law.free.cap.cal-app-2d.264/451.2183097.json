Occurrence of the injury in the course of her employment is undisputed. She first filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, then commenced a lawsuit in the superior court seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Later the employer died. His compensation carrier, Pacific Indemnity Company, defends the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding. His executrix has been substituted as defendant in the damage suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In December 1965 the Industrial Accident Commission (predecessor of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board) dismissed the compensation proceeding, believing that it lacked jurisdiction to make an award where the injury was intentionally inflicted by the employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court granted review. In <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Com. </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 370 [52 Cal.Rptr. 283], we set aside the dismissal and ordered resumption of the compensation proceedings. Disapproving our earlier decision in <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Globin </em>(fn. 1, <em>supra), </em>we held that an industrially connected, albeit intentionally inflicted, injury is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The scene then shifted to the superior court, which granted a defense motion for dismissal of the damage action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Azevedo appealed from the judgment. In the renewed workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding, however, she was awarded temporary and permanent disability benefits, medical expenses and further medical treatment. We granted Pacific Indemnity\u2019s petition for a review of the award. For the purpose of decision, we have consolidated Mrs. Azevedo\u2019s appeal from the adverse superior court judgment and Pacific Indemnity\u2019s petition for review of the compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Pacific Indemnity cites provisions of California law, particularly Insurance Code section 533 and Civil Code section 1668, prohibiting insurance and indemnification against willful injury.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, it contends that the employer\u2019s compensation insurance does not provide coverage against his intentional assault upon the employee; that the Appeals Board erred in holding the insurance carrier; that, as to this willful injury, the employer has failed to provide compensation security, thus permitting the employee to invoke Labor Code section 3706 (fn. 2, <em>supra) </em>and to pursue common law and workmen\u2019s compensation remedies concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Labor Code section 3600 declares in effect that <em>liability </em>for workmen\u2019s compensation shall be in lieu of any other liability ; section 3601 that the <em>right to recover </em>workmen\u2019s compensation shall be the exclusive <em>remedy </em>for the employee\u2019s injury or death. Used to denote exclusiveness or concurrency, words such as these tend to becloud the important distinction between substantive entitlement and procedural means.  While these terms are often used interchangeably, a \u201cright\u201d is generally a claim which the law will enforce,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while a \u201cremedy\u201d refers to the judicial means by which it is made effective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Essentially, sections 3600 and 3601 are substantive declarations, fixing the employee\u2019s claim to those benefits declared by the compensation law and foreclosing entitlement to the damages traditionally available through the courts of law. Strictly speaking, then, these provisions do not point to a tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction to supply a remedy. That function is served by Labor Code section 5300, which designates the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board as the exclusive tribunal to award workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 5300 really declares the procedural or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>jurisdictional result of substantive decisions reached under sections 3600 and 3601.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Regard for the distinction between substantive and procedural declarations facilitates analysis of the pertinent decisions. In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 76 [293 P.2d 18], the court was confronted with the practical problem arising when either one of two tribunals has an exclusive jurisdiction which cannot be discerned until such time as a final decision on substantive entitlement is reached. <em>Scott </em>holds that\u2014-as between the workmen\u2019s compensation agency and the trial courts\u2014the tribunal first assuming jurisdiction retains it to the exclusion of the tribunal invoked later (46 Cal.2d at p. 81); that the only point of concurrent jurisdiction is jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction (46 Cal.2d at p. 83); if the claim is not covered by workmen\u2019s compensation the industrial accident agency (now the Appeals Board) has no jurisdiction to give relief, and if there is coverage the superior court is without jurisdiction (46 Cal.2d at p. 83) ; that a final determination as to coverage by either tribunal will be <em>res judicata </em>in subsequent proceedings between the parties or their privies (46 Cal.2d at p. 83) ; that the tribunal first invoked should proceed to determine jurisdiction, while the second will be restrained if it attempts to do so (46 Cal.2d at p. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 148 [301 P.2d 866], represents an application of the concept developed in Scott, holding that the superior court should not proceed to trial in the damage action where an earlier-commenced compensation proceeding is pending. Essentially, <em>Scott </em>and <em>Taylor </em>deal with the problem of remedy or jurisdiction, not substantive entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Substantive entitlement, however, was the central problem in our former decision in this case, <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra. </em>The substantive question was whether the employee had a right to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for an injury intentionally inflicted by the employer. We held in the affirmative. Procedurally, we went no farther than to declare, in conformity with the <em>Scott </em>case, that the workmen\u2019s compensation agency had jurisdiction to decide the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>coverage where its jurisdiction had been, first invoked -(243 Cal. App.2d at pp. 376-377).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 142 Cal.App.2d 350 [298 P.2d 598], the employee had secured an award from the workmen\u2019s compensation agency for injuries inflicted by an. assaultive employer, then brought a civil damage action.\u201d Holding that the compensation agency\u2019s final decision in favor of coverage was <em>res judicata, </em>the court restrained further prosecution of the civil damage action. <em>Carter </em>too was a procedural decision, since the employee\u2019s entitlement to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits was not in question. The substantive problem of entitlement to civil damages vanished with the denial of access to the civil courts.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Here the parties do not question Mrs. Azevedo\u2019s-substantive entitlement to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. The compensation carrier, however, disclaims insurance coverage, on the theory that statutory declarations of public policy outside the workmen\u2019s compensation law preclude insurance covering willful injury by the policyholder. Specifically, the insurer relies on Insurance Code section 533 and Civil Code section 1668 (quoted in fn. 3, <em>supra). </em>These provisions establish a public policy to prevent insurance coverage which has the effect of encouraging willful torts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Case law qualifies the policy in some respects. For example, recovery against the insurer under a subsequent estoppel does not encourage unlawful conduct and is not precluded by the policy statutes. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">No California decision has considered the system of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance in relation to the statutory ban on insurance against willful injury liability. The workmen\u2019s compensation law, Labor Code section 3700, provides that private employers \u201cshall secure the payment of compensation\u201d either by liability insurance or by a certificate of consent to self-insure. Section 15 of the same code states that \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory. Section 3710.2 declares that failure to secure the payment of compensation is a misdemeanor. As to em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ployers not covered by approved self-insurance, these provisions impose a. statutory obligation to insure, an obligation which must be met before the actual necessity for payment arises, not when compensation is already payable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Liability policies, when approved by the State Insurance Commissioner, may restrict coverage by risks, persons or occupations. (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a711657-11660; <em>Fyne </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 467, 473 [292 P.2d 78].) The authority for restrictions or exclusions in individual policies does not permit gaps in the coverage of the employer\u2019s <em>ordinary liability </em>for disability payments and medical expenses. The workmen\u2019s compensation law demands security for this ordinary liability in advance of injury. It does not pretermit this demand in the case of perils caused by the employer\u2019s willful tort. There is, then, a surface conflict between the compensation law\u2019s demand for secured compensation and the statutory policy against insurance for willful torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The conflict disappears in the light of additional statutes. Labor Code section 4553 directs that the workmen\u2019s compensation otherwise recoverable shall be increased one-half when the employee is injured by the employer\u2019s serious and willful misconduct, while Insurance Code section 11661 prohibits insurance covering this additional compensation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The award for serious and willful misconduct represents additional compensation over and above what we have termed the employer\u2019s \u201cordinary liability\u201d for disability and medical expenses; each of the two awards represents a different kind of liability; that for serious and willful misconduct has the characteristics of a penalty superimposed upon the standard scale of pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If, as Pacific Indemnity contends, Insurance Code section 533 and Civil Code section 1668 apply to workmen\u2019s compensation liability, they overlay both ordinary compensation and the additional compensation for serious and willful misconduct. Given that scope, these provisions would deprive section 11661 of useful function. The latter is a specialized expression of the same public policy expressed by the other two statutes, but evolved for the particular purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. The employer\u2019s inability to insure himself against liability for serious and willful misconduct amply fulfills the public policy banning insurance which tends to encourage willful injury. The public policy does not stand in need of additional support. For the purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation system, Insurance Code section 11661 serves as sole spokesman of the public policy. Section 533 of the Insurance Code and section 1668 of the Civil Code do not apply to workmen\u2019s compensation insurance coverage and do not prohibit insurance against the employer\u2019s ordinary liability for disability compensation and medical expense, even when occasioned by his willful wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The.Appeals Board awarded Mrs. Azevedo disability compensation and medical expenses, but no additional compensation for serious and willful misconduct. Pacific Indemnity\u2019s disclaimer of coverage is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In assailing dismissal of her civil damage action, Mrs. Azevedo proposes a judicial detour around the statutes making the workmen\u2019s compensation law the \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3600-3601, fn. 2, <em>supra.) </em>She points out that the employee\u2019s confinement to workmen\u2019s compensation protects the employer from the common law consequence of his intentional tort, shielding him from general and punitive damage liability. She urges a concurrent pair of liabilities and concurrent jurisdiction on the part of the two tribunals in this limited class of cases, the ultimate damage award to be diminished by the compensation award. Thus, for different motivations, she would reach a result somewhat paralleling that sought by the compensation insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The compensation laws of some states expressly sanction tort damage recovery in addition to the compensation award where the injury resulted from the employer\u2019s deliberate act. (2 Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law, pp. 160-161.) In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>some other jurisdictions the courts have rejected employer attempts to invoke workmen\u2019s compensation coverage as a defense against intentional tort suits. Some, as did this court in <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Globin </em>(fn. 1, <em>supra), </em>declare that the employer\u2019s intentional wrong is not employment-connected at all; others that the employer\u2019s deliberate wrong gives the employee a choice of remedies between a civil action and workmen\u2019s compensation claim. One theory is that the employer \u201cwill not be heard\u201d to allege that his intentional wrong was an industrial accident;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> another that he severed the employment relationship by his act of violence; another that resort to workmen\u2019s compensation as a bar to civil relief encourages willful torts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">No question is raised here as to coverage by the workmen\u2019s compensation law. The same law, in Labor Code sections 3600-3601, declares itself the exclusive source of entitlement for covered injuries. A damage suit as an alternative or additional source of compensation, becomes permissible only by carving a judicial exception in an uncarved statute. Whatever the question of judicial power, the <em>ad hoc </em>theories devised to avoid the statute possess shallow appeal. Resort to a fictitious theory of noncompensability relegates the employee to the dubious benefit of a lawsuit he may lose. The theory which poses a civil action as a sanction against deliberate torts is enfeebled by the compensation law\u2019s penalty for serious and willful misconduct. Neither moral aversion to the employer\u2019s act nor the shiny prospect of a large damage verdict justifies interference with what is essentially a policy choice of the Legislature. The policy choice is to provide employees economic insurance against disability in exchange for the speculative possibility of general damages;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to offer the augmented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>award for serious and willful misconduct in trade for the relatively rare award of punitive damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Counsel for Mrs. Azevedo cites <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Steamship Yaka </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 410 [10 L.Ed.2d 448, 83 S.Ct. 1349], which holds that the \u201cexclusive liability\u201d clause of the federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not prevent an <em>in rem </em>action against an unseaworthy vessel supplied by an owner who (under the circumstances of the case) was also the employer of the injured longshoreman. The <em>Reed </em>case is not persuasive here, resting as it does upon an appraisal of congressional intent in the particular enactment. A minority opinion in <em>Reed </em>(373 U.S. at pp. 417-418 [10 L.Ed.2d at pp. 453-454]) confessed inability to find such a congressional intent. The comparable clauses of California law (in Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3600 and 3601) are unambiguous internally, in relation to associated statutes and in relation to the facts at hand. There is no need or occasion for narrowing them by construction. Whenever, to employ the terminology of section 3601, the \u201cconditions of compensation\u201d are found to exist, Mrs. Azevedo\u2019s entitlement is or will be confined to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">While consistent with <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>the superior court\u2019s dismissal of Mrs. Azevedo\u2019s lawsuit was premature. A judicial affirmation of compensability becomes <em>res judicata </em>only when it reaches finality.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board award had not actually become final when the superior court dismissed Mrs. Azevedo\u2019s lawsuit, because the award was still subject to a writ of review. Nevertheless, both proceedings have been consolidated for. decision in this court. The consolidation subjects both judgments to an identical timetable of finality. Hence it is safe to affirm both the compensation award and the superior court judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Pacific Indemnity questions the propriety of a sum awarded for self-procured physiotherapy. An award for self-procured medical treatment was proper because the employer had failed to provide treatment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4600.) The physiotherapy item is the subject of complaint because an unspecified part of the cost was incurred a few days before Mrs. Azevedo consulted a licensed physician. The monetary significance of the objection is not revealed, but it is infer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ably close to <em>de minimis. </em>The physician acquiesced in the physiotherapy program and directed its continuance. Under these circumstances Mrs. Azevedo is not in the position of a claimant who incurred a significant bill for auxiliary services without medical direction. The doctor\u2019s ratification related back to the portion of the physiotherapist\u2019s fee incurred within the preceding few days, and his direction for its continuance demonstrates its reasonableness. (See 2 Hanna, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 16.01 [2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board is affirmed; the superior court judgment of dismissal is likewise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Pierce, P.
