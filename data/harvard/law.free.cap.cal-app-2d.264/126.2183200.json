It was brought by the plaintiffs, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>defendant filed a cross-complaint also seeking injunctive relief and damages. After a two-day trial the trial court entered judgment enjoining both parties and their employees from parking vehicles or placing signs or structures in the setback area fronting the respective business properties. The court also ordered defendant to remove a so-called \u201cmenu board\u201d from a 6-foot fence and enjoined defendant from obstructing the area above the fence in any manner. The court, however, retained jurisdiction to fix plaintiffs\u2019 damages, both compensatory and punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Bach party is engaged in the business of dispensing food, drinks, gas and similar products to customers who travel along TJ. S. Highway 99 in Tulare County. Bach has \u201cdrive-in\u201d facilities, a gas station and a fruit stand located between the main highway and a frontage road. Because of the layout persons traveling north on Highway 99 first see plaintiffs\u2019 establishment; then, when the travelers turn off the highway \u2022to the north of both establishments and proceed south, they first see defendant\u2019s establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The parties began business operations within one week of each other, and before long they began annoying one another. Thus, the record, as is often the case in an action of this nature, is replete with evidence of petty bickering and ungentlemanly conduct. However, to avoid repetition we shall discuss the evidence when we separately consider defendant\u2019s several contentions for reversal of the judgment. These contentions are substantially as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">I. The court erred when it ordered defendant to remove the so-called \u201cmenu board\u201d from defendant\u2019s 6-foot fence and permanently enjoined defendant from obstructing the area above the fence in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">II. The judgment permanently enjoining the use of the setback area is contrary to both the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">III. The judgment relating to damages is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">IV. The court\u2019s denial of the injunctive relief requested by defendant in his cross-complaint was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">On July 9, 1963, shortly after the parties commenced to do business, defendant erected a 6-foot fence on the dividing line of their \u25a0 adjoining properties. Subsequently defendant extended the fence to a height of 15 feet, 6 inches. He then painted advertising on the extension and called it a \u201cmenu board.\u201d Defendant listed his food items but not the prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The court, however, determined the main purpose for the erection of the so-called \u201cmenu board\u201d was to annoy the plaintiffs and therefore ordered it removed. Specifically, the court found defendant maliciously and unnecessarily erected the \u201cmenu board\u201d to hide plaintiffs\u2019 premises from, the view from the frontage road, a public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Defendant contends that the court used at least four different legal theories in arriving at its judgment, viz., the structure interfered with defendant\u2019s easement of view, it violated the spite fence law, it constituted a nuisance, and it constituted unfair competition. Defendant then extensively argues the validity of each theory. Succinctly, he asserts: it is the settled decisional law of this state that there is no easement in view in California; the spite fence law was misapplied since it does not prohibit structures up to 10 feet above the ground; the \u201cmenu board\u201d could not properly be classified as a nuisance because it was constructed for a lawful purpose; and the doctrine of unfair competition has no application in a case of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">It is the general rule that the unreasonable, unwarrantable or unlawful use by a person of his own property so as to interfere with the rights of others is a nuisance (66 C.J.S., Nuisances, \u00a71, p. 727). In fact, any unwarranted activity which causes substantial injury to the property of another or obstructs its reasonable use and enjoyment is a nuisance which may be abated. And, even a lawful use of one\u2019s property may constitute a nuisance if it is part of a general scheme to annoy a neighbor and if the main purpose of the use is to prevent the neighbor from reasonable enjoyment of his own property <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Northridge, </em>67 Cal.App. 2d 69 [153 P.2d 800]). Thus, we do not find it necessary to discuss all of the theories which the trial court may have considered when it arrived at its judgment.  On the contrary, we conclude that there was ample evidence to justify the court\u2019s order requiring defendant to remove the \u201cmenu board\u201d on the ground that it constituted a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">First, there was substantial evidence for the court to find that the so-called \u201cmenu board\u201d was not necessary or essential to defendant\u2019s business and defendant\u2019s business motive was secondary or incidental. Defendant\u2019s customers were required to get out of their cars and walk to the kitchen to place their orders as defendant did not provide car service. And, significantly, defendant had menu boards hung on his kitchen building. Moreover, the trial judge determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the \u201cmenu board\u201d was not necessary to defendant\u2019s business after he viewed defendant's premises.  It is settled that a view of the scene by the trial judge is independent evidence on which a finding may be made and sustained <em>(Otey </em>v. <em>Carmel Sanitary Dist., 219 </em>Cal. 310, 312 [26 P.2d 308]; Evid. Code, \u00a7140).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Second, there was substantial evidence for the court to find that defendant maliciously placed the \u201cmenu board\u201d on the fence to annoy the plaintiffs. Defendant had operated a similar business at another location. Yet appellant did not have a comparable menu board at that location. Furthermore, when defendant first erected the \u201cmenu board,\u201d the solid portion began at a height of 10 feet above the ground, extending upward to a height of 15 feet, 6 inches, leaving a middle gap of approximately 4 feet which still allowed some view of plaintiffs\u2019 premises. However, defendant then covered this gap with bamboo curtains and almost completely blocked the view of plaintiffs\u2019 premises. Later defendant permanently filled the gap so that the structure became a solid wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Third, there was substantial evidence for the court to find that the erection of the \u201cmenu board\u201d was part of defendant\u2019s general scheme (and only one of his many activities) to annoy plaintiffs and to interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable use and enjoyment of their property. Shortly after the completion of the drive-in restaurants, defendant told plaintiffs that since plaintiffs would not purchase defendant\u2019s business he would do things to plaintiff Hutcherson \u201cthat he wouldn\u2019t do to a dirty dog.\u201d Defendant also told others that he was going to eliminate plaintiffs as a competitor. Defendant then embarked on a course of conduct which included the following activities. He drove his car out to the frontage road and blocked oncoming traffic from going into plaintiffs\u2019 business. He erected a produce stand in a position to block the view of plaintiffs\u2019 premises from the frontage road. He hired young toughs to chase off the plaintiffs\u2019 hired little boy who was passing out free refreshment tickets. He parked a truck on plaintiffs\u2019 right of way and painted white arrows on the frontage road pavement directing people to his establishment. He intimidated plaintiffs\u2019 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Defendant vigorously argues the use of his fence for a \u201cmenu board,\u201d at least up to a height of 10 feet, was a lawful use of the premises and hence could not be enjoined by the trial court. However, a similar argument was rejected in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Northridge, supra, 67 </em>Cal.App.2d 69. In that osase the court at page 75 of the opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201cThe board fence mounted on the retaining wall along the east line of plaintiffs lot darkened their home and excluded their eastern view of the city and prevented designed ventilation. <em>Judging by the behavior of defendants in other respects the trial court must have been impressed that the fence was not constructed to serve the comfort of defendants but only to annoy and grieve plaintiffs. </em>At the trial it was contended as here, that a board fence is not a nuisance <em>per se </em>and it will not be abated unless it unnecessarily exceeds ten feet in height. (Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 2532; Stats. 1913, p. 342.) While the testimony was closely conflicting upon the height of the rough board fence, the court\u2019s finding'was made after the judge\u2019s inspection of the premises. Such inspection constituted independent evidence and provided support for the finding. <em>(Gibson Properties Co. </em>v. <em>City of Oakland, </em>12 Cal.2d 291 [83 P.2d 942].) Even though the fence had not been ten feet in height still it was a nuisance if it was constructed with malicious intent, interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 full enjoyment of their home and if its usefulness to defendants was \u2018subordinate and incidental.\u2019 (See <em>Haehlen </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 437 [54 P.2d 62].\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Defendant does not challenge the validity of the Tulare County ordinance which establishes a building setback area for defendant\u2019s property.  A comity may establish, setback areas and similar regulations in the interest of sound community planning and to allow for future growth. Defendant, however, asserts that the trial court\u2019s order enjoining both parties \u201cfrom parking automobiles, trucks, trailers and vehicles of any kind or placing signs or other structures, .portable or otherwise, in the building line setback area\u201d is erroneous since it enjoins both lawful and unlawful use of their setback area. Specifically, he maintains that the injunction, put in terms of the ordinance, nevertheless exceeds the scope of the county ordinance because the ordinance applies only to fixed structures and not to vehicles or movables such as signs or skids.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the Tulare County setback ordinance applies only to permanent structures is persuasive.  However, as we have stated, even a-lawful .use.-of property is a nuisance and may be enjoined if the real purr pose is to annoy someone else and to obstruct the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>uSe and enjoyment of his property. And when plaintiffs\u2019 evidence relating to defendant\u2019s use of the setback area is considered in light of defendant\u2019s previously related conduct, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for the court to find that defendant\u2019s use of the setback was just another facet of defendant's overall scheme to annoy plaintiffs and to interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">According to plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, defendant parked trucks and cars in the setback area to block the view of respondents \u2019 premises. He also placed an \u201cexit only\u201d sign 4 feet high and 8 feet wide in the setback area to mislead customers into believing that nothing was south of that sign. And on one occasion he even put a sign saying \u201cmain entrance\u201d on a pickup truck and parked the truck in the setback area for approximately three months. This sign was designed to cause prospective customers traveling south on the frontage road to believe that the entrance into defendant\u2019s business was the only entrance into any business.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">We conclude, however, the court\u2019s injunction is worded far too broadly. The Tulare County setback ordinance, by its own terms, applies only to permanent structures and was enacted to guard against insurmountable acquisition costs to the county and in the acquisition of future rights of way which would obviously result from the erection of permanent structures in area clearly needed to accommodate future growth and orderly community development.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the injunction as worded prohibits lawful uses of the setback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>area by the defendant even if such uses are not intended to, and do not in fact, unnecessarily interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of plaintiffs\u2019 property. Therefore, the injunction must be modified to enjoin only those uses which are unlawful, or lawful but nevertheless primarily designed to annoy plaintiffs and to obstruct plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable use of their premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court found the plaintiffs had suffered business losses, but the amount of the losses could not be ascertained with reasonable certainty and hence were speculative. Plaintiffs had scarcely commenced to operate their business when the trouble began, and the court apparently felt there was insufficient business information available to determine the extent of plaintiffs\u2019 business losses with precision. Thus, the court retained jurisdiction to fix plaintiffs \u2019 damages at a later date after the nuisance had been abated and plaintiffs had the opportunity to operate their business for a period of time without defendant\u2019s interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">It is of course true that a court of equity may, under certain circumstances, retain jurisdiction over the parties to the action in order to make certain that its orders and injunctions are obeyed <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Bucke\u2019s Dept. Store, </em>199 Cal. 194 [248 P. 668]). And, manifestly, in bifurcated cases the court retains jurisdiction, after the liability issue has been resolved, to fix the damages or for accounting and similar purposes.  However, no statute or decision has been cited and none has been found which authorizes a judgment of the character rendered, i.e., which would authorize a court to abate a nuisance which is injurious to the plaintiffs\u2019 business, as in the instant case, and then to defer judgment on the issue of past damages to a later date in order to consider evidence accumulated after the nuisance has been abated. If anything, the authorities are to the contrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The difficulty here originally arose because plaintiffs were engaged in a new business venture when defendant erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the so-called \u201cmenu board\u201d on his 6-foot fence and engaged in the other obnoxious activities to which we have referred. Consequently, the court\u2019s desire to give the plaintiffs the opportunity to prove their business losses is understandable. However, be this as it may, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact on this issue are ambiguous and the judgment which was ultimately entered thereon is erroneous.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Had the trial judge decided that he could only speculate whether or not the defendant\u2019s actions caused plaintiffs any damages, then a finding of damages would clearly have been erroneous <em>(Continental Car-Na-Var Corp. </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>24 Cal.2d 104, 113 [148 P.2d 9]).  However, here the judge determined defendant\u2019s conduct caused plaintiffs some damages. Thus, if the trial judge merely believed the evidence was speculative in the sense that he could not calculate the damages with certainty, he should have nevertheless resorted to the best evidence available and fixed damages accordingly <em>(Ojala </em>v. <em>Bohlin, </em>178 Cal.App.2d 292 [2 Cal.Rptr. 919]). It is the rule that one whose wrongful conduct has rendered the determination of damages -uncertain cannot thereby escape liability <em>(Xum Speegle, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 546, 556 [31 Cal.Rptr. 104]). On the other hand, if the trial judge believed the evidence was completely speculative so that the amount of damages fixed would be entirely conjectural, he should have at least allowed plaintiffs nominal damages (Civ. Code, \u00a73360).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Thus, in no event should the court have deferred the issue of past damages to a later date in order to give plaintiffs a second chance to prove their damages according to profits made in entirely new and different circumstances. In fact, the trial judge could not possibly determine plaintiffs\u2019 business losses by resorting to business data accumulated after the \u201cmenu board\u201d had been removed without engaging in sheer speculation. Plaintiffs\u2019 business profits or losses are dependent primarily on customer patronage, and any increases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 customer patronage which may occur \u25a0 during the. one-year period following the removal of the /'menu board\u201d and the cessation of defendant\u2019s other injurious .'.cpnduef could conceivably result from numerous other imponderable factors such as economic conditions, increased- highway use, changes in business policies and effective management.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We do not, however, agree with defendant\u2019s suggestion that defendant is entitled to judgment on the issue of damages.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we have stated, plaintiffs are at least entitled to nominal damages. They are also entitled to a decision on the issue of punitive damages; when the facts warrant, exemplary or punitive damages may be recovered in a nuisance case. <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Northridge, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 69, 76 [153 P.2d 800] ; <em>McIvor </em>v. <em>Mercer-Fraser Co., </em>76 Cal.App.2d 247, 254 [172 P.2d 758]). Moreover, defendant has not yet removed the \"menu board;\u201d the removal of the board was deferred pending disposition of this appeal. Thus, it is possible (and even probable) that additional ascertainable damages have since accumulated.  No supplemental pleading is required to obtain damages to the date of trial in an equitable action <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>89 Cal.App. 107, 112 [264 P. 776]; <em>Kazanteno </em>v. <em>Cal-Western etc. Ins. Co., </em>137 Cal.App.2d 361, 376-377 [290 P.2d 332]).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the court erred when it denied defendant the injunctive relief requested in his cross-complaint is a mere quarrel with the court\u2019s finding of fact and without substantial merit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And since there is substantial evidence to support this finding, we cannot disturb the court\u2019s judgment on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The judgment is reversed insofar as it absolutely prohibits the parties from parking vehicles or placing signs or other structures, portable or otherwise, in the building line setback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>area, and insofar as it purports to postpone the damages determination. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed. The cause is \u25a0 therefore remanded to the trial court with instructions (1) to modify its injunction enjoining the parties \u201cfrom parking automobiles, trucks, trailers and vehicles of any kind or placing signs or other structures, portable or otherwise in the building line setback area\u201d to conform with the views expressed in this opinion and, accordingly, to enjoin only such activities and uses (including the parking of automobiles, trucks, trailers and vehicles and the erection or placing of structures, portable or otherwise, by either party, their agents or employees) in the setback area not otherwise prohibited by the setback ordinance, which the court has found, on the basis of the evidence previously presented, or may find, on the basis of additional evidence as may be presented by the parties, are primarily and intentionally designed to interfere with access rights, view of the premises or any other reasonable use or enjoyment of the parties\u2019 respective premises; and (2) to determine and fix plaintiffs\u2019 damages, both punitive and compensatory, in accordance with the views herein expressed and on the basis of evidence previously presented and such additional evidence as may be presented by the parties.
