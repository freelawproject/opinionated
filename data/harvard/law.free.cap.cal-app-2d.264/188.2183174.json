J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiV\">Lionel Arthur Slade and Vannoy Leo Black, convicted of possessing marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530), appeal from probation orders deemed final judgments (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">At 4:55a.m., April 15, 1967, San Diego Police Officer Jacobson very slowly drove his police vehicle on Main Street watching a slowly moving, erratically driven 1955 Chevrolet traveling behind him; slowed down; saw the Chevrolet remaining behind, similarly slowly; pulled to a curb; let the Chevrolet with four occupants pass; started to pursue. Immediately the Chevrolet pulled to a curb and stopped. Jacobson then stopped, turning on his red light to keep the four occu: pants stationary while awaiting cover. Two men, Slade and driver Black, stepped out and came to the rear of the Chevrolet asking for directions to 39th Street. Jacobson asked for and examined their identification. Black owned the Chevrolet. Officer Boyette arrived; asked Black if there was anything \"in the vehicle he would not want seen; heard Black\u2019s negative answer; asked \u201cDo you have any objection if I search your vehicle ? \u201d; was told by Black \u2018 \u2018 Go ahead. \u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Pushing the upper half of the right front seat forward to get into the rear seat, Boyette observed a marijuana cigarette on the exposed recessed front seat. The officers found 13 marijuana cigarettes hidden behind the dashboard. Both Slade\u2019s and Black\u2019s pockets contained marijuana debris.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Contrary to their first contention, the marijuana cigarettes found in Black\u2019s vehicle, Black\u2019s erratic driving, Black\u2019s and Slade\u2019s quick exiting from the Chevrolet, asking a diversionary direction question, and the marijuana debris in their clothing at the time sufficiently support the finding they controlled and maintained dominion over marijuana knowing, of its presence and narcotic character <em>(People </em>v. Waller, 260 Cal.App.2d 131, 142 [67 Cal.Rptr. 8]; <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1940 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Chrysler, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 306, 314 [175 P.2d 585]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gory, </em>28 Cal.2d 450 [170 P.2d 433]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Redrick, </em>55 Cal.2d 282 [10 Cal.Rptr. 823, 359 P.2d 255]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 163, 171 [62 Cal.Rptr. 848]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 545, 552 [58 Cal.Rptr. 707]; see <em>Rideout </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>67 Cal.2d 471 [62 Cal.Rptr. 581, 432 P.2d 197]).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Black and Slade tortuously contend the police unlawfully found their marijuana. Jacobson properly stopped, red-lighted, detained and investigated <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miekelson, </em>59 Cal.2d 448 [30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658]). Black consented to the search. The request for permission to search implied a choice of granting or refusing the request, and did not require a warning that consent might be refused <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>246 Cal.App.2d 715, 729 [55 Cal.Rptr. 62]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chaddock, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 483, 485-486 [57 Cal.Rptr. 582]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Campuzano, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 52, 57 [61 Cal.Rptr. 695]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dahlke, </em>257 Cal.App.2d 82, 87 [64 Cal. Rptr. 599]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 23, 31 [65 Cal.Rptr. 487]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyles, </em>260 Cal.App.2d 62, 67, 68 [66 Cal.Rptr. 799]).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On direct examination in his own behalf, Slade testified he knew the narcotic nature of marijuana. Over objection the trial court permitted Deputy District Attorney Hewicker to ask \u201cHave you smoked marijuana before?\u201d and, after a yes response, \u201cWhen was the last time?\u201d Slade answered eight to ten months ago. Deputy Hewicker wanted on cross-examination to prove other offenses to prove Slade\u2019s knowledge of marijuana\u2019s narcotic nature, the very thing Slade had just admitted. Objecting, Slade cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 97 [294 P.2d 997], in which alleged heroin seller Spencer, in substance, before the trial court admitted evidence of other offenses to prove knowledge of the narcotic nature of heroin, testified he knew what heroin was. Reversing, and discussing the trial court\u2019s admission of other offense evidence, the reviewing court said: \u201cSince it was already clear that knowledge of the narcotic character of heroin was not an issue there was no reason, and no justification, for the admission of this evidence with the attendant danger of its misuse by the jury despite the cautionary instruction of the court.\u201d [Page 105.] Here, as in <em>Spencer, </em>Slade\u2019s testimony removed the knowledge issue from dispute, sapping the other offense evidence of probative value, leaving the purpose of its admission an attempt to inflame and prejudice, violating the' basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>principles regarding other offense evidence discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>66 Cal.2d 232 [57 Cal.Rptr. 363, 424 P.2d 947], <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 286 [68 Cal.Rptr. 578],</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Regarding the other' offense error, Black cannot complain. The evidence related solely to Slade. The error, furthermore, as to Slade could not have been prejudicial. When asked on cross-examination to explain how marijuana debris got in his clothes, Slade answered \u201cWell, I was arrested before this,\u201d meaning, as later explained, he wore the same clothes some five months earlier when arrested for marijuana possession. This testimony of an earlier marijuana offense, to the same effect as the cumulative evidence improperly admitted, mitigates convincingly against finding prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Black contends Deputy Hewicker prejudicially misconducted himself during argument by saying: \u201cWe are talking about joint possession in this case. Of course, the idea is to blame it on those that aren\u2019t here. What about the two juveniles? Why not blame them, <em>blame it on anybody but the defendants. </em>Well, that is a smart tactic; sure, <em>that is what they get paid for.\u201d </em>[Italics added.] After Black objected, Deputy Hewicker immediately restored jury focus by saying: <em>\u201cLet\u2019s refer to it as their duty then, </em>that is a better word, but that doesn\u2019t explain away the presence of the debris in all of these pockets, does it?\u201d [Italics added.] This by-play is trivia without consequence at trial, certainly not prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Black\u2019s contention regarding a witness testifying solely against Slade, about the debris in Slade\u2019s pants, is improvidently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
