L. Hume, he executed to Lindsay another bond, for-: that on the-, he paid to Lindsay the full amount of this last bond, and took his receipt for the same: that shortly thereafter he was served with a writ, in the name of said Lindsay, for debt: that, supposing the action to be founded on his individual bond to Lindsay, he made no defence, and a judgment was. obtained against him: that he has since found that the judgment was for the amount of the paid bond, which had been assigned to Mason, though the plaintiff, at the time of the payment, had no notice of that assignment: and that, until after the judgment was recovered, the plaintiff did not know that the suit was in the Superior Court, but supposed it to be in the County Court. Wherefore, he prayed an injunction, to restrain the defendants from proceeding on the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-7\">An injunction was granted, according to the prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-8\">On behalf of the defendants, respectively, demurrers were filed to the bill, as not shewing any title of the plaintiff to relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-9\">In this state of the cause, the plaintiff, by leave of the court, filed an amended'bill, setting forth his case somewhat differently, and more in detail. This bill stated, that on the - day of-, the plaintiff executed to Landon Lindsay and Lewis Lindsay, jointly, or to Landon Lindsay, individually, a bond for a debt due from him individually. That, on the 21st of January, 1828, one W. L. Hume, (since deceased,) and the plaintiff, who had been partners in business, executed to Landon arid Lewis Lindsay their joint obligation for 200 dollars, payable on the 25th of December ensuing; on the back of which an endorsement was made in these words: \u201cThe whole amount of the within is to be paid to Landon Lindsay, on ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>count of the extra improvements which he put at the springs after the partnership was dissolved. March 1, 1828.\u201d (Signed) \u201cL. &amp;L. Lindsay.\u201d That the plaintiff afterwards paid to Landon Lindsay the full amount of the lastmentioned bond, and took his receipt for the same. That, at the time of the payment, Lindsay said he had\u2019not the bond with him, but promised to deliver it up to the plaintiff, or destroy it. That, instead of complying with this promise, it since appears he transferred the bond to the defendant Mason. That a suit was instituted in the Circuit Court of Orange, in the names of Landon Lindsay and Lewis Lindsay, upon the bond which had been paid; and when the writ, which was against \u201cJames Kelson, Junior,\u201d and not against James Kelson, Junior, as surviving obligor of <em>~W. </em>L. Hume and James Kelson, Junior, was served upon this complainant, he supposed that the suit was brought upon the bond given for his individual debt; under which impression, and knowing that debt to be justly due, he made no defence to the suit, but suffered judgment to pass by default. That he had no notice of the transfer of the bond to Mason, at the time of paying the amount thereof to Lindsay; nor did he know or suspect, until after the judgment was obtained, that the bond so paid had been transferred, or had not been destroyed, or that it was the subject of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-9\">The bond for 200 dollars, with the endorsement thereon, the receipt for the amount of that bond, and the writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, </em>referred to in the amended bill, were exhibited therewith. The receipt bears date the 1st of Kovember, 1831, and the signature was proved to be the handwriting of Landon Lindsay. The individual bond of the complainant, also referred to in the amended bill, was produced in evidene\u00e9. It bears even date with the receipt for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>amount of the other bond, namely, the 1st of Novemher, 1831, and is executed to Landon Lindsay, <em>indivirtually, </em>for 163 dollars 71 cents, payable on demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">To the amended bill, neither answer nor demurrer was put in by either of the defendants: and it appearing that Landon Lindsay was not an inhabitant of the commonwealth, an order of publication was entered and executed against him. As to Lindsay, both the bill and amended bill, and as to Mason, the amended bill, were taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">W. S. Frazer, a witness examined in the cause, deposed, that on the 2d of January, 1832, the deponent, as deputy sheriff of Orange county, served a writ upon the complainant Nelson, at the suit of Landon and Lewis Lindsay, which suit was brought to recover the sum of 200 dollars. This was the only writ he ever executed upon Nelson. Nelson expressed some surprise at the amount, and told deponent that he had executed his bond to Landon Lindsay, but for a less sum than 200 dollars, somewhere about 160 or 170 dollars, and he supposed that was the bond on which the suit was brought, as it was the only debt he owed Lindsay; but, he said, he might be mistaken in the amount. Deponent thinks he did not shew the writ to Nelson, but only informed him that he had a writ against him for the amount of 200 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">The deposition of Mann A. Page, another witness examined in the cause, is in the following terms: \u201c The deponent, being sworn, deposeth and saith, that he was employed by James Nelson, Senior, to prosecute a suit upon an injunction bond, in his name, as executor of Henry Wood, against Landon Lindsay and Launcelot Lindsay; that he obtained judgment, and by direction of Richard Richards, agent for James Nelson, Senior, who employed him to bring the suit, he allowed <em>said </em>bond as a credit to the execution in the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Wood\u2019s executor against Lindsay, which this deponent did, and said bond is now in his possession; which bond is in the following words and figures, to wit(Here the complainant\u2019s individual bond to Landon Lindsay for 163 dollars 71 cents was copied.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The cause coming on to be heard upon the bill, amended bill, demurrers to the bill, exhibits and depositions, the court overruled the demurrers, and directed an issue to be made up, and tried by a jury at its own bar, to ascertain whether or no the plaintiff did pay to Landon Lindsay the amount of the bond for 200 dollars, before notice of the assignment thereof by Lindsay to Mason. A jury being accordingly impanneled at a subsequent term, found that the plaintiff did make such payment before notice of such assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">The cause was finally heard the 2d of October, 1835, on the papers formerly read, and the verdict of the jury: on consideration whereof, the court decreed that the injunction awarded the plaintiff he made perpetual, and that the defendants pay him his costs of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">On the petition of Mason, an appeal was allowed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-12\"><em>Patton </em>for the appellant: there was no counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-13\">Tucker, P., and Cabell and Stanard, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8F\">concurred in the following entry, Brooke, J. dissented:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">\u201c The court is of opinion, that the case made by the bill, and sustained by the proofs, entitled the appellee to relief in equity, But the measure of that relief depended upon the state of facts in regard to the bond for 163 dollars 71 cents, which ought to have been ascertained by proper proceedings before final action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>upon the case. The appellee in his bill admits, that at the time of the institution of the action at law, that debt was justly due, and supposing that to be the subject of the suit, he designed no defence to it. Although, therefore, the 200 dollar bond had been paid, Nelson still owed Landon Lindsay 163 dollars 71 cents, to which Mason was equitably entitled. And unless Nelson had paid that sum to Landon Lindsay before notice of Mason\u2019s interest in the transaction, or unless the bond had been assigned by Lindsay to some third person without notice of Mason\u2019s rights, he must still be liable to Mason for that amount. By the pleadings and proofs, it neither appears that the bond for 163 dollars 71 cents has been paid by Nelson, nor that it is not still in Lindsay\u2019s hands. The confused and almost unintelligible deposition of Page, would seem to indicate, indeed, that Lindsay had disposed of the bond; but when or how, does not appear. In this state of the case, the court is of opinion that it was erroneous to perpetuate the injunction as to the whole amount of the judgment, since, upon the pleadings as they now stand, Mason would appear to be entitled to this 163 dollars 71 cents, as Nelson states it was unpaid when suit was brought, and neither alleges subsequent payment, nor assignment by Lindsay to a third person. The court is therefore of opinion that the said decree is erroneous. Therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellee do pay unto the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal. And it is ordered, that the cause be remanded to the Circuit Superior Court, with instructions to dissolve the injunction as to the sum of 163 dollars 71 cents, with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum, from the 1st day of November, 1831, till paid, and the costs of the action at law, without damages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>unless the appellee, by proper proceedings, shall establish to the satisfaction of the court that he hath, paid the amount of the said bond before notice of Mason\u2019s interest in the transaction, or that the bond-hath been assigned by Lindsay to some third person,, who hath title to the same superior to the equitable; right of the said Mason.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
