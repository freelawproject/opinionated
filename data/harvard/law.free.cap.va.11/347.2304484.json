And the said defendants proved that the land in controversy was embraced by this deed; that the land embraced in the deed was in the actual possession of Shirkey, from the time of the grant till the date of the deed, and in the possession of the defendants ever since the deed was made; that the land mentioned in the grant had been duly entered on the books of the commissioner of the revenue of Kanawha county, where the land was situated, from the time of issuing the said grant to this time; and that Samuels, Shirkey, and the defendants, had paid and discharged all the taxes charged or justly \u25a0chargeable thereon against them, since the issuing of the said grant. Thereupon, the plaintiff produced a grant, made by the commonwealth on the 16th of June, 1786, to Thomas Augustus Taylor, for 3,051 .acres; under which grant the plaintiff claimed the land in controversy. And in order to be allowed to give said grant in evidence to the jury, the plaintiff proved that Thomas O. Taylor, one of the lessors of the plaintiff, is the only child, and the heir at law, of the said Thomas Augustus Taylor, who had died before the institution of this suit; and he produced 'the following papers, to wit: a receipt, of the 28th of August, 1834, given by John Adams Smith, the chief clerk in the auditor\u2019s office, then acting as auditor, shewing that, pursuant to the 27th section of an act passed on the 10th of March, 1832 concerning delinquent and forfeited lands, Thomas O. Taylor had paid in advance, for the year 1834, the taxes on several tracts of land, one of which was the said tract of 3,051 acres, and that the payment was credited to the sheriff of the county; at the foot of which receipt it was certified, that the taxes' on said lands had been released by law, to 1831, inclusive, and that the same had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>been returned delinquent to the auditor\u2019s office for the years 1832 and 1833, and were only charged on the commissioner\u2019s books of Kanawha for the year 1834, in Thomas O. Taylor\u2019s name: also, a certificate of the commissioner of Kanawha county, bearing date the 26th of February, 1835, stating that Thomas O. Taylor did enter on the commissioner\u2019s books certain tracts of land, one of which was the tract of 3,051 acres, and that he had charged the taxes on the said tracts for the years 1832, 1833 and 1835, on his land book for 1835, without charging damages; and that the said tracts were entered on the books in May, 1834, and were so certified by him to the auditor in the books of that year: also, a receipt of the auditor, bearing date the 18th of March, 1835, shewing that Taylor paid the taxes of 1832, 1833 and 1835, which payment was in advance of the revenue of 1835, and would be passed to the credit of the sheriff: and likewise the official printed list of the auditor of public accounts, dated the 24th of August, 1831, purporting to be a list of lands and lots returned as delinquent for the non-payment of taxes for the year 1820, and prior thereto, and redeemable on or before the 1st of January, 1832; by which list it is shewn that the land mentioned in the said grant to the said Thomas Augustus Taylor, was returned delinquent for the non-payment of the taxes thereon in the year 1811. And no other evidence being offered by the plaintiff to shew that the land mentioned in said grant, and claimed by him m this suit, had been duly entered on the books of the commissioner of the revenue in the county where it was situated, and charged with taxes according to law, or that he, or those under whom he claimed, had actually paid the taxes charged and justly chargeable thereon, the defendants objected to the grant so offered by the plaintiff going in evidence to the jury; and the said objection being referred to the court, the judge was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>opinion that the defendants had shewn themselves <em>bona fide </em>claiming the land in controversy, mediately, tinder a grant from the commonwealth, issued before the first day of April, 1831, and had had the land so claimed ^ ^em duty entered on the books of the commissioner of the revenue, and had paid and discharged all taxes charged or justly chargeable thereon since the date of the patent under which they held as aforesaid; and that the plaintiff, on his part, had not shewn that he, and those under whom he claimed, had had the land, so by him . claimed, duly entered on the books of the commissioner of the revenue, and charged with taxes according to law, or that he or they had actually paid the taxes justly chargeable thereon, so as to authorize him to give in evidence the grant from the \u2022commonwealth under which he claimed title as aforesaid, according to the provisions of the 17th section of the act passed the 1st of April, 1831, entitled \u201can act concerning lands returned delinquent for non-payment of taxes, and making disposition of certain lands so delinquent, and of certain escheated lands, for the benefit of actual and <em>bona fide </em>holders thereof under grants from the commonwealth; \u201d and therefore sustained the objection made by the defendants, and excluded the said grant to Thomas Augustus Taylor from going in evidence to the jury. To which opinion the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\">The jury found a verdict for the defendants, and judgment was rendered for them; to which, on the petition of the plaintiff, a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AdGu\"><em>Johnson </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-6\"><em>B.

Code, ch. 287), it is provided hy the 17th section, that in a suit for the recovery of lands lying west of the Alleghany mountain, against a person <em>bona fide </em>claiming such lands, mediately or immediately, under a grant from the commonwealth issued ^previously to the act, who has had the lands duly entered, and has paid all the taxes chargeable upon them, his adversary shall not be allowed to give his grant in evidence, unless he shall shew that he too has had Ms hands duly entered and charged with taxes according to law, and has actually paid the taxes charged and justly chargeable upon them. Has the plaintiff in this case done so ?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">First, as to entering the land with the commissioner. This was first required by the act of 1810; and accordingly it appears that the lands were on the commissioner\u2019s books in 1811; for they are on the auditor\u2019s list, as delinquent, for that year. How, if they were once on the books, it would seem that this duty was fulfilled, as it was not required to be repeated \u2022every year. But be this as it may, on the 26th of February, 1835, Thomas O. Taylor, the plaintiff, entered the lands again in his own name, as appears by the certificate of Commissioner Wilson. That commissioner further proceeded, according to law, to charge the tax on the lands for the year 1835, and also those for the back years 1833 and 1832 (that for 1834 having been previously paid in advance into the treasury, as appears by the auditor\u2019s receipt.) Why did he not go farther back? Why did he. not charge the taxes for the years anterior to 1832, back to 1811 ? Doubtless because they had before that time been already charged, cither to Thomas O. Taylor or Thomas Augustus Tay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>lor; for the lands had been listed in 1811, in the name-of Thomas Augustus Taylor, and must be presumed to have continued so on the books until they were-listed by Wilson, in 1835, as Thomas O. Taylor\u2019s. When anything is entrusted to an officer to be done,, the law presumes <em>omnia rite acta, </em>unless the contrary appears. Phillipps on Evid. 614; Starkie on Evid. part 2, p. 172. Here we are not at liberty to doubt that Wilson would have proceeded to enter and charg\u00e9* the taxes anterior to 1832, unless they had been already so entered and charged. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Hext, as to the payment. It is admitted that all the taxes subsequent to 1831 have been paid;, and it only remains to enquire whether those of 1831, and anterior, have been also paid or released. The evidence is satisfactory to my mind that they were released. By the act of March 10, 1832, it is provided, that if' the amount of taxes, exclusive of damages, charged upon any tract of land returned delinquent for the year 1831 or any prior year, shall not exceed ten dollars, they should be by that act relinquished and forever discharged. To establish the fact that his lands were exonerated by this act, the plaintiff has introduced the certificate of John Adams Smith the acting auditor. On this certificate two questions present themselves,</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">1. Is the certificate, being that of the clerk and not of the auditor, admissible evidence? This can admit of no doubt. In case of sickness or absence of the auditor, the chief clerk in the auditor\u2019s office is re- \u25a0 quired to perform the duties of the office; and the certificate being signed by J, A. Smith as chief clerk and acting auditor, I must presume he was acting by reason of the sickness or absence of his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">2. Does this certificate establish the fact that the taxes on this land were released by law ? If the evi- - dence is competent, there seems to be no reasonable-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>doubt of its sufficiency; for tbe officer whose duty it was to receive the treasurer\u2019s receipt for the taxes, and to give the landholder his receipt tor them, has certified that for 1831, and the years preceding that, the taxes were released. An attention to the formula in such cases will render this matter more clear. The landholder wishes to pay off his taxes to the state, at the treasury; which he is expressly authorized to do,. \u201cupon the certificate of the.auditor of public accounts, authorizing the treasurer to receive the same.\u201d 2'. Eev. Code, ch. 183, \u00a7 <em>87, </em>p. 38. Accordingly, he first goes to the auditor, and states his desire to pay the-taxes upon ,his land. It is the auditor\u2019s duty to examine the commissioner\u2019s books on file in his office,, ascertain the taxes due upon the land, and issue his. order or warrant to the treasurer to receive the amount. The treasurer does receive the amount, for which he gives his receipt. This receipt is handed to the auditor, who takes it up, and gives in lieu of it his own receipt; and that closes the transaction. That receipt of the auditor is a <em>quietus </em>to the party. In the performance of these duties, the auditor must examine the commissioner\u2019s books, he must ascertain what is due; he must therefore, in that examination, decide whether the lands of the party are or are not exonerated by the act of March 10,1832. If not exonerated, the amount due for them should be certified, that it may be paid. But he caunot decide whether they were exonerated, without ascertaining that the taxes anterior to 1832 did not exceed ten dollars. In the fulfilment of his duty, he must then have ascertained that fact from the books, and must have known that it was a fact when he so certified. The evidence therefore was sufficient. \"Was it competent? I think it was. The competency may be inferred from what has been already said. The duty of the auditor is to examine the books and ascertain the taxes due. Those which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>are released are not due. Of those charged, then, he must ascertain what are released. And when a <em>quietus </em>is demanded by the landholder, to which he is certainly entitled when he has paid all that is due, what is the auditor to give? If he is to give a receipt or <em>quietus </em>for those taxes which are paid, is it not within his province to give also a certificate that the other laxes, which were charged on the books, have been released? If the receipt is evidence of payment, why \u25a0.should not the certificate of the officer whose duty it is to decide what is due, be proper evidence of what has been released ? It is his business to examine and to judge whether the arrears before 1832 were under ten dollars, and were therefore released; it was the party\u2019s right to have evidence of that fact; and it was therefore competent for the auditor to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">I am, therefore, of opinion that the patent was improperly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">As to the other questions, as I have not a shadow of \u00abdoubt of the constitutionality of the law, and as it is not necessary to be decided, I shall not enter upon a consideration of the elaborate argument on the subject. Suffice it to say, that it has not had the effect of shaking the opinion I have always entertained, that however harsh many of our land laws may seem, it was fully competent to the legislature to pass them. The act in question is one of those, and harsh as it may be, it is the law of the land, which we must respect. I am not sure that it will not, upon the whole, be beneficial'.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Per curiam, judgment reversed, and cause remanded ROR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
