His father John Street, the elder, was his heir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>at law. Administration of his estate was granted by Qolm\u00a3y Court of Hanover to his brother Parke Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2W\">John Street the younger had been in his life time, for some years, a deputy sheriff of the county of Hanover. He died indebted on account of sundry liabilities which he had incurred in his official character, and otherwise indebted by specialties binding his heirs. He owned at his death some lands in the states of Ohio and Kentucky, and a lot in the city of Richmond, which descended to his father as his heir at law. His personal estate, which came to the hands of his administrator, was comparatively trivial, so that a very small portion of his debts could be paid out of it; yet the administrator paid all the debts, upon the faith, as he alleged, that he was to be reimbursed out of his intestate\u2019s real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH5S\">John Street the elder died in 1801, having made a will, wherein he devised as follows: \u201c\"Whereas a considerable portion of the estate of which I am now seized and possessed, is held by me as heir at law of my son John Street the younger deceased, being lands in the state of Virginia and other states of the Hnion, and the estate of my said deceased son being in an unsettled state, and it being uncertain how it will close, that is, whether his personal estate will be sufficient to discharge all his just debts or not; it is my will and desire, that if his personal estate shall not be sufficient to discharge all his just debts, .so much of the real estate of which I am possessed as his heir at law as will be sufficient fully to discharge his debts, even if it takes the whole of it, be sold by my executors as they may think best, and applied by them to the discharge of his debts; but should the estate heired by me as aforesaid, not be sufficient to discharge the debts of my said son John, in that case this clause is by no means to be construed to subject the estate possessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\"by me independent of such heirship to the payment \u25a0of the said debts.\u201d He appointed his sons, William, Parke, George and Anthony Street, his executors. And the will being offered by the executors for pro-bat in the County Court of Hanover, in March, 1801, it appeared by the sentence of probat, that \u201cthe said will <em>having no subscribing witnesses </em>thereto, three of the sitting members of the court were sworn and examined, and thereupon declared, that the <em>signature </em>of John Street subscribed at the foot of the said will was, from their acquaintance with the handwriting of the said John Street, to their full belief, written with the proper hand of the said John Street; and the same was thereupon ordered to be recorded.\u201d It appeared by the evidence in this cause, that, in fact, the body of the will was not wholly written by the testator, but was written for him by his son Parke Street; so that the will, though admitted to full probat in general terms, was not duly executed as a will of real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-4\">John Street the elder left six children, his heirs, devisees and legatees; namely, his four sons abovementioned, and two daughters, Sally Street and Hannah, the wife of \"William Brown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">In September, 1819, the County Court of Hanover appointed commissioners to audit and settle Parke Street\u2019s accounts of administration of the estate of John Street the younger; and on the 29th of that month, the auditors settled and reported an account, whereby it appeared, that, after crediting the estate with all the personal assets that came to the hands of the administrator, and debiting it \u2022 with all the debts which he had paid, including the debts which his intestate had contracted in his official character, and his other debts by specialties binding his heirs, there was a balance due to the administrator of 4,876 dollars. The account referred to vouchers for eveiy item of debit. George and Anthony Street were present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>at the settlement before tbe auditors, and subjoined anaj.e f00t 0f accoun-(; g0 stated, tbat they were satisfied it was correctly settled, and tbat tbe balance-of 4,876 dollars was justly due from the estate to tbe administrator; and William Street, who was not present at tbe settlement, afterwards subjoined a note on bis part to tbe same purpose. And tbe account being returned to tbe court, with these acknowledgments of its correctness thereto subjoined, was in October,, 1819, ordered to be recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">In 1826, Parke Street exhibited a bill in tbe Superior Court of Chancery of Eichmond, against bis brothers and sisters, William, George, Anthony, and Sarah Street, and Hannah, tbe wife of William Brown, in which be set forth <em>(inter alia) </em>tbe death of John Street, the younger intestate, tbe grant of administration of bis estate to him, tbe nature of tbe debts due from tbat estate, tbe payment thereof principally by himself out of bis own funds, tbe provision of tbe will of John Street, tbe elder, subjecting tbe real estate be bad inherited from bis son John, to tbe payment of tbe son\u2019s debts, and tbe account of administration of tbe estate of John, tbe younger, settled and reported by tbe auditors of tbe County Court; and tbe general purpose of tbe bill was, that tbe real estate of J obn Street, tbe younger, which bad descended to bis father, tbe testator, John, tbe elder, should be subjected to tbe payment of tbe balance of 4,876 dollars, appearing due to tbe plaintiff on bis account of administration of the estate of J obn, tbe younger, and tbat tbe same should be sold, and tbe proceeds applied to tbe payment of that balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">Tbe defendants, in their answers, mentioned, tbat tbe will of John Street, tbe elder, was in fact written for him by tbe plaintiff\", Parke Street; but they did not impugn tbe validity of tbe will as one not duly executed and published to pass, or to create a charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>upon, the testator\u2019s real estate; they referred to the language of the provision for the payment of the debts of John Street, the younger, stating, that \u201cit was uncertain whether the personal estate of that decedent would be sufficient to pay his just debts,\u201d as evincing that the testator thought, and that Parke Street, the draftsman, knew, that the amount of debts of that estate, beyond the personal assets thereof, could not have been so large as the administrator now alleged it to have been, and as affording reason to suspect and to contest the fairness of the account settled and reported by the auditors of the County Court. They stated several specific objections, both to the principles and the details of that account; and insisted, that the unjust charges and omissions in the account should be corrected, and the just balance due the administrator ascertained. And the defendants, George, Anthony, and William Street, said, that their acknowledgment of the correctness of the account, was made without any examination of it, and was induced by the (unmerited) confidence they reposed in their brother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-4\">The court referred the accounts to one of its commissioners, with general directions to examine, state and report the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">When the commissioner came to execute this order, the defendants insisted, that he ought to examine and state the accounts of the plaintiff\u2019s administration of the estate of John Street, the younger, <em>de novo </em>from the commencement, upon the vouchers to be produced by the administrator, without regard to the account stated and reported by the auditors of the County Court. But the commissioner thought it proper to make that account the basis of the account to be stated by himself, and to take it as correct, except in such particulars as the defendant should surcharge and falsify it. The defendants then insisted, that as the plaintiff\u2019s vouchers were ostensible, and were indeed filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>in the commissioner\u2019s office, they ought to be submit- ^ examinaj\u00bf0Ilj in order to enable- them to-surcharge and falsify the account by a comparison thereof with the vouchers. But though the plaintiff had preserved all the vouchers, though he had in fact filed them in the commissioner\u2019s office for <em>Ms </em>examination, and though they were examined by <em>Mm, </em>yet he-insisted, that he was not bound to produce them, to sustain the account stated and reported by the auditors of the County Court and recorded by the court,, and that the defendants had no right to examine them,, as to any particulars in which the account was not impeached by their proofs; and the commissioner being of this opinion withheld the vouchers from the-view and examination of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-5\">Proceeding on these principles, the commissioner stated the account, by correcting trivial errors in the account stated by the auditors of the County Court,, some for and some against the administrator, and bringing the account down to the date of the report-It appeared by the commissioner\u2019s report, that all the debts of John Street the younger, which had been paid by the administrator Parke Street, and charged by him to the estate, were debts due by specialties binding the debtor\u2019s heirs, except debts to the amount of about 114 dollars, and that personal assets exceeding that sum were credited to the estate; so that the whole balance claimed by the administrator was due to him, in effect, on account of debts of his intestate-paid by him, which were due by specialties that bound the intestate\u2019s real estate. And the balance reported to be due to the administrator was 5,257 dollars with-interest on 2,796 dollars part thereof, being principal,, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-6\">The defendants filed exceptions to the report in respect to several details of the account. And they es-specially excepted to it, on the ground that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>missioner had refused to allow <em>them </em>to examine the plaintiff\u2019s vouchers, which were laid before him, which he inspected and examined, and to which he made references in his report; an exception which went to the whole report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\">It appeared by subsequent proceedings in the cause, that the whole real estate of John Street the younger was not sufficient to pay more than about one-third of the balance reported by the commissioner to be due from that intestate\u2019s estate to the plaintiff his administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">Upon the hearing, the chancellor, overruling the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report,, directed a sale of the lot in Richmond, parcel of the real estate of John Street the younger; which was sold accordingly, and the net proceeds of the sale were-only about 1,550 dollars. \"Whereupon, the chancellor-decreed, that that sum should be paid to the plaintiff, in part discharge of the debt ascertained to be due to him from the estate of John Street the younger for which the real estate of that decedent was bound-From which decree the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-6\"><em>Lyons </em>and Johnson, for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZs\">1, maintained, that the course of the commissioner was wholly unwarrantable. If the account reported by the auditors of the County Court, on which the appellee\u2019s claim was founded, had really been an account of his administration of his intestate John Street the younger\u2019s estate, yet the vouchers on which the auditors stated the account being ostensible, the appellants would have had a right to require the production of them before the commissioner, not only for the purpose of enabling the commissioner to examine them, but especially for the purpose of enabling the parties themselves to examine and scrutinize them. The leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>authority for taking administration accounts settled and reported by auditors of the County Court as <em>prima fade </em>evidence, and for dispensing with vouchers to sustain those accounts when the vouchers are not ostensible in consequence of lapse of time, distinctly admits, that when the vouchers are in the administrator\u2019s possession, they must be produced if called for. <em>M\u2019Call </em>v. <em>Peachy\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>3 Munf. 288, 305. Here, the administrator\u2019s vouchers were in fact laid before the commissioner; and the only question was, whether they were examinable by the commissioner alone, and the parties interested had no right to see and examine them? Surely, the parties had a right to see or hear all evidence that could affect their interests in the cause. But, they said, the account reported by the auditors of the County Court, in this case, so far as it went to establish a claim for the appellee against the real estate of his intestate, was not, properly speaking, an administration account. The whole personal estate was trivial, and had been exhausted, and when exhausted, the administration was complete. The claim of the administrator to be reimbursed out of his intestate\u2019s real estate, the amount of specialty debts binding his heirs, which he had paid, not out of the personal assets, but out of his own funds, was a claim to be subrogated to the creditors whose demands he had satisfied; and though the account reported by the auditors of the County Court might have been <em>prima fade </em>evidence against other creditors, or the distributees of the intestate, it was not evidence at all against his heirs. <em>Mason\u2019s devisees </em>v. <em>Peter\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>1 Munf., 437. The chancellor, then, ought to have set aside the report, and recommitted the accounts, with instructions to expose the vouchers to the view and examination of the appellants. 2. They made the point, that the will of John Street, the older, which was not attested by any witnesses, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>of which only the signature, not the whole will, was proved to be in the testator\u2019s handwriting, was not effectual to pass, or to charge, his real estate. The sentence of the County Court admitting the will to full probat upon such defective proof, and the defect of proof appearing in the sentence itself, could not make it, what by law it manifestly was not, a good will of real estate. Therefore, the appellee could not found any claim on the provision in the will, whereby the testator subjected the lands he had inherited from his son John, to the payment of the son\u2019s debts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-4\"><em>R. T. Daniel </em>and Leigh, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYf\">thought it could hardly be maintained, that wherever an administration account, reported by auditors \u00f3f a County Court, shewed that the administrator had administered and exhausted the personal assets, and paid other debts of his intestate out of his own funds, the account, to the extent of his payments beyond the assets, was not an administration account, such as the County Court had authority to refer to auditors, and the auditors, upon a general reference of the administration account, to settle and report. But granting that the commissioner allowed an undue weight to the auditors\u2019 account, and that he erred in refusing to open the vouchers to the scrutiny of the appellants, yet the error was, in the actual case, rather formal than substantial. For, they said, it appeared by the report, that in respect to every disputed item of the account, the commissioner reported all the evidence appearing in the vouchers. And the account shewed, too plainly for cavil, that a much larger sum than the net proceeds of the sale of the lot in Bichmond, which was all the chancellor had yet decreed to the appellee, was and must be due to him, and justly chargeable on his intestate\u2019s real estate. Neither can the correctness of the audited account be reasonably questioned, seeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>that the three brothers of the plaintiff,' all men of ful-I. agg^ deliberately acknowledged its correctness, and that the balance thereby reported to be due him was-justly due. Taking all this into consideration, they submitted that the decree ought not to be reversed, so. far as it decreed the net proceeds of the Richmond lot. to the appellee, though it might be proper to recommit the report, in order that the accounts might be more fully scrutinized, before any further sum should be decreed to him out of the Ohio and Kentucky lands-2. They said it was quite too late now, to raise the* question whether the will of John Street, the elder, was. a good will of lands. The will had been admitted to. full probat, as early as 1801; and, according to our laws, the sentence of probat, however erroneous in fact, could not be contested after the lapse of seven years. <em>Bagwell v. Elliott &amp; wife, </em>2 Rand., 190; West v. <em>West\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Id., 373, 378-9, 386; <em>Nalle </em>v. <em>Fenwick, 4 </em>Id., 585, 588-9; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1 Leigh, 287. And none of the parties in the cause had controverted the validity of the will in any respect. The point., however, was immaterial in the present case; since,, independently of the provision in the will of John Street, the elder, the lands of John, the younger, in the hands of his heir, were subject to his debts, by specialties binding the heirs, which the administrator had paid, and which therefore he. was entitled to have reimbursed to him out of his intestate\u2019s real estate.,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-14\"> <em>Parker, </em>J., was dead, and <em>Allen, </em>J., had not been appointed when the cause was argued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-5\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"App\">The principal question in this caus\u00e9is as to the,weight and influence of the audited account; and it only requires that we should advert to the real character of the case, to enable us to see that it is entitled to none. It was not even. evidence between these parties in inference to-the object and purpose of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The bill is. filed, by an administrator;; who alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>that he has made large advances for the estate, over and above the assets, and seeks to charge those advanees upon the realty in the hands of the heirs. His claims upon the real estate are not then executorial; and they can only be sustained by regarding him in his true light, and substituting him to the rights of the creditors whom he has paid. He stands in their shoes, and must establish his demand precisely as they must have done. Had the bill been filed by the creditors themselves, they must have shewn, 1, the liability of the realty to their demands, and 2, the amount of those demands. Then, admitting the first, how is the second to be established? Certainly not bythe settlement of the administrator\u2019s account by auditors.. That settlement grows out of the obligation of the administrator\u2019s bond, that he shall settle his account of' the administration of the personalty when required.. That settlement is made with the court, in their character of a court of probat, having jurisdiction over the <em>personal </em>estate of decedents; only.. They have no' farther power than to audit, settle and allow the disbursement of that estate by the administrator. The; limit of their authority is the amount of the personal estate. The question whether the administrator has paid beyond the assets, so as to entitle him to charge the realty, is, as to that court, <em>coram nonjudice; </em>the only modes of settling that question being by the agreement of the parties, by action at law, or by bill in equity. With the settlement before auditors, the <em>heir </em>as such has no concern, nor can such settlement be evidence against him either <em>prima facie </em>or otherwise. Even a judgment against an executor is no evidence against the heir, of the justice or amount of a creditor\u2019s demand; it is <em>res inter alios acta., </em>1 Munf. 437. <em>A fortiori </em>it would seem, that the <em>ex parte </em>report of auditors, appointed only to settle the disbursements of the <em>personal </em>assets, cannot be so. The ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>count in this ease, then, was no evidence before the commjggjoner 0f Court of Chancery, except so far as the acknowledgment of the brothers made it so. Butin that acknowlegment the sisters did not join, an(j it did not therefore bind him. Therefore it could not avail the administrator; for he could have no decree for a sale of the realty without establishing his demand in such mode as would bind <em>all </em>the heirs. It is like the case of a confession of judgment by one of two joint obligors, and a successful defence of the action by the other; in which case, the confession avails nothing, and judgment is entered for both defendants. The demand is entire, and if disproved as to one, is disproved as to all, the confession to the contrary notwithstanding. The application of the principle seems peculiarly proper in the present case, as the confession seems to have been dictated by an overweening confidence of younger brothers in the superior intelligence of an elder brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">If the audited account be altogether rejected, it is not necessary to say any thing of the unjustifiable course of the plaintiff and the commissioner. But, as a matter of practice, I think it behooves us to express our decided disapprobation of that course. Where the vouchers are <em>ostensible, </em>as they were clearly shewn to have been in this case, the defendants have a right to call for them. Admit the account to have been <em>prima facie </em>evidence, still it was only <em>prima facie </em>evidence. The defendants had a right to controvert it. Had they not a right to call for the evidence in the possession of the plaintiff, to enable them to controvert it? By what rule or principal of law were the defendants excluded from the right to demand, that the plaintiff should produce the evidence which he had in his pocket in support of his account, in order that it might be seen whether the items were or were not sustained by the vouchers ? I know of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>But the commissioner had the examination of them, though they were denied to the parties. When has this sort of secret inquisition been introduced into the proceedings of our courts of justice? What court would receive as evidence, and act upon, a paper offered by one party, or suffer it to go to a jury, without the inspection or examination of the other? As well might the commissioner have examined in secret a witness offered by the plaintiff to prove his demand, and have sent the defendants out of his office, thus depriving them of the power of objection, contradiction and cross-examination. His course in this case is as novel and unprecedented, as it is incompatible with those first principles of judicial proceeding, which secure to every party the right of being confronted with the witnesses, of knowing the nature of the allegations against him, and of seeing and hearing the evidence by which they are supported. Of what use would be the privilege of excepting to the opinion-of a court, or the report of a commissioner, if the evidence upon which they have acted be scrupulously hidden from the eyes of the party complaining? It would be practically of no effect; and it is indeed matter of surprise, that, at this day, such an instance should be afforded of a violation of the most familiar principles, as this record presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">I am clearly of opinion, then, that the decree in this case should be reversed, and the cause sent back to the commissioner, with instructions to disregard the audited account of the Hanover commissioners, and to report the amount and character of the plaintiff\u2019s claims against the estate of John Street, the younger, whether in his own right, or as substituted for the creditors whom he has paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Another question, however, presents itself, which it is important to settle. The will of John Street, the elder, by its terms charges that portion of his estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>which he derived from his son John, the younger, with ^ \u00bfg-j^ 0;\u00a1? y-g gon. aU(j -f ^hg pe executed so as. to pass or charge real estate, this will must have that effect. But the will is not attested by any witnesses, and in the sentence of probat there appears no proof .that it was wholly written in the testater\u2019s hand. It \u25a0was, however, ordered to be recorded in general terms, \u25a0and not merely as a will of personalty. In this state \u2022of things, it would seem that we must, according to \u2022the decisions of this court, cited at the bar, take it to be a good will to charge the realty. To this course of \u25a0decisions I feel myself bound to defer, where, as in this case, it is possible, evidence <em>may. </em>have been given \u25a0of the whole will being in the testator\u2019s handwriting. 'This, <em>though it be not true, </em>we may be bound to presume to be true. If, however, a case were to occur where, upon its face, the will could not pass real estate, as if it were not signed at all, I should much incline to consider the order to record it, however general, as properly to be interpreted in the more restricted sense of .declaring it a good will of personalty only.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The other judges concurred, that the decree should be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, in order that the accounts should be sent back to the commissioner, with instructions to disregard the audited account of the Hanover commissioners, and to report the amount and. character of the appellee\u2019s claims, whether in his own right, or as substituted in place of the creditors whose claims he had discharged; and to BE PURTHER PROCEEDED IN TO A PINAL DECREE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
