Hbld, nevertheless, under the circumstances of this case, the bond should be received as evidence of the amount advanced.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-3\">On the 12th of February 1828, Charles C. Patterson exhibited his bill in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Lynchburg district, setting forth, that he had various transactions during several years with one Thomas Campbell of Bedford county, since deceased, in the course of which transactions he borrowed money of said Campbell, under an express stipulation to pay him interest at the rate of 12 per centum per annum on all sums advanced. That on the 25th of March 1820, he executed his bond to said Campbell for \u00bf\u00a3221 15 10, payable on demand, principally for money loaned at the rate afores\u00e1id, the interest on the previous loans being calculated at that rate, and included in the bond. That afterwards on the same day he executed to said Campbell another bond, also payable on demand, for <em>\u00a37 12 </em>5\u2014exclusively for interest at the rate aforesaid on sums previously loaned, which Campbell alleged had been omitted in taking the larger bond. That on the 9th of October 1822, the complainant and said Campbell had a settlement up to that date, at which the complainant took in the two..bonds aforesaid, and executed a paper whereby he acknowledged himself indebted to Campbell in the sum of 1029 dollars 36 cents; a considerable part of that sum being made up of interest at the rate of' 12 per centum per annum, some of which had been compounded at that rate. That Campbell having agreed to advance to the complainant a further sum, sufficient, with the 1,029 dollars 36 cents, to make up the amount of 3,000 dollars, on condition that the complainant should pay interest at the rate of 12J per cent, per annum, and execute a bond for 3,000 dollars, and a deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of trust\u2018to secure the payment thereof, the complainant accordingly, under the pressure of pecuniary embarrassment, which had much increased since the commencement of his dealings with Campbell, executed his bond to said Campbell on the 23d of December, 1822, for 3,000 dollars payable on demand, and to secure the payment thereof, executed to Robert Campbell (a son of the said Thomas) and B. A. Eidson, a deed of trust on a valuable tract of 400 or 500 acres of land, and eight slaves. That when the bond for 3,000 dollars was taken, Campbell made a calculation of interest (on what sum the complainant does not know) which he said was to be included in that bond as part thereof; and immediately after the execution of the said bond and trust deed, he required complainant to execute another bond, for 63 dollars, which he said was also for interest. That complainant executed the bond for 63 dollars, and afterwards paid off and took in the same. That the express agreement between said Campbell and the complainant, before and at the time of executing the bond for 3.000 dollars and the trust deed, was that Campbell should pay to the complainant, in cash, at that time or in a few days afterwards, the difference between 3.000 dollars and the amount of the 1,029 dollars 36 cents with interest thereon at the rate of 12J per centum; but the said Campbell failed and refused to perform his part of the agreement, and instead of paying cash, procured outstanding debts due from complainant to other persons, to a considerable amount, and compelled him to allow them as part of the consideration for the bond of 3,000 dollars. That Campbell/ having subsequently advanced to complainant a claim for 680 dollars on one Irvine, and 150 dollars in cash, informed complainant in January, 1824, that he had made a statement of their accounts, including interest at the rate aforesaid, and required complainant to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ecute a further bond for 752 dollars 57 cents, and to secure the same by an additional trust deed. That complainant, without having ever seen the statement, accordingly executed his bond for the lastmentioned sum, and conveyed to the same trustees, for securing the payment thereof, another tract of land of 105 acres, and four other slaves. That complainant never did receive, directly or indirectly, the whole amount of the lastmentioned bond: that both the bond for 8,000 dollars, and that for 752 dollars 57 cents, were in part composed of usurious interest: and that the latter not only included interest on the former at the rate of 12J per centum, but interest compounded at that rate. That the complainant had at various times made considerable payments to the said Campbell (the dates and amounts were particularly set forth in the bill), which were applied to the extinguishment of the usurious- and illegal interest claimed of him. That the said Campbell died in 1827, intestate, and his two sons William and Robert, and his grandson M. D. Gray were the administrators of his estate. That the trustees in the deeds executed by the complainant had advertised for sale the property thereby conveyed to them, for the purpose of raising the amount which appeared to be due on the two bonds aforesaid. The bill made those trustees, and the administrators of Thomas Campbell, defendents, and called upon them to answer all the allegations thereof, and particularly to discover and set forth the rate of interest agreed to be paid by the complainant for moneys advanced him by the said Thomas Campbell, in what manner the amounts specified in the two bonds aforesaid were made up, the payments made by the complainant to the said Thomas Campbell, and the application of those payments. And the prayer of the bill was, that an injunction be awarded \u201cto stay all proceedings on the said trust deeds, and the collec-. tion of the debt therein named, until the matter can. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>be fully heard in equity; that the whole matter be referred to a commissioner of the court, to adjust and settle, and expunge all compound, illegal and usurious interest, and credit your orator by all sums in any manner paid, and extend to your orator all such other and further relief and aid as his case may require and justice dictate; and that all persons be released from all penalties under the statutes against usury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">An ini unction was awarded according to the prayer \u25a0 of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">All the defendants answered. They all disclaimed any knowledge of usury in the transactions between the intestate and the complainant; and the answers of William and Robert Campbell expressed the belief of those respondents that no usurious interest whatever was included in either of the bonds secured by the trust deeds. William Campbell said, it was not the practice of his intestate to include such interest in any of his bonds, but when he lent money at more than legal interest (as he sometimes did), he relied on the promise of the borrower for the excess. And Robert referred to and insisted on the statement of the bill itself, as incompatible with the allegation that usurious interest was included in either bond. These two respondents declared themselves ignorant of the manner in which the amount of either bond was made up. They admitted a payment of 950 dollars by the complainant to their father in his lifetime, but disclaimed all knowledge of any other, or of the manner in which that was applied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">The two bonds of 3,000 dollars and 752 dollars 57 cents were exhibited with the answer of Robert Campbell; and all the other evidences of delpt, referred to by the complainant in his bill, were exhibited therewith. At the foot of one of these, namely, the bond for \u00a3221 15 10, was the following memorandum\u2014 \u201cAgreed to pay 12 per cent.\u201d And at the foot of an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>other (the bond for 63 dollars) was the following: \u201cThe above note of $63, was for interest due at the time of taking the bond of $3,000, as believed not legal to put in with the principal.\u201d Bach memorandum was proved to he in the handwriting of the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-11\">The deeds of trust, it seems, were never filed in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-12\">On the 27th of October 1828, the cause coming on to he heard, the court dissolved the injunction as to the sum of 1497 dollars 55 cents, part of the bond for 3,000 dollars, and as to the sum of 322 dollars 53 cents, part of the bond for 752 dollars 57 cents; which sums were the balances of principal mon\u00e9y due on those bonds respectively, according to a statement made by a commissioner of the court, \u201cto which\u201d (the record stated) \u201cthere was no objection for the present by either party.\u201d The court further ordered that the marshal should make sale of the land and slaves conveyed in trust to secure the bond of 3,000 dollars, or of so much as might be sufficient to discharge the said sum of 1497 dollars 55 cents; and of the land and slaves conveyed in trust to secure the bond of 752 dollars 57 cents, or of so much as might he sufficient to discharge the said sum of 322 dollars 53 cents; and should pay the proceeds, after defraying the expenses \u25a0of sale, into one of the banks at Lynchburg, to the credit of the cause, and make report of his proceedings, in order to a final decree. At the same time the court referred the accounts between the parties to a commissioner, with directions to make two statements thereof, in one of which he should exclude all interest, and in the other allow it at legal rate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-13\">The marshal reported that on the-day of February 1829, he made sales of property comprised in the two deeds of trust, to the amount of 1820 dollars <em>8 </em>cents (which was the aggregate of the two sums directed to be raised), besides the expenses of sale. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>amount was, by an order of court made the 29th of May, 1830, directed to be paid over to the administrators of Thomas Campbell. The date of the actual payment to them was the 7th of July, 1830. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\">The commissioner to whom the accounts were referred reported, 1. A statement wherein the complainant was charged with 3,752 dollars 57 cents the aggregate of the two bonds secured by the trust deeds, and credited with 12 per cent, interest on the bond of \u00a3221 15 10 from the 25th of March, 1820, the date-of that bond, to the 23d of December, 1822, the date of the bond for 3,000 dollars,\u2014with the amount'of the two small bonds for \u00a37 12 5 and 63 dollars,\u2014and with two payments of 200 dollars and 950 dollars. According to this statement, the balance due from the complainant was 2,287 dollars 63 cents. 2. A statement in which the complainant was charged with the amount of the two bonds for 3,000 dollars and 752 dollars 57 cents, and legal interest \u2022 on the same, and credited with <em>half </em>the amount of interest, <em>half </em>the amount of the two small bonds, and the whole amount of the two payments, which had been allowed in the first statement. According to this second statement, the balance due from the complainant on the 1st day of May, 1830, was 3,849 dollars 58 cents ot principal and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">Both parties excepted to the commissioner\u2019s report. To the first statement the complainant excepted, 1. Because a certain credit (which he specified) was not allowed him. 2. Because the charge for interest on the bond of \u00a3221 15 10 was less than it should have been. 3. Because he was improperly charged with the whole-amount of the bond of 3,000 dollars; \u201cthere being no evidence that the said Thomas Campbell ever advanced to the plaintiff the amount which, at the time said bond was executed, he contracted to advance to make up the sum of 3,000 dollars.\u201d 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Because the complainant was improperly charged with the amount of the bond of 752 dollars 57 cents, \u201cwhen the sums constituting that amount may have been advanced to make up the amount of 3,000 dollars.\u201d To the second statement the complainant excepted for the same reasons assigned in his exceptions to the first statement, and also because, in the said second statement, he was charged with interest, when, under the act of assembly, the creditor was entitled to none. The defendants excepted to the report for the following reasons : 1. \u201c This suit was not brought against Thomas Campbell in his lifetime, Avho could have given a true account of it: it is brought against his administrators, who can give no account of it. They deny (as far as administrators can deny such allegations) that the interest was included in the bonds. The plaintiff ought therefore to prove his case,, and in the absence of all proof on his part, it should be taken for granted that the sums expressed on the face of the bonds were the sums advanced.\u201d 2. Because, the plaintiff having been credited Avith interest, it was improper to credit him also with the amount of the bonds for <em>\u00a37 </em>12 5 and 63 dollars, which were given for interest, since that was to credit him twice for the same sum. 3. \u201cThe plaintiff in this case only seeks relief as to the compound, illegal and usurious interest (see his bill)The defendants are entitled, even if the court should think usurious interest was received, to their principal money with lawful interest upon it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-11\">Many depositions were taken and filed in the cause; hut it is only material to notice the testimony of one of the witnesses; who deposed, that about November, 1825, a sale of the plaintiff\u2019s property'being expected to take place for the benefit of Thomas Campbell, the AAfitness was requested by the plaintiff to propose to said Campbell, that he should take the property of the plaintiff at a fair valuation, in satisfaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Ms debt, instead of' compelling a sale; and in a conversation with the witness on that occasion, said Campbell told him that 12 <em>or </em>12J per cent, was the interest that the plaintiff had promised to pay. But the witness did not suppose this interest was included in the bonds, though he supposed there might be some written agreement for the payment of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-4\">The cause was finally heard on the 25th of November, 1831; when the court overruled the exceptions \u2022filed by the defendants to the commissioner\u2019s report, sustained those filed by the plaintiff and approved and adopted a new statement made by the commissioner, in which the two bonds of 3,000 dollars and 752 dollars 57 cents were wholly disregarded as evidence of the amount advanced by Thomas Campbell to the plaintiff. Charging the plaintiff with the amount of the original bond for \u00a3221 15 10, and the principal of the sums which were proved by the other evidence in the cause to have been actually advanced to him by Thomas Campbell, and giving him credit for his payments, including the two small bonds of \u00a3 7 12 5 and 63 dollars, and the net proceeds of the sales made by the marshal, this statement produced an excess of payments amounting to, 550 dollars 26 cents, with interest from the 7th of July, 1830. The court therefore proceeded to decree, that the injunction be made perpetual, and that the administrators of Thomas Campbell pay to the plaintiff, out of their proper goods and chattels, the lastmentioned sum with interest, and out of the assets of their intestate, the plaintiff's costs expended in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">From this decree the administrators of Thomas Campbell obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-13\"><em>Lyons </em>and <em>R.

But the amount due from the appellee to the appellants is not so easily ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The first question of importance is the measure of the recovery. Is the appellant entitled to interest upon his advances, or must he sit down contented with his principal?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">\"When a borrower comes into equity seeking relief against usury, he is, by the principles of the court, bound to do equity' by paying up both principal and interest. Our act of assembly, however, provides that any borrower may exhibit his bill against the lender, and compel him to discover upon oath the money lent, and if thereupon it shall appear that there was usury, the lender shall be obliged to accept his principal money without interest. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 102, \u00a7 8, p. 374. I incline to think that wherever a case' is strictly within this section, and the borrower insists on its protection, he can only be compelled to pay the principal; and that herein the principle of equity is modified by the statute. But where a case is not within the third section of the act, or where.its protection is waived, the principles of equity have the strictest application. Such is the case of a bill filed to recover back what has already been paid. In this case it is now well established that the borrower can only recover back the usurious interest; thus leaving to the lender the enjoyment of his legal interest, as well as his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">The case before us I take to be not within the third section of the act. It is certainly not within its letter. The bill here is not exhibited against the lender, but against his representatives. The bill under the statute must be exhibited against the lender himself, and call upon him to discover the money lent. If the plaintiff rests upon the disclosure of his adversary, he shall pay only the principal, and the usurer shall re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ceive no more. But if he declines, during the usurer\u2019s lifetime, to exhibit his bill, and to afford him an opportunity of explaining the transaction, and of 'shewing what is justly due, it may well be doubted whether it was designed that he should be absolved from the payment of any portion of what is justly due. Moreover, the usurer being dead, and it being no longer possible that the penalty can fall upon the guilty head, there would be much reason for distinguishing the innocent representative from his rapacious ancestor. He, at least, has done nothing which forbids him to look for sheer justice at the hands of a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Be this as it may, there is another ground on which the case may securely stand. The plaintiff in his bill clearly puts his case upon the general principles of equity, and excludes it from the operation of the third section. His prayer is, that \u201c all compound, <em>illegal </em>and usurious interest may be expunged; that he may have such relief as his case may require and <em>justice </em>may dictate ; and that all persons may be released from the penalties of the statute.\u201d I can understand this in no other way than as expressing a willingness to pay principal <em>and legal interest. </em>That is what justice dictates, and what every honest man will do. And shall we reject the plaintiff\u2019s proffer to be honest? Shall we, by a forced construction of the prayer of his bill, interpret him to refuse to pay what he justly owes? Shall we really enter into the views of his counsel, and construe a prayer to expunge <em>illegal </em>interest, as a prayer to expunge <em>all interest </em>whatsoever ? and this too upon the singular hypothesis, that in usurious contracts, even <em>legal </em>interest becomes illegal? I think not. And if, as I conceive, the plaintiff is fairly to be understood as waiving the penalty, and proffering to pay principal and interest, a Court of Equity will not be so eager to-enforce a forfeiture, as ,to compel the defendants to receive their principal only, and leave the plaintiff' in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>possession of the interest which, upon its own principles, he ought to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The second question to be settled before we enter upon the facts, is as to the effect of the bonds as evidence. It cannot be denied that the bonds, as securities for money, are void. It cannot be denied, moreover, that where there are manifest signs of fraud (or usury) in the obligee, he ought to be put to the proof of actual payment. 3 P. Wms. 289. Yet this general rule admits of exception or modification. For where, as in this case, a borrower lies by until the death of the lender, and then calls for proof of the moneys advanced, a court of justice would be cautious in the application of the rule. But where the borrower has moreover taken up all the original evidences, as is the case here; where he has, therefore, all the means of explanation in his own hands, yet fails to make it; where he comes into equity asking relief, and yet omits to set forth the money borrowed, so that equity may lay him under the customary terms of paying the amount with interest, I cannot think the rule could fairly be applied. If he has not furnished in his bill a statement of facts, within his own knowledge, and resting upon documentary evidences which have been delivered up to him, so as to enable the court to administer its justice between the parties, he cannot complain that it should look to the evidences under his own hand for proof of the facts. And where, as here, he has lain by till the lender\u2019s death, he could with no show of reason expect to throw the <em>onus probandi </em>upon those who were not actors in the transaction, and are uninformed as to its character. The bonds in this case must therefore be resorted to as evidences (subject indeed to contradiction and explanation) of the amount which has been loaned.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">In this case, however, there can be no difficulty. The plaintiff does not pretend that he did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>large advances from the defendants\u2019 intestate. But he alleges that in both the bond for 3,000 dollars and that for 752 dollars 57 cents, usurious interest was included, and moreover compounded. The usury was 12 or 12J per centum; that is, 6 or 6\u00a7- in addition.to legal interest. <em>~We </em>are of course left to infer that the residue-of the bonds was composed of the advances. If, then, we purge the bonds of the .12 per cent, and of com-, pound interest, we get the true amount loaned. And this is the more clear when we look to the prayer, of. the bill, which is only to expunge the illegal and compound interest, and sets up no pretence to scale the bonds because they falsely represent in other respects the amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">Let us, then, from- all the sources of information furnished by the record, endeavor to discover what the appellants are entitled to demand. In the obscurity hanging over the transactions, it will be impossisible to ascertain, this with certainty. Approximation is all we can hope for. And here, first observe, that as all the obligations are payable on demand, there can be no prospective usury in any of them. And as to the usurious interest accruing upon the, several sums, I am of opinion that it was not includedjn the bonds of 3,000 dollars and 752 dollars 57 cents. Bor the scheme of the parties was to keep the usury separate and distinct, lest the bonds themselves should be tainted by it. This appears from the bonds of <em>\u00a3 </em>7 12 5, which the bill says was exclusively for interest, which, according to the terms of the loan, was calculated up to March, 1820. It also yet more clearly appears from the bond of 63 dollars, which is distinctly stated to be for interest not put into the large bond. Of what it was made up, we can only conjecture. It was probably the balance, at its date, of the whole extra interest - account.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Taking the bonds then as containing no interest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>matter probably would stand thus r [Here tbe president entered into a statement of the account between tbe parties.]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Brooke and Cabell, J. declined expressing any. opinion on tbe point, whether tbe third section of tbe statute against usury extends to tbe case of a bill' filed, after tbe death of tbe lender, against bis representatives. \"With that reservation, they concurred in tbe opinion of tbe president.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Tbe decree entered by the Court of Appeals was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">\u201c Tbe court is of opinion that tbe transactions set forth in tbe bill were usurious, and that tbe bonds of 8,000 dollars and 752 dollars, though they are believed to contain no usurious interest in themselves, yet, having been given for money loaned on usury, are within tbe statute, and void as securities for money. But tbe court is further of opinion that as tbe borrower, at tbe successive settlements, got into bis bands tbe documentary evidences of tbe transactions, and has failed to set forth tbe amount borrowed, tbe bonds above mentioned must be received as evidence, subject however to contradiction and scrutiny, and to be purged of usury, if it bad appeared (which tbe court does not think) that their amounts were in any part composed of illegal interest. And tbe court is further of opinion that tbe bill of tbe appellee not being within tbe third section of tbe statute of usury, be is only entitled to relief upon tbe terms of paying principal and interest, and that tbe amount now due, after deducting tbe proceeds of sale by tbe deputy marshal under tbe decree made in this cause, is 1808 dollars and 72 cents, with interest thereon at tbe rate of six per centum per annum from tbe 23d day of February, 1829, till paid, for which sum tbe appellants should be permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ted to proceed.\u201d Therefore, decree reversed with costs. <em>\u201c </em>And this court proceeding, &amp;c., it is further decreed and ordered, that the injunction awarded the appellee in the cause he dissolved as to the sum of 1808 dollars 72 cents, with legal interest thereon from the 23d day of February, 1829, till paid, and perpetuated as to the residue, and that the appellants be allowed to enforce their deeds of trust on the property not already sold by the marshal, so far as may he necessary for the payment of the said sum of 1808 dollars, 72 cents, with interest as aforesaid, and the costs attending the sale: \u201d and that the appellee recover HIS COSTS EXPENDED IN THE CHANCERY COURT.: and Circuit Superior Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
