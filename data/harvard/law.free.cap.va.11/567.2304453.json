January, 1797. And the plaintiffs adduced evidence* to prove, that Henry Camden, the husband of the legatee Lucy and their father, about the year 1800 or 1801, sold the slave John to one Bryant, under whom the defendant claimed; that the legatee Lucy Camden died within five years next before the commencement \u25a0 of this suit; that the plaintiffs, Sarah Duncan, Mary Davidson, and William and Henry Camden, were her children; and that they were infants at the time of the-sale made by their father to Bryant. And then the-defendant adduced evidence on his part to prove, that the testator\u2019s executors Joseph and Charles Burrus; migrated from Virginia about the year 1807, and one of them, Joseph, died in Tennessee in 1828; that they were apprised of the sale of the slave John by Henry Camden, the husband of the legatee Lucy, to Bryant,, before they left Virginia; and that the purchase money of the slave was not paid by Bryant, until after he had. had an interview with the executors, who were said to-have made objections to the sale, interposing their claim under their testator\u2019s will. (There was no proof adduced of the assent of the executors to the legacy, in the first instance; but the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not resisted on that ground, and the court considered that fact as admitted). Whereupon, the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that the statute of limitations which he relied on in his defence,,beg,ah. to run; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>from the date of the sale by Camden the husband to Bryant, notwithstanding the infancy of the plaintiffs, provided it should be proved to them, that Camden sold, and the purchaser Bryant claimed under the sale, the absolute estate in the slave, that such sale and claim were known to the testator\u2019s executors before their migration from Virginia, and that there was no impediment to a suit by the executors before they left the state. And the court gave the instruction accordingly; to which the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-4\">Verdict and judgment for the defendant.

The bequest under which they claimed was so framed, that,had the words been applied to real property, they would have given Mrs. Camden an estate tail, tantamount by our law to a fee simple, and applied to personal property, they gave her the absolute estate; and then to this absolute estate a condition subsequent was annexed, that neither she nor her husband should alien the property, but should keep it constantly in actual possession. The condition was repugnant and void,' and the legatee took the property exempt from the restraint upon her power of alienation. Co. Lift. 22Sa. <em>[Tucker, </em>P. Whatever there .may be in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>point, it does not appear that it was raised in the court ^glow, and it is not presented by the record.] <em>Leigh </em>agreed that it was not; but, he said, as the point must arise upon the will, it would be well that the court should intimate its opinion upon it (as under like circumstances it had often done), and so put an end to a controversy, the expense of which was probably equal to the present value of the subject. But supposing the bequest effectual according to the testator\u2019s intent, then immediately upon the alienation of the slaves, the legal estate was vested in the executors; they were empowered and required to take them into their possession; they might have maintained an action for them. The trust on which they were in that case to hold them was not expressly declared, but it resulted very plainly: they were to hold them in trust for Mrs. Camden for life, and after her death in trust for her children to be divided among them. The statute of limitations was a bar to any action the executors and trustees could have brought at this late day; and it was equally a bar to the claim of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>and that notwithstanding their infancy. <em>Wych </em>v. <em>East India Co., </em>3 P.

The question of title does not arise upon the record. .As the case is presented to us, we must take it that Mrs. Camden or her husband had no power to sell the \u25a0slaves, and that upon the sale her title ceased, and a right accrued to the executors to take them into possession <em>during her life. </em>It still remains to decide, whether during her life the legal title devolved upon her \u25a0children by the bequest, or whether the executors were \u2022trustees for them. And I am of opinion, that the \u2022children were to take nothing until after the decease \u25a0of Mrs. Camden, at which time the title devolved upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>them, and not till then. Ho trust of the profits between the date of the sale and Mrs. Camden\u2019s death is declared in their favour. It is not necessary to decide, whether the profits went to her, or .into the re- \u2022 siduum of the testator\u2019s estate: they could not, under the terms of this will, pass to her children. The children, then, had no title until their mother\u2019s death, . and the statute consequently was not a bar to this action, brought within five years after her death. The Judgment must, of course, be reversed, the verdict set aside, and a new trial had, upon which the instruction given by the court is not to be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"ATI\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AEN\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded ror a -NEW TRIAL.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
