Ware\u2019s own support, and contended, that the surplus-ought to be retained by him as part of his testator\u2019s estate, and that the interest thereof ought to be divided among all the testator\u2019s daughters and the children of those who were dead; and praying an account of the profits of that portion of the testator\u2019s estate-which was bequeathed to M\u2019Candlish for the use of Mrs. Ware, and a decree for the payment of the whole amount thereof to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">M\u2019Candlish answered, that he had acted as trustee under his testator\u2019s will, hired out the trust slaves from year to year, and annually credited the female plaintiff with the hire of the slave Lucy, and one fourth of the profits of the residuary slaves; that, out of this fund, he had educated, boarded and clothed her, and that there was a balance thereof in his hands, of 274 dollars with interest on 193 dollars from the 1st January, 1887, which he was always ready to pay when he could safely do so; that he had refused to pay this money to Ware, the husband of the legatee, because he was expressly excluded from benefit by the testator\u2019s will, and the female plaintiff\u2019 was an infant and could not give an acquittance; and that he conceived, that he ought to invest the surplus of the profits in question, over and above the support of the female plaintiff, in some fund for the benefit of her and her sisters; since if it should be paid to her husband he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>might use it at pleasure; and if she should die with-011\u00a3 ieavxng a child, the surviving sister and the children of the deceased sisters might be entitled to the very money now claimed by the bill. And he submitted the construction and effect of the testator\u2019s will to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-4\">The defendants Delk and wife, in their answer, insisted, that the surplus of the profits of the female plaintiff\u2019s portion, ought to be invested in order that the same might accumulate for the benefit of all the legatees, as M\u2019Oandlish in his answer proposed; and they suggested that it should be invested in a young female slave, to be held as part of the trust subject for the benefit of all, especially as some of the residuary slaves had died, and this would be the means of replacing them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\">The court appointed a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>for the infant defendants. And the cause coming on for hearing upon the bill, the answers, and the exhibits, the court declared, that the surplus of the profits set apart by the testator\u2019s will for his daughter Martha, over and above what was necessary for her support, now in the hands of M\u2019Oandlish the executor and trustee, namely, the sum of 274 dollars with interest on 193 dollars from the 1st January, 1837, ought to be invested in the purchase of a young female slave, or some other profitable stock; and decreed, that the trustee M\u2019Oandlish should invest that sum in the purchase of a young female slave, to be by him held as part of the daughter Martha\u2019s portion, in all respects, according to the provisions of the testator\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">On the application of Ware and wife, this court allowed them an appeal from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-7\"><em>Harrison, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Tp\">said, that under the will of the testator Slaughter, his daughter Martha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>was plainly entitled to have, during her life, the absolute use of and dominion over the whole profits of the property given to the trustee for her use. To decree that any portion of those profits should be converted into and made part of the capital subject bequeathed to her, in which she should then enjoy only a life estate, was irreconcilable with any just or sensible construction of the will. The restriction of the use and enjoyment of the profits of the estate vested in the trustee, to the sole, separate and exclusive use of the legatees, free from the control of their husbands, was intended to avoid the marital rights of the husbands in the subjects, so far only as to exempt the same from alienation or incumbrance by them, and from their debts, but not to restrict the common use and enjoyment of the profits by the husbands and their respective wives. And he submitted, that the court ought to have directed an account of the trustee\u2019s transactions, and of the profits by him received.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-4\">There was no counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b647-5\">Tucker, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aabb\">delivered the opinion of the court: That under the will of the testator Slaughter, though the appellant Martha was entitled to but a life estate in the slave Lucy, and in her portion of the testator\u2019s residuary estate, she was nevertheless entitled to the absolute property, use and enjoyment of the profits of the estate bequeathed to her; and therefore, the decree was erroneous in directing any portion of those profits to be converted into capital, whereof she should enjoy only a life estate. That, instead of reinvesting the profits, as directed by the decree, the surplus thereof in the hands of the trustee M\u2019Oandlish, after having been duly ascertained by any proper proceeding, should be decreed to be presently paid to the female appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>or her order, if she be of full age; and if she be yet an to be paid to her so soon as she shall attain to full age, or, in cas\u00e9 of her death during infancy, to ]ier representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">T-.
