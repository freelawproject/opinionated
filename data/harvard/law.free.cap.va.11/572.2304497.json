Whatever \u2022the* balance was, she paid it immediately, by a transfer to Wilkins of bank stock, and some other funds. At or about the same time, she put into Wilkins\u2019s hands twenty-five other shares of bank stock, which *she still owned, and some other effects; authorized him to sell the bank stock and effects for her, and appointed him her agent, to collect the rents of a small real estate she held in Fredericksburg.

In 1838, they \u25a0constituted Barton their agent to settle Wilkins\u2019s accounts, and to collect the balance due to them. His \u25a0efforts to bring about a settlement of the accounts were ineffectual, and they were not settled. But, in November, 1838, Wilkins requested Barton to draw a deed of trust, mortgaging his property for the benefit &lt;of his creditors, and for the indemnification of Gu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>lielmus Smith, his surety for the due administration of \u2018 Qorj;)p1 ;pane\u2019g estate, and providing (among other specified debts) for the debt he owed Gordon and wife, ari&lt;^ f\u00b0r the debt which, as administrator of Lane, he owed to' his distributees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-4\">By this deed, dated the 7th November, 1888, (reciting that James \"Wilkins \u201cwas justly indebted to Andrew Gordon and Mary his wife, in their individual characters and as administrators of James Corbin, in a sum not then ascertained but supposed to be about 2000 dollars, and to Mary Boyd, Daphne \"West, Austin Peay and Benjamin Hord, as distributees of Corbin Lane, in a sum not ascertained but supposed to be about 1800 dollars,\u201d and to sundry other creditors therein named in certain specified sums, \"William conveyed and assigned to Isaac Cary, divers lots in' or near the- town of Fredericksburg, some lands in Randolph county, four horses and other chattels, and certain debts stated in a schedule annexed; upon trust, that Cary should permit \"Wilkins to hold possession of the land and other property (except the debts assigned) and to take the profits, until default should be made by him in the payment of the debts due .to-the creditors, \u201cthe same being accurately ascertained, and payment thereof demanded\u201d either of \"Wilkins or of Cary the trustee; and that upon such default off payment, and upon the request of the creditors, or- a majority of them, the trustee should sell the trust subject, real and personal, at auction,.for cash, and out of the proceeds, pay the debts in the deed mentioned, and then any other debts due .from \"Wilkins, to other creditors, and the surplus, if any, to \"Wilkins*.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">James Wilkins, the mortgagor, was afterwards taken-, in execution by the sergeant of Fredericksburg for debts due to other creditors; and thereupon, he took, the benefit of the statute for relief of insolvent debtors;, surrendering to the sergeant all his effects, and <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>alia </em>his equity of redemption in the property, real and personal, mortgaged by the deed of trust of the 7th November, 1888.

That the accounts between Gordon and wife and James Wilkins, had never been settled, and so the true amount due from the latter to the former was yet uncertain, and it was in fact much less than 2,000 dollars, the sum mentioned in the deeds ot trust. That since the deed of trust of the 7th November, 1838, was executed, James Wilkins had paid many sums of money to or for 'Gor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>don and wife, which ought to be credited to him. That the accounts of Mrs. Gordon\u2019s administration her first husband James Corbin\u2019s estate, had never been settled and closed; balances were still due to the distributees of that intestate, and, among the rest, to the estate of Corbin Lane; and James Wilkins, as Lane\u2019s administrator, was entitled to the balance due Lane\u2019s estate, for which he would be accountable to-Lane\u2019s distributees. That James Wilkins being Mrs-Gordon\u2019s surety for the due administration of James Corbin\u2019s estate, was entitled to have her accounts administration thereof settled and closed, before his property should be sold to pay the alleged debt to her,, since he might be made liable as her surety for whatever debts she might owe to her intestate\u2019s distributees. And that the twenty-five shares of bank stock,, and the other effects, which she put into his hands-when she went to Ohio, was received by him as security for advances already made and afterwards to be made by him to or for her, and as an indemnification to him against loss by reason of his suretyship for her due administration of her first husband\u2019s estate. Therefore, the bill prayed, that the claims mentioned in the deeds of trust should be adjusted and ascertained by proper accounts, to be settled under the direction of the court, and that, in the mean time, the trustee Barton should be enjoined from selling the trust subject, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">Gulielmus Smith answered, and insisted on the-prompt execution of the deed of trust, upon which his indemnification depended, since his principal,, James-Wilkins, was insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">The answer of Austin Peay, in his own right, and as administrator of Daphne West, and of Benjamin Hord, stated that Hord had received all that he was entitled to as a distributee of Corbin Lane,.and Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Boyd had received more than she was entitled to, and had, moreover, by deed recorded, assigned to Peay all. her claim as one of Lane\u2019s distributees. That, in 1889, the accounts of James Wilkins, as administrator of Lane, were settled, or rather a compromise was made in respect thereto, between him and Peay; upon which all credits claimed by Wilkins for payments to the distributees were allowed him, and it was agreed that he should pay Peay 750 dollars; Wilkins promised prompt payment of that sum to him; and upon the faith of that promise, Peay agreed to accept it in full .satisfaction; but Wilkins had never paid it; Peay, therefore, insisted that the trust subject should be presently sold, in order to pay him that balance. And that Mrs. Gordon\u2019s accounts \u2022 of administration of James Corbin\u2019s estate had been settled; she had accounted for all the assets that had come to her hands, and had paid and distributed the whole surplus of that estate to the distributees, and among the rest to James Wilkins, the administrator of Lane, except a small balance, which had been left in her hands to pay a debt due from the estate; and these defendants exonerated Gordon and wife from all demands on that account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-4\">Gordon and wife, in their answer, stated, that at the time the deed of trust of the 7th November, 1838, was -executed by James Wilkins, it appeared by his own vouchers, exhibited to their agent Barton, that he owed them something more than 2,000 dollars; and as he had, on various pretexts, avoided a full settlement of his account, that sum was inserted in the deed of trust as being the least amount due to them; and he had never since paid them any thing. That the twenty-five shares of bank stock, and the other effects, which . Mrs. Gordon put into the hands of James Wilkins when she removed to Ohio in 1836, were, as he well \u25a0knew,.her own property; she empowered him to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the stock, and the other effects, and also to collect the \u2022rents of her real estate in Fredericksburg; and he was to account for and remit the proceeds of sale of the stock, and the other effects, and the rents, to her. That the property was not put into his hands as a se\u25a0curity or indemnification for any purpose whatever. That she had paid him all that she owed him, or that he claimed, before she left Virginia. That it was true her accounts of administration of James Corbin\u2019s estate had not been finally settled, but she had rendered \u2022an account of all the assets which had come to her hands, and distributed the surplus to and among all the distributees, to their satisfaction, except a small sum, which they had agreed should be left in her hands to meet a claim against the estate, for which a suit was then pending; and thus the state of her administration accounts furnished no pretext for delaying the payment of the debt which James Wilkins owed her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">It appeared, that Mrs. Gordon\u2019s accounts of administration of James Corbin\u2019s estate had been settled, and the surplus (except 500 dollars, left in her hands by agreement of the parties, to meet claims asserted against the estate,) had been distributed, under a decree of the Hustings Court of Fredericksburg; in which distribution thirty-six shares of bank stock were assigned to her for her distributive share. There remained to be distributed, so much of the 500 dollars as should not be absorbed by the outstanding debts of the estate, and James Corbin\u2019s share of the estate of .James Ross, then in the hands of Ross\u2019s administrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-6\">The deposition of Mr. Barton, the trustee, was taken and filed. He stated, that before Mrs. Gordon went to Ohio, he, in April, 1886, settled the accounts between her and James Wilkins, at their request; that, upon that settlement, Wilkins exhibited an account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>against Mrs. Gordon, consisting partly of a balance1 wplc^ pe elaime\u00bf[ for advances made to her, and partly of debts he had paid or assumed to pay for her, amounting in the \u2022 aggregate, according to his reeollection, to between 800 and 1,100 dollars; that the whole of Wilkins\u2019s account (including all the claims,, as they both stated, which he had against her, for advances made, and debts paid or assumed, by him for-her,) was then paid by her to him, by a transfer of seven shares of bank stock, and from other resources. That Mrs. Gordon had then twenty-five shares of bank: stock remaining, which she put into Wilkins\u2019s hands, as he had acknowledged; and she also authorized himi to collect her rents in Fredericksburg; that in 1888, Gordon and wife (not being able, as they alleged, to get any account from Wilkins of the bank stock, it\u00ae dividends or proceeds, and of the other property she-left in his hands, and of the rents,) sent an agent to Virginia to procure a settlement of the accounts; this .the agent could not effect, but Wilkins paid him 500-1 dollars; and then the agent employed Barton to settle-the account, and collect the balance; that after various ineffectual efforts to bring about a settlement, Wilkins called upon him in November, 1838, and requested him to draw a deed of trust for the benefit of his creditors, and, at his instance, the debts due from him to Gordon and wife, and to the distributees of Corbin Lane, were provided for in the deed; that,-in estimating the debt due to Gordon and wife, Barton charged Wilkins with the twenty-five shares of bank stock,, at 112 dollars per share, (the actual value,) with the dividends thereof for July, 1836, which he had received, and interest on the value of the'' stock sold, and. with. 72 dollars which he admitted he had received torrents; and he credited him for the 500 dollars.paid to the agent of Gordon and wife, and with the whole; of his charges against them, not included in. the pr.e<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>wious settlement with. Mrs. Gordon in 1836, that were sustained by any evidence, and some that were not, \"but that Wilkins said he could prove; that the result was, that Wilkins was found to owe Gordon and wite a balance of above 2,100 dollars; but Wilkins stating that he had other accounts and vouchers to produce, which (according to Barton\u2019s recollection) he supposed would leave only 2,000 dollars, the balance was stated at about that sum; and though Barton at the time believed that more was due to Gordon and wife, he \u25a0agreed that the debt should be stated as of that \u25a0amount in the deed; that after Barton had resolved to \u25a0execute the deed of trust, Wilkins, for the first time, \u25a0began to talk of set-offs against the claim of Gordon \u25a0and wife; Barton urged him to exhibit them, and go into a settlement; offered to go over the whole account with Wilkins\u2019s counsel; and promised to allow him every credit that he could prove, or that was even plausible; but all was rejected: Wilkins admitting, that he could mot prove his account, and \u00bfhat all must rest on the .admissions of Gordon and wife, who he insisted should come from Ohio, where they resided, to hear his explanation; and that, under these circumstances, Barton proceeded to advertise the property for sale, under the deed of trust of August, 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">There was an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit filed, to prove that Wilkins, in June, 1840, sent an account to Gordon and wife, wherein there were numerous charges for moneys sent them, or paid for them, subsequently to April, 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-6\">Upon this state of the pleadings and proofs, the Circuit Superior Court dissolved the injunction that had been awarded to stay proceedings under the deed of trust of August, 1839; as to the defendants Gordon .and wife, for 2,000 dollars, with interest from the 7th November, 1838; and as to the defendants Peay and Hard, for .750 dollars, with interest from the 15th Oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>tober, 1889, upon the last named defendants giving ^ ugua| refim(3ing frond to James Wilkins, administrator of Corbin Lane, to indemnify him against debts his intestate outstanding and unforeseen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY2t\">From this decree, the plaintiff applied by petition to this court, for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-5\">Patton, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-6\"><em>R.

This, indeed, would seem to be an axiom in the law. Until the amount of the creditor\u2019s demand is adjusted, he cannot resort to compulsory means to enforce the payment. Even the judgments of a court of justice have no validity, and can be enforced by no execution, where they leave the amount of the demand uncertain, and depending for ascertainment upon subsequent adjustment. <em>A fortiori, </em>these judgment bonds, as they have been not unaptly called, to which, when the debt is certain, we have given, perhaps unwisely, the force of judgments, ought not to be regarded in that light, where they do not fix, distinctly and definitely, the amount of the demand. In all such cases, the deed of trust has but the effect of a mortgage. It secures the debt indeed, but it vests no power in the creditor, or in his trustee, to enforce payment, except through the agency of the courts, unless the amount be voluntarily adjusted by the agreement of the parties. However unreasonable the debtor may be in refusing to settle, his vexatious and litigous spirit can yet give; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>no right to the creditor to take the law into his own hands, by proceeding to execute the trust. It is his duty to seek from the tribunals of justice, the settlement of his accounts; and when that has been effected the enforcement of the trust will become lawful, but not till then.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The present case comes fully, I think, within the influence of these principles. It is very clear, that the deed of trust of November, 1838, was given without definitively fixing the amount of the demand. It does not appear, that there was any adjustment of it between the dates of the first and second deed of trust of August, 1839. And the latter deed, though not in terms so strong as the former, speaks of the debt to Mrs. Gordon as \u201cin and <em>about </em>2,000 dollars;\u201d and that to Lane\u2019s distributees as \u201c in and about 1,800 dollars;\u201d still leaving uncertain the actual amounts due. The last has been confessedly reduced to 750 dollars. And thus we have an evidence how little confidence is to be placed in the expressions \u201c in and about,\u201d as fixing the true amount of the demand'. Moreover, long since the deed of August, 1839, the parties say they were willing to go into a full account, and to allow any offsets which could be proved; thus sufficiently admitting that there was nothing definite as to the amount of debt, in the deed of trust. They allege, indeed, that \"Wilkins prevaricated, and very probably he did; but this, though good cause for suing him, was no justification of an attempt to sell the trust subject, without an appeal to the tribunals of justice to compel a settlement. There was, then, ample ground for the injunction; and as the state of the case is not changed materially since filing the bill, and as the accounts are still in the same state of uncertainty as before, I think the injunction was improperly dissolved. Accounts ought to have been directed embracing not only the accounts between Wilkins and Gordon &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>wife, but the account of administration of the estate jameg 0f whom Wilkins\u2019s intestate Corbin Lane was a distributee. The account of Wilkins with <em>^eSLJ </em>iQ his own right, and as representing Lane\u2019s .\u00a9ther distributees, should also be settled, and proper refunding bonds decreed, before action on the deed of trust is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">'The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><em>D-ecree, </em>That the Circuit Superior Court ought not to have dissolved the injunction, without having first \u25a0directed a settlement of the proper accounts, namely, not only the accounts of Wilkins with Cordon and wife, but the accounts of the administration of the estate of James Corbin, of whom Wilkins\u2019s intestate Corbin Lane was a distributee, and the account of Wilkins with Peay in his own right and as representing Lane\u2019s other distributees; and then directing proper refunding bonds to be given; therefore, decree reversed wdth costs, the injunction reinstated, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
