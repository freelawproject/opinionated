[Seal.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">On the 24th of April, 1798, Huston commenced a suit in chancery in the County Court of Kanawha, against Jemima Clendenin the administratrix of George Clendenin, John Meggs, who intermarried with Parthenia one of the daughters and heirs of the said George, and Cynthia and Mary Clendenin, two other daughters and heirs. The bill of Huston set forth his entering into the bond before mentioned as surety for Clendenin, the execution of the power of attorney, and the death of Clendenin before any sale under that power, \u201cby which circumstance he is advised that the powers granted unto him by the said Clendenin cease and are determined; but as those powers were given to carry into execution a purpose in itself just and laudable, and as it is conceived he hath a lien on those lands for the purposes aforesaid, so it hath been deemed expedient that application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>should be made to this court for assistance and relief.\u201d The prayer is, that the court will, by its decree, order and direct that the said Jemima, Parthenia, Cynthia and Mary revest the plaintiff with the powers formerly granted to him by the said George, under the rules and restrictions in the said powers contained, or that the administratrix, out of the personal estate of the decedent, pay the amount of the debt with interest and costs, or, in default of such payment, that the court will authorize the plaintiff to sell and dispose of the premises aforesaid, and apply the moneys arising from the sale thereof according to the direction contained in the letter of attorney. The widow answered, \u201cthat having fully considered the bill of the plaintiff, and being well apprized of the circumstances and truth therein contained, she prayed the aid of the court to convey such power and authority as she might have, unto the plaintiff, to carry into execution the power given him to dispose, sell and convey the lands therein specified, and for the purposes and under the regulations therein mentioned and expressed.\u201d Meggs and wife filed an answer under their hands and seals, the purport whereof was, that they granted and renewed to Huston full and sufficient power to dispose of, sell, or cause to be sold the tract of land, according to the tenor of the power of attorney, and they relinquished their title, right and claim as heirs. On the 11th of September, 1799, the following decree was made: \u201cIt appearing to the court from the answers of Jemima Olendenin and John Meggs and his wife, that they are desirous and willing that the complainant should have power and authority to carry into execution the powers given him to sell, dispose of and convey the lands therein specified, and for the purposes and regulations therein expressed, the court doth order and decree the same accordingly.\u201d The cause was afterwards continued until the 10th of December, 1807, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>plaintiff not further prosecuting, on the motion of the defendants it was ordered that the suit be dismissed, and that the complainant pay to the defendants their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfU\">On the 19th of December, 1812, another suit was commenced by Huston in the Superior Court of Chancery holden at Staunton. The bill in this suit sets forth the discharge by Huston of the judgment against him, the execution of the power of attorney, the death of Clendenin before sale, the previous suit in chancery, the nature of the answers therein, the decree authorizing the plaintiff to sell the land, and the dis-mission, which is stated to have been owing to the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The bill then states that John Cantrii has intermarried with Mary Clendenin, and become the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of George Clendenin\u2019s estate, that -Lamb has intermarried with Cynthia Clendenin, and that Meggs the former husband of Parthenia is dead, and she has intermarried with Andrew Bryant. It alleges that there is considerable personal estate in the hands of the administrator, that the land aforesaid yet remains unsold, and that other lands have descended from Clendenin. Cantrii and wife, Bryant and wife, Lamb and wife, and Jemima Clendenin are made defendants. The hill prays an account of the personal assets, and satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim from them, if sufficient, if not, that the land specified in the power of attorney, and, if necessary, the other lands descended, may be sold for its payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">In December, 1814, Cantrii, as husband of Mary Clendenin, and as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of George, filed his answer, setting forth his marriage in November, 1803, his qualification as administrator in the spring of 1804, the insufficiency of the personal estate to pay the decedent\u2019s debts, and the various parcels of real estate. This answer of Cantrii was referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to and adopted by bis wife, and by Bryant and wife, in the answers put in for them respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">On the 8th of December, 1818, the chancellor decreed that unless the defendants, on or before the first of June following, should pay to the plaintiff the sum \u2022of 26,617 pounds of crop tobacco with the casks, with interest thereon from the 29th of May, 1800, the marshal of the Greenbrier Chancery Court, after advertising the time and place of sale in the manner specified in the decree, should sell at public action in the town of Lewisburg in Greenbrier county the said tract of 3,000 acres of land, requiring so much of the purchase money to be paid in cash as would defray the costs and charges of sale, and bond with security for the payment of the residue into court on the 1st day of the term next after the sale should be made. It was further ordered that an account be taken before a commissioner, of the real and personal estate which had come to the hands of the defendants as heirs and administrators of George Clendenin, and the manner in which the same had been disposed of. By a subsequent order, of the 3d of July, 1821, the commissioner was directed to state the annual value of each parcel of real property descended from George Clendenin to his heirs, and the value of the whole interest in such property,, as well at the time of the order, as at the time when any parcel thereof might have been disposed of by the heirs, or any of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">The commissioner made a report shewing the assets in the hands of the administrator, and the facts in relation to certain slaves given by Clendenin in his lifetime to his children by deeds of gift. His report also set forth the real estate and the value thereof. In relation to the tract of 3,000 acres, he stated, \u201c that from 600 to 1,000 acres of it is land of first quality for that country, and if sold in small tracts to suit purchasers, and on a reasonable credit, would probably produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>5 dollars an acre, but the balance thereof is worth but little.\u201d. This.statement was made \u201cas well from the answers to interrogatories propounded by him to the defendants Cantril and Andrew Bryant, as the answer 0f the defendant Cantril.\u201d; 5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">Both parties excepted to the report; the third of the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions being, because the commissioner had not charged the administrator with all the slaves in the intestate\u2019s possession at his death, the deeds of gift under which they were claimed by his children being (as the plaintiff contended) void as to creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-7\">On the 25th of July, 1822, the court, being of opinion that the true balance of assets in the hands of the administrator, wherewith he was properly chargeable, was 628 dollars 77^- ceuts with interest from the 1st of January, 1817, decreed that he pay the same into court. At the same time the marshal of the Green-brier Chancery Court was directed to proceed to execute so much of the decree of December, 1818, as related to the sale of the 8,000 acres of land. In relation to the slaves conveyed by the deeds of gift, the court made no decree, but it declared that it would thereafter, if the plaintiff desired it, give him leave to amend his bill for the purpose of charging them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">The marshal of the Greenbrier Chancery Court reported, that on the 22cLof July, 1823, he sold the 3,000 acres of land, and the plaintiff Huston became the purchaser, being the highest bidder, at 30 cents per acre, equal to 900 dollars; of which, deducting 24 dollars for his commission, and 6 dollars for the printer\u2019s charge, there was left 870 dollars to be applied towards the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-9\">On the 3d of July, 1826, the death of the plaintiff Huston was suggested, and by consent the cause was revived in the name of Philip Pitman, his administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-10\">On the 21st of July, 1827, on the motion of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tiffs, leave was given them to file a supplemental bill. This supplemental bill, after briefly reciting the former proceedings, alleged that Clendenin in his lifetime owed a large number of valuable negroes, which with other property he conveyed away to his children, or to persons in trust for them, without any valuable consideration by deeds bearing date subsequent to the time when Huston became his seurety. It specified a deed executed by Clendenin to his brother 'William, bearing date the 3d of May, 1790, conveying two negroes and four cows for the benefit of Mary Olendenin, now Mary Cantril. It averred that Clendenin also conveyed two other negroes to Parthenia, now the wife of Andrew Bryant, and two others to Cynthia, now the wife of-Lamb. And it charged that these deeds were all made by Clendenin in fraud of his just creditors, and that he remained in possession of said slaves and other property till his death, when they were claimed and r\u00e9ceived by his daughters and their husbands under the deeds. Cantril and wife, Bryant and wife, Lamb and wife, and William Clendenin were made defendants. The prayer was, that the deeds might be produced, the consideration discovered, and the negroes with their increase also discovered; that the deeds might be declared void as to the complainant; and that the* negroes -with their increase might be sold to satisfy the balance due to Huston\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">To this supplemental bill there was filed a plea, demurrer and answer for Cantril and wife, and a like plea, demurrer and answer for Bryant and wife. The plea was to the jurisdiction, averring the non-residence of the defendants within the Staunton district; and blanks in the bill were assigned as the causes of the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-8\">With the answers were exhibited copies of the deeds. Each of them was stated on its face to be in conside<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ration of the love, good will and affection which the maker of the deed bore to the daughter to whom the gift was made. To Mary. was given a negro man named Eob, about 23 years of age, a mulatto girl called Daphne, about 7 years of age, and 4 head of cows. To Cynthia was given a negro woman named Doll, about 35 years of age, a mulatto boy named York, 9 years of age, and about 4 head of cows. And to Parthenia was given a negro boy called Peter, 5 years old, a negro girl called Phcebe, 3 years old, a roan mare, and 4 milch cows. In each deed, after the property was mentioned, were the following words, \u201cdescribed in an inventory given in trust for her to my well beloved and favorite brother, William Clendenin, before the signing and sealing of these presents, which inventory is signed with my own hand, and bearing even date with this my deed of gift; \u201d or words of like import. The deeds bore date the 3d of May, 1790, and on that day, upon the motion of Q-eorge Clendenin, the court of Kanawha county admitted the same to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\">Cantril and wife, in their answer, after objecting to the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity, insisted that the deed relied on by them was not fraudulent. They state, that the grandfather of the female respondent gave her, when of very tender years, some property, which went into the possession of her father for her benefit, and that property, with its increase, they believe to have been a consideration of the deed, as well as the consideration mentioned therein; that at the time of mailing the deed, and long after, Clendenin had property amply sufficient to pay all his debts; that the respondent Mary, at the time the deed was made to her, was not more than about 7 years old; that in a few months after the deed was made, the negro man Eob died; that though the said Mary lived with her father until his death, which happened early in 1797, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>yqt the slave Daphne, with such of the other property as remained, was in her possession, and treated by her and by the rest of the family as her own property: and they rely upon the statute of limitations. They further state that the tract of land sold was of more than sufficient value to have paid the debt, but was sacrificed for less than one-third of its value; that Huston, who bought it in, admitted to Cantril that the land was worth at least one dollar per acre, which it is in fact, and which the affidavit of Archibald Hutchinson and the papers filed in the original suit will shew; and they submit to the court whether it will not even now compel the complainants to take the land at one dollar per acre, as stipulated in the power of attorney, or direct a new sale to be made of the land, in such parcels and on such reasonable credits as might suit the circumstances of purchasers in the county where the land lies, so as to obtain a fair price for the same. The answer concludes as follows: \u201cThese respondents farther say, that they have always understood and believed that the true reason of making the deed aforesaid at the time it was made, was, that the country at that time was infested with Indians, who lurked in every corner to murder the inhabitants of these widely extended forests, and in this state of uncertainty the grantor deemed it prudent to make such division of this property among his children as was just and equitable. And these respondents farther say, that in consequence of the pressing necessities of the inhabitants, part of the stock, they believe, was killed and eaten by the family of the said George Clendenin in his lifetime. The balance was sold by the widow, and the proceeds appropriated to the use of her daughter Cynthia. After the death of the slave Robert, the other slave Daphne was raised by the female respondent, and taken by her to the state of Kentucky, whither she removed about the year 1799, and where she con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>tinued to reside till about the fall of 1803, when she finally returned to Virginia and married her husband the co-defendant, who, at considerable expense, went to Kentucky and brought said slave Daphne and her infant child to Mason county in the year 1805, where he now lives. The child (now a man) he yet has. Daphne, with another infant child, then very young, he sold about 1810 to Andrew Burks, now of Kanawha county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">The answer of Bryant and wife is nearly to the same effect as that of Cantril and wife. It states that Mrs. Bryant was about 10 or 11 years old at the time the deed to her was made; that during her father\u2019s life she held the property as her own, and it was known and recognized as such by the family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\">Archibald Hutchinson, whose affidavit is referred to in Cantril\u2019s answer, made oath that he had a tolerable knowledge of the greater part of the tract of land sold, <em>\u201c </em>and from said knowledge he does believe that the said tract is, on an average, worth one dollar per acre, and so informed Huston at the time of said sale, and he does believe that if said land was laid off in parcels to suit purchasers, and sold on short credits, it would bring at least that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-12\">The cause came on to be heard the 25th of August, 1830, on the supplemental bill, answers thereto, exhibits, and examination of witnesses: when the chancellor, expressing the opinion that the deeds of gift from Clendenin to his daughters were originally fraudulent, but were made good by the subsequent marriage of the donees, which supplied a consideration, decreed that the supplemental bill be dismissed, and that the parties respectively pay their own costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-13\">From this decree Huston\u2019s administrator appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-14\">The cause was first argued in March, 1836, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant, and <em>Robinson </em>for the appellees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>before a court consisting of Tucker, P. and Brooke, Cabell, Carr and Brockenbrougb, J. On tbe 30th of March, 1836, the following opinions were delivered and decree entered.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-6\">Brockenbrough, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzP\">The bond executed by Clendenin as principal, and Huston as surety, to Mayo, bears date as far back as 1782. After various efforts made by the creditor, he at length, in 1800, obtained a judgment against Huston the surety, who paid the amount of the debt on the 29th of May, 1800. The supplemental bill by which Cantril and wife, and the other daughters of Clendenin and their husbands,, were made parties, was filed on the 21st of July, 1827. That bill seeks to set aside certain deeds as voluntary and fraudulent, by which Clendenin had conveyed some slaves to his three infant daughters, for the consideration of love and affection, which deeds were admitted to record as early as May, 1790. If the plaintiff has any right to set aside those deeds, and to subject the property conveyed by them to the payment of Huston\u2019s debt due from the estate of Clendenin, that right accrued at least as early as May, 1800, more than 27 years before the filing of the supplemental bill; and the defendants rely on the lapse of time as a bar to the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">It was contended by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the plaintiff\u2019s action did not accrue till he had established his debt against the rightful administrator; and as an excuse for not making this demand at an earlier period, it was stated, that shortly after it was ascertained from the commissioner\u2019s report what was due,, and then that there was not a sufficiency of other assets to discharge the debt, this bill was filed against the fraudulent donees. It is well established at law, that the limitation begins to run from the moment that the cause of action accrues, and not from the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that it is ascertained that damage has been actually sustained by the breach of contract. <em>Battley, </em>&amp;c., v. <em>Faulkner, &amp;c., </em>8 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 288; 5 Eng. C. L. R. 288. and <em>Wilcox, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Plummer\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>4 Peters 172; are strong cases to that effect, and I see no reason why the same rule should not prevail in equity. After the enjoyment of the property for 37 years, and 27 years after the right of action, if any, accrued to the plaintiff, I think the title of the children ought not to be disturbed. The supplemental bill ought not to have been allowed, and was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">I concur with my brethren in the opinion, that as the bond on which the claim is founded does not bind the heirs of the obligors, no decree can be rendered against the children of Clendenin, to subject to the payment of this debt any land inherited by them, other than that on which Huston acquired a lien by the deed in the record mentioned: and that, by the very terms of that deed, Huston was bound to allow for that land at the rate of one dollar per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b176-6\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5z\">The original bill in this case was filed to enforce a lien on a tract of land, given by Clendenin to Huston, in the form of a power of attorney to sell, but operating as a mortgage on the land. The bill was filed against the real and personal representatives of Clendenin, and on a hearing, the court decreed a sale of the land. It was sold; and the report of the marshal shewing that it left a considerable part of the debt unpaid, the court (without confirming the report, as I understand the record) gave leave to file a supplemental bill, for the purpose of impeaching three deeds made by Clendenin to his daughters, conveying to them slaves and other chattels, and of having those slaves sold to pay the residue of the debt. Without acting finally on the original bill, the court proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to hear the supplemental bill, and dismissed it: from which dismissal this appeal is taken by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">I think this dismissal right, for several reasons. In the first place, I do not think that under the aspect of the case at the time, the court ought to have given leave to file the supplemental bill. Here was a specific subject pledged for the debt, and resorted to by the bill, and until that was fairly exhausted and shown to be insufficient, there was no need and no propriety in seeking to condemn other property. How, to my mind, this specific fund has by no means been shown to be insufficient; on the contrary, the fact seems to be, that, properly disposed of, it would have discharged the debt and left a considerable surplus. The lien on the land, dated in December, 1794, contains a stipulation between the parties, that it should not be sold for less than one dollar per acre. This is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that, at that early period, the parties thought it worth that price. In the commissioner\u2019s report, made in 1821, we find him representing \u201c that from 600 to 1,000 acres of this land is of the first quality for that country, and if sold in small tracts and on a reasonable credit, would probably produce five dollars per acre: but the balance thereof is worth but little.\u201d This report was before the court when the last order of sale was entered. In 1822, Archibald Hutchinson makes oath that he is well acquainted with the land, and thinks it worth on an average one dollar per acre. And yet, in July, 1822, this whole tract is set up and sold in a lump, and bought in by Huston the plaintiff at 30 cents per acre, making, to be credited to the decree, \u00a770 dollars only; whereas, if it had been sold according to the suggestions of the commissioner, 800 acres of it would probably have brought 4,000 dollars. I feel satisfied that if this monstrous sacrifice had been brought to the notice of the chancellor, he would have ordered a resale; this being strongly prayed for in the answers to the supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>bill, ancl in itself most reasonable and proper. But the report seems never to have come under his notice: the subsequent proceedings are wholly taken up with the case made by the supplemental bill, answers and evidenee, ending with the dismission of that bill, from which the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">I think this dismission correct, in the second place, on the ground taken by the chancellor; that the deeds from Clendenin to his daughters, though in their origin voluntary, and, while they continued so, assailable by creditors, yet became, by the marriage of those daughters, deeds for a valuable consideration, and from the dates of their marriages the daughters and their husbands became purchasers for a valuable consideration, liable to no creditor of their father who had not, before such marriage, obtained, by judgment or otherwise, a specific lien on the property. That a deed voidable may be rendered valid and effectual by matter <em>ex post facto, </em>is an undeniable proposition, and as old as the statute of Marlbridge. (See 2 Inst. 111.) <em>Prodgers </em>v. <em>Langham, </em>1 Sid. 133, a conveyance was made in trust for an only daughter for 21 years, to the intent that the profits before her marriage should be applied to her maintenance, and if she married with her father\u2019s consent, then in trust for her during the rest of the term. The court held that the deed to the daughter was voluntary, and would have been void against the defendant, a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration, if the marriage had not intervened; but when that took effect, the deed ceased to be voluntary, and became supported by a valuable consideration which was unimpeachable, inasmuch as the marriage was an advancement to the daughter, and the husband was induced (though that fact does not appear in the case) by the prospect of this provision. The cases of <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>Prac. in Ch. 275, and <em>East India Co. </em>v. <em>Clavell, </em>Id. 377, are to the same effect, except that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>these the marriage was had with notice by the husband of the deed, and in the first such notice was presumed. In <em>Brown </em>v. Carter, 5 Ves. 862, Lord Alvanzey reviews all the cases, and considers that proof of notice of the settlement before the marriage is not material. He says, \u201c The lady had a right, the children have a right, to have it considered that he had the estate which he appeared to have. Therefore I am of opinion, though it does not appear that the friends of the wife did speculate upon this and take it into consideration, it must be presumed they did act upon it, and the husband has not a right now to disturb it.\u201d In the case of <em>George </em>v. <em>Milbanke, </em>9 Ves. 190, Sir Ralph Milbanke h'ad a power of appointment of \u00a35,000, to be raised under a trust term, and if he failed to appoint, then to his executors. In pursuance of this power, he directed that \u00a3500 should be paid to his natural son Mark Milbanke, and the rest of the \u00a3 5,000 he appointed in favor of his natural children and their mother. Mark Milbanke (soon after the death of Sir Ralph) in consideration of \u00a3400, paid him by Gr. and P. assigned to them the \u00a3500 charged on the trust in his favor. Sir Ralph died in debt; and this bill was filed by a specialty creditor, also administrator with the will annexed, to have the \u00a35,000, or so much as was not well appointed and disposed of by Sir R. in his lifetime, raised and paid to the plaintiff. Lord Chancellor Eldon said, it was too clear for argument, that the \u00a34,500, appointed to the woman and children was part of the personal assets of Sir R. applicable to the payment of his debts, they being volunteers; but as to the \u00a3500, after a careful examination of the cases, he concludes thus: \u201cThis is an assignment, in equity merely, of a sum of money. But the question would be, whether the general creditors have a better equity than a purchaser of this specific part of the estate, having paid his money? And I think his the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>better equity. The son, as a volunteer, would hold it against every one but creditors; and the question is whether, being not-a volunteer but a purchaser, creditors having no specific charge upon this property have as good an equity? I think they have not.\u201d In his review of the cases, Lork Eldon makes this remai\u2019k upon <em>Prodgers </em>v. <em>Langham: </em>\u201cIn the case in Siderfin, the settlement is expressed to be by covin. The reason as stated is this, that though a voluntary feoffment is bad as between the creditor and the feoffee, yet it is good as between the feoffor and feoffee; and therefore the latter, if prior, shall hold against the subsequent feoffee of the feoffor. The consequence is, that the feoffment of the voluntary feoffee is good against creditors.\u201d In Sugden on Vendors, ch. XVI, \u00a7 1, part III (American Edi. of 1836, vol. 2, p. 198-9), the author, having laid down the rule that a deed merely voluntary or fraudulent in its creation, and voidable by a purchaser, may become good by matter <em>ex post </em>facto, proceeds to cite the cases I have quoted, and remarks, \u201cIf a voluntary grantee gain credit by the conveyance to him, and a person is induced to marry him on account of such. provision, the deed, though void in its creation as to purchasers, will, on the marriage being solemnized, no longer remain voluntary, as it was in its creation, but will be considered as made upon valuable consideration. And it is to be inferred\u201d (he adds) \u201cfrom a late decision\u201d (referring to <em>Brown </em>v. Carter) \u201cthat though it. does not appear that the friends of the wife did speculate upon the provision and take it into consideration, yet it must be presumed that they did act upon it; and it cannot after-wards be disturbed.\u201d In <em>Sterry </em>v. <em>Arden, </em>1 Johns. Ch. R. 261, Chancellor Kent remarks, \u201cThe marriage was a valuable consideration which fixed the interest in the grantee against all the world; she is regarded from that time as a purchaser, and as much so as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>she had then paid an adequate pecuniary consideration. It has been a principle of long standing, and uniformly recognized, that a deed voluntary or fraudulent in its creation, and voidable by a purchaser, may become good by matter <em>ex post facto. </em>It is the constant language of the books and of the courts, that a voluntary deed is made good by a subsequent marriage; and marriage has always been held to be the highest consideration in law. Co. Litt. 9 b. The cases do not require that the settlement should have been made with a view to any particular marriage; it is sufficient that the settlement was afterwards known to third persons, and was one probable inducement to the subsequent marriage. Indeed, in <em>Brown </em>v. Carter, Lord Alvanley did not think it very material to prove that the marriage was even made with notice of the voluntary settlement, as the knowledge of the circumstances of the party, and the inducement, were to be presumed.\u201d See 12 Johns. Rep. 536, where this case, on appeal, was unanimously affirmed; Spencer, J. delivering a .most able opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The three deeds in the case before us seem to have been ordered to record in open court, in Kanawha, on the day of their date (May 3, 1790), upon the motion of the grantor\u2014a circumstance calculated to give them much publicity; and it cannot be reasonably doubted that gentlemen inclined to address these ladies would in some way get notice of them. \"We know too that on the death of the grantor the slaves were taken into the separate possession of the daughters, and never inventoried as the property of their father. The daughters were all married after this, and of course with the slaves in their possession, and their deeds of record. How can it be doubted that their husbands had a knowledge of these notorious and open facts before their marriages ?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">It was said, however, that this defence of the mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>riage and its operation as a purchase for value, was not pleaded, nor any way put in issue. It is true there is no plea, nor any formal defence on this ground; but fae\u00a3g are ap stated and not at all contested\u2014indeed stated in the bill itself. It was further insisted that Clendenin, when he made these deeds, was not in a situation in which he could have made a marriage settlement in favor of his daughters that would have been valid, and therefore that the deeds could not be validated by the subsequent marriage. I cannot admit either the position, or the consequence deduced from it. What was the situation of Clendenin when he made these deeds? We hear of no debt but that to Huston, and he was a creditor at large; or rather, there was no <em>debt </em>even to him, but a liability only, which did not become a debt until ten years afterwards, when he paid the money as surety. Will it be said that if, at the date of the deeds, Clendenin had sold <em>bona fide </em>and for a valuable consideration every slave he had, Huston could have disturbed such sale ? And what is a settlement of slaves or other property upon a child in consideration of marriage, but a sale for a valuable consideration? Is not marriage the highest consideration, the most favored? ' I have always seen it so laid down. Co. Lit. 9 b.; 1 Bro. P. C. 244; 2 Id. 596; Mitford\u2019s Plead. (4th edi.) 278. But let us take the case actually before us\u2014the case of these deeds. Could Huston have set them aside? Never while he was a creditor at large; and he was <em>no creditor </em>till he paid the debt as surety, which was not till 1800. He must then have gotten a judgment and sued out execution before he could file a bill to impeach them. Instead of this course, he preferred to take a lien on the 8,000 acre tract, then by his own admission an ample security for the engagement into which he had entered as the surety of Clendenin. This lien indeed was given to enable him to sell the land and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>meet the debt, and ti; us save himself from paying any thing out of his own pocket; and if he had used due diligence, it would seem that he might have effected this; for he received the power of attorney in 1794, and Clendenin did not die till 1797. But be this as it may, after taking this security, what had he to do with Clendenin\u2019s personal estate? Could he tie it up in any way ? Assuredly not. He stood merely as a surety bound for a deot and holding In his hands ample counter security. While he occupied this ground, Clendenin died; his daughters came into actual possession of the slaves, and married. This event, as the cases tell us, <em>\u201c </em>fixed the interest of the grantees against-all the world; from this moment they must be taken as-purchasers, and as much so as if they had then paid an adequate pecuniary consideration.\u201d This seems to me a complete defence against the claim set up in the supplemental bill; for surely if, at the times of the marriages, the slaves had been sold to a purchaser for their value in -money, Huston could never have disturbed those sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">I am also of opinion that the statute of limitations is a bar to the claim: but I have been so tedious upon the points already discussed, that I refer myself entirely to the view of my brother, the president, has taken of this point, and the cases he has cited.</p>\n<author id=\"b183-7\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">In this ease, Huston, the surety of Clendenin, having paid off the debt after Clendenin\u2019s death, claimed to be substituted to the rights of the bond creditor against his heirs and personal representatives. His right to be so substituted cannot be contested, and is not denied. But having failed to make his debt out of the personal estate in the hands of Clendenin\u2019s administrator, and the lands in the hands of his heirs, the appellant, the administrator of Huston filed a supplemental bill, with a view to subject to his demand some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>slaves and other property in the hands of Clendenin\u2019s daughters, which he conveyed to them in 1790, in fraud, as it is alleged, of his creditors, and of Huston m particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The first defence set up by Cantril and others against this demand is, that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject. The Court of Chancery, however, very properly thought otherwise, and proceeded to consider the case upon another point, on which it gave judgment against the plaintiff by dismissing the bill. This was, that although the deeds from Clendenin to his daughters were fraudulent in their inception, they were made good by the subsequent marriage of the daughters. That such would have been the effect of a marriage settlement cannot be questioned. Whether the mere marital rights of the husband would render valid an anterior fraudulent conveyance, is a broader question, upon which I do not feel prepared to pronounce, though the authorities indeed seem to sustain the proposition. <em>Sterry </em>v. <em>Arden, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 261. Roberts on ffraud. Conv. 508, 508. Nor do I think it necessary to decide another question that has been made. It is contended that if a fraudulent donee, or any other who holds an estate subject to a charge, parts with it so as to withdraw it from the power of the creditor, the donee becomes personally liable for the demand. See <em>Ferrars </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>2 Vern. 384. If so, then it is said the <em>femes covert </em>here became, by the discharge of the property, debtors to its value, and the husbands have taken them and their property with that burden.1 Without, however, touching this question, or that upon which the chancellor dismissed the bill, I am satisfied it was properly dismissed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The^defendants are charged on the ground of a fraudulent conveyance executed 37 years anterior to the exhibition of this charge against them, the fraudulent grantor having also been dead nearly 30 years before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>this- assault upon Ms memory. There are two grounds on which the charge of fraud rests: first, that the conveyance was voluntary and without consideration; secondly, that possession did not accompany the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">As to the first, I cannot think it sustained by any thing that appears in the cause. It is not every voluntary conveyance to a wife or child that is to be taken to be fraudulent. I admit it is said that as to creditors a voluntary conveyance is <em>prima fade </em>ff audul ent. <em>George </em>v. <em>Milbanke, </em>9 Ves. 194. But such a conveyance, made by a person not at all indebted, is certainly neither fraudulent nor void as to subsequent creditors, and the better opinion seems to me to be, that although the grantor may be somewhat indebted, yet if he be not embarrassed, or so greatly indebted as to afford evidence of fraudulent intent, the deed shall not be held void as to subsequent creditors. <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>2 Brock. R. 132. It cannot be sustained against antecedent creditors indeed, according to the opinion of very able judges, though others have thought otherwise. In the case of <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 Day\u2019s Connect. Rep. N. S., p. 525, the chief justice is reported to have said that \u201cif there be no fraudulent intent, and the grantor be in prosperous circumstances, unembarrassed, and not considerably indebted, and the gift a reasonable provision for a child, leaving ample funds unincumbered for the payment of the grantor\u2019s debts, the voluntary conveyance to the child will be valid against <em>existing </em>debts.\u201d In these sentiments I fully concur, believing them to be the true exposition of the proviso of our statute which excepts from its operation conveyances upon good consideration and <em>bona fide. </em>If therefore the case required it, I should think it proper to look into this doctrine thoroughly, and to suggest to my brethren the propriety of settling, once for all, whether it really be the law of this land that no man can make a valid gift to a child, or settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ment upon his family, which shall prevail against subsisting creditors, whatever may be his wealth or his unembarrassed condition. But that question does not, I think, necessarily arise in this case, although the ^u^\"^an(^e^ situation of Clendenin when he made the gifts might bring, him within the principles of the decision of <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>and although the actual and apparently voluntary execution of an instrument giving a lien for the debt on 3,000 acres of land, satisfactorily proves the fairness and <em>bonafides </em>of Clendenin throughout these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Without resting the case on these points, the length of time which has elapsed since the gift to the daughters, is, in my estimation, an insuperable barrier to the investigation of the alleged fraud in the conveyances. There is no principle more cherished in a Court of Equity than that which reprobates the entertainment of stale and antiquated claims. An equitable claim of 20 years\u2019 standing is now considered as barred by length of time; and if the principle be just in relation to accounts and equities where there is no fraud alleged, it is still more just and proper where fraud is charged upon a defendant. It is not reasonable that after the lapse of 37 years a party should be called upon to answer to such a charge, unless it has been kept from view by his own cunning and contrivance. 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 634; 2 Eq. Ca. Abr. 10. pl. 11. It has been strongly and truly said, indeed, that no time will prevent the \u201cunkennelling of fraud:\u201d but the pursuit must be prompt, or it will prove unsuccessful. It is not reasonable to call upon a party to explain a transaction, when the evidences of its fairness may have been swept into oblivion by the lapse of more than the third of a century. I am of opinion that the rule established both at law and in equity, which requires the party who charges the fraud to proceed within a given time after its discovery, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>just and proper rule, equally demanded by policy and a fair analogy to the statute of limitations, and equally applicable to cases of constructive fraud as to cases of actual fraud. I shall content myself with a simple reference to some of the cases on this subject, without making extracts from them; though the remarks of the chancellor, 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 633-639, are strikingly apposite to this case. <em>Bree </em>v. <em>Holbech, </em>2 Doug. 656; 3 P. Wms. 143; 4 Bro. P. C. (by Tomlin) 163; 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 607; Mitford\u2019s Plead. 212, (4th edi. 269); 2 Eq. Ca. Abr. 10, pl. 11; and 4 Leigh 474, where the cases are cited by the bar in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">How in this case the conveyances were made by the father to his daughters 37 years before the charge of fraud is brought forward, and 30 years after Clendenin himself was in his grave. It is not alleged in the bill that the fraud was recently discovered, nor is it possible so to conceive. The deeds of gift were recorded, and upon the death of Olendenin in 1797, his children took possession, and part of the property at least was carried out of the state. If, as the law presumes, the creditor trusts his debtor upon the faith of the property which he sees in his possession, we must take it that the creditor here knew that Olendenin lived and died in the continued possession of this property, which he looked to for the satisfaction of his debt, and that immediately upon his death that property was removed from the hands of his personal representative, and claimed, held and eloigned by his children as their own. Pressed as Huston was by this claim\u2014committed as he was to close custody, and breaking jail as his only means of liberation, it is scarcely credible that he should not have diligently scrutinized the state of Olendenin\u2019s property, and asserted his claim to charge these slaves at an earlier period, had he not been conscious that the transaction was fair and meritorious. Cantril, in his answer, alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ges that there was a valuable consideration for the gift to his wife. Thirty-seven years ago this might perhaps have been proved, though it would be wonderful indeed if to this late day the testimony as to that fact has been preserved. I am therefore of opinion that it is now too late to question the transaction, and that after such a lapse of time it must be taken to have been unimpeachable.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">This view of the case applies with not less force to the second ground of fraud alleged in the bill, namely, the fraudulent retaining of possession by the grantor in the deeds. That might have been accounted for 37 years ago, in various ways, however difficult it may be to explain it now. What light could Cantril\u2019s wife (then a small child) throw upon the transaction? In his lifetime, Olendenin might have shewn that there was a valuable consideration for the gift, in which case the retaining possession by him for his children would have been held good, according to the case of <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Gaines </em>others, 4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 151. But at this late day, such proof cannot be expected, and it would be unreasonable to demand it. It cannot be, that .such a fact can be made the subject of examination at any period however remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">It is said, however, that there is no manner in which the party sued as <em>executor de son tort </em>can protect himself at law from the creditor\u2019s claim by relying on the lapse of time. I cannot assent to this. In the scanty materials which the books afford upon this subject, the question does not seem to have occurred, nor does there appear to be any precedent of a plea of the statute in such a cas\u00e9. I do not think such a <em>plea </em>could be sustained. But when, to the plea of <em>no executor, </em>the plaintiff replies that the defendant has taken possession of the goods of the decedent, the issue is made up on the question whether they are indeed his goods; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and on the trial of that question, after a great lapse of time and an uninterrupted possession of the property, it would he competent and proper for the court to instruct the jury, that they might and ought to presume the delivery of possession, or an adequate excuse for its non-delivery. This principle of presumption from length of time has not been confined to the case of a bond or a mortgage: it has been extended even to the presumption of a deed or a patent, and among us, to the new and unprecedented case of a presumed compliance with the requisitions of our law against the importation of slaves into this commonwealth from adjoining states. <em>George </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>4 Rand. 659. It is a principle of universal application, and essential to the protection of all rights which have been long and uninterruptedly enjoyed. The right to this protection cannot depend upon the form of action which the plaintiff may select. It must avail the defendant, in some form or other, in every suit which may be instituted against him, assailing a right which he has held without question, until the evidence of its validity has been lost by the lapse of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">For these reasons, I am of opinion that the supplemental bill was properly dismissed, and indeed that it ought never to have been permitted to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u201c The court is of opinion that there is no error in the decree dismissing the supplemental bill: but the court is of opinion that the heirs of the obligors in the bond from Clendenin and Huston to John Mayo, Jr.,, in the proceedings mentioned, not being bound to the obligee, they are not bound to Huston, the surety who paid the debt and seeks to be subrograted, except under some specific lien which may have been given upon the lands; and the instrument giving the lien in this-case providing expressly that the lands shall not be sold for a less price than one dollar per acre, the said Hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ton or his representatives cannot avail themselves of this lien, unless they, or some other person, will give an average of one dollar per acre for every acre in the tract. Therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the said decree dismissing the supplemental bill be affirmed,\u201d with costs to the appellees. And cause remanded to the Circuit Court of Augusta, \u201cwith directions to set aside the decree directing a sale of the land, and to direct a re-sale on the conditions above mentioned, and also to set aside so much of the decrees as directed an account of the other real estate of Clendenin, which descended to his heirs; and to be proceeded in to a final decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">This decree was subsequently, during the same term, set aside on the motion of the appellant: and on his further motion, and suggestion of diminution in the record sent to this court, a writ of <em>certiorari </em>was awarded; upon the return of which it appeared, that in the transcript of the record originally certified, the following proceedings had been omitted\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">On the 18th of June, 1828, it was ordered, on the motion of the plaintiff, that if he should become the purchaser of the land directed to be sold by the former decree, the bond and security for the purchase money, required by that decree, might be dispensed with by the marshal, who was required to receive the bid of the plaintiff without such bond and security.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">On the 20th of December, 1823, on the motion of the defendants by their counsel, and by.consent of the plaintiff, it was ordered as follows: \u201c that the marshal of the Superior Court of Chancery, holden at Lewis-burg, at any time before the next term, at the request of the defendants, and at their proper costs and charges, make sale of the lands in the preceedings mentioned, in such lots or parcels as the said defendants may di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>rect, for ready money, having advertised the time and place of such sale in such manner as directed by the decree made in this cause, or for such time, and in such manner, as the defendants may direct.\u201d But it was understood and agreed, \u201c that the plaintiff shall be at liberty, at the next term, to take the benefit of such sale or sales, if he thinks proper, provided the whole land shall sell for less than the amount due to him, and if the whole product of all sales shall not be equal to the amount, the said marshal shall, instead of receiving the amount of the respective purchases from those who shall become the highest bidders, in money, take bonds with sufficient security from them respectively, to pay the sums of money due from them, when their titles shall be confirmed by the decree of this court, and not otherwise.\u201d . And it was further ordered, by consent of the parties, \u201cthat the present cash prices of crop tobacco in the Petersburg market shall be the standard by which the sum due'to the plaintiff shall be ascertained,\u201d and that certain persons of the city of Richmond should determine such price, that is to say, determine- at what price the quantity of tobacco due to the plaintiff could, at the date of the order, be purchased in the Petersburg market.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The following certificate of three mercantile firms of Petersburg was filed in the cause: \u201cWe hereby certify that a parcel of Petersburg passed tobacco might have been purchased in this market about the 28th of December last, say from 10 to 35,000 pounds, at 3 dollars and 50 cents per hundred pounds. Peters-burg, 31st day of March, 1824.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On the 24th of July, 1824, by consent of the parties, the privileges granted the defendants, by the order made on the 20th of December, 1823, were continued \u25a0until the next term.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">To the marshal\u2019s report, and to the sale made by him, tim defendants excepted on two grounds: 1st, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>because tbe land was sold in Greenbrier, and not in Nicholas, the county in which it lay; 2dly, because the marshal did not furnish proof that the requisitions of the decree directing the sale had been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">On the 19th of July, 1827, the cause came on to be heard on the marshal\u2019s report, and the defendants\u2019 exceptions thereto; when the court overruled the exceptions, confirmed the report, and decreed that the marshal convey the land to the heirs of George Huston deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The cause was again argued in April, 1840, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellees, before a court consisting of <em>Tucker, </em>P., and <em>Brooke, Cabell, Barker, </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The questions mainly discussed at the bar, though not decided by the court, were, 1. Whether, supposing that the deeds from Glendenin to his daughters were voluntary and fraudulent as to creditors, the donees can avail themselves of the statute of limitations, as a defence against the claim made by the supplemental bill? 2.

Whether the obligation executed by Clendenin and Huston to Mayo, bound the heirs of the obligors ? 7.

Ch. R. 481, from the many cases on the subject, upon a careful review of them; which doctrine is thus stated by him: \u201c The conclusion to be drawn from the cases is, that if a party be indebted at the time of the voluntary settlement, it is presumed to be fraudulent in respect to <em>such </em>debts,\u201d (that is, debts existing at the time of the settlement) \u201cand no circumstance will permit those debts to be affected by the settlement, or repel the legal presumption of fraud. The presumption of law in this case does not depend upon the amount of debt, or the extent of the property in the settlement, or the circumstances of the party. There is no such line of distinction set up or traced in any of the cases. The attempt would be embarrassing if not dangerous to the rights of creditors, and prove an inlet to fraud. The law therefore wisely disables the debtor from making any voluntary settlement of his estate to stand in the way of <em>existing debts. </em>This is the clear uniform doctrine of the cases.\u201d Such too is the doctrine of the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Chamberlayne &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>2 Rand. 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">My opinion further is, that the property and the responsibilities therefor were not discharged in either of the modes suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">1st. The act of limitations does not protect it from the claim of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">It has been a <em>concessum </em>in the argument, that a party holding property under a voluntary conveyance which may be avoided by a creditor of the grantor, may, on the death of the grantor, be sued by the creditor as <em>executor de son tort. </em>On the assumption that such suit may be brought, the limitation applicable to suits for the recovery of personal property, it is contended, is applicable in this case, and commences to run from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the time such action might be brought; and when time has elapsed sufficient to protect the adverse possession of personal property from a suit to recover it, that time consummates the title of the donee in respect to the creditor, and the donee no longer holds the property, or is chargeable in respect of it, as <em>executor de son tort. </em>To this I cannot assent. The liability as <em>executor de son tort </em>does not subject the party to an action of detinue or trover by the creditor: the liability is to the action that the creditor might have against the rightful executor\u2014the action of <em>assumpsit </em>or debt, if on a simple contract, of debt if on a specialty or judgment: and having incurred a liability to such actions, the only limitation by which he can protect himself from such liabilty is that which applies to the action to which he is so liable. The claim of the appellant could not have been barred by the statute of limitations, and the statute cannot give protection to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">2ndly. The marriage did not supply a valuable consideration, giving validity to the voluntary conveyance, and exonerating the donees from the responsibility that existed previous to the marriage. The title that accrues to a husband in the personal property of his wife, by force of the marital right, has not the stability and strength of that of a purchaser for valuable consideration. The husband is invested, by force of the marital right, with the rights of property that his wife may have had in the personalty that he reduces to possession. His rights in such property are measured by hers.' If acquired by her by covin, and that covin be secret, she might pass a good title to a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice; hut the <em>marital </em>right would not protect the property. A secret trust, or an unrecorded mortgage, which would not protect it from the claim of such purchaser, would certainly not be defeated by the marital right. Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>riage is an absolute gift to the husband of all the goods and personal chattels and estate which the wife was actually and beneficially seized or possessed of at that time in her own right, and of such other goods and personal chattels as came to her during marriage. 1 Roper on Husband and Wife, p. 169. The husband is not a purchaser of the personal chattels of the wife. 7 Ves. 174. Again, the wife, at the time of her marriage, was liable to the action of the creditor. Her marriage cannot <em>'per se </em>absolve her from that action.. If, by force of the marriage, the title in the property be so changed as to protect it from specific charge,, more certainly would a sale of it by the donee, for-valuable consideration, to a purchaser without notice, have that effect. Yet in the latter case it would hardly be pretended that the donee, by selling the property in respect to which she was chargeable as executrix <em>de son tort, </em>would absolve herself from such liability.. In either view the liability to the creditor would continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u25a0 3dly. The lapse of time should not deprive the appellant of redress. It was proper for the appellant to seek satisfaction out of the estate of the debtor, rather than attempt to obtain it out of the property conveyed to the donees. If he could have sued at law, charging the donees as executors in their own wrong, I think, with the appellant\u2019s counsel, that proof of the insufficiency of Clendenin\u2019s estate to pay his debts, unless aided by the property conveyed to the donees, formed an indispensable part of his case. The creditor resorting to a Court of Equity might have made the donees <em>parties; </em>but this he could not have done so effectually, unless he had charged that Clendenin\u2019s estate, unaided by the property conveyed to the donees, was inadequate to satisfy his claim. Without such an allegation, it would not appear that he was hindered or defrauded by the conveyances, and that they' were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>therefore void as to him; and the donees might have demurred. How, at the time the suit was instituted, there was every probability, according to the view the parties took of the liabilities of Clendenin\u2019s estate, that it would-prove adequate; up to the order confirming the sale of the land, it was not ascertained to be inadequate; and during this time, the creditor was seeking to get satisfaction out of the subject that in equity ought to have been primarily charged for the protection of the donees. Though the creditor might, on the suggestion of the insolvency of Clendenin\u2019s estate, have made the donees parties, he was not, against his own belief and the ostensible probabilities of the case, bound to do so, at the hazard of being subjected to costs to the donees, as I suppose he would have been, had the result shewn (as he had reason to \u2022expect it would do) that Clendenin\u2019s estate was not insolvent, and his claim been satified out of that estate without touching the donations. The responsibility of the donees in equity was secondary and eventual, and the time consumed in the attempt to fix the charge on and procure satisfaction out of the estate primarily chargeable, and which was believed to be adequate, cannot be computed in order to sustain the objection founded on the lapse of time, which operates only as evidence of satisfaction, or of abandonment or acquiescence. The donees cannot complain that that effort was made. It was necessary to fix the title of the creditor to a <em>decree </em>against them; and though they might have been made parties at an earlier date, had the creditor, against the probabilities of the case, thought proper to hazard the suggestion that Clendenin\u2019s estate was insolvent, yet that fact not being ascertained or believed, the creditor was not bound to suggest it, and consequently not bound to make the donees parties at that time. I know of no case, or doctrine deduciblefrom analogies, which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>justify the discharge of an eventual responsibility, on the length of time consumed in the diligent pursuit of satisfaction from the fund primarily chargeable. Were an executor to assent to and deliver legacies without leaving funds to satisfy debts, the creditors might embrace the legatees in a suit against the executor, by making that suggestion. Yet it never has been supposed that if the creditor pursues his claim against the executor, and at the end of a tedious litigation it is ascertained that he has not assets or ability to pay the debt, the time consumed in this pursuit could be used to repel the suit against the legatees, instituted within reasonable time after such abortive pursuit. I forbear to extend the argument in support of my opinion that the supplemental bill ought not to have been dismissed, as the other judges, on different grounds, dissent from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The resulting questions are, 1st. Can the court, on this appeal from the dismission of the supplemental bill, examine the previous decrees, and correct them if they be erroneous ? and 2dly. If this can be done, are those decrees erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The cases referred to in 2 Rob. Prac. 433, leave no doubt that the first question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The solution of the second depends on the effect of the power of attorney, and of the obligation of the bond given by Clendenin to Mayo.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The obligation of the bond does not, in my opinion, extend to the heirs of the obligor, and the creditor therefore cannot charge the real estate, unless the power of attorney has given him a lien on the 3,000 acres mentioned in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The case of <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmaniere\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>8 Wheat. 174, which has been recognized by this court in the case of <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Fawcett\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>2 Leigh, 19, is, I think, sound law, though in this case I apply it with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the more reluctance, seeing that by it the creditor will be deprived of a security which he and the court below, and one at least of the defendants, supposed to exist. Assenting to the law of that ease after the fullest deliberation, the result 'is that the power of attorney expired with the life of Clendenin, and gave no lien after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The decree therefore for the sale of the 3,000 acres of land was erroneous, and all proceedings under it must be set aside, the land restored to the heirs of' Clendenin, the conveyance of the marshal, made on the confirmation of the sale, cancelled, and a release- or reconveyance, with special warranty, by Huston or those claiming under him as heirs, devisees or grantees, decreed to be made to the said heirs of Clendenin.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b200-11\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">I concur with the president in the opinion he is about to deliver; and I concur also in the-opinions of Judge <em>Carr </em>and Judge <em>Brockenbrough, </em>(delivered on the first argument of this case,) upon the-act of limitations. That act, as regards slave property, has been often applied to the right as well as the remedy. Bive years possession has been held not only to protect the right of a <em>defendant, </em>but to entitle a <em>plaintiff </em>to recover the slaves, even against one having a prior title. In the case before us, to hold that such a possession will not protect the property against the creditor of the donor, would be to prefer the right of\" the creditor to the right of the true owner; which I think would be (where there is no lien on the property)to prefer the less to the greater right, and violate the object of the act of limitations; especially in a case in which the rights of the defendants accrued more than 27 years before the filing of the bill.</p>\n<author id=\"b200-12\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">I have carefully reconsidered this case, and re-examined the opinion I delivered at the former-hearing, (to which I beg leave to refer,) and I find no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>reason to depart from the conclusion at which I then \u2022arrived. My mind has been fortified in the belief that a fraudulent donee, sued at law as executor <em>de son tort, </em>-cannot protect himself by the statute of limitations by way of plea, but that he may do so by moving an instruction to the jury to presume from lapse of time that every thing was fair. For if, to the plea of <em>ne \u25a0ungues executor, </em>the plaintiff replies that the defendant had administered by taking possession of the property of the deceased, the question at once arises whether it was the decedent\u2019s estate, and this would depend upon the question whether the conveyance impeached was or was not fraudulent; and in the decision of this question a jury ought, after great lapse of time, to presume every thing to have been right. And if the donee could so protect himself at law, it would seem <em>a fortiori, </em>that where, as in this case, the length of time is relied \u2022on in equity, he should receive its protection. It is perfectly well settled that in case of an actual fraud, the statute of limitations is a good bar, both at law and in equity, or rather it operates as such in equity, by analogy to its effect at law. \"Why then should a mere constructive fraud, implied from transactions oftentimes most praiseworthy and amiable, be denied the protection of a pi\u2019inciple which has been established \"by the legislature, and followed by the chancellors, for the purpose of protecting rights long uninterruptedly enjoyed, and for discountenancing that greatest mischief to the republic, the hunting up and the assertion of stale and antiquated claims? I cannot perceive; and I am therefore of opinion that a party may protect himself by length of time, from the attempt to charge him as a fraudulent donee. In this case I am satisfied that Huston might, as early as 1800, after he paid the -debt, have instituted his action, either at law or in equity, against the appellees as fraudulent donees, if they were really such, and that of course the lapse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>time should be computed from that period. If so, 27 years elapsed before the institution of the present proceeding, which for the first time puts the defendants upon the proof of the fairness of a transaction 87 years old, with the circumstances of which they cannot reasonably be supposed to have any acquaintance. Though the deeds are apparently voluntary upon their face, yet parol evidence would be admissible to prove a valuable consideration to support them and rebut the fraud. Sugden on Vendors, 473, (American edi. of 1836, vol. 2, p. 200;) <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>Cowp. 278. How, if this might be established by evidence, it may be presumed from lapse of time, which supplies the place of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\"With these views, I am still of opinion to afiirm the decree in the supplemental cause. But some other questions have been pressed upon me, which I waived upon the former hearing as unnecessary to be decided, but which it seems desirable to pronounce upon, as we are not unanimous upon the point which I have disrcussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The question as to the effect of the marriage of the-voluntary donees is the first that I shall notice. It has been very satisfactorily treated by my Brother <em>Parker,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and by our former able associate, Judge <em>Carr. </em>They have shewn, that upon principle and authority, the intermarriage with a voluntary donee renders the transaction valid. Their able views will render unnecessary any thing more than a few general remarks on the-subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Marriage, from the earliest times, has been considered in law a valuable consideration1! On the part of the-husband it is peculiarly so, as he is responsible for the-debts of the wife. Hence, it is beyond question that if a father makes a gift to his daughter in marriage, the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>property given shall forever after be protected against the creditors of the father, how much soever he may have been indebted, provided it was under no specific lien. If, for instance, the slaves in question had been given by Clendenin to his daughters upon their marriage, Huston could have ho pretension to charge the property itself, or them or their husbands in respect of it. The real question then is, whether, if the marriage would protect the gift out and out against a creditor, it will fail of that effect in relation to that partial interest which, in contemplation of law, and by the operation of the statute, is, in case of a voluntary gift, left in the donor for the benefit of creditors ? Upon the reason of the thing, there would seem to be little room for doubt. So long as the whole shall he held to he greater than a part, so long must it he held that marriage with a fraudulent donee must extinguish the creditor\u2019s right to charge the property, if a gift out and out at the time of the marriage would he protected by it. Upon authority the matter seems to have been long and well settled. Thus, in <em>Prodgers </em>v. Langham, 1 Sidd. 138, the father created a trust to raise a fund to support his daughter till marriage, and to portion her if she married one Poulson. She did not marry him, hut <em>another, </em>unacceptable to the father. The father then sold the land, thus charged, to a third person. It was decided that if he had sold before the marriage, the trust in favour of the daughter would have been held void; but that although it was void in its creation as to purchasers, yet as the marriage had taken effect, the first settlement no longer remained voluntary, as it was in its creation, but was upon valuable consideration and unavoidable, since the marriage was an advancement of the daughter, and of him who should he induced to marry her by that provision. This is a leading case, and said in 9 Ves. 193, to have been long considered good law. So in <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>Prec. in Ch. 275, 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Bac. Abr. 317, a voluntary settlement on a son, followed by a subsequent marriage, was held to be thereby made good and valid, and it was declared it ought to pe congi(jere\u00bf as made at the time of the marriage. go in <em>East India Company </em>v. <em>Clavell, </em>Prec. in Ch. 377, 3 Bac. Abr. 315, a voluntary settlement for raising a portion for a daughter, though in its creation invalid, yet was held to be rendered valuable and unavoidable by a subsequent marriage. See also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>5 Ves. 862. In <em>Sterry </em>v. <em>Arden, </em>1 Johns. Ch. R. 261, affirmed unanimously by the court of errors, the cases are reviewed by Chancellor Kent, and he comes to the same conclusion. There the deed to the daughter was voluntary; but it was held that her subsequent mamage <em>\u201c </em>changed the character of the previous settlement, and placed her in the light of a purchaser for valuable consideration.\u201d Principle and authority thus seem to me to concur in sustaining the proposition that the mamage of the daughters in this case rendered the gifts, if voluntary before marriage, good and unassailable afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">It is said, however, that if the fraudulent donees had sold the slaves before marriage, they would have become personally responsible for the value; and that if marriage is a purchase, they must <em>pari ratione </em>be responsible, as by their act they have placed the property beyond the reach of the creditors: and then it is said the husbands, having taken them <em>cum, onere, </em>are , bound for the value of the property thus slipped from the grasp of the creditors. If this be so, the principle which protects the marital rights is of no value: \u201cit keeps the word of promise to the ear, and breaks it to the hope.\u201d If the property is protected against creditors by the marital rights on the one hand, the husband is made liable to its value on the other. What then does he gain by it ? Of what value is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>'institution of these perplexing enquiries, if in every event he must be charged with the debt?</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">But is the principle such as is contended for? Does the daughter become debtor by the marriage? Is she considered as selling, and the husband as purchasing the property <em>from her? </em>By no means. <em>She </em>is considered as purchasing from her father by the act of marriage. The valuable consideration enures to make that conveyance valuable which before was voluntary. 'The property may not be, from some cause, in the wife\u2019s possession at the time of the marriage. If they \u25a0sue for it, the suit is brought by both, as in <em>Sterry </em>v. <em>Arden. </em>If she dies, her husband must administer, and recover in the character of administrator, as m <em>East India Company </em>v. <em>Clavell, </em>before cited. He, then, is not a purchaser from his wife: she has not parted with her right but by operation of law, and has not therefore incurred any responsibility whatever, for the protection afforded to the property by the marital rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that on this ground also the'supplemental bill was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Another question has been made as to the power of attorney, and its effect as an equitable mortgage. As to that, I shall only say that as this court seems to have recognized the case of <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmaniere\u2019s </em>adm'rs, I shall of course bow with deference to its decision. It is, however, in entire conflict with my own opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">As to the bond, it clearly does not bind the heirs, and as this is not a bill to marshal assets,, the enquiry as to the real estate was unnecessary and erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">These errors occur in the proceedings in the original cause, which should therefore be herein corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">The decree entered by the Court of Appeals was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u201c The court is of opinion that whatever might have been the character, in its origin, of the transfer of the slaves sought to be subjected to the plaintiff\u2019s demand by the supplemental bill, it was rendered good and available against creditors and purchasers upon the marriage of the daughters, who thereupon were to be considered as purchasers by relation for valuable consideration. The court is therefore of opinion that there was no error in dismissing the supplemental bill; but considering that by the appeal of Huston\u2019s administrator the original proceedings, as well as the supplemental bill, were brought up to this court, and proceeding to examine the same, they are further of opinion that there is error in the said original bill and the proceedings thereupon, in the following particulars : 1st, In considering the power of attorney in the proceedings mentioned, as having the effect of an equitable mortgage, and as creating a charge upon the land; this court being of opinion that the said power, not having been carried into effect in Clendenin\u2019s lifetime, was utterly revoked by his death, and that all the proceedings for subjecting the 3,000 acres of land in Greenbrier to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s demand were erroneous, and should be set aside, and a reconveyance to the heirs decreed. 2ndly, In directing an account of the real estate; as the bond did not bind the lands, and the bill does not seek to marshal assets. Such an account therefore could avail nothing, and involved the parties in unnecessary costs. Therefore,\u201d1 SO MUCH OF THE DECREE AS DISMISSES THE SUPPLEMENTAL BILL AFFIRMED, AND THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE ORIGINAL CAUSE, SO FAR AS ABOVE DECLARED TO BE ERRONEOUS,. REVERSED, WITH COSTS TO THE APPELLEES AS THE PARTIES SUBSTANTIALLY PREVAILING. AND CAUSE REMANDED BOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO THE FOREGOING. OPINION AND DECREE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\"> Judge <em>Parker </em>died before this report was prepared, and his-opinion never came to the reporter\u2019s hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
