At the trial of the issues, the defendant offered to introduce his brother, Nelson Parrish, as a witness, to prove that the slave in question belonged to the estate of the defendant\u2019s and the witness\u2019s father, of whom the defendant was the administrator, and in that character claimed and had taken possession of the slave. And the witness being a distributee of the father\u2019s estate, the defendant, to shew that he had now no interest in the slave, exhibited a deed from the witness to him, duly recorded in the County Court of Louisa, whereby Nelson Parrish, the witness, in consideration of 475 dollars, bargained and sold to Humphrey Parrish, the defendant, \u201c all his, Nelson\u2019s, right, title and interest, of every kind, real and personal, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>.and to the estate of their deceased father,\u201d and warranted \u201c the same free from the claims of all persons whatever.\u201d The plaintiff objected to the competency of the witness, because he had conveyed to the defendant his interest in the slave in question, if he was parcel of his father\u2019s estate, and had warranted his title by the conveyance.

The action was <em>trespass de bonis asportatis, </em>to recover the value of a slave. The defendant, Humphrey Parrish, insisted that the slave belonged to his father\u2019s estate, of which he was the administrator, and he called his brother Helson to prove it. The objection to the competency of the witness was, that he was interested as a distributee; to obviate which, a deed from him to Humphrey was produced, conveying all his interest in his father\u2019s estate to him, so that he had parted with all interest as distributee. But in the deed he gives a general warranty of all the right conveyed; and it is contended, that he is liable to make good the loss to Humphrey, if the plaintiff recovers, and so is interested in protecting the defendant by his testimony. I do not think so. If the defendant loses the slave, it will be because the witness\u2019s <em>father </em>had no title to him; and if <em>he </em>had not, then the <em>witness </em>had none, and so the conveyance and the warranty had no reference to that slave. Por he sold no specific property <em>nomi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>natim </em>or by description; but only <em>his right,, title and' interest in the estate. </em>What he had no right, title or interest in, or what was in fact no part of the estate-, he did not <em>sell, </em>and ot course did not <em>warrant;: </em>for- the warranty cannot be larger than the grant. Though the language of this warranty seems general, yet it is, in effect, but a warranty against the vendor and all claiming under him, of <em>such </em>right and title as-- he had in his father\u2019s estate. He did not warrant this slave or any other property to be part of his father\u2019s estate. On the contrary, the very terms, of the deed, that he sold \u201call <em>his right, title-and interest,\u201d </em>exclude the idea of his selling any thing <em>more than he had a right to, </em>and of course exclude the idea of his warranting ahy thing;. Then, not having warranted the title of his father to-this slave, he would not be responsible for his loss, and so is disinterested. The warranty was designed,, not to insure the goodness of the <em>father\u2019s </em>title, but to secure the vendee against any prior conveyance or incumbrance of his own right and title.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The witness was therefore improperly excluded, and. there-must of course be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">The other judges concurred. Judgment revers^ED, AND CAUSE SENT BACK FOR. A. NEW TRIAL,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
