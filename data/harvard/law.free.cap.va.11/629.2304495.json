The defendant pleaded, <em>conditions performed; </em>upon which an issue was made up. The jury found a verdict for the relator, and assessed his damages by reason of the breach alleged, to 349 dollars 80 cents, with interest on 335 dollars 54 cents part thereof from the 1st January, 1816, till paid.

Upon the application of the defendant, this court allowed him a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b650-5\"><em>Morson, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK1\">The action was, substantially, an action for a <em>tort; </em>an action to recover damages for an official malfeasance of the sheriff; for a false return made by his deputy upon a <em>fieri facias </em>sued out by the relator. The statute gives this action of debt on the sheriff\u2019s bond, in order to secure redress to the relator for the officer\u2019s default, but it does not convert the relator\u2019s claim to damages for the tort, which is its real nature, into a claim for breach of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tract; the measure of damages should he the same as in an action on the case brought for the <em>tort. </em>The rule is stated by Lord Mansfield in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>2 Burr. 1087, that in <em>trespass </em>or <em>tort, </em>the damages should be estimated only up to the time of the wrong complained of; and this court approved the hule in <em>Brugh </em>v. <em>Shanks, 5 </em>Leigh, <em>598. </em>Here, the verdict and the judgment first give the relator excessive damages for the <em>tort, </em>and then give him interest thereon, retrospective and prospective; but it is the continuing interest that constitutes the sheriff\u2019s chief grievance. The declaration shews the <em>data </em>by which the amount of damages may be exactly ascertained; and, by the relator\u2019s own shewing, the utmost he could have had a right to recover, was 326 dollars 7 cents, with interest on 312 dollars 21 cents, part thereof, from the 1st January, 1816, to the fourth Monday in August, 1821; that be.ing the utmost of his loss by reason of the sheriff\u2019s default, at the time it was committed, since that was the utmost amount of his execution on which the false return was made.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I say this was the utmost extent of his claim to damages against the sheriff; for the recovery against the sheriff does not vest the property in the execution in him; the relator may still pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the original debtor, and so, perhaps, recover double satpsfac^011i wouid pe most unreasonable to give him running interest during the whole time of his long delay bring bis action; a delay which may have jeoparded, Pei\u2019^aPs ren&amp;ered wholly unavailing, the defendant\u2019s remedy over for indemnity. Besides, neither the sheriff nor his deputy enjoyed the use of the money; the relator\u2019s claim supposes that it was not in fact collected, though with proper official diligence it might have been. Supposing the debt wholly lost to the relator, the sheriff is no more bound to pay him running interest upon it in damages than an executor, who by negligence has lost a debt due to his testator\u2019s estate, which by due diligence he might have recovered, is \u2022chargeable with interest on the debt he has so lost, blow, an executor in such case, is only chargeable with the principal lost; as was held by this court in <em>Colston </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>(which has not been reported.) So, an attorney by whose neglect debts placed in his hands for collection are lost, is only chargeable with the princi- \u25a0 pal; <em>Hootes </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>2 Leigh 650. Interest on unliquidated damages for a <em>tort </em>never can be proper.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b652-4\"><em>G. N. </em>and <em>C. Johnson, </em>for defendant m error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2RV\">A sheriff covenants by his official bond to execute and make due return of all process to him directed, and when he makes a false return he breaks that covenant, and is responsible in damages for a breach of contract: the statute gives the party injured an action for the breach of contract. He ought to make compensation for the whole loss sustained by the party injured thereby. The loss to the relator, in this instance, was the loss of the money due upon his execution, and of the use of that money for years, in other words, of the interest of the money. And the statute expressly provides, that \u201cin all actions founded on contracts, and tried before a jury, the jury shall ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>principal sum due, and fix the period from which, interest shall commence, if interest be allowed by them; and judgment shall he given accordingly, carrying on the interest till the judgment be satisfied;\u201d 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128, \u00a7 80, p. 508. Ro bill of exceptions having been filed to shew the state of facts proved at the trial, the judgment should be sustained, if in any possible state of facts the verdict might have been right; as if it appeared that the sheriff had in fact received the whole amount due on the relator\u2019s execution at the very time he made the false return of <em>nulla bona, </em>then surely he ought to have been charged with interest till he should make payment. If it be said, that the declaration does not allege that the sheriff collected the money, yet, by the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>the verdict cures the omission of such averment; it cures the omission of the averment of matter without proving which the jury ought not to have given such verdict. Id. \u00a7 103, p. 511, 512. At any rate, the verdict and judgment, if the court shall think them excessive, may he corrected, by requiring the relator to release the excess and. the continuing interest, or giving judgment for the just amount, including the interest, as was done in <em>Brugh </em>v. <em>Shanks.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-4\"><em>Mor son, </em>in reply. The statute which authorizes juries to give continuing interest, applies only to actions founded on contracts, <em>where a principal sum is due, </em>and cannot be tortured into a warrant for giving interest on unliquidated damages for an official malfeasance of a sheriff, or for any other <em>tort. </em>As to the statute <em>of jeofails; </em>this is an action not for vindictive damages, but for compensation for the loss sustained by reason of the sheriff\u2019s default complained of; and a greater recovery than the wrong complained of in the declaration warrants, is just as erroneous as the recovery, in an action for a liquidated demand, of more</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>than the plaintiff claims in his declaration; and in cageg the error is equally apparent on the record. The case of <em>Brugh </em>v. <em>Shanks </em>is a clear authority to this point.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-5\">To shew this, the counsel submitted the following statement, which the court afterwards adopted:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\u201cOriginal debt due Nov. 7, 1812, - - $400 00 \u201cInterest to Jan. 1, 1816, say 3 years 2 months, - 76 00 476 00 \u201c Credit payment made Jan. 1, 1816, - - 163 79 \u201c Balance due that day, ... 31221 \u201c Add the costs, - - - - 13 86 $326-07</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">\u201cAdd interest on $312 21 from Jan. 1, 1816, to the 4th Monday in August, 1821, the return day of the execution-; this shews the utmost amount of the execution, and therefore the utmost amount of damages which the creditor sustained by the false return.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aa5\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AxKn\">The amount which the relator was entitled to recover, according to the claim alleged in his declaration, was the amount due upon his execution at the return day thereof; and the jury should have found that amount for him in damages, and no-interest on such damages should have been allowed by the verdict, or given by the judgment of the court. Therefore, the judgment must be reversed with costs. But the error may be corrected without a new trial,, if the relator will release the excess he has recovered beyond what he was .entitled to; and the court will give him an opportunity to make the proper correction. Therefore, the court will remand the cause to-the Circuit Superior Court for a new trial to be had therein, unless the relator shall release the damages found for him by the verdict, except as to the sum of 326 dollars 7 cents with interest on 312 dollars 21 cents part thereof from the 1st January, 1816, till the 4th Monday in August, 1821, in which case judgment shall be entered for him accordingly with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded with THE DIRECTIONS INDICATED IN THE OPINION.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
