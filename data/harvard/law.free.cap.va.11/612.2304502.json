At June rules, an attachment<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> was sued out, directed to the coroner, to attach the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>goods to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s demand, returnable to-<em>rules\u2022 </em>which was returned, \u201cexecuted on a silver candlestick.\u201d At July rules, the plaintiff filed her declaration; and the defendant not appearing to' replevy the attached effects, a conditional judgment for the plaintiff was entered in the office, unless the' defendant should appear and plead at the August rules. The defendant still failing to appear at the August rules, the conditional judgment was then confirmed, and a writ of inquiry of damages awarded to be executed at the next term. But at the next term, in September, 1835, <em>on the defendant\u2019s motion, </em>the attachment was quashed, the proceedings consequent upon it set aside, and the case sent back to the rules: for further proceedings there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-4\">The plaintiff, at October rules, sued out an <em>alias </em>summons, returnable the next rule day; on which the coroner returned, \u201cnot found, and a copy left on the-side board in the defendant\u2019s dwelling house on Biiday the 30th October;\u201d so that the copy of the process was not left ten days before the return day, as the statute in such cases requires. Yet at November rules, the defendant not appearing, a conditional judgment was entered for the plaintiff against him,, unless he should appear and plead at the next rules;, and at December rules, the defendant still failing to-appear, the conditional judgment was confirmed, and a writ of inquiry of damages awarded. The writ of inquiry was executed at April term, 1836:; the jury assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages to 277 dollars with interest, &amp;c., and the court gave h,er judgment accordingly. The defendant Wynn applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-5\">The cause was first argued in December, 1839\u2019, by <em>Spooner </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Allison </em>for the-defendant; and the court then reversed the judgment,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>and remanded the case to the Circuit Superior Court to be there further proceeded in; but in March, 1840, on the motion of <em>C. </em>and G. <em>N. Johnson </em>for the defendant in error, the court set aside the judgment of reversal, and directed another argument. In the mean time, however, the certificate of the judgment of reversal had been sent by the clerk of this court to the Circuit Superior Court, and thus the case was now in that court. Whereupon this court made the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\">\u201c On the motion of the defendant in error by her counsel, and it appearing to the court, that the judgment of reversal rendered in this court in December,, 1839, was, by a subsequent order made in March last, set aside, for the purpose Of having a rehearing of the whole matter in the cause, and it further appearing that before the last recited order was made, the transcript of the judgment aforesaid was improvidently <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> certified to the said Circuit Superior Court, and the cause remitted to the said court, it is ordered, that the same be recalled and revoked, and it is further ordered, that the said Circuit Superior Court from all further proceedings in the said cause under the judgment aforesaid do altogether surcease, until the further order of this court. And it further appearing to. the court, that the plaintiff in error is not an inhabitant of this state, and that at the former hearing he was represented by counsel, it is further ordered, that a service of this order upon his said counsel shall be deemed and taken to be a sufficient service.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">Upon the second argument, Spooner, for the plaintiff in error, objected, 1. That it nowise appeared by the record, that the summons was the proper process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in the action; in othei\u2019. words, that Wynn, the defen^elow, wag a person against whom the statute authorized the proceeding by summons; and if the summons was illegal, the defendant was not bound to appear upon it; and the proceedings should, therefore, be reversed from the beginning. 2. That the proceedings at June rules, 1835, upon the return of the first summons, were altogether irregular; for the coroner\u2019s return thereupon did not shew, that the summons was served ten days before the return day, or indeed that it was duly served at all according to the provisions of the statute; and instead of an attachment against the defendants for failing to appear, an <em>alias </em>summons should have been sued out.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The attachment was therefore properly quashed. 3. That the subsequent proceedings at the rules -were also irregular; because upon the <em>alias </em>summons then issued, the coroner\u2019s return shewed distinctly that the process was not served ten days before the return day; the copy of it was left at the defendant\u2019s dwelling house on the 30th October, 1835, and the return day was the nest rule day, namely, the first Monday in November. Therefore, instead of entering a conditional judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>for the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at November rules a <em>pluries </em>summons should have been issued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b637-5\"><em>C. </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9h\">said, 1. That the court must, in this case, presume, that Wynn was a person against whom Wyatt\u2019s administratrix might commence her action by <em>summons; </em>for as he appeared in court to have the proceedings at the rules corrected, and could then have objected to the <em>\u25a0summons, </em>and had that process quashed if it was irregular, but only objected to the <em>attachment </em>and the proceedings thereupon, it was plain enough that the propriety of the <em>summons </em>could not have been contested. Besides, if the summons was not the proper process, the error was in the defendant\u2019s favour; it allowed him a privilege to which he was not entitled. He had no reason, and therefore no right, to complain. 2. They admitted that the proceedings at- the rules on the return of the first summons were irregular; and whether they were so or not, they were set aside by an interlocutory order of the court, from which no appeal lay, and which the defendant in error could not now question here. But, 3, they contended, that. Wynn in fact appeared to the action. He appeared in court to have the proceedings at the rules corrected; he had, therefore, full notice of the action. The only purpose of the summons was to give him such notice. After he had appeared in court, and had the case sent back to the rules, \u2019there was no necessity to issue a new summons to give him notice of the action which he already had; and the plaintiff might have proceeded against him at the rules, as against a defendant who had appeared but failed to plead, and so might have taken judgment against him by <em>nil dicit. </em>The conditional judgment was, indeed, entered by the clerk for the failure of the defendant <em>to appear and plead; </em>but the failure to <em>plead </em>after appearance equally warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the conditional judgment; and the mistaken entry of faj\u00a1ure f0 <em>appear </em>could not vitiate the proceeding. This was, in effect,, a judgment by <em>nil dicit, </em>and all errors were cured by the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 128, \u00a7 103, p. 512.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-4\"><em>Spooner, </em>in reply, maintained that Wynn\u2019s appearance in term, to have the proceedings at the rules corrected, upon the ground of the irregularity of the process, could not be tantamount to regular process, nor could an appearance in term be an appearance to the action at the rules. But if the appearance in term could be so regarded, it might have authorized a rule upon him to plead, but not this office judgment against him for default of appearance and plea.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-4\"> It did. not appear <em>by the recoi'd, </em>why the plaintiff proceeded by <em>summons </em>instead of suing out a <em>capias ad respondendum, </em>or why the process was directed to the <em>coroner </em>instead of the <em>sheriff. </em>But the reason no doubt was, that the defendant was the <em>sheriff. </em>The coroner was, therefore, the proper officer to serve the <em>process, </em>by the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 81, p. 292-3. And by another statute, Id., ch. 128, \u00a7 68, p. 506, it is provided, that \u201cin all actions or suits which may be commenced against the governor of the commonwealth, any member of the privy council, any of the judges of the Superior Courts, or the <em>sheriff </em>of any county during his continuance in office, <em>instead of the ordinary process, </em>a <em>summons </em>shall be directed to the sheriff, <em>or other proper officer, </em>reciting the cause of action, and commanding him to summon such defendant to appear and answer the same on the proper return day; and if such defendant, being summoned, or <em>after a copy shall be left at his usual place of abode, ten days before the return day, </em>shall not appear to answer the same, the court shall proceed against such defendant in the same manner as if he had been taken upon a <em>capias ad respondendum.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b633-5\"> The <em>rules </em>are held in the clerk\u2019s office on the first Monday in \u00abevery month. 1 Rev.

Code, ch. 128, $ 61. But a return of <em>non est inventus </em>is not a due return of a summons of this kind; for if the defendant \u25a0cannot be found, the proper service of such process is to leave a copy at the defendant\u2019s dwelling ten days before the return day.

Hyde, which was heard before four judges of this court, who were equally divided in. opinion, and so the judgment there was affirmed. In that case, <em>Tucker, </em>P. said: \u201cIf the defendant was a private individual, it was not competent to sue him by <em>summons, </em>and he could not he in default for failing to appear upon illegal process. The judgment being by default, the process is part of the record; and as it does not appear, that the defendant was an officer who must be sued by <em>summons, </em>we cannot presume him to have been so; and if not, then he was not bound to appear. But suppose we may presume him to have been a privileged person within the statute, then the service of the process ten days before the return day ought to have appeared; else, he was in no default. But this does not appear. Therefore, the judgment is erroneous.\" But it did not appear in that case (as it did in this) that the defendant had appeared in the cause, in any way or for any purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b638-5\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUq\">I think the objection, that it does not expressly appear by the record that Wynn was a person against whom it was proper to commence the action by <em>summons, </em>is of no avail. The substitution of the <em>summons </em>instead of the ordinary process of <em>capias, </em>is a privilege given by statute to certain officers, when they are sued. If a defendant be not strictly entitled to the privilege, no wrong can be done him by conceding it to him, but rather a favour. A defendant not entitled to the privilege might probably object to the extension of it to him, and by declining it, have the process set aside for irregularity; but if he suffers the case to proceed upon the summons, he must be considered as admitting that he is a person liable to be sued by such process, or if not, as acquiescing in the privilege it concedes to him. In either view, the objection, to the process ought not to be regarded as just cause to impeach the judgment rendered upon it. Besides, in this case, Wynn, the defendant below, havipg expressly objected to the regularity of the process of <em>attachment, </em>without making any objection to the <em>summons, </em>the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>plication is inevitable, either that he was a person against whom the summons was the proper process, or if he was not, that he waived obj eetion .on that head.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The award of the attachment on the return made upon the first summons, and the proceedings at the rules upon the return of the attachment, were confessedly irregular; nor is it to be doubted, that the court was right in quashing the attachment, setting aside the proceedings consequent upon it, and sending the cause back to the rules for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In the subsequent proceedings at the rules, an <em>alias </em>summons was issued, the return upon which shewed, clearly, that the process was not duly executed, and yet an office judgment was entered against the defendant for failing to appear and plead, and a writ of inquiry of damages was awarded. The writ of inquiry was executed at the ensuing term. There could be no-default of appearance, unless the summons was returned duly served. The clerk, I presume, through mistake, supposed that the return upon the summons-shewed that it was duly served, and entered the office judgment, and the award of the writ of inquiry, in consequence of that mistake; But as the summons was not duly served, there was no warrant for entering the office judgment and awarding the writ of inquiry; and those proceedings are erroneous, if there be no other foundation for them than the supposed default of appearance <em>at the rules.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">It has, however, been earnestly insisted, that \"Wynn\u2019s appearance in term, to have the attachment quashed,, and the proceedings consequent upon it set aside, was an unqualified appearance to the action, which superseded the necessity of other process; and that when the case returned to the rules, the plaintiff below, without further process, was entitled to judgment for the defendant\u2019s failure to plead. It might be a sufficient answer to say, 1. That, if the defendant\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>pearanee in term, to have the previous proceedings at rujeg cori.ected, dispensed with the necessity of further process, the plaintiff, by suing out the new process, waived the benefit of that dispensation; and 2. That the judgment entered at the rules was not a judgment for the defendant\u2019s failure to plead after his appearance, but for his failure to appear after process served. But, apart from these considerations, was the defendant\u2019s appearance in term for such a purpose, an appearance to the action, which dispensed with further process, and subjected him to a judgment by <em>nil dicit, </em>and to the consequences of such a judgment? It was not so understood by the plaintiff, by the clerk, by the defendant, or by the court: not by the plaintiff*, for upon the return of her case to the rules, she sued out new process, not by the clerk, for he founded the subsequent proceedings at rules upon the return of the <em>alias </em>summons, under an erroneous opinion that the return shewed due service of that process: not by \u25a0the defendant, else he would hardly have let judgment pass by <em>nil dicit, </em>and a writ of inquiry be executed, whereby any claim which the plaintiff might have set up, however inconsistent with that mentioned in the process, might have been conclusively charged upon him: not by the court, for it set aside the previous proceedings, because the attachment was irregular process, and when, after quashing the attachment, it sent the case back to the rules for further proceedings, the further proceedings plainly indicated, were .such as the plaintiff ought to have taken instead of suing out the attachment; that is, as the first summons was not duly served, the issuing of an <em>alias. </em>The ai\u2019gument then, is, that the defendant\u2019s appearance in term, and motion to quash the attachment, though not so intended by him, nor so understood by the plaintiff, or by the clerk, or by the court, was, <em>propria vigore, </em>and, necessarily, an unconditional appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>anee to the a'etion which dispensed with further process. The proposition is not sustained by any prineipie or analogy. -It is of common occurrence, that a motion for award of execution on a forthcoming bond, is resisted on the ground that due notice of the motion has not been given; yet, in my experience, it has never even been pretended, that such an appearance dispenses with due notice of the motion, to be made at a subsequent term: but if the argument for the defendant in error here were well founded, then, in every such case, the court would treat the appearance to resist award of execution for want of due notice of the motion, as dispensing with further notice, at least in respect to a motion to be afterwards made; and when the actual notice was found defective, though execution might not be presently awarded upon it, the motion would yet be docketed as one to be afterwards made, as upon notice dispensed with by. the party\u2019s appearance. The argument presents the singular dilemma, that a party cannot free himself from the present or past effect of erroneous process, without forfeiting his right to exemption from judgment until proper process shall be sued and duly served upon him. It would subject him to judgment without any future regular process, as the consequence of his objecting the nullity and irregularity of past process.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">My opinion is, that the appearance of the defendant in term, and his motion to quash the attachment irregularly issued, and to set aside the proceedings at rules founded upon it, was not an appearance to the action, dispensing with further and proper process; that the award of the <em>alias </em>summons was proper and necessary; and that the proceedings on that subsequent process cannot be sustained, since, confessedly, it was not duly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Cabell, J. concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"ALu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ACt\">It is conceded, that the first proceed-ngg were jrregular, and that the office judgment which had been entered at September term, 1835, was properly set aside. The plaintiff then sued out a new summons, but that never was duly served; and yet she proceeded against the defendant for not appearing, and took a common order against him by default for want of an appearance. This was wrong, because the defendant was under no obligation to appear, since the process was not served in due time according to law. The common order then being wrong, the office judgment founded upon it was also erroneous, as were also the subsequent proceedings. But it is now contended, that the motion to quash the attachment and send the cause to the rules, was an appearance. I think not, for the reasons given by Judge <em>Stanard. </em>But if it was, the plaintiff waived her first process, \u2022and the proceedings under it, when she took out the second process; and, moreover, if there was an appearance, there could have been no common order for want of one, but a rule should have been given to plead. In every aspect of the case, then, the proceedings are erroneous, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The proceedings up to the return of the <em>alias </em>summons must be set aside; and the cause remanded to the Circuit Superior Court, to be sent back to the rules, where the plaintiff may sue out a <em>pluries </em>sum-summons, if she shall think proper so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
