Brent, wife of the aforesaid; William, has agreed, in consideration of a proper provision and settlement to be made upon her, and for her sole and separate use and behoof, free from all manner of control on the part of' her said husband, to sell, convey and surrender her right of dower in and to all the real estate of her aforesaid husband, consisting of various large tracts of land, and various houses and lots in the city of Richmond, and the towns of Manchester, Fredericksburg and Alexandria, and elsewhere ; and has relinquished her right of dower in a large real estate sold by the said William unto one W. H. Fitzhugh, to enable the said William, out of the proceeds of the sale of the same, to discharge and satisfy large debts due and owing by him to various persons, and which purchase money has been applied to that object; and whereas, the said William has, in pursuance of the agreement aforesaid, made upon the aforesaid consideration, heretofore by deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of bargain and sale, bearing date tbe 5th day of May, and now of record in the office of tbe County Court of Stafford, conveyed unto tbe aforesaid Philip Harrison and John M.

All of them bore date the 17th of June, 1822, and were duly admitted to record in the office of Stafford County Court on the following day. That which was first executed and acknowledged by William Brent, and first admitted to record, contained a recital substantially the same with that in the deed admitted to record on the 17th of June; it recited also that Brent and wife, by their deeds of even date therewith, had granted to Eliza J. Carrington an annuity or rentcharge of 666 dollars 67 cents, and to John Moncure and Hancock Eustace, in trust for Adelaide Elwes, an annuity or rentcharge of 250 dollars,, both of which were charged upon and to issue out of\" a tract of land in Stafford county, containing 824 acres; and then, in consideration of the premises, and of one dollar paid to the grantors, it conveyed to Harrison and Conway the said tract of 824 acres (subject to the said annuities or rentcharges) upon a trust for the separate use of Winifred L. Brent, similar to that contained in the said deed recorded on the 17th of June. But the trustees were authorized, for the purpose of extinguishing the annuities, to make sale of the land conveyed to them, except a part lying within certain specified bounds, and containing 337 acres; and the surplus proceeds of such sale, after extinguishing the annuities, were to be applied by the trustees in payment of such debts of William Brent, secured by the two other trust deeds of the 17th of June (to be presently mentioned), as should remain unpaid. It was also provided that if the provision for the said Wini-fred, made by this and the previous deeds to Harrison and Conway, in lieu and satisfaction of her right of dower in the real estate of the said William Brent,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>should, coutraiy to the opinion and expectation of the parties, upon legal investigation and decision he deemed excessive, the trustees should make sale of such excess, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the debts secured by the other deeds aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">By the deed which was next in the order of execution, acknowledgment, and admission to record, Brent :and wife conveyed to John Macrae and Walter Jones a tract of land in Stafford county, containing 499 acres, and several other lots and parcels of land, constituting in the whole a large and valuable property, upon trust to make sale of the same, and apply the proceeds in payment of certain debts of William Brent, which were specified in the deed and in a schedule annexed thereto. The debts specified in the deed itself were to be paid first, in a certain order; and after they should be fully satisfied, the surplus of the proceeds of sale was to be applied in the ratable payment of the debts mentioned in the schedule. Among these was a debt stated to be due to Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, by a judgment recovered in the Superior Court of Law for Stafford county, -amounting to about 7,500 dollars. The deed provided also that the trustees <em>\u201c </em>shall pay and satisfy any other debts for which the said William Brent or his estate may be liable, if any there be not included in the schedule hereto annexed, and of which he the said William will furnish a schedule hereafter.\u201d And there was a further provision that the trustees should hold the surplus, if any, after payment of the said debts, to the sole and separate use of Winifred L. Brent, in the manner specified in the deeds already mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">The last of the deeds in the order of execution, acknowledgment, and admission to record, was one by which Brent and wife conveyed and assigned to Philip Harrison certain lots in Richmond and Manchester, .and all other real estate of Brent whatsoever and where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>'soever, not included in any of the deeds already men-Honed, together with all debts of every description due to him, upon trust to sell the real estate and collect the debts, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the same creditors, for securing whose demands the trust deed to Macrae and Jones was executed. This deed contained also the following provision: \u201cAnd moreover the said \"William being desirous of paying and satisfying all his just debts, and apprehending that he may, from forgetfulness, have omitted to place upon the annexed list and schedule all such as may be due and owing by him, it is required that the said Philip, \u25a0out of the trust funds aforesaid which may come to his hands, if sufficient there be, shall pay and satisfy such other claims as may now exist, and may be hereafter placed upon schedules and lists aforesaid, and in such priority as the said William may direct.\u201d The surplus after payment of all the debts was to be held by the trustee for the sole and separate use of Winifred L. Brent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">. In October, 1822, Harrison, Conway, and Mrs. Brent, by Harrison her next friend, filed their bill in flie Superior Court of Chancery held at Fredericksburg, against Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, \"William Brent, and Enoch Mason, the deputy sheriff of Stafford; setting forth the agreement between Mrs. Brent and her husband (to the same effect as recited in the deeds), and the execution of the several deeds of the 5th of May and 17th of June, in pursuance and fulfillment of that agreement; that Mrs. Brent was at all \u2022\u25a0times willing and ready to perform the agreement on her part, and the delay to perform it by executing the \u25a0deeds relinquishing her right of dower, arose without her agency, from her husband\u2019s impression that such delay would not jeopardize the provision made for her, or prejudice her interests, and from the consumption of time in ascertaining and classing his debts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>preparing the deeds; that the defendant Carroll, having obtained a judgment against William Brent at the preceding May term of the Superior Court of Law for Stafford county, for \u00bf61,340 13. 1. sterling, with-interest from the 7th of June, 1816, and costs of suit, had, on the 13th of June, 1822, sued out a <em>fieri facias' </em>thereon, which on the 15th of the same month was delivered to the defendant Mason, the deputy sheriff; that Carroll, pretending that the deeds of settlement on Mrs. Brent were fraudulent and void as to him, had urged the said deputy to levy the execution, and the same had accordingly been levied on a part of the slaves and other property settled, which had been advertised for sale by the sheriff*. The bill prayed that Carroll and the deputy sheriff might be restrained frem further proceedings under the execution, and that the property levied on might be restored to- the possession of Mrs. Brent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-11\">An injunction was awarded according to the prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-12\">The answer of Brent conformed to the statements made in the bill. Mason failing to answer, the bill was taken pro <em>confesso </em>as to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-13\">Carroll, in his answer, admitted that his execution was sued out, delivered to the sheriff, and levied, as stated in the bill. He insisted that the whole of the transactions between Brent and his wife were fraudulent as to him; that at all events the deed of the 5th May, was not valid, and his execution having been delivered to the sheriff, and a lien thereby acquired on the property in question, before the deeds of the 17th. June were executed, those deeds could not affect the. lien, or give validity to the first deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-14\">The only testimony in the cause was that of a witness who desposed to a conversation held with Mrs. Brent herself, about the end of March or beginning of April, 1822, in which Mrs. Brent stated that her hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>band and herself had made such an agreement as that set forth in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">The cause coming on to be heard the 10th of May, 1823, the Court of Chancery was of opinion that the deed of the 5th of May, as well as the deeds of the 17th of June, were fraudulent and void as against the execution of the defendant Carroll; and therefore dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bill with costs. From which decree' the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-5\"><em>Harrison, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-6\"><em>Morson, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> Of the cases reported in this volume, this is the first which was-argued before Judge <em>Allen.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-7\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjqY\">I am of opinion that the decree of the court below, dissolving the injunction that had been awarded the appellants, and dismissing their bill, is right, and ought to be affirmed. To entitle the appellants to the relief they sought, it behooves them to shew an unexceptionable title, paramount to and overreaching the lien of the creditor whose execution they sought to intercept and defeat. Such title is not shewn.. The conveyance of the 5th of May, standing alone, must, I think, be taken as voluntary and void as to existing creditors. The alleged consideration of that deed is a parol agreement between husband and wife, that the wife should convey her dower interest in certain real estate of her husband, which he intended to devote to the payment of debts. Assuming that such parol agreement, precise and definite in its terms, was distinctly proved to have been made before the execution of the conveyance of the 5th of May, but still remained wholly unexecuted on the part of the wife at the time the lien of the creditor, by force of his judgment and execution levied, attached, the deed, as to such creditor, must be treated as voluntary and without valuable consideration. The agreement, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the ostensible consideration, in no wise bound the an(j -n regpee\u00a3 \u00a30 eyery legal obligation on her, or remedy on the part of the husband or his creditors, was a mere nullity. It is not questioned by me that the dower interest of the wife may constitute a valuable consideration that will support a post-nuptial settlement, and that'such settlement, made in consideration of the conveyance or surrender of such dower interest, may be supported against the claims of creditors. In such case, a consideration passes from the wife beyond recall. In the case of a mere parol unexecuted contract between husband and wife, (if indeed such communications, imposing no - obligation and giving no remedy, can be properly dignified by the' name of contract,) nothing passes from the wife, no obligation is incurred, and no remedy exists to compel her to convey any thing. Value cannot be predicated of that which imposes no obligation and gives no remedy. The deed of the 5th of May, remained in the predicament of a voluntary one, without valuable consideration, when the lien of the creditor, by his judgment, and execution thereon delivered to the sheriff, was consummated; and that lien was in full force, and ought to have full effect, unless it be dislodged by the subsequent deed of the 17th of June. The only way in which that deed can operate that effect, is by connecting it with the deed of the 5th of May; by considering it as supplying that valuable consideration, in the dower rights actually conveyed, of which the deed of the 5th of May was destitute, and by relation giving that deed effect from its date, as one for valuable consideration. This pretension ascribes to the wife, or rather to the husband and wife, (for she could not convey without his concurrence,) the faculty, on their mere volition, to cancel and defeat the lien of the creditor. It would make one of the firmest liens that the creditor can acquire, effectual or nugatory at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the irresponsible will of the debtor. To state such a pretension is to condemn it. The deed of the 17th of June, under the most favourable view, and giving it the utmost effect that a deed of that date can have, did not displace or overreach the lien of the creditor, and gave no just warrant to the Court of Equity to interfere by injunction to arrest the creditor in his course. On this insulated view of this case, and without expressing any opinion on several other objections, taken and very forcibly urged in the argument, to the interference of the Court of Equity in this case (some of which would in all probability equally sustain the opinion I give), I am of opinion that the decree dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill was right, and ought to be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
