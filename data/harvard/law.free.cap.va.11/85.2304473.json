May and Robert <em>K. </em>Jones of the second part, and the president, directors and company of the Bank of Virginia of the third part,\u2014reciting that Haffey was indebted to the bank, at their office of discount and deposit in Peters-burg, upon two accommodation notes negotiable there, each for 1,350 dollars, upon which notes Robert Birchett, Edmund Birchett and Peter Puryear were then the indorsers, and that, it being expected the said sums would be continued from time to time as loans from the bank to Haffey, upon other notes of the same character, indorsed by the said Birchetts and Puryear, or others, he had agreed to secure the payment thereof, and thereby indemnify the said indorsers, or any other or second indorsers,\u2014the same lot conveyed by the former deed for the security of Williamson\u2019s demand was again conveyed to May and Jones, for the purpose of securing the debt due to thebank as aforesaid, with interest and charges thereon. Haffey, for himself and his heirs, covenanted with May and Jones, and the president, directors and company of the Bank of Virginia, respectively, \u201cjointly and severally, that he is possessed of an absolute estate of inheritance in the premises, and that he will warrant and forever defend the same against all persons whatever.\u201d This deed also was duly recorded in the Corporation Court of Petersburg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\">In September, 1824, Birchetts and Puryear filed a' bill in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Richmond district, setting forth, that - Roderick Haffey (who was now dead) was in his .lifetime indebted to them in a balance of account for goods purchased by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the complainants on behalf of themselves and the said A . Haffey jointly, the complainants being, at the time, merchants and partners in trade, and Haffey being \u2022also a merchant and manufacturer; that at the time \u2022of executing the deed of the 25th June, 1823, (which was exhibited with the bill) Haffey owned but one lot \u2022on Sycamore street, although two brick tenements were erected on it, and the said deed was intended to convey, and did convey, the whole lot and both tenements, while the deed for the benefit of Williamson -conveyed only one-half of the lot; that Haffey died leaving three infant children, Margaret, Henry and \u25a0Jane, and his personal estate had been committed to Roger Mallory, s\u00e9ijeant of Petersburg, for administration; that the complainants had been compelled to pay the debt of 2,700 dollars to the bank, with 8 dollars 6 cents for charges of protest, for recovery wherof they had brought an action against Haffey\u2019s administrator, which was yet undetermined; that Haffey\u2019s personal estate would be insufficient to pay the debt; that the moiety of the lot conveyed by the first deed of trust would shortly be sold, and the residue would be the only estate out of which the debts due the complainants could be satisfied. The bill prayed that the heirs and administrator of Haffey, the president, directors and company of the Rank of Virginia, and May the survivor of the two trustees in the deed of the 25th June, 1823, might be made defendants; that the lot might be sold, and the whole debt due the complainants paid; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">The president, directors and company of the Rank \u2022of Virginia, and May the trustee, answered, admitting that Haffey\u2019s debt to the bank had been paid by the complainants as indorsers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The heirs of Haffey, by their guardian assigned <em>ad </em>litem, answered, denying the allegation that their ancestor owned but one lot on Sycamore street; insisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that he held two adjacent lots on that street at the time of his deed to May and Jones, which conveyed but one of them, the same that had been previously conveyed for the security of Williamson\u2019s demand; and claiming the other lot as their own property, free from the claim of the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-3\">As to Haffey\u2019s administrator, the bill was taken <em>pro. confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\">The complainants, having obtained leave to amend their bill and make new parties, accordingly filed an amended bill in December, 1826, in which they stated, that since the institution of this suit, the lot conveyed by the deed for Williamson\u2019s benefit had been sold. under the provisions of that deed, and purchased by Joseph C. Swann; and they impeached the sale, as having been irregularly made. They further insisted, that even if they were mistaken in supposing the whole lot on Sycamore street to have been conveyed by the deed of the 25th June, 1823, yet as that deed was expressly made for the purpose of indemnifying, them as the indorsers of Haffey, they were entitled to the benefit of Haffey\u2019s covenant of warranty entered into with the trustees and the bank, and that covenant having been broken, they might rightfully claim indemnity out of the other portion of the lot, which was the only real estate in the hands of the heirs. To-this bill, the heirs and administrator of Haffey, Thomas-Lambert trustee in the first deed, George Williamson the creditor thereby secured, and Swann the purchaser of the trust property, were made defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">The heirs of Haffey answered, submitting to the court whether the complainants were entitled to the benefit of the warranty contained in the deed to May- and Jones; contending however, that if it could under any circumstances enure to their benefit, yet as they had fall notice of the existence and contents of the prior incumbrance, that incumbrance ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>taken as excepted from the scope and intent of the x 1 1 warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">Swann answered, insisting upon the fairness and regularity of his purchase under the first deed of trust; of which he contended that the complainants had actual notice, inasmuch as one of them, Robert Birehett, was one of the trustees in that deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">Neither Wiliamson nor the administrator of Haffey answered the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">In the progress of the cause, the court made an order referring to a commissioner, for settlement, the accounts between the complainants and Roderick Haffey, the account of Mallory\u2019s administration upon Haffey\u2019s estate, the account of the assets descended to Haffey\u2019s heirs, and the account of the product and application of the fund conveyed in trust by the deed for the benefit of Williamson. By the commissioner\u2019s report it appeared, that there was in the hands of Mallory, the administrator, the sum of 950 dollars 21 cents, due the estate of his intestate: that the real estate claimed by the heirs of Haffey was of the annual value of 800 or 400 dollars: that the proceeds of' the lot conveyed by the first deed of trust amounted to 2,459 dollars 5 cents, of which 2,035 dollars 56 cents, the amount of Williamson\u2019s claim, had been paid to him, and the residue to the complainants; after crediting which, there remained due to the complainants 239 dollars 62 cents on account of their other transactions with Haffey in his lifetime, and 2,746' dollars 11 cents on account of the bank debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">The Circuit Court of Henrico (to which the cause had been regularly transferred) held, that the deed of trust under which the plaintiffs claimed, dated the 25th June, 1823, only conveyed the tenement included in the prior deed of the 7th December, 1822, and that the adjacent tenement was not conveyed by either\u2019 of those deeds; but that the plaintiffs were entitled in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>equity to be substituted to the right of the president, directors and company of the Bank of Virginia under the deed first mentioned, and to have satisfaction out of the real assets descended to the heirs of Haffey, to the extent of the damages sustained, by the plaintiffs under the covenant of warranty in the first deed contained. \"Wherefore the court, confirming the report of the commissioner in all respects, decreed that the administrator of Haffey should pay to the complainants the sum in his hands, due the estate of his intestate; and that unless the heirs of Haffey should, within six months from the date of the decree, pay the complainants so much of the sum of 2,035 dollars 56 cents (the amount paid to Williamson the first incumbrancer) as should be equal to the balance remaining due to them after applying the personal assets in the hands of the administrator of Haffey as aforesaid, the land descended to the said heirs should be sold by commissioners named in the decree, at public auction, for \u2022cash, in order to satisfy that balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-4\">Prom this decree, the heirs of Haffey appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-5\"><em>Spooner, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>May, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-7\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">The only questions of importance in this ease are those which arise out of the warranty in the deed of trust to May and Jones. The effect of that covenant of warranty was to give to the bargainees of the trust premises, in case of eviction, a right of recovery in value from the bargainor if living, or, if he be dead, to charge his heirs for the damages sustained by the breach of covenant, to the value of the assets descended to them. Moreover, in the case of an incumbrance on the land anterior to that in question, the covenant is broken so soon as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Bargainee lias been turned out of possession by the first incumbrancer, or even so soon as he has been - compelled <em>in invitum </em>to pay off the first incumbrance. 2 Lomax\u2019s Dig. 278; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Cutts, </em>4 Mass. Rep. 349. There is no necessity for him to involve himself in a lawsuit, to defend himself against a title which he is satisfied must ultimately prevail. <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>17 Mass. Rep. 586. Tor the covenant to warrant and 'defend implies a covenant-for quiet enjoyment, <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Proprietors of land in Minot, </em>1 Mass. Rep. 464, and it is broken by any lawful disturbance of a third person. In this case, therefore, the rights of the prior incumbrancer having been enforced by sale, and the incumbrance of the bargainees May and Jones thereby altogether defeated, the covenant of warranty may \u25a0well be considered as broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The next question is as to the measure of damages. In case of a sale, the measure is the value at the time \u2022of the sale, and the test of this value is the purchase money. But in case of an incumbrance, this principle can have no application, for price is not a subject \u2022of adjustment in the treaty for a security. Adequacy alone is inquired into. \u2018The true measure of damages, therefore, in case of eviction by superior title, is the value of the mortgaged or trust subject at the time of \u2022eviction, provided it do not exceed the amount of the debt secured;' for it is obvious the creditor can never be damaged to a greater amount than that. If this view of the matter be correct, then it is clear that there is no error herein to the prejudice of the appellants ; for the damages are taken to be 2,035 dollars only, while the debt was 2,700 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">It is said, however, that the right of the parties to \u2022damages for breach of this covenant could only be asr serted at law, and that a Court of Equity could not properly estimate them. As a general principle, this is true; but here the plaintiffs, having no rights but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>editable principle of substitution, could assert no remedy at law. They could only get relief in equity. Moreover, although it is generally true that damages should be inquired of by an issue at law, yet tere that could not be necessary, since the damages were fixed and already certain. The damage was the value of the land lost, and that value was ascertained by what it sold for. The debt of Hafiey to Williamson was paid out of a trust subject to which the second incumbrancers had title, and Hafiey could not complain, nor can his heirs complain, at reimbursing the second incumbrancers to the full value of what has been paid for him to their prejudice. In this view of the matter, an issue must have been superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The decree, however, is erroneous in directing a sale for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">As to' the other errors assigned, there is nothing in them, as they were not made objections in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On the whole, I am of opinion to reverse the decree, as to the direction to sell for cash, and affirm for the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The decree entered in the Court of Appeals was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">\u201c The court is of opinion that the legal effect and operation of the deed of trust from Hafiey to May and Jones, and of the covenant of warranty therein contained, was, to entitle the parties for whose benefit it was executed, or those who might be substituted to their rights, to charge the real assets descended with such damages as may have arisen from a breach of that covenant. The court is further of opinion that the sale of the trust property under an anterior deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of trust was a breach, of the covenant, and that the measure of damages was not (so far at least as the appellants were concerned) improperly fixed at the price for which it sold. The court is further of opinion that as the plaintiffs claim by substitution only, their remedy was properly in a Court of Equity, where only the principles of substitution can be properly enforced. The court, however, is of opinion, that though in this case the long time that would elapse, before the application of the net amount of rents from year to year to the discharge of the appellees\u2019 claim would satisfy it, forbade a resort to that mode of providing the means of satisfying that claim, and justified the court below in accelerating that satisfaction by a sale; yet, in the proper exercise of judicial discretion, the court below ought not to have decreed such sale to be made for cash, but such sale should have been made on a reasonable credit, which in this case is deemed to be a credit of six, twelve and eighteen months for equal instalments of the purchase money.\u201d Therefore, .</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Decree reversed so far as it directs the sale to BE FOR CASH, AND AFFIRMED IN OTHER RESPECTS, WITH COSTS TO APPELLANTS; AND CAUSE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
