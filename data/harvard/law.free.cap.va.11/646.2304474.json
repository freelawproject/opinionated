And then, by their answer, they admitted the facts alleged in the bill, but insisted, that the hoys, Green and Henry, having been horn while their mother was actually held in slavery by their testator, were born his slaves, and so belonged absolutely and for their whole lives to their testator\u2019s estate, and the defendants claimed the right to dispose of them as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">Hpon the hearing at October term, 1836,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the Circuit Superior Court, declaring that the boys, Green and Henry, though horn before their mother attained the age of twenty-one years, <em>were free from their birth, </em>perpetuated the injunction, and decreed, that the defendants should forthwith enlarge and discharge them from their custody, and pay the plaintiff her costs expended in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-7\">The defendants, by petition to this court, prayed an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-8\"><em>May, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbH\">1. The demurrer should have,been sustained, and the bill dismissed, for want of jurisdiction. For, if the fact, that a master intends to sell persons whom he holds as slaves, and the probability that traders may buy them, be sufficient to give jurisdiction to courts of equity, it is obvious, that all pauper suits for freedom may be brought in those courts. And certainly, the mother had no right to sue, in her own name, to recover or to protect the freedom .of her children. 2. The negroes, Green and Henry, were not emancipated by the will of the testator Jordan Anderson, unless the bequest that their mother should be free at her age of twenty-one, had the effect of emancipating her children born before her attain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ment to that age and while she herself was actually a slave. But the children followed the actual condition of their mother at the time of their birth, not the <em>status </em>she was to acquire at a future time. The mother 'was\u2019 a* birth of these children, Nathan Anderson\u2019s slave; and, therefore, they were born his slaves. <em>Maria </em>v. Surbaugh, 2 Rand. 428; <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>4 Rand. 597; <em>M\u2019Cutchen </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>8 Peters, 220, 241.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-4\"><em>Taylor, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayy\">1. As to the objection to the jurisdiction: though these boys were emancipated by the will of Jordan Anderson, their legal right to freedom could never be perfected till the executors assented to the bequest, which they have never done: their right was equitable, and the Court of Chancery was the proper and indeed the only <em>forum </em>to which they could resort. But they were infants; infants held in bondage, for whom the law provided no guardian; surely, then, equity ought to entertain the bill of their mother to protect their rights, which, but for her interference, might have been lost or jeoparded. 2. The effect of the will of Jordan Anderson was to give the woman Patty a <em>present </em>right to freedom, or a right to freedom to commence at his wife\u2019s death; and, at the most, to give the legatee Nathan Anderson a right to her personal services until she should attain to the age of twenty-one, hy way of compensation for <em>raising </em>her, which was imposed on him as a duty. The case is like that of <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>West\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>6 Rand. 652. But, if Patty was a slave at all, she was certainly not Nathan Anderson\u2019s slave; the testator did not bequeath any slave property to him, or to any of his other children. If she was a slave, she belonged to the estate of the testator, and her sons, Green and Henry, were born tbe slaves of his estate; and were emancipated by the bequest, that the two young negroes then with his son Charles and the two then with his son James, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u2022and \u201c all the others,\u201d should be free at twenty-one years of age. The plain intent of the testator was to cipate all his slaves and all their posterity. <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>4 Leigh, 252; <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>9 Leigh, 188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-8\"><em>May, </em>in reply. Let it be conceded, that the slaves were not bequeathed to Nathan Anderson; that is no question in this case. None of the slaves were to be free till they attained the age of twenty-one years; but before Patty was of that age, her sons Green and Henry were born; therefor they wrere born slaves. Whether they belong to the appellants, or whether they passed under the residuary clause of the will, or whether the testator died intestate as to them, are questions that do not arise here. The only question is, whether Patty -was a free woman or a slave when they were born. It is remarkable, that while the testator indicates his intent, that the future <em>increase </em>of Patty\u2019s mother Phillis, and the <em>increase </em>of Amy, of Milly, and of Rachel, shall be free, there is no such provision as to the <em>increase </em>of Patty.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> Neither Green, nor Henry (the hoys whose freedom was in question) were twenty-one years old at the time of the decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b671-9\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqks\">delivered the opinion of the court. The cases of <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>and <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>are decisive in favour of the negroes. Judge <em>Carr </em>remarked, in the first of those cases, that \u201cin the construction of wills, we are to find out the meaning, the intention, the will of the testator, and unless it violates some provision of law, it must be carried into effect.\u201d This is the polar star to guide us in the construction of all wills. The law permits emancipation by will, and where the intention is clear, it must be observed. In the present case, upon the whole will, there would seem to be no doubt of the intention of the testator to emancipate the whole of his slaves. The will intends a disposition of his whole estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>But his slaves are not specifically bequeathed, as slaves, to any person. A limited interest, coupled' with a\u00a1- . charge, is given to the legatees, \u201cthe labour and raising;\u201d with a further restriction as to the slaves in question, that they were not to be removed out of the stat\u00e9, or so far as to deprive them of .their freedom; And after making similar provisions as to other slaves, and the two young negroes, with his sons Charles and James, he directs that they and \u201call the others,\u201d- shall be free at twenty-one years of age. Many of the slaves no doubt exceeded that age at the execution of the will: others might probably attain it before his and his wife\u2019s death; and for those in that condition, he provides that they shall be free on the first of January succeeding the death of himself and wife. Such as-were then under that age were left to the operation of the preceding clauses, which gave their \u201clabour and - raising,\u201d to his sons, and conferred freedom on their attainment of twenty-one. bTo disposition being made of the slaves or their increase, they continued to be the slaves of his estate, and as such were embraced by the comprehensive grant of freedom to <em>all the other slaves </em>of his estate. In the case of <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>the testator directed that all the rest of his slaves should be given to a trustee to take to Liberia. It was contended there, in reference to the increase, that the mothers were slaves at the birth of the children: to w\u2019hieh it was replied by Judges <em>Carr </em>and <em>Tucker, \u201c </em>If the children were born slaves, they were the slaves of the testator, and come within the bequest as well as their mothers.\u201d In <em>Ershine </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>the testator bequeathed all his. estate, real and personal, to R. 0., during her life, and at her death <em>all his negroes </em>to be tree: the court held, that not only the slaves living at his death, but the children born during the life estate, were <em>his slaves, </em>belonged to his estate, and as such were emancipated. The words in the present will are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>equally comprehensive; and the intention not to dispose of any of the slaves as slaves, hut to emancipate all, is equally manifest. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">\u00a5e do not think there is any thing in the objection to the jurisdiction or form of proceedings. Though a testator may emancipate by will, the right to do so is subject to the claim of creditors. The assent of the executors is necessary, and until given, the slaves have no <em>legal </em>title to freedom which could be asserted in an action at law; hence the necessity of an application to a court of equity. The <em>slaves here were infants, bound to service until they attained the age of twenty-one; the legatee and his representatives had a right to the custody of \u2022them. </em>The bill avers an intention to sell; and this allegation is not denied. The executors insist upon their right to hold and dispose of them as absolute \u00ablaves; and if the condition of the estate required it, they would, if their view was correct, be bound, in the proper discharge of their duty, to sell them. If redress could not be afforded by a Court of Chancery, the slaves would be without remedy. On both grounds, it seems to me, the jurisdiction could be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The decree is to be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> The court held, that the hoys Green and Henry were hound to service till they attained to twenty-one years of <em>age; </em>that the representatives of the legatee Nathan Anderson had a right to the custody of them till then. Yet it affirmed the decree of the Circuit Superior Court, which held that they wer <em>&amp; free from their birth, </em>and ordered that they should he forthwith discharged from custody, though neither was then twenty-one years of age. Tile-reason of the <em>general affirm-</em>a-ncejprohahly was, that, at the'time, of the decree of this court, they had hoth attained to that age.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b673-6\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Ho\">dissented: he said\u2014This ca-eis,T think, an important one, since it involves the point decided in the case of <em>Maria </em>v. Surbaugh. There, a testator bequeathed a female slave to his son, with a provision that she should be free at the age of thirty-one years; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>she had children b.orn after the testator\u2019s death and was thirty-one; and the question was, whether these children were born slaves ? or born free ? or persons bound to service for a limited time ? The point had never before been decided; and the court after great consideration held, that they must follow the actual condition of their mother at the time of their birth,, and that as she was then a slave, though she was afterwards to be free, therefore they were born slaves-In the case before us, I think the boys, Green and Henry', born while their mother Patty was a slave though she was to be free at the age of twenty-one,, must b\u00bf held to be slaves until they attain to the age of twenty-one, according to the [particular provisions-of this will. \"In <em>Maria </em>v. <em>Surbaugh, </em>the claim was, that-the children of Maria born before she attained to the age of thirty-one, were free born; and that case wasd\u00e9cided on its merits. Here, it is admitted, that Green and Henry were slaves; and the object of the bill was to protect them from the treatment of their masters till they shall attain to the age of twenty-one, when they are to be free. Their case is a hard one; every case of slavery is a hard one; but there are considerations connected with it of a very delicate nature. The-rights of the master must be controlled, the moral influence that subjects the slave to the master disregarded^ and a spirit of hostility engendered while they continue to be slaves, calculated to diminish their value while slaves; the property of the master is to be invaded in a manner subversive of the institution of slavery, and. likely to have an influence on those who are slaves for life; and the next step may be to interfere with the master in their case also, if the humanity of the court is to be appealed to. I admit the right of a testator-to emancipate his slaves prospectively, because I submit to the decisions of this court, though I think there-is nothing in the law, which authorizes it; but while-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>I do this, I insist that, in such case, the testator must make complete provision for the objept, and not .rely on the Court of Chancery to become the guardian of his infant slaves, and thereby to enfeeble the master\u2019s rights while they continue slaves. The case of <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>is entirely unlike this. That case was cided by a bare court; I did not sit'in it, or I should have dissented. There the question was presented upon the will of one M\u2019Coy, by parties who claimed the negroes as their property; and the court, instead of deciding that question, which was a pure question of property, decided that the negroes were free under the will; and that too, notwithstanding that in a former suit brought by the negroes against Erskine for their freedom, they had been adjudged to be slaves, and this court had refused to allow a.swper<em>sedeas </em>to the judgment; for it was said, Erskine had no title to them, though he had a verdict and judgment against them as slaves, in their pauper suit for freedom. This was confounding the question of property with the question of freedom, which, unfortunately has been too often done. <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>has as little application to the present case. In that case, the testator\u2019s will provided amply for the emancipation of all his slaves, the young and the old, if they would consent to go to Liberia; they were free at the testator\u2019s death, upon condition that they should consent to go to Liberia; and it was only necessary to apply to the Court of Chancery to carry the provision into effect. Though I reluctantly differ from my brothers, I am of opinion that this decree ought to be reversed, the injunction dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Decree arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
