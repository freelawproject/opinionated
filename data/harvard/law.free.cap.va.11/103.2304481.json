Yoss, and Turner &amp; Yoss (all of whom were merchants trading in Baltimore). This bill set forth, that Barnes and Dandridge became indebted to the complainants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>September, 1836, for tbe price of goods purchased of them respectively, for which they executed their promissory notes,\"payable six months after date; namely, a note to A. Hart for 1,642 dollars 46 cents, dated the 16th of September, 1836; a note to F. &amp; B. Yoss for 200 dollars, dated the 20th of September, 1836; and a note to Turner &amp; Yoss for 1811 dollars 20 cents, dated the 16th\u2019/of September, 1836; on which notes the complainants had respectively recovered judgments in the County Court of King William at the August term, 1837. (Copies of the judgments were exhibited with the bill.) That the goods so purchased of the complainants were taken into possession by Barnes &amp; Dandridge, and placed in a store at \u00c1ylett\u2019s in the said county, and there exposed to sale; and before the said notes became due, these very goods, or such of them as remained unsold, were conveyed to James P. Corbin by the deed of the 6th of February, 1837. After setting forth the provisions of that deed, the bill charged that the same was fraudulent and void as to the complainants, and was designed to delay, hinder and defeat them in the recovery of their debts; that it is void on its face, as it vests in Barnes <em>So </em>Dandridge, as debtors, rights entirely inconsistent with those of the trustee, and of the creditors intended to be secured thereby; that no debt was due to Corbin when the deed was made, and none had since arisen, as he had never discharged the liabilities therein said to be assumed by him; and that the property conveyed was much more than sufficient to pay the debts which were specifically provided for. That, in order more fully to effect the fraudulent objects of the first deed, the said Barnes &amp; Dandridge, [on the 13th of May, 1837, executed another deed to Walker Hawes as trustee, embracing the same property as that conveyed by the first (or at least that part of it which then remained). The bill set forth the provisions of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>second deed; and then proceeded to allege that after the grantors had for some time remained in possession, selling the goods and collecting the debts, an auction sale was held by authority of the trustee Hawes, who had received a considerable sum of money the proceeds of that sale, and had since permitted Dandridge to act in collecting debts embraced by the deed. That Corbin, the complainants believe and charge, had never paid any thing out of his own pocket on account of the liabilities assumed by him, and if any such had been discharged at all (which they do not believe), it was with money arising from sales of goods and collections of debts embraced in the said deeds. The bill prayed a discovery of the .property and debts embraced by the deeds, of the. sales and collections made by Barnes &amp; Dandridge and the other defendants respectively, and of the sums paid by Corbin on account of the liabilities assumed by him as aforesaid; that Barnes &amp; Dandridge be in-joined from any further collection of the debts embraced in the deeds, and a receiver appointed to collect the same; that Hawes be restrained from paying over or disposing of the funds in his hands; that the deeds be declared fraudulent and void, and all the debts and effects embraced in them be applied to satisfy the claims of complainants and other just creditors of Barnes &amp; Dandridge who may come in and contribute to the expenses of the suit; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-4\">The injunction prayed by this bill was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">At May term, 1838, by consent of all the parties in the two suits, it was ordered that the same be consolidated, and that a commissioner of the court take and report an account of the value of the goods and debts-embraced in the said deeds, of the goods, moneys and evidences of debt which had come to the hands of the defendant Hawes as trustee, and of the sales and col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>lections made by Barnes &amp; Dandridge or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">The defendants Barnes and Dandridge failed to answer the bills; which, as to them, were taken pro <em>confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">Hawes answered, that he knew nothing of the debts alleged by the complainants to be due to them; that, in the execution of the deed to him as trustee, he had no reason to suspect, nor does he believe, that any fraud was intended or perpetrated; that he has understood and believes the deed was made to secure a just debt to Corbin; that the grantors were permitted to remain in possession for the limited time mentioned in the deed, with a view to enable them to arrange their books and business, and place their affairs in a proper train for settlement; that during this period they sold goods to the amount of about 400 dollars, which this respondent believed they had honestly accounted for and paid over to him; that the remainder of the goods was then sold at auction, and brought about 2,000 dollars; and that he is ready to account and to pay over the balance in his hands as the court may direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">The defendant Corbin, in his answer, gave a full and minute detail of the circumstances respecting the execution of the two deeds of the 6th of February and the 13th of May. He said, that early in 1837, Barnes and Dandridge (with whom he had been acquainted for several years) came to him, and represented that they were in embarrassed circumstances, daily expecting to be sued; that they believed their property would not be sufficient to pay all their just debts, and though they were anxious to pay them all as far as their means would enable them, they yet particularly desired to secure certain favoured creditors by giving them a preference; to effect both of which objects, as well as to obviate the loss and vexation at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tending suits, they proposed to this respondent to assume the payment of their debts to certain creditors whom they would designate, to the probable amount and value of their whole property, which they would convey to him as an indemnity for his liabilities so to be assumed, the assumption of the liabilities and the execution of the deed to be concurrent, and the deed to be recorded immediately. That, actuated by a friendly feeling towards Barnes and Dandridge, this respondent agreed to make himself liable to the extent proposed, in consideration that they would secure him by a direct conveyance and transfer of their property, real and personal, including debts due; he to make sale of and collect the same, and from the proceeds thereof, first to satisfy himself on account of his said liabilities, and should there be an overplus, to hold the same upon trust generally for the remaining creditors of the said Barnes &amp; Dandridge. That, being himself ignorant of the business of a dry goods merchant, and confiding in the skill and capacity of the said Barnes and Dandridge, he contracted with them, and they, as a further inducement to him to assume the liabilities aforesaid, engaged with him, to remain in the store at Aylett\u2019s as his agents, and in, that character to sell the goods and collect the debts due. That in pursuance and on the faith of this agreement, this respondent, on the 6th of February, 1837, executed his obligations to sundry creditors of Barnes &amp; Dandridge, for various sums, amounting in the whole to 3,262 dollars 46 cents, and at the same time received the deed of that date, duly executed by the defendant Barnes, who was then in Richmond; which obligations were executed to the creditors and for the amounts specified in the schedule annexed to the said deed. That the amount so assumed was considered by the parties at the time of the transaction a fair price for the whole property conveyed, and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>spondent now believes and charges that it exceeded the value of that property. That on the execution of the said deed by Barnes, this respondent entrusted it to him, for the purpose of procuring it to be executed by his partner Dandridge (who was then at Aylett\u2019s in King William), which Barnes promised to do, and also to have it immediately recorded. That some months afterwards, this respondent, who resides in King &amp; Queen county, went to Aylett\u2019s for the purpose of ascertaining what progress had been made by his agents in selling the goods; when, finding that the deed had not been recorded, receiving no satisfactory account of it from Barnes &amp; Dandridge, and believing that Barnes had destroyed it, he insisted that they should immediately execute another deed to secure him for the liabilities he had assumed. This they were persuaded to do, and, the deed of the 13th of May was accordingly executed and recorded. That shortly afterwards respondent got information that the first deed, duly executed by Dandridge, was in existence and in the possession of Barnes; whereupon he insisted that it should be delivered up to him; which at last was done, and that deed admitted to record on the 19th of May. Respondent expressly denies that there was any fraudulent intent whatever connected with either of the said deeds, and insists that they were executed for the purpose of effecting a fair and legal object. He contends that the deed of the 6th of February ought to be considered as an absolute conveyance of the property to him, for a full and fair consideration; that, as the absolute purchaser, he had a right to constitute Barnes &amp; Dandridge, or any other persons, his agents to manage and take charge of the property; and that the character of their possession, as his agents and not as owners, appears on the face of the deed itself, which is notice to all the world. He admits that at the execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>deed, there was no debt due to him from Barnes &amp; Dandridge, except on account of the liabilities which he then assumed for them; the whole amount of which he avers that he has since paid out of his own pocket, and not with moneys arising from sales and collections under the deed, from which source he has never received a single farthing. But even if it should be considered that he is not entitled to the full benefit of the property conveyed by the first deed, as the absolute purchaser thereof, he insists that that conveyance ought to be considered as a mortgage in fee to him, with power to 'make sale of the property, and out of the proceeds first reimburse himself to the extent of the liabilities assumed and paid for Barnes &amp; Dandridge; and to that extent he claims the benefit of all the provisions for his indemnity contained in both the said deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\">By exhibits filed with the answer of the defendant Corbin, it appeared that Barnes <em>&amp; </em>Dandridge, on the 6th of February, 1837, executed their promissory notes to Corbin himself for amounts specified in the schedule annexed to the deed of that date, all of them payable twelve months after date; that these notes were assigned by Corbin to creditors of Barnes &amp; Dandridge named in the schedule; and that actions having been brought against Corbin by the assignees, and judgments recovered therein, he satisfied and paid those judgments (amounting in the whole to 3,172 dollars 14 cents) in the month of June, 1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">Several depositions were taken and filed in the progress of the controversy; but the evidence, so far as it related to the nature and purpose of the transactions between Barnes &amp; Dandridge and Corbin, did not conflict with the account thereof given by Corbin in his answer, except perhaps in one particular: the scrivener who wrote the deed of the 6th of February, being examined as a witness, deposed, that in a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>versation with. Corbin immediately before that deed was prepared, Corbin told him he was satisfied that Barnes &amp; Dandridge \u201chad property enough to pay all their debts, if they could be allowed to <em>wind wp </em>without disturbance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">The commissioner reported that Hawes, the trustee in the second deed, had in his hands the sum of 2,133 dollars 39 cents in cash, and bonds amounting to 430 dollars more, the proceeds of sales and collections made by authority of that deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-11\">The causes came on to be heard the 24th of May, 1839; when the court, being of opinion that the two' deeds which the bills sought to set aside were not fraudulent as to the defendant Corbin, but were fair and <em>bona fide, </em>decreed, that the trustee Hawes pay the money and assign the bonds appearing by the commissioner\u2019s report to be in hands, to the defendant Corbin, towards the discharge of the debt due him by Barnes &amp; Dandridge; that the bills of the plaintiffs be dismissed; and that the said plaintiffs pay to the defendant Corbin his costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-12\">From this decree an appeal was allowed, on a peti: tion of the plaintiffs assigning for error\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-13\">1. That, upon the supposition that both deeds are <em>bona fide, </em>the other creditors of Barnes &amp; Dandridge are provided for after indemnifying Corbin, and it was- wrong to dismiss their bill with costs, instead of 'decreeing to subject the real property conveyed by the deeds and not disposed of by the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-14\">2. That,- upon the same supposition (that the deeds are fair), the first conveyed the property to Corbin, and the second passed nothing to the trustee, who had therefore no authority to sell. But if it be said that both deeds were made for the same object, to indemnify Corbin in case he should pay the assumed debts in twelve months, and that therefore the proceeds must be applied as if the sale were regular, then it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>answered, he has failed to comply with the terms, and has lost his security; for the notes fell due the 6th of February, 1888, and were paid under execution some time afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\">3.

The court is also of opinion that the appellants are entitled to any surplus, after Corbin is indemnified, of the debts and effects so surrendered, and of the proceeds of the house and lot mentioned in the deed from Barnes and Dandridge to Corbin, of the 6th day of February, 1837, and that the court below ought not to have dismissed their bills, until the whole subject, including the house and lot and the outstanding debts, had been administered, so as to ascertain whether or no there be any surplus; and if there be, then, instead of dismissing the bills, that surplus should be decreed to the appellants. Therefore it is decreed and ordered that the said decree, so far as it directs the application of the funds in the hands of the trustee Hawes to the indemnity or reimbursement of Corbin, be affirmed, and that so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>as it dismisses the bills with costs, it be reversed and annulled,\u201d with costs to the appellants.
