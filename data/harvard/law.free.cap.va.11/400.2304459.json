The-facts of the case appearing by the record were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-11\">By an obligation dated the 4th of August, 1824, James, Andrew and Edmund Waggener bound themselves jointly and severally to pay to Zebulon Dyer 736 dollars 57 cents. By an obligation dated the 31st of May, 1826, James and Andrew Waggener bound themselves jointly and severally to pay to Dyer 300&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>.dollars. And by an obligation dated the 6th of Octoher, 1828, James Waggener bound himself to pay to Dyer 111 dollars 50 cents. These obligations were given by James Waggener for money which he owed to Dyer, and in the first of them Andrew and Edmund Waggener, and in the second Andrew Waggener, were his sureties. At the time these debts were contracted, James Waggener owned little property besides his farm; which was one-fourth of a tract of land in Mason county, on the Ohio river, called Waggener\u2019s <em>bottom, </em>containing upwards of 4,000 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">On the 20th of January, 1826, James Waggener gave his note to his nephew, William Waggener, for the payment of 1,620 dollars 25 cents on the 20th of January, 1827, with interest from the date, and executed a deed of trust on his land to secure its payment, which authorized the trustee, in default of payment, to sell the land at public auction for cash, after advertising the time and place of sale for sixty days at the door of Mason courthouse, and in some newspaper most convenient to Mason county. This deed was duly recorded in May, 1826. The debt secured by the deed being unpaid, William Waggener, not long after the time for payment had elapsed, caused the land to be set up for sale by John D. Lewis, the trustee named in the deed. There was some sort of proof that the sale was advertised in a newspaper printed at Chilicothe, in the state of Ohio, and at the door of Mason courthouse, but it did riot appear for what length of time previous to the sale. The property was struck out to William Waggener at the price of 1,000 dollars, which was the only bid. The land was at that time worth much more; its cash value being variously estimated by the witnesses at from 1,500 to 7,000 dollars. William Waggener declared, before the sale, on the day of the sale, and after the sale, that he wanted the land for his own security merely\u2014that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>would hold it or dispose of it for that purpose only, and after satisfying his deht, the residue should belong to his uncle James and his family. The trustee con<em>veye\u00bf[ </em>.\u00bfpg jan(j \u2019William Waggener by deed dated the 2d of July, 1827. William permitted his uncle to retain possession of a part of the land till the fall of 1828, when he turned him out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\">On the 2d of September, 1828, William Waggener executed a deed of trust upon the land to secure a debt of 500 dollars to Henderson &amp; Smith, payable the 2d oi September, 1829; and on the 4th of February, 1829, he executed another deed of trust on the land to secure a debt of 991 dollars 37 cents to Andrew Lewis, payable the 1st of February, 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">In the spring of 1829, William Waggener wrote to Dyer, that he would convey the land to him, if he would pay the amount which James Waggener owed him, William: and he sent Dyer a similar message soon after by Andrew Waggener, who went to Pendleton, the county of Dyer\u2019s residence, on a visit in May, 1829. Dyer replied that he would come to Mason between the 1st and 15th of September, to pay him the money according to his proposition. Dyer arrived on the 15th of September; but in the meantime William Waggener had sold to one Henry Cape-hart a part of the land, at the price of 1,800 dollars, and though he had not made the conveyance when Dyer arrived, he made it on the day after.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">Before Capehart\u2019s purchase, it was known to William Waggener and others that James Waggener talked of bringing suit to set aside the sale to William; and that fact was communicated to Capehart before his purchase. Capehart, however, determined to run the risk, and accepted a deed from William Waggener, with special warranty only. He paid 300 dollars of his purchase money in a horse; 500 dollars in discharge of Henderson &amp; Smith\u2019s incumbrance; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the remaining 1,000 dollars by discharging the incumbrance of Andrew Lewis above mentioned, which was effected, in pursuance of an arrangement between William Waggener, Capehart, Lewis, and Alexander and Samuel M\u2019Culloch, creditors of Lewis, by Cape-hart giving to the M\u2019Cullochs his two bonds for 500 dollars each, payable in August, 1830, and August, 1831, with a deed of trust on the land he had bought of William Waggener, and the M\u2019Oulloehs allowing to Lewis a credit for the same amount. Capehart\u2019s \u25a0deed to secure the payment of his bonds to the M\u2019Oulloch\u2019s, is dated the 16th of September, 1829, and conveys the land to John M\u2019Culloch, as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">On the 9th of November, 1829, James Waggener and wife executed a conveyance of the same 1,000 \u2022acres of land to Dyer, which was recorded in February, 1830. The deed is in form an absolute deed to Dyer in fee simple, with general warranty, but its intention, according to the declarations and acts of the parties to it, was to confer upon Dyer a security for his debt, and for this purpose to invest him with James Waggener\u2019s right to redeem the land in possession of William Waggener and Capehart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">. Accordingly, in April, 1830, Dyer commenced this suit, in the late Superior Court of Chancery for the Clarksburg district, and in May, 1830, filed his bill, making James Waggener, William Waggener, and Henry Capehart, defendants; setting forth his claims upon James, the fraudulent conduct of William, the irregularity of the \u201csale to him, the gross inadequacy of the price, his declarations, which shewed that he held as a trustee for James, his sale to Capehart, who had notice of the trust, and James\u2019s conveyance by way of mortgage to the plaintiff. The bill alleged, also, that the debt of James to William Waggener had been greatly reduced. It sought an account of that debt, and of the rents and profits of the land since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\"William\u2019s purchase, and a sale of the land for the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Azha\">The answer of James Wagg\u00e9ner corresponds, in its statement of facts, with the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aoj\">The answer of William Waggener admits some payments made to him by James; admits that his bid of 1,000 dollars was the only bid; denies that he made any declarations before the sale, that he would purchase and hold the land as a mere security for his debt; but admits that he informed James, and perhaps others, after the sale, that he did not want the land; that all he wanted was his money; and declares that his own necessities and want of money induced him to have the land sold by his trustee, and after-wards to sell part of it to Oapehart. He denies the alleged inadequacy of price, but admits that he sold part of it to Oapehart for 1,800 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">Oapehart, by his answer, objects that the plaintiff\" claims under a deed which is void by the statute prohibiting the purchase of pretensed titles. He declares that he was a purchaser from William Waggener for valuable consideration, without notice of any equity or claim of either James Waggener or the plaintiff against William; but insists, that if he could be affected with such notice, yet having paid off the incumbrances created by William on the land, he became clothed with all the rights, and substituted in the room of the creditors whose debts he discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ar0E\">The cause having been regularly transferred to the Circuit Superior Court of Law ancl Chancery for Mason county, Alexander and Samuel M\u2019Culloch, in September, 1832, filed a petition, setting forth their interest as incumbrancers of part of the land under the deed from Oapehart to their trustee John M\u2019Culloch, and asking to be made parties. An amended bill was accordingly filed, making them and their said trustee defendants: whereupon, they filed their answer, cle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u25a0daring that they acquired their incumbrance fairly, and without any knowledge or notice of the equitable claims preferred in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">Among the depositions for the plaintiff, that of Andrew Waggener was of primary importance. This deponent being asked whether he had any interest in the controversy, responded that he had none as he believed, and produced an instrument under the hand and seal of Dyer, dated the 25th of February, 1888, by which Dyer, reciting the two obligations wherein the deponent was bound as the surety of James Waggener, covenanted that he should never be sued upon them, and that no attempt should ever be made to enforce the collection of the same, or of either of them, from him by any process of law. This instrument was returned and filed with the deposition, the defendants by their counsel objecting to its being copied. They excepted also to the deposition on two grounds: 1st. That the witness was interested. 2dly. That the instrument produced by the witness was in effect a release, and the plaintiff therefore had no longer any claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">The cause being heard the 18th of April, 1835, the court overruled the exceptions to the deposition of Andrew Waggener, directed the land in the bill mentioned, to be sold at public auction, upon a credit of \u25a0one, two and three years, after advertisement in the manner prescribed by the decree, and ordered several accounts to be taken by its commissioner, to wit: an account of the rents and profits of .the land since the date of the deed to William Waggener, with an account of the value of the permanent improvements put upon the land by William Waggener and Henry Capehart; and accounts of the debts due from James to the plaintiff, and from James Waggener to William; and of the mortgage debt of the M\u2019Cullochs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>On the petition of William Waggener, an appeal was allowed him from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-11\"><em>Fisher </em>and <em>W. A. Harrison, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-12\"><em>C. Johnson </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b426-13\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A52\">There is no legal question of interest' in this case, except those which respect the propriety of reading Andrew Waggener\u2019s deposition. He is one-of two sureties in a bond to Dyer, the appellee, and if Dyer succeeds in the cause, the debt will be thereby liquidated and discharged. To remove this objection,. Dyer has executed to him a covenant not to sue him,, which he produced at the taking of his deposition. Two questions are now made: 1. Can the covenant-be read without proof by the subscribing witness ? This objection, if valid, comes too late. It ought to-have been made when the paper was introduced, that the subscribing witness might be called. This was-not done. The paper was admitted, the counsel for the defendants only objecting to its being copied, meaning, I suppose, that the original must be filed. Independent of this, it seems to me that as Dyer calls for the covenant, and avails himself of it to rehabilitate his witness, the proof of the subscribing witness-was not necessary. <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>6 Call, 78. He could never afterwards be permitted to deny it, and if so, the witness would have the full- benefit of its protection. 2. Did this covenant exonerate the witness ? I think it did. It did not, it is true, discharge the co-surety, because a covenant not to sue one does not exonerate both. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Munf., 9; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>8 T. R., 168; <em>Wrights adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>5 Leigh, 153. But the covenant operated to protect Andrew Waggener forever from Dyer\u2019s claim. It is contended, however, that he would, be subject to the co-surety\u2019s demand for contribution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>I think not. By exonerating him, Dyer\u2019s redress against Edmund Waggener, the co-surety, would he confined to one moiety of the debt. Could Edmund Waggener, if he had paid that moiety, demand that Andrew should reimburse him any part thereof? If each surety is to be considered, in respect to his co-sureties, as a principal as to his aliquot part of the debt, and only surety to his co-sureties for the balance, (see <em>Ex parte Gifford, </em>6 Ves., 805; 1 Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7 499, p. 477,) then it is clear that Edmund can have no claim upon Andrew. But if this be not a general rule, (see Theobald on Princ. &amp; Surety, 267,) yet, where a creditor, with a view to the purposes of justice, and to have the benefit of a witness\u2019s testimony, gives up the liability of the witness for one half his debt, no court of law or. equity would recognize the claim of the other surety to defeat this reasonable arrangement, by holding the witness responsible for the payment of a portion of his co-surety\u2019s moiety. Ho wrong is done to him; for if, instead of being released, Andrew Waggener had paid his moiety, Edmund never could have demanded contribution for his aliquot part paid by himself. And as his rights are not impaired, it would be unreasonable to make him partaker in equity of the benefit of a covenant which confessedly cannot avail him at law, and which equity will never carry beyond the intention of the parties. <em>Kirby &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Taylor, &amp;c., </em>6 Johns. C. R., 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Waggener was therefore a good witness, and reading his testimony, the merits are most clearly with the appellee. The objection as to the title being pretensed cannot prevail. The cases of <em>Allen, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Leigh, 231, and <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewis\u2019s ex\u2019ors et al., </em>7 Leigh, 720, promulgate, I think, the true doctrine on this subject, on the authority of the opinions of learned English chancellors there cited. The present case is fully within the influence of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>As to the objection that the priorities of the incumbrances are not settled, that is a matter of which, if it were as is contended, Waggener cannot complain, as he is the first incumbrancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">On the whole, I think there is no error in the decree to the prejudice of the appellant, and that it should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Per curiam, decree arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
