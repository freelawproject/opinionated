Craighill, having pledged themselves to me to pay the entire debt with interest of Craighill in 1 and 2 years, the personal and real property of Craighill and the other sureties is to be sold under the warrant in your hands, for their benefit, and on such terms and conditions as they shall prescribe: provided, however, they take upon themselves the responsibility of guaranteeing the sale to the purchaser or purchasers.

Richard Duffield and William Grove were the purchasers for the above amounts, for their own benefit, agreeably to the directions from the agent of the treasury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-6\">The return of the marshal, and his deed to Duffield and Grove, bore date the 29th of April, 1828. The deed recited that the marshal levied the warrant upon a tract of land claimed to belong to Nathaniel Craig-hill, situate in the county of Jefferson, and described particularly in the deed by metes and bounds, \u201cand having duly advertised the time and place of sale of the said land, according to law, proceeded to sell the same at public auction, at Charlestown, on the-day of-, at which sale Richard Duffield and William Grove became the purchasers, being the highest bidders, having bid therefor the sum of 1,000 dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>In the meantime, to wit:' on the 20th of August, 1827, a deed had been made by Nathaniel Craighill to \u25a0John E. Page, conveying the same tract of land, upon certain trusts therein expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\">Grove and Nuffield, after purchasing the land of Nathaniel Craighill, thus previously conveyed, filed their bill in the Superior Court of Chancery at \u2018Winchester, in July, 1828, impeaching the deed of the 20th of August, 1827, as fraudulent and void, and setting forth, that under color of this deed, William Little was in possession of a saw-mill on the premises, and wood-land adjacent, and was engaged in cutting down, sawing, and disposing of the timber. The bill made defendants Nathaniel Craighill, John E. Page, William Little, and others who might claim under the deed of August 20th, 1827, to wit: the children of William P. Craighill, the children of William Little, \u25a0the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Georgetown, and .Samuel J. Cramer. And the prayer was, that the said deed might be annulled; that the plaintiffs might be put in full possession of the land which they had purchased; and, until the merits of the case should be decided on, that an injunction might be awarded to restrain waste.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">An injunction was awarded accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">There was filed with the bill, as an exhibit, a transr cript of the record in an action brought by John Grove against Nathaniel Craighill and William Little. By this record it appeared, that judgment was obtained in this action on the 20th of April, 1818; that after the death of John Grove, a <em>scire facias </em>issued on behalt of William Grove, as his administrator, to revive the judgment, upon which <em>scire facias </em>execution was awarded the 19th of September, 1820; that a forthcoming bond was given, with.Samuel J. Cramer as surety, upon which judgment was rendered the 17th of. April, 1821; that on the 31st of August, 1826, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>scire facias </em>issued to renew the judgment, upon which,execution was awarded the 24th of August, 1827; and. that a writ of <em>cop\u00e1is ad satisfaciendum </em>issued the 12th September, 1827, under which Craighill was com- \u25a0 mitted to jail, Little took the oath of insolvency, and Cramer was admitted to the bounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">The bill mentioned the fact that Nathaniel Craighill was confined in jail under this <em>ca. sa. </em>at the time of\" the sale by the marshal, and at the time of filing the bill. And the circumstance of the <em>scire facias </em>being on the docket at the time of making the deed of the 20th of August, 1827, was relied on to shew the fraudulent intent in making that deed. But -the bill did not assert any lien on behalf of Grove\u2019s administrator by reason of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">In the answer of William Little it is stated, that besides the land of William P. Craighill which the complainants bought for 755 dollars, they purchased under the same warrant several negroes belonging to his estate, for 580 dollars. It is admitted by the respondent that of the sums paid by him to the United States, about 1,800 dollars was paid out of the funds belonging to Craighill\u2019s estate; but having paid for Craighill\u2019s estate more than 2,000 dollars since his death, he claims to be considered as having paid to the government the whole amount credited as paid by him. This amount was equal not only to his own quota as surety, but to that of Nathaniel Craighill also,, and he was willing to have it considered that he had paid Craighill\u2019s quota as well as his own. The land of Nathaniel Craighill, it is therefore insisted, should be regarded as discharged from the claim on account of which it was sold. It is farther insisted that the deed to Page was <em>bona fide, </em>and that the sale under the warrant was not made in a fair and proper manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">In the answer of Nathaniel Craighill it is stated, that William P. Craighill left personal estate which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ought to have been applied to the payment of the debt due the United States; that this respondent\u2019s land was not duly advertised, and that the sale thereof was not fairly and properly made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">These answers were afterwards amended. Nathaniel Craighill, by his amended answer, insisted that the sale was altogether irregular, in consequence of the failure of the marshal to have the warrant of distress recorded in the District Court; and that it was illegal to sell any real estate, until all the personal estate, as well of the sureties as of the principal, was exhausted. He relied upon the fact of indulgence having been granted, without his assent, to William Little one of the sureties, and upon the stay of'execution allowed as to the complainants; a stay allowed, as he said, under the belief ot the agent of the treasury that the respondent was the principal and not merely a surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">It appeared by an additional return of the marshal, enclosed in a letter from him of the 23d of May, 1828, that he sold three slaves the property of William P. Craighill, for 597 dollars, to Richard Duffield, who paid, for the marshal\u2019s fees and the expenses of surveying four tracts of land, 283 dollars 95 cents, leaving a balance of 313 dollars 5 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">By a report from the agent of the treasury to the secretary of the treasury, it also appeared that when the agent allowed a stay of proceedings as to the complainants, to give them time to subject the land of Nathaniel Craighill, he was under the mistaken impression that Nathaniel Craighill was the principal debtor. Grove and Duffield assumed the payment to the United States of the entire debt with interest, and at the date of the report (June 10, 1829,) more than half of it had been paid by them. By an account from the treasury department subsequently filed in the cause, it appeared that Grove and Duffield paid 3,000 dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>on tlie 9th of February, 1829, and 3,320 dollars 22'. cents the 4th of February, 1830, in full of the debt and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An_\">On- the 29th of April, 1830, on the motion of the \u25a0 plaintiffs, leave was given them to amend their bill, and the amendment was directed to be made in 60 days. It was never made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">On the 9th of December, 1830, the court, being of opinion that, to do justice to the parties, the defendants Oraighill and Little should have leave to file a cross bill against the plaintiffs, asserting the pretensions of the defendants as stated in their answers, gave them leave to file such cross bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-13\">The cross bill was accordingly filed, and an answer thereto put in by Grove andDuffield. In this answer.it was mentioned, among other things, that Nathaniel Oraighill had taken the oath of insolvency at the suit of Grove\u2019s administrator, and that, at the sale by the sheriff, the plaintiff Grove became the purchaser of Craighill\u2019s interest in the land at the price of 1,505 dollars. Along with the answer was exhibited a copy of the sheriff\u2019s account of sales, and a copy of the deed from the sheriff to Grove.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-14\">The children of William Little and of William P. Oraighill filed an answer to the original bill, insisting, among other things, that the warrant was not lawfully issued against the representatives of William P. Craig-hill, and that it could not be levied on any real estate until all the personal estate, as well of the sureties as of the principal, had been exhausted; and alleging that Grove, Duffield and Griggs had, at the time of the levy and sale, a large and valuable personal estate..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-15\">There was filed a copy of the account of sales of the personal estate of William P. Oraighill by William Grove his administrator, and a copy of the administration account, whereby it appeared that the-administrator had. received 745 dollars 66 cents, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the funeral expenses, charges of administration, and commissions amounted to 289 dollars 49 cents, and that the balance and more was disbursed in paying executions against the deceased, debts binding his heirs, and due bills and accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-3\">It was proved that at the time of the sale of Nathaniel CraighilPs land by the marshal, Grove and Nuffield had considerable personal property, consisting of negroes, horses, cattle, &amp;c. Indeed, in their answer to the cross bill, they stated the fact that the warrant of the 28th of September, 1827, was levied on their personal property in November of that year. The sale of it was prevented by the arrangement made by Grove and Nuffield with the agent of the treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">There was evidence tending to shew the insolvency of Griggs, and that the land of Nathaniel Craighill. was not duly advertised. And there was also' much, evidence in relation to the conduct of the parties. It was the object of Grove and Nuffield to shew that Nathaniel CraighilPs deed was fraudulent, and that the funds out of which Little made payments to the United States were not his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">The causes being removed to the Circuit Court of Jefferson, came on to be heard in that court the 10th of April, 1833, upon the bills, answers, depositions and exhibits .* on consideration whereof, the court decreed that the injunction granted in the first case be \u2022 dissolved, that both the original bill and the cross bill be dismissed, and that the plaintiffs in each case pay to the defendants in each case their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">On the petition of Grove and Nuffield, an appeal was allowed them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsZ\">admitted the general principle that a creditor at large cannot come into equity to set aside a fraudulent conveyance by his debtor. Nut, he said, where it is competent to an officer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>treasury to issue a distress warrant for the sale of lands to satisfy a debt, <em>quoad </em>such debt the United States cannot be considered creditors at large. As the lien a judgment is the mere result of the capacity to sue out an <em>elegit </em>to take the debtor\u2019s lands, so the lien, m the ease of a debt to the United States for which a distress warrant lies, results from the capacity to issue the warrant. And a surety paying a debt to the United States is entitled, on general principles, to be subrogated to the rights of the United States against the principal debtor and co-sureties. <em>Enders &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Brune, </em>4 Rand. 438. On this ground alone the plaintiffs might have been entertained in equity; and if the bill is not suited to their case, they should have been allowed to amend it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-4\">Supposing the claim of the plaintiffs to be merely \u25a0as purchasers, the question is whether the marshal\u2019s deed passed title, without proof of his compliance with all things which the statute makes pre-requisites to the sale. Is this question to be determined by analogy to the case of a sale by a marshal or sheriff for taxes, or to the case of a sale by such officer under execution? If the analogy be to sales for taxes, it must be conceded, upon the authority of <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>4 Munf. 431; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>2 Leigh 329, and <em>Williams &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Peyton\u2019s lessee, </em>4 Wheat. 77, that the plaintiffs shew no title. But the analogy is properly to sales under execution; and in such cases, though the officer is liable if there be irregularity, yet his conveyance passes title. It is said that according to the words of the statute, the conveyance only gives title to lands \u201c sold in pursuance of the authority aforesaid; \u201d and upon the previous words, declaring that the amount due shall be a lien upon the lands from the date of a levy and a record thereof, the objection is taken that here there was no such record as the statute contemplates, and so there never was any lien; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>aud the further objection is taken that the land was. not duly advertised. But is it the fair interpretation of the statute, that objections of this kind shall avail here? There may have been malfeasance or anee by the marshal, for which he may he liable to make compensation, and yet it may not avoid the sale\" and conveyance. Redress may be had in such case by injunction, and a court of the United States is the proper forum. As to the objections that the personal property had not been exhausted, and that U. Craighill\u2019s proportion of the debt had been satisfied by Little, it is enough to say, as to the former, that there was no personal property besides that levied on, and as to the latter, that the payment was out of the funds of the principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\">In any point of view, there is a clear ground of relief by force of Grove\u2019s judgment and execution. Moreover it was improper to dismiss the bill <em>in toto, </em>without any reservation of the rights of the sureties for money paid.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-5\"><em>Robinson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq5o\">The constitutionality of the act of congress under which the warrant issued was much discussed in <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>Case, <em>2 </em>Brock. R. 447. It was said in that ease, that to sustain the validity of the statute, the agents, in its execution, must be regarded as purely ministerial, and the authority strictly pursued, and the act, in its construction, be confined to the letter. Such agents, it is said, \u201c cannot act on other persons or on other subjects than those marked out in the power, nor can they proceed in a manner different from that it prescribes.\u201d (p. 480.) Thus regarding the statute, the court will find itself relieved from the necessity of considering its constitutionality, for the case will be found to be in which the statute has not authorized the warrant to issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-8\">By the terms of the statute, the agent of the trea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>.sury is to proceed against \u201csuch delinquent officer.\u201d There is no authority at all to proceed except where the officer is alive. To allow such a proceeding against es^e a c^ea(^ person would be most unwise. For want of proper information on the part of the decedent\u2019s representative, he might be certified to be a debtor to a much greater amount than ivas really due. Before a representative qualified, the whole estate might be sacrified. And even if there were a qualification on the estate, the proceeding is so summary that the sacrifice might be made before the assets were collected. Infant heirs might have the whole of their lands sold for a small portion of their value. It ought not to be supposed that the legislature intended to authorize a proceeding so injurious to the creditors, heirs and distributees of a decedent, when there is nothing in the act itself to shew any such intention. On the contrary, it is manifest that it contemplated proceedings where the delinquent officer was alive. The warrant is to be directed to the marshal of the district in which such delinquent officer and his sureties shall reside. And the marshal is to proceed to levy the money by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such delinquent officer. This provision cannot be complied with, where the goods and chattels of the officer have come to the hands of an administrator and been sold by him. And yet there might be assets in the hands of the personal representative of the officer, equal to the whole amount of the debt. In this very case there is an account of sales of the personal estate of the officer, made by William Grove, his administrator, to a qonsiderable amount; and though, by the administration account, the proceeds appear to have been disbursed, yet the debts paid must have been of inferior dignity to that due the United States. Again, the statute provides that if the goods and chattels of the officer be not sufficient, his body may be taken; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u2022notwithstanding the commitment of the officer, or if he abscond, the goods of the sureties may be taken; that the amount due shall be a lien upon the lands of officer and his sureties from the date of a levy; and that all moneys which may remain shall be returned to such delinquent officer or his sureties. All these provisions are incompatible with the issuing of a warrant after the death of an officer. How can the amount due be a lien upon the lands of the officer, when the officer is dead and has no lands ? The decision in <em>Glass-ford </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>3 Call, 193, in which a motion was denied against executors under the act in 1 Rev. Code, ch. 113, \u00a7 2, p. 447, is in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-4\">TT. Though the warrant were regard'd as legally issued, still the sale of the lands ot Nathaniel Craighill, one of the sureties, was wholly illegal. 1. The marshal should have-proceeded to raise the money by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the delinquent officer. Passing by the fact that there was money in the hands of Grove, his administrator, (the very party who procured the warrant to issue,) there was no \u25a0levy upon any goods of the officer until after the lands of Nathaniel Craighill, the surety, had been sold. 2. The provision of the law requiring the money to be raised by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the sureties, was wholly disregarded. Grove and Duffield had a large personal property, and yet, without selling this property at all, the land of Nathaniel Craig-hill, a co-surety, was taken and sold. On this point, the case of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Graves, &amp;c., </em>2 Brock, R. 379, is decisive. It was a. case under the act of 1813, (2 Story\u2019s Laws II. S., p. 1381, \u00a7 6,) but the principle is strictly applicable. 3. Until a record, in the office of the clerk of t.-e District Court, of a levy in pursuance \u25a0of the warrant, there was no lien upon the lands; and ;no such record appears to have been made. 4. The provision of the statute requiring an advertisement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>at least three weeks, in not less than three public places in the county or district where the real estate is situate, does not appear to have been complied with; the recim ^e marshal\u2019s deed not being even <em>prima facie </em>evidence. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>7 Cow. 88. If the argument were sound, that the decision should be by analogy to a sale under execution, the analogy is not to a sale of goods, but to a sale of lands under execution, in relation to which the rules are more strict. Thus in Louisiana, the statute requires that the judgment, on which execution issues, should be recited in the deed of sale given by the sheriff; and it has been declared that the omission of that recital prevents the transfer of the title to the buyer. 4 Kent\u2019s Comm., 484, citing <em>Dufour </em>v. <em>Camfrane, </em>11 Martin, 607, and <em>Durnford </em>v. <em>Degruys, </em>8 Id. 222. But in truth there is no analogy to the case of a sale under an execution, or a sale under a decree, for the party has no day in court. The remedy given in the 4th section is an injunction to stay proceedings on the warrant. No means are given by the statute for enquiring into the regularity of the sale. It must of necessity be enquired into when a party comes into court,, claiming under the sale. The statute is to be construed by analogy to sales for taxes. 5. The lands of Nathaniel Craighead could only be sold to raise what he was bound for. The principle is, that if, by any arrangement between the creditor and a surety, his co-surety would, after making payment, be unable to enforce a claim to contribution, he is thereby discharged. 1 Suppl. to Ves. Jun., p. 512, in note on <em>Ex parte Gifford, </em>6 Ves., 805; Pothier on Oblig. pt. 3, ch. 1, art. 6, \u00a7 2, p. 332-3, of' Am. edi. Applying this principle to the facts appearing in this cause, Nathaniel Craighill was bound for\u2019 nothing. In another point of view, nothing was due from him. According to the administration account on the estate of the delinquent officer, his administrator has received 745 dollars 66 cents, and his allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>anees for funeral expenses, charges of administration, and commissions, amount to 289 dollars 49 cents, leaving 456 dollars 17 cents. To this add 597 dollars for the three slaves of the principal, and 755 dollars for his land, and the sum of the principal\u2019s credits is 1,808 dollars 17 cents, which, deducted from 9,282 dollars 66 cents, left 7,424 dollars 49 cents. Now, there were originally six sureties, hut of these John Grigg\u2019s was insolvent. Dividing the sum last mentioned into five parts, the portion of each was only 1,484 dollars 89 cents; so that what Little had paid was equal to his portion and that of Nathaniel Craighill. Nor were there any portions of others for which the land of Nathaniel Craighill could be sold. Yestal\u2019s portion was made from the sale of his land, and the portions of Grove and Duffield were discharged. Even if no credit he given to Little for his payments, there was very little due from Nathaniel Craighill. Considering 1,300 dollars of those payments as made out of the funds of the principal, and adding that amount to the 1,808 dollars 17 cents, there will he a sum of 3,108. dollars 17 cents to be deducted from the 9,232 dollars. 66 cents, which will leave 6,124 dollars 49 cents, one-fifth of which is 1,224 dollars 89 cents. In any point of view, only so much of the land of Nathaniel Craig-hill should have been sold as was necessary to pay the sum last mentioned. But instead of selling only a small part of the tract for a small part of the debt, the whole tract was sold for the whole debt, which was not only unjust and oppressive, but illegal. <em>Stead\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Course, </em>4 Cranch, 403.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-5\">LEI. The ground taken, that the plaintiffs have a right to come into equity, even though the sale were illegal, cannot be sustained. 1. The bill asserts no claim of the plaintiffs except as purchasers at the marshal\u2019s sale. 2. When the suit was commenced, no other claim could have been asserted, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>plaintiffs had paid no money whatever. 3. If, before commencing this suit, they had been creditors for money paid as sureties, entitled to contribution from their co-sureties, still, being mere creditors at large, they could not come into equity to set aside the conveyance. But it is said that the United States are something more than creditors at large, and the sureties, by subrogation, more also. The argument is, that as, before an <em>elegit </em>issues, there is a lien, because of the capacity to sue out an <em>elegit, </em>so, before the distress warrant issues, there is a lien, because of the capacity to sue out thejwarrant. The fault of the argument is this\u2014\"When the <em>elegit </em>issues, it relates back, in terms, to the date of the judgment. Hot so with the warrant. There can, from the very nature of it, be no lien before it issues. And if a surety pays the debt before the warrant issues, he can have no lien upon the lands of a co-surety. The surety has the benefit of such lien as exists at the time of the payment, and no more. If, for example, the surety of a sheriff or other debtor to the commonwealth, pays off a debt before the commonwealth proceeds, the surety cannot move in the General Court, nor can he sue out execution to sell the lands of the principal. The case of <em>Enders, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Brune, </em>is perfectly consistent with this view; so too are the cases of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>&amp;c., 4 Wash. C. C. R., 446, and <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Pratt, &amp;c., </em>2 Wash. C. C. R., 490.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-4\">IV. As to the judgment of Grove\u2019s administrator, it is, in the first place, questionable whether his separate claim could have been united with the joint claim of Grove and Dufiield. But if it could have been so united, it has not been. Ho claim is asserted under the judgment. The bill itself states that at the time of filing it, Craighill was in execution under a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon the judgment; and in such a state of things a creditor has no right to come into equity. Moreover, since the suit was brought, Craighill has taken the oath of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>insolvency, the property mentioned in his schedule has been sold, and the judgment stands as satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-4\">Y. Leave was given to amend the bill; but the \u2022amendment was never made, and three years elapsed after the leave thus given, before the bill was dismissed. There was no occasion for any reservation in the decree, of the rights of the sureties for money paid. The decree in their case as purchasers would be no bar to a proceeding for money paid by them as \u2022sureties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>in reply. The main question is, in what light is the proceeding under the act of congress to be regarded? Whether as a proceeding purely ministerial in its inception, progress and consummation, in which the agent of the treasury, in issuing the warrant, and the marshal in executing it, acted in utter exemption from all direct control or correction of the courts of the United States, like a marshal or sheriff selling lands for taxes, so that the regularity of their respective proceedings can be nowise directly brought in question, and their acts avoided, but only enquired into collaterally when a claim is asserted under those acts ? Or whether the proceeding is not rather to be regarded as analogous to proceedings of a marshal or sheriff in sales of property under execution or decree, in which, though the officer acts ministerially and exercises a naked power, yet his acts are subject to examination and correction by the court in a direct proceeding for the purpose, and can only be so corrected, and, if consummated, cannot be questioned afterwards collaterally? If the first view be correct, the decree is right, if for no other reason but the want of proof of due advertisement; and then all the other objections are supererogatory. But if the last view be correct, then all those objections may safely be admitted,, and yet it is too late now to urge them; neither is this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>a proper ease, nor this the proper forum, in which the defendants can avail themselves of them. The proceeding is certainly anomalous, but its constitution-a^37 can hardly be doubted in respect to officers and' their sureties who incur responsibility under and in reference to the act; neither, in respect to such, is it a harsh or unjust, though it is a summary proceeding. The regularity of the proceedings might have been <em>directly </em>called in 'question in the federal courts, and they were the proper and the only jurisdiction to examine and correct them. Can it be doubted, that if this be a case in which the agent of the treasury had no right to issue a warrant, the marshal might have been arrested in his execution of it by application to the Federal Court? Or that if the marshal proceeded to levy on the property of sureties before exhausting the process against the principal debtor, or on lands before exhausting the process against the goods, the Federal Court would have been open tO' redress the wrong? Under the provision of the 4th section of the act of congress, an application for an injunction would have been proper on each and every ground urged here. And if resort could have been had to the Federal Court, that was the proper remedy, and that the proper forum. Congress have authority to execute their own laws of revenue and finance, and the Federal Courts have exclusive jurisdiction to enforce them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-4\">If the proceeding be regarded in analogy to sales under executions or decrees, then the Louisiana decisions present no difficulty. They are cases of sales und'er execution, in which the statute required the judgment to be recite 1 in the instrument of conveyance. It is exactly as if the statute had required a conveyance by instrument, under seal, and the conveyance had no seal.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\"> Judge Parker made the final decree in the court below, and Judge Tucker sat in the cause in its previous stages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxK\">The claim asserted by the original bill of the appellant is, that they have purchased a tract of land at a sale made by the marshal of the United States, under the authority of a treasury rant issued against Nathaniel Oraighill, the former owner of the land, and other sureties of \"William P. Oraighill. Their complaint is, that before such sale the land in question was fraudulently conveyed by N. Oraighill to some of the defendants, for the benefit of others of them, and the rebel sought is a decree to set aside the said fraudulent conveyance, and to give them possession of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The title to the relief dejiends, 1st, on the establishment of the validity of the title of the appellants under their purchase at the marshal\u2019s sale, supposing the previous conveyance of Nathaniel Oraighill had not been made; and 2dly, on convicting that conveyance of the imputed fraud, or of some other infirmity which deprives it, or ought in the judgment of a Court of Equity to deprive it, of any efficacy in respect to the antagonist title from the sale and conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The title of the appellants under the sale and conveyance has been objected to on various grounds: and the first enquiry is that presented by the proposition, to the maintenance of which the force of the able argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel was mainly directed, to wit, that the court cannot, in this litigation, take cognizance of objections to the title claimed under the sale and conveyance of the marshal, founded on the irregularities of that officer in the levy and sale, but that such objections could only be urged in the Eederal Court, under the fourth section of the act of congress authorizing the proceeding by distress warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">To this proposition I cannot assent. The remedy given by the 4th section, is against the warrant as issued, and is intended to protect from injury that might result' from the undue emanation of the process, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>excess in the amount for which it might emanate ;- not to redress injuries resulting from the undue or irreguiar execution of it.</p>\n<p id=\"AUG\">^ insisted, further, that the proceedings under the warrant are analogous to those under an execution from a court of record, and that irregularities in the proceedings of the'officer must be corrected by application to the authority from which the process emanates, and cannot be urged in another forum against the title derived from the execution of the process. The analogy is not a sound one. In case of the warrant, the process does not issue from a court; and though the act directs that a record of the levy shall be made in the office of the clerk of the district, it gives the court no cognizance over it, nor does it direct that the marshal shall make return, or record of any kind, of his proceedings in further execution of the warrant. The party then had no day in court to urge objections to the undue levy and sale under the warrant. The sale under the warrant bears a stricter analogy to one for the nonpayment of taxes, than to one under an execution issuing from and returnable to a judicial authority. The whole proceeding in both is ministerial; all the functionaries are ministerial, executing power conferred by law; and the title is derived under the law, only in cases in which it appears that the authority which the law gives has been strictly pursued. Like power derived from the conventions of individuals, it cannot displace or transfer property from one to another, unless it be pursued; and to the title claimed under it, the due execution of the power, according to the provisions which direct and limit its exercise, is as necessary as the power itself. Title is the offspring of the conjoint operation of the power and the due exercise of it; and he who asserts it is equally bound to shew the one as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The title of the purchasers under the sale and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>veyance of the marshal is, I think, liable to be repelled by shewing that the levy and sale were not duly and regularly made; especially by parties holding the attitude of defence: and in this case the purchasers have not only failed to prove that in the levy and sale the directions of the act were observed, but the defendants have affirmatively shewn a deviation from them in several respects. Under the mandate of a warrant issued in pursuance of the act, the lands of a surety were not liable to be levied on and sold, but in defect of the goods and chattels of the principal and sureties; and yet, in this case, no such want of goods and chattels appears. On the contrary, it affirmatively appears that two of the sureties (Grove and Duffield) had large personal estates. It does not appear that the sale was advertised as directed by the act. There are other objections to the sale; but it is unnecessary to enumerate or further consider them. Indeed, the counsel of the appellants almost conceded, that if in this litigation the court could take cognizance of the objections to the regularity of the levy and sale, to defeat the conveyance of the marshal, the title of the appellants as purchasers could not be sustained: and such is.my opinion, without any concession of counsel. The nullity of the appellants\u2019 title under the sale and conveyance, renders it unnecessary to decide the question, whether the conveyance of Nathaniel Craig-hill be or be not fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">It is further insisted on behalf of the appellants, that though they may not be entitled as purchasers, yet they have, by their payment of the purchase money, discharged the claim of the United States; \u201cthat that claim was a lien on the land in question; and that they, by substitution, are entitled to charge the land, to the extent of the amount paid on their purchase. No such claim is asserted by the appellants in their pleadings; and their counsel, conscious of this, insists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that it appears in the proofs, and that it was the duty of the court helow to have authorized or directed an amendment of the pleadings, for the purpose of giving appellants relief on this ground of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">It is sufficient to say, that it was not the official duty of the court to direct the amendment, and that the omission of the appellants to ask leave, or to use the leave to amend, cannot in this court be objected as an error of the court below. Hay more, I think it is matter at least of grave doubt, whether such an amendment ought to have been authorized by the court. The parties had been engaged in a tedious and expensive litigation of a title asserted by the appellants. That litigation had swelled the record to a considerable size. The title litigated had failed, and the claim to be asserted by an amended bill was distinct from, and even incompatible with, that involved in the previous litigation. To permit the new and inconsistent claim to be brought forward by an amended bill, would have blended the new with the old controversy\u2014would have incumbered the record with the volume of matter belonging to exploded and abortive litigation, and would have exposed the parties to the costs of embodying all that useless matter in the record relative to the new claim: this useless expense to the parties producing only annoyance and inconvenience to court and counsel, especially in the event of appellate proceedings. And what advantage could result from this course of proceeding? Time would not be saved, because it would take as much time to mature the suit on the new claim asserted by an amended, as though asserted by an original bill. The only effect would be to save the plaintiffs from a decree for the costs of the suit touching their abortive claim; and this is an effect which certainly does not recommend such a proceeding to the favour of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The cross bill is but a pendant to the original, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>object and function of which is to qualify or modify the relief that is sought by the original bill. But as that relief would not be granted though the cross had not been filed, the cross bill is supererogatory, ought to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">I am of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The decree of the Court of Appeals was entered in the following terms: \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u201c The court being of opinion that whatever elaim the appellants, or either of them, have by substitution to the rights of the United States, or as co-sureties of' H.

Craighill in the land, at the sheriff\u2019s sale of the property surrendered by him on his discharge, pending this suit,, as an insolvent debtor, those claims cannot be adjudicated in this case, they not being embraced by the pleadings, and will remain without prejudice from the decree of the court below, or the affirmance thereof by this court; and being further of opinion that there is no error in the said decree,\u201d the same is appirmed, with COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
