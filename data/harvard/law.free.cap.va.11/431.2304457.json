Waller, his executors, and desired they should not be required to give security. The will was dated the 28th December, 1831. The executors, Clarke and Waller, proved the will in the Hustings Court of Petersburg, at January term 1832, and both qualified as executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYN\">The testator\u2019s son and legatee, John L. Myrick, was, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, an infant of very tender years. The Hustings Court of Petersburg, at its August term 1837, appointed Andrew Kevan guardian of the infant. But at the next September term, on the motion of the executor Waller, who represented that he was appointed testamentary guardian of the infant by his father\u2019s will, that he desired and intended to qualify as such, and that Kevan had been appointed guardian, without previous summons or notice to him, as the statute required. The Hustings Court made a rule on Kevan, to shew cause why his appointment should not be revoked. Both parties appeared at November term, Waller insisted that Kevan\u2019s appointment was irregular and illegal, and that it should be revoked, and moved the court to permit him to qualify as testamentary guardian; and Kevan insisted that his own appointment was regular and legal, and opposed Waller\u2019s motion for permission to qualify as testamentary guardian of the infant. The Husting\u2019s Court revoked Kevan\u2019s appointment, but at the same time overruled Waller\u2019s motion to be permitted to qualify as testamentary guardian. Kevan excepted to that part of the sentence which revoked his appointment to the office of guardian, and Waller to that part of it which denied' him permission to qualify as testamentary guardian. And both parties appealed to the Circuit Superior Court of Petersburg. Waller carried up his appeal. But Kevan did not prosecute the appeal he had taken. However, upon the hearing of Waller\u2019s appeal in the Circuit Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Court, Kevan appeared and contested Waller\u2019s claim to the wardship as testamentary guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-4\">The Circuit Superior Court held, that, as Kevan had failed to prosecute his appeal from the sentence of the Hustings Court, which revoked his appointment to the office of guardian, the propriety of that revocation was not examinable there; that the sen-fence of revocation was to be considered as in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">The Circuit Superior Court also held, that the executors of the testator, John Myrick, were by his will appointed testamentary guardians of his infant son;: but yet held it proper to hear parol or any other legal evidence, to shew that Waller ought not to be permitted to qualify as guardian. On this point, then, a good, deal of evidence was introduced on both sides, which, was made part of the record by bill of exceptions filed, by Kevan; but it is unnecessary to state it here, since the cause was decided by this court upon the construction and effect of the will. The Circuit Superior Court thought that no good reason was shewn by the evidence why Waller should not have the wardship; and therefore reversed the sentence of the Hustings Court, which denied it to him, and remanded the cause to that court, with directions to permit him to qualify as testamentary guardian, according to the provisions of the statute concerning guardians, &amp;c.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> From which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>sentence Kevan, by petition to a judge of tbis court, pray.ecj an appeaij which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AeQ\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Macfarland, Rhodes </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-7\"><em>The counsel for the appellant </em>maintained, that the will of the testator, John Myrick, did not appoint his executors guardians of his infant son. The provisions of the first section of our statute, concerning guardians, &amp;c., were taken (not literally indeed, but substantially,) from the English statute 12 Car. 2, ch. 24, and, therefore, the adjudications of the English courts on their statute, would afford us a guide for the exposition of our own. The best and fullest judicial exposition of the English statute, would be found in the opinion of the chief justice, in <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Constable, </em>Vaugh., 177, the material points of which were well abstracted in 3 Bac. Abr., Guardian, A 3, p. 405. The English and the Yirginia statutes both authorized a father, by deed or will, to grant or devise \u201cthe custody and tuition \u201d of his infant child. They said, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>word <em>tuition, </em>in those statutes, did not mean <em>education, </em>in the ordinary sense of that word: it was used in its proper sense, and meant <em>guardianship. </em>At all events, the phrase \u201ccustody and tuition,\u201d was the exact definition of <em>guardianship; </em>and so it had always been understood. Neither statute prescribed any particular form of such appointment; and it was equally true in the construction of both, that it was immaterial by what words the guardian was appointed, provided the father\u2019s intent was sufficiently apparent. But, then, the father\u2019s intent must distinctly appear, to give the custody and tuition of his child\u2019s person, not merely the care of his estate; to appoint a guardian for the child, not a trustee, to manage the estate given to the child, and to apply the profits to his use, whether for his education or otherwise. This appeared clearly from the propositions deduced from the opinion in <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Constable, </em>that neither before nor since the statute of 12 Car. 2, ch. 24, might an infant directly devise his lands, yet an infant might, within that statute, dispose of the custody of his child, and that disposition would draw after it the land as incident to the custody, Yaugh., 178; and that the testamentary guardian would, as incidental to his office, have the custody, not only of the lands descended from or left by the father to the child, but of all lands and goods in any way acquired or- purchased by the infant, Id., 185-6; but, that if a father of full age should devise his land to J. S., during the minority of his son and heir, in trust for the son, and <em>for his maintenance and education </em>during his minority, \u201c this would be no devising of the custody within the statute, for he might have done this before the statute,\u201d Id., 184. The devise of the custody of the child\u2019s person, then the appointment of a testamentary guardian, carried with it authority over all the ward\u2019s estate; the devise of a trust or authority over the estate given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>father to the child, with whatever latitude of disereQr por whatever purpose, even for the express purpose of his <em>maintenance and education, </em>did not carry with it the custody of the child\u2019s person, the tuition,, the guardianship. Then, adverting to the will in the present case, whereby the father gave 15,000 dollars-to his infant son, to be invested by his executors in-bank or other stock, as they should think most advantageous to the legatee, and from the profits \u201c to&gt; educate him in the best manner, under the direction of his executors, and the surplus to be vested in like-manner or stock;\u201d they insisted, that the trust here confided to the executors, was to invest, manage and improve that particular fund, and at the most, to direct the manner of his education, and out of the profits of that fund to defray the expense of the best education; that there was not the least manifestation of any intent to give the executors the care and management'of any other estate of his son but that which the-testator bequeathed to him, or any authority to apply the profits of any estate which his son might otherwise acquire, to the purpose of his education, or to his use in any other way. And if the testator\u2019s intent was only to confide to his executors the care and management of the estate he had given to his child, and the direction of his education to be defrayed out of the profits of that estate, he intended to confide a trust them far short of the office of testamentary guardians. Here was \u201cno devising of the custody within the statute, for he might have done this before the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-4\">The testator expected and intended, that Mrs. Turner-should have the care of his child\u2019s person, during-the early part of his infancy at least; he gave her a handsome legacy, in consideration of the trouble she had had, and <em>would afterwards have, </em>in rearing and attending to him. How, if the <em>will </em>had appointed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>'executors guardians of the child, and Mrs. Turner had insisted on keeping him under her own care ing his early infancy (as probably she did), the <em>statute </em>would have given the testamentary guardians an aelion of ravishment of ward or trespass against her, to recover their ward and damages for her detention \u25a0of him. But to hold that they would have been entitled to such an action against Mrs Turner, were to set at nought the plain wishes of the father in regard to the care of his child\u2019s person, the preservation of his health and life. And if they could not have recovered the custody of the child from her, they were \u2022not testamentary guardians. Indeed, Mrs. Turner might have claimed the custody, the testamentary .guardianship, of this infant, with much more plausibility than the executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-6\">Granting that the testator meant to give his executors the utmost latitude of discretion that can possibly be inferred from his will, in respect to the manner .and expense of his infant son\u2019s education, yet the \u25a0grant of such control and discretion over his education would not have constituted them his guardians; for the <em>guardianship </em>of an infant may be expressly devised to one, and the direction, or a share in the direction, of his <em>education, </em>confided to another. <em>Duke of Beaufort </em>v. <em>Berty, </em>1 P. Wms. 702-6; <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Spann\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>2 Brock. C. C. R. 81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">They said, it would be found, on examination of the \u25a0cases which had arisen upon testamentary appointments of guardians, that either the <em>custody </em>of the infant was expressly devised; or there was an express appointment of a guardian or tutor, <em>eo nomine; </em>or all (not a part) of the powers essential to the office of guardian were granted. They referred for instances, to <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Constable, Duke of Beaufort </em>v. <em>Berty, </em>and <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Spann\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>(before cited); <em>Eyre </em>v. <em>Countess of Shaftsburg, </em>2 P.

Ca. Abr. 486, pl. 16, best reported by the name of <em>Lady Teynham </em>v. <em>Lennard, </em>4 Bro. P. C. 302. According to the two former reports, the infant\u2019s father <em>said, </em>on his death-bed, that he expected his father would take care to <em>educate his child in the Protestant religion, </em>and not leave the <em>education </em>of it to his wife, (she being a Papist;) and these <em>words </em>were held a good appointment of the grandfather guardian. According to-Brown\u2019s report, the state of the case was thus: \u201cRichard Barrelt, (whose wife was a Roman Catholic,) being sensible of the prejudice it might be, not only to his child and family, but also to the Protestant religion, especially in Ireland, did, in his last sickness, and not long before his death, direct that, his father should have <em>the care and tuition </em>of such child when born, alleging that his wife had always promised it should be bred up a Protestant; and this direction was reduced to writing, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>way of memorandum or instructions for a will, but before tbe same could be prepared in form, BarrettN died.\u201d The contest for the guardianship of the infant was between the Homan Catholic mother and the Protestant grand-father, who, being himself infirm, named two persons, to whom he desired the guardianship might be committed. The Court of Chancery appointed the grand-father\u2019s nominees guardians of the infant. On appeal to the house of lords, the\u2019appointment of the grand-father\u2019s nominees to be the guardians, was reversed, but it was decided that the guardianship was not assignable, and that the grand-father in person should have the guardianship. How, they said, it was plain, that there was, in that case, no testamentary appointment of a guardian, within the statute, 12 Car. 2, ch. 24, for by that statute, such appointment could only be made by deed or will, in writing, in the presence of two or more credible witnesses; but the father\u2019s directions on his death-bed, were, at the most, only a nuncupative will. Nor was it pretended, in the argument, that the grand-father had been appointed testamentary guardian of the infant, but only that the lord chancellor, to whom by the law of the land it belonged to appoint guardians for infants, did right m giving the guardianship to the Protestant nominees of the Protestant grand-father, to whom the father wished to confide the <em>can and tuition </em>of his child, in preference to the Homan Catholic mother. The religion of the parties to the contest for the guardianship, was the real ground of decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-4\">They concluded, that the appellee \"Waller, had no claim to the guardianship of this infant by testamentary appointment of his father. And on this point they rested the case. But they suggested, that even if the Circuit Superior Court was right in holding that the will made an appointment of testamentary guardians for the infant son, the appellee was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>sole guardian; both the executors had equal right to participate in the guardianship; and the Circuit Court erred in directing that Waller alone should be peruiitted to qualify, without summoning the other executor Clarke, to say whether or no he also would qualify as guardian, according to the second section of the statute concerning guardians, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALS\"><em>The counsel for the appellee </em>argued, that as the testator gave to his executors the whole care and management of the estate he had given to his infant son, during his minority, and gave them the direction, in other words, the control, of his <em>education, </em>he confided to them all the essential attributes that belong to the office of guardian. Of these, the direction of the education of the infant was far the most important. <em>Education, </em>they said, comprised the training of the body, of the understanding, of the heart; the breeding of the youth, nurture, instruction in letters, manners, morals and religion. The executors could not direct the education of the infant in the best manner, according to their own judgment, without having the disposal of his person, to place him where such best education could be bestowed on him. The right conferred on the executors to direct the infant\u2019s education, therefore, carried with it, by plain and inevitable implication, a perfect right to the custody and disposal of his person. If the right and duty to hold and manage the infant\u2019s estate, and to direct the manner of his education, and dispose of his person so as best to accomplish the purpose of educating him, and the consequent right and duty to maintain him, did not constitute all the attributes of the office of guardian, what attribute of that office was withheld ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-5\">They insisted, that the grant of the <em>education </em>of the infant in this will, was exactly tantamount to the grant of the <em>tuition </em>in the statutory sense of the word, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>entered into a criticism of those words to shew that they were equally comprehensive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-4\">They said, the case of the <em>Duke of Beaufort </em>v. <em>Berty, </em>established no such proposition as that an absolute control and direction of the <em>education, </em>could be separated from the <em>guardianship, </em>of an infant, and the <em>guardianship </em>confided to one, and the <em>education </em>to another. In that case, the testator expressly appointed two of his friends guardians of his infant sons, and only recommended to the guardians to take the advice of the Duke of Ormond in the education of his eldest \u25a0son; there was no question who were entitled to the guardianship; th\u00e9 only question was, whether the guardians should consult another who was not appointed one of the guardians, in the education of the \u25a0infant. It was determined, that the guardians, in the execution of their office, ought to follow the testator\u2019s recommendation, and consult the Duke of Ormond, or the persons whom the court substituted for him; not that the persons with whom the guardians were to advise, might direct and control them in the education of their ward. In the present case, the absolute \u25a0uncontrolled right and duty to direct the education of the infant, as well as the care and management of the estate given to him, was confided by the testator to his executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">The argument for the appellant rested mainly on propositions extracted from the opinion of the chief justice in <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Constable: </em>but it nowise appeared what was the point in controversy in that case, or who were the parties to it, or how it was decided, or whether it was ever decided; it only appeared, that the court was equally divided upon the case before it, whatever it was. The case could not be considered authority to any purpose. In <em>Meades </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>the testator did not confide to his wife the care and management of the whole property which he had given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>his children, which was very large, but only directed' _g <em>qqq </em>a year should be given to his wife, out of\u2019 his own estate, for the maintenance and education of' cluilcLreiu, while they should continue to live with her and at her charge; and Lord Hardwicke thought that might amount to a devise of the guardianship,, but he gave no absolute opinion, not because he doubted, but because the case did not require him to-decide the point. The present case, they said, afforded far stronger grounds to imply a grant of the guardianship of the infant; the care and management of the infant\u2019s whole estate; the right and duty to direct his education, (which included, as they had shewn, his maintenance, his nurture, and the disposal of his person,) with no limitation, but that the expense should be defrayed out of the profits of the estate, (the very limitation imposed by our statute on all guardians, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 108, \u00a7 9,26;) every authority, every duty, which concerned the welfare of the testator\u2019s infant son, was confided by this will to the executors. If Lord Hardwicke doubted, in <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>whether the testator\u2019s will devised the guardianship of his children to his wife, he could hardly have doubted whether Mr. Myrick\u2019s will devised the guardianship of his child to his executors. Taking Brown\u2019s report of <em>Lady Teynham </em>v. Lennard, as the best and fullest report of that case, it is apparent that Barrett\u2019s deathbed direction being, that his father should have the care and tuition of his child, in order that he should be bred up a Protestant, that is, <em>educated in the Protestant religion; </em>these were held apt words to appoint the grand-father guardian of the child: else, why was it held by the house of lords that the grand-father could only take and exercise the office of guardian in person; that the office confided to him was not assignable to others; and that the Court of Chancery had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>no authority to appoint other fit persons to be guar- \u201e dians f</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayf\">The legacy bequeathed to Mrs. Turner in consideration of the trouble <em>she had had, and would afterwards have, </em>in rearing and attending to the testator\u2019s son from his infancy, did not warrant the inferences which the appellant\u2019s counsel deduced from it. She had had the same care of the child during the father\u2019s life, which she was expected to have after his death; and as the care she had had of him during the father\u2019s life, was nowise incompatible with the father\u2019s right of custody and guardianship of his child, so neither was the care she was expected afterwards to have in rearing and attending to him, incompatible with the office of the testamentary guardians who were placed <em>in loco parentis.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-10\">As to the objection to the sentence of the Circuit Superior Court, because it directed that \"Waller should be permitted to qualify as testamentary guardian, without summoning Clarke to accept or renounce the office,, they said, the authority of testamentary guardians was joint and several, like that of executors, and, therefore, either of several testamentary guardians might qualify alone. <em>Eyre </em>v. <em>Countess of Shaftsburg, 2 </em>P. Wms. 103, 107-8. Besides, the permission of Waller to qualify' as guardian, would nowise hinder Clarke also from qualifying as such, if and whenever he thought proper to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-12\">Lastly, they submitted, that Kevan had no right to appeal from the sentence of the Circuit Superior Court, declaring Waller\u2019s right to qualify as testamentary guardian. The Hustings Court had revoked its appointment of Kevan to the office of guardian; and though he had appealed from the order of revocation, he never prosecuted that appeal, and therefore the propriety of that revocation was not examinable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the Circuit Superior Court, and of course could not examined here; he was no longer guardian, and had no interest in the controversy as such. In the seParafe question, whether Waller was appointed testamentary guardian or not, after his own office of guardian was revoked, he had no interest whatever. A person could not make himself party to any controversy, without shewing some interest in the subject or the question.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\"> 1 Rev.

Kevan, the appointed guardian of young Myrick, was summoned, at Waller\u2019s instance, to shew cause why he should not be removed, he Waller claiming that he had been appointed testamentary guardian, and not having been summoned or notified according to law, to declare'his acceptance or renunciation of the office. Kevan was removed .by the Hustings Court of Peters-burg by which he had been appointed. Waller then moved to be permitted to qualify; Kevan opposed this motion; and it was entered of record that he did so. The Hustings Court rejected Waller\u2019s motion; and Waller appealed. How although, if the two cases are considered as distinct, Kevan\u2019s right of appeal might have created some doubt, if he had failed in the Hustings Court; yet as he succeeded, and Waller appealed, Kevan was properly before the Circuit Superior Court as a party; and as that court reversed the sentence of the Hustings Court, and gave judgment against <em>him for costs, </em>there can be no doubt, I think, of his right of appeal from that judgment. The question is then fairly brought up as to the merits of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">I put out of the case all question as to the power of one of two testamentary guardians to qualify without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the other. I take it to be clearly and properly settled, under the statute concerning testamentary guardians,1 that the authority conferred is joint and several; that it is not a naked authority, hut coupled with an interest; that if one dies, it will go to the survivor; that where one refuses, the other may qualify without him; that each is a complete guardian, if the other does not qualify. It would he most mischievous if, where there are several appointed, and some refuse to act, the rest should not be able to do any thing; and yet this must he the consequence, if the appointment of several should he held to be one joint naked authority; a construction which would make the act of little force, and the more guardians a father should appoint for the security of his child, the less secure he would be, since the refusal of one would defeat the authority of all. 2 P. Wms. 102, 107-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The real question in the case is, whether the will of Myrick constituted Waller and Clarke the guardians of his child? And here I shall concede, that it has been decided (whether wisely or not, may perhaps he questionable) that the use of the term guardian, or other express words of appointment, is not necessary, nor is it material by what words the guardian is appointed, provided the father\u2019s intent be sufficiently apparent. Yet, with this concession, I am still of opinion, that, as the father\u2019s authority is an innovation upon the common law, and in derogation of the rights of the mother or other kindred who would be entitled to he guardians by nature, the declaration of his intention should he distinct and unequivocal, and in terms inconsistent with the existence of the power and authority of the natural guardian. And if the language of his will is clearly reconeileable with the rights of such natural guardian, it should not he strained, by piling inference upon inference, so as to take them away. Thus, in the present case, the mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>if alive, or the grandfather if she he dead, are the guar\u00bfqang ]3y nature of this child. From the tie of blood, the law looks upon them as his natural protectors. But as the father may be presumed to know to whom it would be safest to entrust him, the law defers to his judgment; yet it surely will not be eager to presume that the father intended to tear his child from the tender cares of a mother, or other kindred, and to place his person, his fortunes and his education, in the hands of a stranger. Before we arrive at such a conclusion, the language must be clear and cogent; and moreover, the direction given to the stranger must be incompatible with the guardianship in the next of kin, or it cannot fairly be presumed to be designed to take it away. For if the intent can be fully satisfied short of annihilating the natural guardian\u2019s power, we are not authorized to go one step farther.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Such appears to me to be the present case. Here is a grandfather of the child yet living. Why should we presume, that the father intended to take from the grandfather, his natural friend and protector, this only child, and place his person and all his property, in the hands of Waller and the grandfather jointly? Because he has ordered, that he shall be \u201ceducated in the best manner, under the direction of his executors ? \u201d Is this order incompatible with the rights of the natural guardian? What -more was meant, than that Waller and Clarke should prescribe the course, and point out the mode, of his education, to the person having the guardianship ? Such directions that person would indeed be bound to follow: because, even before the statute, the father had the power of directing the course of his child\u2019s education, and a court of equity would enforce a compliance with his will. Since the statute, it is yet more clear; the greater power of appointing a guardian, comprehending that of directing the education, or giving power to direct it. Accordingly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the case of <em>Beaufort </em>v. <em>Berty, </em>where the testator appointed two guardians, and recommended that should take the advice of the Duke of Ormond, as to the education of the wards, Lord Macclesfield recognized the validity of this recommendation, hut the Duke of Ormond being attainted, the authority was held to devolve upon the great seal, and the chancellor thereupon directed that the guardians should take the advice, and follow the counsel, of the Duke and Duchess of Grafton, who were relations of the wards. Here, then, the guardianship was in two persons, and the \u201cdirection of the education,\u201d in two others. And is any thing more common, than for a father, who is solicitous about his child\u2019s education, to declare his wishes that some friend, in whom he has confidence, should have the <em>direction of his education, </em>without designing to burden him with the guardianship, the custody of his person, and the management of his fortunes ? Such a construction would defeat its very object; for a friend might be very willing to discharge the duty of an adviser or director of the child\u2019s education, who would be unwilling or unable to take upon himself the guardianship. That great and excellent man, our former fellow labourer, and one of the lights and ornaments of this court, (the late Judge Carr,) recommended that his son should be educated under the direction of myself, in conjunction with his wife. It may be safely affirmed, that he never designed take the guardianship of his boy from that excellent lady, or to vest in me any power over his person or his estate.' Certain it is, I never dreamed of such a construction of his will, whilst I should have faithfully complied, as far as I was able, with his wishes. should never have supposed it necessary to enter into bond, with security, before I could have recommended a course of study or instruction, nor should I have thought myself entitled to qualify as a guardian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>take the child and his estate from his mother\u2019s hands, case she did not qualify also. I have mentioned this ease merely as furnishing an actual instance of a provision similar to that at bar, in which the construction contended for by the appellee, would obviously have violated the wishes of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">From what has been said, I think it clear, that an authority to direct the education of a child, may be exercised by one, while the guardianship (that is, the custody of his person and property,) may be in another. The two things, then, are not incompatible, and if not incompatible, the gift of the former is no derogation of the latter. To me, indeed, it appears that the very provision, that a child shall be educated under the direction of an individual, implies the custody by one person, and the direction of the education by another. Had the testator in this case designed to confer the guardianship, he would have conferred it <em>totidem verbis, </em>since it would have been the most natural and obvious mode of expressing himself; or had he designed that his child\u2019s education should be <em>directly </em>conducted by the executors, he would have said that he should be educated by them; but, in declaring that he should be educated <em>under their direction, </em>there is the strongest implication of agency in some other,- who was to be subject to their direction. That other was-the guardian. The clause in question is indeed imperfect.: he gives his son 15,000 dollars, \u201cand from the proceeds to educate him.\u201d Here is something\u2019 wanting, something to be supplied, but what, is not so clear. Yet it is clear, that the words \u201cmy executors,\u201d are not the omitted words, for if they are inserted it will make the sentence absurd. It will make the testator provide that his executors shall educate' him, under the direction of his executors. Either the testator intended some other person, or he intended to speak impersonally; and, in- either case, he seems-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to have looked to his child\u2019s education being conducted by others, though under the direction of executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The statute concerning guardians, &amp;c., and the interpretation of the word <em>tuition </em>there used, were the subject of much discussion at the bar. That word I certainly do not understand in the narrow sense of <em>instruction </em>or <em>education; </em>it is used in the broader sense of' <em>protection, superintendence, guardianship; </em>it comes from the Latin <em>tueor, </em>to defend; and hence its radical signification is <em>defence. </em>This is also implied by the word <em>guardianship; </em>which, however, is yet broader, for it implies <em>custody; </em>its root is the Anglo-Saxon <em>wardian; </em>which signifies <em>to look, to look after, </em>and thence by transition, <em>to guard, to keep; </em>and so implies <em>custody. </em>The-word <em>guardian </em>is derived immediately from the French. <em>gardien, </em>which itself comes from <em>wardian; </em>the <em>w </em>being; converted, as is usual, into <em>g. </em>Richardson\u2019s Diet. 1 Toolce\u2019s diversions ofPurley, 332-4, 2,Inst.., 305. Thus,, <em>guardianship </em>includes the idea of <em>custody; </em>and <em>custody and tuition, </em>as used in the statute, constitute guardianship\u201e.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Admitting, therefore, that no particular words are-necessary in a will for the appointment of a testamentary guardian, it may safely be affirmed, that the language must be such as to imply a right to the <em>custody, control, </em>and <em>protection </em>of the ward. This I do not think can be fairly implied from the provision, that the child shall be educated under the direction of the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The word <em>education, </em>here, is obviously used in the narrow sense of <em>instruction, </em>and does not imply <em>tuition, </em>and much less <em>custody. </em>But it is contended, that we must infer a right of control over the education, from the right of direction; a right to the possession of the person from such right of control; and the powers of a guardian over the estate from the right to the possession of the person; and thus, from the simple power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to direct the course of education or instruction, the appeqee eiaims <em>f0 </em>]je invested with the custody of person and estate, and a guardian\u2019s power over both. I cann\u00b0t consent thus to build inference upon inference, of which I am persuaded the testator never dreamed. I must have somewhat more than a single case, and \u25a0that too of doubtful authority and analogy, before I will pile consequence upon consequence, for the purpose of vesting in a party the largest powers over the person and estate of an orphan from so remote an implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">If indeed we look to authority, I think the case of the appellee.will not be much better than without it. The case of <em>Lady Teynham </em>v. <em>Lennard </em>stands alone, and may well be suspected to have been partly decided under the influence of religious jealousy and intolerance. It occurred in the very heat of sectarian controversy, early in the reign of George I. and turned on the dangers of entrusting the education of a child to a Papist mother. It was, moreover, stronger than this case; for there were in that case words of exclusion of the natural guardian; the testator said, he \u201cexpected his father to take care of the education of his child in the Protestant religion, and not leave the education of it <em>to Ms wife.\u201d </em>Against this case may fairly be opposed the case stated in <em>Bedell </em>v. Constable, where even a devise of land to <em>J. </em>S. during the minority of the testator\u2019s child, for his maintenance and education, was held not to constitute him guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to en-quire, whether the evidence adduced to shew Waller\u2019s unfitness for the office, would have justified the refusal to permit him to qualify, even if he had been really appointed a testamentary guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the sentence of the Circuit Superior Court be reversed with costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u25a0and the sentence of the Hustings Court refusing 'Waller permission to qualify as guardian affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Sentence reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
