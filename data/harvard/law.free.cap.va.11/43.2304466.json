And as no part of the waters of the creek were to be diverted into the Tuckahoe canal, it was, according to the original plan of the work, to be supplied with water from the James River \"canal, by a feeder taken from its upper level, which was high enough to supply water to the lateral canal for its whole extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">The charter of the Tuckahoe Canal Company was altered, at the instance of the compapy, by an act passed on the 11th January, 1828; whereby the company was authorized to make a railroad on so much of the ground intended for the location of the canal, as the company should deem expedient; provided that it should not thereby obstruct any private roads or ways, or such other roads as were convenient for persons traveling to Tuckahoe mill; to make navigable any part of Tuckahoe Creek lying between the James River canal and the mouth of Buck Branch by deepening the same, or, if necessary, by erecting a dam and lock for raising the water of the creek, so that it should not be raised more than a foot above the ordinary level; provided it should not charge more than a <em>sixth </em>(instead of <em>&amp; fourth) </em>of the whole toll, for the navigation from Buck Branch to the James River canal: and to cross the Tuckahoe at any point above Tuckahoe bridge on the main road, so as not to raise the water in Tuckahoe mill pond, or the creek above it, higher than its then level, or to obstruct the course of the water in the mill pond or the creek.

From the head of the. navigation to the dam mentioned in the last act, the-improvement was made by deepening the Tuckahoe,. in some parts, clearing away obstructions, and so rendering it navigable, and by cutting canals, in other-parts, whereby the stream was straightened; from the dam to the mouth of Buck Branch, a canal was cut,, which was supplied with water partly from the Tuckahoe, and partly by a feeder from the James River canal; and at the mouth of Buck Branch, locks were constructed to connect the canal with the stream of the Tuckahoe, which was deepened and rendered navigable from the locks to the James River canal. The canal from the dam to Buck Branch crossed the main road from Richmond to Goochland courthouse, a bridge being made across the canal for the road to-pass over, high enough to admit the passage of any boats along the canal, which could be used in the navigation, in the then state of the improvement.

But The James River and Kanawha Company having proceeded, under its new charter, to enlarge that canal, so as to afford navigation for boats of much larger burden, and to conduct the canal in that part on a higher level than the Tuckahoe, a corresponding change in the construction of the lateral Tuckahoe canal was thereby rendered necessary. And by an act of assembly passed the 9th April, 1838, The Tuckahoe Canal Company was authorized to increase its capital to the amount of 30,000 dollars, and to enlarge the dimensions of its canal and works, and to alter the construction thereof, in the manner provided in the act.

That the' Canal Company had a right, not only to enjoy the profits of its work, free from obstruction, in the then state of the improvement, but also to enlarge and improve its canal, so as to correspond with the late improvement of the James River canal. And that the erection of bridges for the projected railroad, especially the erection of the upper bridge, at the elevation proposed, would obstruct or impede the navigation of the canal, and the use of the towing path, even in the then state of the work; and would utterly prevent the Canal Company from enlarging and improving its canal, so as to correspond with the late improvement of the James River canal, and to afford a navigation for boats of the same dimensions and burden with those that navigated the James River canal, as enlarged and improved. Therefore, the bill prayed an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to restrain The Tuckahoe and James River Railroad Company from constructing any bridge or railroad, or arch of any kind, across the Tuckahoe canal. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">The Tuckahoe and James River Railroad Company, <em>J 7 </em>in its answer, insisted, that The Tuckahoe Canal Company was nowise entitled to the aid of the Court of Chancery, because it had not in fact constructed its canal, and kept it in repair, so as to afford a navigation for such boats as navigated the James River canal at the time the Tuckahoe canal was constructed, and because the Canal Company had from the time of the completion of the work (which, the defendants alleged, was completed as early as 1831) continued to exact full tolls, yielding an enormous profit on the capital actually expended, and had never made any such report to the board of public works as the company was bound by law to make, in order that the board might determine whether it was proper to reduce the tolls. That the Canal Company had acquired no legal title in the land upon and through which it had dug its canal, but claimed only under an executory contract with Mr. \"Wickham, which had never been executed by deed; and therefore, any part of that land was still liable to be condemned, as the land of Mr. Wickham, for the use of the Railroad Company. That, as against the Railroad Company, the Canal Company had no right to enlarge and improve its canal so as to correspond with the late enlargement and improvement of the James River canal, since it could only claim such right under the act of assembly passed on the 9th April, 1838, and the charter of the Railroad Company was passed on the 27th March, 1837, under which the Railroad Company had been incorporated, had commenced its work, and had made great progress therein-before April, 1838. That the Railroad company had a right to construct its road on any route it thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>proper, between the'two points mentioned in its char- and to cross tbe line of the Tuckahoe canal, provided the road should be so constructed as not to ob-g\u00a3ruC\u00a3 or impe(je the navigation of the canal; and that, jn fact, the railroad bridges would nowise obstruct or impede the navigation of the actual canal, since they were to be erected at \u00e1n elevation greater than that of any of the bridges which the Canal Company had itself erected across the canal. That, at all events, the Railroad Company had a right to construct its road so as to cross the canal, in the manner proposed, even if it should thereby obstruct or impede the navigation of the canal, in which case the Canal Company would only be entitled to compensation in damages; and that the Court of Chancery had ho jurisdiction to interfere by way of injunction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">In March, 1839, the-Circuit Superior Court dissolved the injunction, so far as the same restrained the Railroad Company from erecting a bridge for its road, across the canal, at an elevation of <em>six feet or more </em>above the <em>toioing path </em>of the canal. The Canal Company applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the order; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-7\">The cause was argued here, by <em>R.

They referred to the cases of <em>The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company </em>v. <em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 4 </em>Gill &amp; Johns. 1, and <em>The Proprietors of the Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>The Proprietors of the Warren Bridge, </em>11 Peters 420. The last case, they said, went to as great a length as any other case (and, they thought, farther than any other) in upholding the right of the legislature to take away, iir effect, the whole substantial benefit of corporate privileges which it had itself previously conferred. The question there presented to the court was, whether by a subsequent act of incorporation, a state legislature could constitutionally confer on a junior company, the right of constructing an improvement, which, <em>by establishing a direct and ruinous competition, </em>would impair, if not destroy, the franchise of an elder existing corporation which it had previously chartered ? On that question the Supreme Court of Massachusetts was equally divided: the Supreme Court of the United States, by a divided court (four judges to three) held the affirmative. In that case, the main question was as to the extent of the franchise of the elder corporation; the Charles River Bridge Company insisting, that its franchise had a reasonable extent beyond ferry ways and the timbers of the bridge, so as to prevent ruinous competition; and the Warren Bridge Company maintaining, on the contrary, that the charter of the other company must be strictly construed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and its franchise confined to the ferry ways and the timbers of the bridge. But no one denied, that within the ferry ways and the timbers of the bridge the fran\u00bf\u00a1\u00bfgg wag gacre\u00bfp It was not pretended, that the legislature of Massachusetts could confer on the \"Warren _ . . . . Bridge Company, a right to construct its bridge between the same points, or to throw it over the Charles River bridge, or to appropriate to its use the ferry ways, or the <em>termini </em>of that bridge, or either of them, even though the access to it, or the passage or transportation over it, should not be thereby obstructed: \u2022to have done that, it was admitted, would have been \u25a0to invade the paramount and exclusive right which the Charles River Bridge Company had in its own bridge and ferry ways, and would have involved a \u25a0direct and .unconstitutional violation of its undoubted franchise. The argument for the Warren Bridge Company was (and such was, substantially, the opinion of a majority of the Supreme Court) that the fran\u2022chise of the Charles River Bridge Company was confined within the limits before mentioned, and the construction of the Warren bridge was, therefore, no violation of it; and that as to the loss of the tolls, with which the Charles River Bridge Company was threatened, that was a consequential damage resulting from \u25a0a lawful act, <em>damnum absque injuria, </em>for which the elder company had no redress. Admitting, then, the authority of the judgment of the Supreme Court in that \u2022case, yet so far from sustaining the claim set up by -the Railroad Company in this case, to make bridges across the appellants\u2019 canal, they said it was a direct authority against the appellees on that point. However, they controverted the propriety of thejudgment of the Supreme Court by which the claim of the Warren Bridge was sustained against the rights of the Charles River Bridge; founding themselves on the arguments of Judges Story and M\u2019Lean, who dissented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>from the majority of the court. In the controversy between The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company and The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, the latter, which was the junior corporation, had actually selected the route and had the land condemned for its road, when it was arrested by an injunction from the chancellor of Maryland, which he afterwards dissolved. The Court of Appeals of Maryland held, that the Canal Company had, under its elder charter, a prior right to select the route for its improvement; and that this right of selection (though it had not yet been exercised) was a vested franchise in the Canal Company, which no subsequent legislation could abridge or impair ; and, therefore, reversed the decree, and perpetuated the injunction. It appeared, indeed, in that case, that the railroad, on the route selected for it, would render the construction of the canal impracticable; but, as Chief Justice Buchanan said, that was <em>\u201c </em>a question not of <em>principle </em>but of degreeand the court expressly held, that the Railroad Company could not be permitted, in the selection of its route, to interfere \u2022with, impair, or in .any way abridge, the prior and paramount right of choice vested in the Canal Company by its charter. Row, if it was a violation of the charter of The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, to interfere with its right to select the route for its canal, before that right was exercised, much more would it be a violation of the charter of The Tuckahoe Canal Company, to interfere with the route of its canal, after it had been selected, after. the company \" had purchased a right in the lands on the route for the work, and had completed its canal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\"><em>The counsel for'the appellees </em>answered, that the legislature had unquestionable power, after having chartered a company to make a particular improvement for public accommodation, without any provision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>no rival improvement or competition, should after-wards he authorized, in other words without contract or design to give a monoply, to grant a charter to ancomparLy to make an improvement of the same or of a different kind, to afford the like or the same accommodation as the former, however the work of the junior company might impair, or even destroy, the profits of the elder. If the legislature had not such power, they said, the whole legislation of the country on such subjects, had been founded in error and injustice. They referred to very numerous instances in the statute book, in which the legislature had authorized the establishment of rival ferries, rival toll bridges, rival turnpike roads, to serve the purposes of the same travel and transportation, from which established and ancient ferries, and previously chartered toll bridges and turnpike roads, derived their profits. And hitherto, none had ever questioned the power of the legislature to authorize such competition, however injurious or ruinous it might be to the proprietors of older rights and works of the same kind. The propriety of authorizing such competition was a question of expediency, not of the legislative power. It was competent to the legislature too, to authorize one improvement of the kind to cross the line of a former improvement, provided the use of the older improvement was not thereby obstructed. Thus, it had chartered the Portsmouth and Weldon Railroad Company, though its road was of - necessity to cross the road of The Petersburg and Roanoke Railroad Company: it had chartered The Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Company, though its road would necessarily cross the Manchester turnpike, the Manchester Railroad, and the Richmond and Petersburg turnpike, all of which had been' constructed under previous charters. In these instances, the right of the junior companies to cross the lines of the\u2019older im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>pr ovements, had never been, and could not be, doubted: but the charters of the junior companies did not, (they admitted) could not, without providing just compensation, give them any right to obstruct the use the former improvements. It was the duty of the ju- . . ,, ,. \u201e <em>r </em>. mor companies, m crossing the lines o\u00ed \u00edormer \u00edmprovements, to avoid the least obstruction to the use of them. The whole question in the present case, then, and the only question that could arise in any case of the kind, was, whether the Tuckahoe and James Elver railroad crossing the Tuckahoe canal, at the two points, according to the projection of the road, would, or could, obstruct or impair the navigation of the canal? And this, they said, was a mere question of fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-18\">II. <em>The counsel for the appellants </em>insisted, that the charter of The Tuckahoe and James Eiver Eailroad Company, neither gave, nor was intended to give, that company any right to cross the line of the Tuckahoe canal. The <em>termini </em>given for the railroad were such, that it was nowise necessary that it should cross the canal; and it appeared by the evidence, that a route might have been selected for the road altogether east of the canal, which would have been equally eligible as the route that was adopted, excepting some difference in the expense. Had it been intended, that the railroad should or might cross the canal, it would have required but a few additional words to express the purpose. And had it been so intended, the legislature would not have failed to provide some proper process for ascertaining, whether, in crossing the canal, the road would obstruct the navigation of it, or in any way impair the rights of the Canal Company, and for compensating it for any damages it should thereby sustain. The charter of the Eailroad Company, not being intended to confer upon it any such right, provided no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>such process. And, they said, there was no general law providing any such process, that could possibly he held applicable to the case. They entered into a critiea] examination of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th sections of the general railroad law of 1886-7, ch. 118, \u25a0 f\u00b0r tib-e purpose of shewing,.that those provisions authorized incorporated railroad companies to purchase or have condemned for their use, only such <em>lands and tenements </em>as belonged to individuals; such as could be laid oft' by metes and bo\u00fands, and full possession thereof taken; such as had not been previously condemned for public use, or for the use of other public companies chartered to construct works of internal improvement: that they by no means authorized the condemnation, over again, of lands which had been already acquired or condemned for public use, or for the use of other chartered companies; much less did they authorize the condemnation of the rights and franchises of an established corporation for the benefit of another corporation. They did not deny, that the legislature <em>might </em>authorize the condemnation of property already before condemned for the use of a chartered company, or even the franchises of the company, for\" the purpose of improvements of paramount importance, providing at the same time just compensation to the owners: they only denied that the legislature had done so in this instance; and, they said, it had never done so, in any instance to be found in the' history of our legislation. But if the provisions of the general railroad law could, by any violence of construction, be applied to a case like this, yet, they said, the appellees had availed themselves of those provisions, and had not acquired, or attempted to acquire, any rights under them. That statute provided compensation in all cases in which it authorized the condemnation of property; otherwise, it would have been unconstitutional. <em>Crenshaws </em>v. <em>The Slate River </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Co. </em>6 Rand. 245. Therefore, if the statute authorized the appellees to have the property, much more the corporate franchises, of the appellants, condemned for the use of the railroad, it also provided a process for ascertaining the damages, and required that just comsation should he paid. Sensible of all this, the appellees had insisted in their answer, that the appellants had not acquired the <em>legal title </em>of the land through which they had made their canal; that the <em>legal title of the soil </em>was still in Mr. Wickham; and that they had a right to have the same land condemned as the land of Mr. Wickham, for the use of their railroad. It did not appear by the record, that the appellees had procured the condemnation of the land as Mr. Wickham\u2019s land; hut if they had, they could only have acquired, by such a proceeding, the rights of Mr. Wickham; namely, the naked legal title, subject to the equity of the appellants to call for a conveyance, according to their agreement with Mr. Wickham, and subject to-their exclusive right, under that agreement, to the use of the land for the purposes of their canal, without obstruction from Mr. Wickham, or any person claim'ing under him. Row, it could hardly he pretended that Mr. Wickham, or any one claiming under him*, would have had a right to erect bridges over the canal, without the consent of the Canal Company, even if-' such bridges would not obstruct the navigation of the canal, much more if they would obstruct it;</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-4\"><em>The counsel for the appellees\u25a0 </em>answered, that the charter of The Tuckahoe and James River Railroad Company, gave The' Tuckahoe Canal Company the preferable right to construct the railroad from the lands of Mrs. Ellis in Henrico to such point on the James River canal as the company should select; and if it should decline to undertake the work, then the act. incorporated the new company to construct \u201c the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>roacl.\u201d It could not be doubted, that if tbe Canal Company had undertaken tbe work, it might bave so constructed tbe road as to cross tbe line of tbe canal; ^bat it might have selected any point on tbe James River canal, whether west or east of tbe Tuckahoe, for the <em>terminus </em>of tbe road; and if it selected a point west of that creek, tbe road must bave crossed tbe line of tbe canal. Tbe Railroad Company was authorized to construct \u201ctbe said road;\u201d its rights were measured by tbe previous grant to tbe Canal Company; it bad the privilege of selecting any route for tbe road which tbe Canal Company might bave selected; it bad a right to select a point west of tbe Tuckahoe, for tbe <em>terminus </em>of tbe road on tbe James River canal. It followed, that tbe Railroad Company was authorized, by its charter, to select any route for its road, which it should deem, most eligible, whether it should cross tbe lino of tbe canal or not. But again, tbe charter referred to tbe general railroad law, and made tbe provisions of that statute part of tbe charter, for ascertaining and regulating the rights and duties of tbe Railroad Company. And the 16th section of tbe general railroad law expressly provided, that \u201cwhenever, in tbe construction of any railroad, it should be necessary to cross <em>any established road or way, </em>it should be tbe duty of tbe president and directors so to construct their railroad, as not to impede tbe passage or transportation of persons or property along tbe same.\u201d Row, tbe Tuckahoe canal was only an <em>established %oay; </em>and tbe appellees bad a clear right to run their railroad across it, only taking care so to construct tbe road as nowise to impede tbe navigation. They said, tbe appellees did not claim a right to condemn the bed of tbe canal, or tbe towing paths, or any rights, whether legal or equitable, which tbe appellants bad acquired therein; much less did they claim a right to condemn for their use tbe corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>franchises of the appellees. They only claimed the right to have condemned for the abutments of their bridges, the lands of Mr. Wickham on both sides of the canal, in which the appellants had acquired rights, legal or equitable; and then to construct their bridges across the canal* but only so to construct them as not to obstruct the canal itself, or the towing paths, or to impair in the least the rights of the appellants. So that the question again came round to the question of fact, whether the Tuckahoe and James River railroad, crossing the Tuckahoe canal at the two points, according to the projection of the road, would, or could, obstruct or impair the navigation of the canal?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-4\"><em>The counsel for the appellants </em>replied, that the 16th section of the general railroad law, in authorizing railroad companies to cross <em>established roads or ways, </em>meant the ordinary highways of the country, not such ways as a navigable canal made by a corporate company under authority of its charter. And this, they said, clearly appeared from the context; for the provision not only authorized railroad companies to <em>cross, </em>but where they should cross, to <em>change, </em>established roads or ways; and it could not be pretended that the statute intended to authorize a railroad company to change the course of a navigable canal, made under an older charter, at the points where the railroad should cross it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">\u00dcI. <em>The counsel for the appellants </em>earnestly contended, that the construction of the railroad bridges across their canal would materially impair their corporate rights. According to the projection of the railroad by the appellees, the upper bridge was to have crossed the line of the canal at an elevation of <em>six and a half feet </em>above the <em>ordinany level </em>of the water in the canal, but only <em>three and a half feet </em>above the <em>towing path. </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>bridge would, probably, have impeded the passage of boats along the canal at <em>high water; </em>and, certainly, it would have prevented the passing of a horse of ordinary \u00bfze al0ng the towing path. It was in vain to say, that the elevation of the bridge above the ordinary level of the water in the canal, was greater than that of the bridges which the Canal Company had itself made, for the main road and the private ways over its canal: the Canal Company had the right to raise its own bridges to greater elevations at its pleasure; but it would have no right to raise the viaducts of the railroad when they should once have been constructed. The Circuit Superior Court dissolved the injunction it had awarded, so far as it restrained the appellees from erecting bridges for their road across the canal at an elevation of <em>six feet </em>or more above the <em>tewing path </em>of the canal; and this might, possibly, obviate' the impediment to the navigation of the canal in the existing state of that improvement. But what the counsel chiefly insisted on, was, that even with such additional elevation of the <em>viaducts </em>for the railroad,, they would impede and prevent the navigation of the canal, when it should be enlarged and improved, so as to correspond with the late improvement of th&amp; James Eiver canal, and to afford a navigation for boats of as great dimensions and burden as could navigate the James Eiver canal in its present enlarged and improved state. They contended, that the Tuckahoe Canal Company, under its original charter, independently of the act of the 9th April, 1838, had a right to enlarge, improve and alter its canal, so as to connect the navigation thereof, and to make it of equal capacity, with the James Eiver canal. At the time the Tuckahoe Canal Company was chartered, the James Eiver canal had been completed according to the laws which authorized that work; its level, its dimensions, its navigable capacity, from Tuckahoe creek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>to Richmond, were all ascertained. The purpose of the charter of the Tuckahoe Canal Company was to provide a lateral navigation, corresponding in level, in dimensions and capacity, with the then level, dimensions and capacity of the principal canal; if the lateral had not corresponded with the principal canal, in navigable capacity, its utility would have been comparatively trivial; and if the lateral canal had been constructed upon a lower level than that of the principal, it would have been of little or no use. The Tuckahoe Canal Company, therefore, so constructed its canal as to connect the navigation thereof with the James River canal, and to adapt the one to the other.. And after the Tuckahoe canal was completed upon this principle, the construction of the James River-canal, by authority and upon the requisition of the-legislature, was wholly changed, its dimensions enlarged, its capacity improved, so as to afford navigation for boats of much greater burden than before;; and especially, it was conducted on a higher level than formerly; and thus, the connexion of the lateral navigation with, and its adaptation to, the principal canal, was destroyed. The Tuckahoe Canal Company had a clear right, without any new authority from the legislature, to make a corresponding alteration in the level, the dimensions, and the capacity of its canal; since in so doing, it would accomplish the precise purpose for which it was originally chartered, and without so \u25a0 doing, the pro'fits of its improvement to itself would be much reduced, perhaps wholly lost,, and the advantage to the public materially impaired,, if not annihilated. It had a right to agree with the James River and Kanawha Company, for water to supply its canal so enlarged, and with the land owners for the additional land which the enlargement should require: and surely, the commonwealth could not exact a forfeiture of its charter for usurpation, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>by her own act, she had made the enlargement of the work necessary. Then, if the Tnckahoe Canal Company had the right to make such alteration, enlargement and improvement of its canal, it was impossible projected bridges of the Railroad Company across it, might, and would, directly interfere with, hinder and prevent the exercise of its corporate rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\"><em>The counsel for the appellees </em>answered, that it was quite certain, that the projected bridges for the railroad across the Tuckahoe canal, would not obstruct the navigation thereof, in the present state of the improvement, since the elevation of the bridges, and the \u2022spaces between the abutments, were greater than those of the bridges which the Canal Company had itself made over the canal. As to the claim set up for the \u25a0Canal Company, to enlarge and improve its canal, so :as to make it correspond with the James River canal in its enlarged and improved state, they said, it could maintain no such claim, as against the Railroad Company, under authority of the act of the 9th April, 1838, because that act was subsequent to the charter of the Railroad Company. And it could maintain no such claim under its original charter, for this conclusive reason (if for no other) that the charter required, that the work which it authorized, should be completed within five years from the act of incorporation, and provided that if it should not be completed within that time, the rights conferred by the charter should cease and determine. The term of five years had long since expired. The charter gave the Canal Company no authority <em>now </em>to construct a new work. This claim to enlarge the canal was founded on nothing like <em>right; </em>for such a work would depend absolutely on the will and pleasure of the James River and Kanawha Company, from whose canal alone the water could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>supplied for such, an enlargement of the lateral canal; on the will and pleasure too of the owners of the lands on the lateral canal, there being now no process <em>by </em>which additional lands could he condemned for a use. Besides, they added, when once a navigation company like this, had projected and constructed its work, and the term within which its charter required the work to be completed had elapsed, the company had no right so to enlarge the capacity of the canal, as to affect the rights or interests of other persons. <em>Blakemore </em>v. <em>Glamorganshire Canal Navigation, </em>1 Mylne &amp; Keene 154, 6 Condens.

The question as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to interfere, by way of injunction, to restrain the Railroad Company from constructing bridges for its road across the canal, was discussed at the bar, 1st, on general principles, and 2ndly, on the construction and effect of the 13th section of the general railroad law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\"><em>The counsel for the' appellants, </em>1, to shew the general jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery to interfere, by injunction, in cases of this kind, cited, among other authorities, <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Van Ingen, </em>9 Johns.

And 2, they said, that the 13th section of the general railroad law referred to the provisions of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th sections, which authorized Railroad Companies to purchase, or have condemned for their use, such <em>lands and tenements </em>as they should select for the purpose, and before purchase or condemnation, to take possession of such <em>lands and tenements, </em>and to proceed in the construction of their roads: and the 13th section provided, that no injunction should he-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>awarded to stay the proceedings of such companies in the prosecution of their works, \u201cin the meantime,\u201d namely, before or pending their proceedings to purcpase or pave condemned for their use <em>such lands and tenements. </em>But this section nowise took away the jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery to injoin a railroad company from invading a <em>franchise, </em>which the previous provisions of the statute had not authorized it to have condemned. And this was the injury which the appellants complained of here, and asked the court to prevent by injunction. Besides, the statute directed, that no injunction shall be awarded, \u201cunless it be manifest, that the Bailroad Company are transcending the authority given them by the act, <em>and </em>that the interposition of the court is necessary to prevent injury that cannot be adequately compensated in damages.\u201d They said, the word <em>and </em>ought to be construed or, so as to leave the Court of Chancery free to exercise its preventive justice in either of the cases mentioned: but if they were right upon the merits, the appellees were transcending the authority given to them by the statute, <em>and </em>their proceedings would produce irreparable injury to the appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\"><em>The counsel for the appellees </em>contested the general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to interfere by injunction, in a case circumstanced as this was: but, however that might be, they maintained, that the 13th section of the general railroad law was conclusive against the jurisdiction. That provision ought to be so construed as to fulfil the policy that induced the enactment; which was to save railroad companies from the mischief of having their work arrested at every step, and their improvements indefinitely suspended, by the process of a Court of Chancery; a suspension, which must result in serious loss to them, if it should not render it impossible for them to complete the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>within the time prescribed by their charters. There was no reason, why a <em>franchise </em>should be held more sacred than the <em>land </em>to which it was annexed, or the land of a <em>corporate company </em>more carefully than the land of an individual, or an <em>equitable </em>title more than a <em>legal </em>title. The statute in question intended no .such distinction. Whatever might be the opinion of the court upon the merits, they said it seemed to them impossible, that any court could think it \u201cmanifest\u201d that this Railroad Company was transcending the authority given to it, or that the injury which the Canal Company sought to prevent, was such as <em>\u201c </em>could not be adequately compensated in damages.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-5\"> The general law concerning turnpike companies, 2 Rev.

The separation of the legislative and judicial powers, and the inhibition of the invasion by the. one of the powers of the other, demands that we should be cautious lest we transcend our own limits, in the attempt to confine a co-ordinate branch within its legitimate boundaries. We must carefully distinguish between legislative discretion and legislative power. With the former we have nothing to do, however harshly or injudiciously it may have been exercised. With us, this question is a question of power, not a question of the judicious exercise of it. With these views of our authority to pronounce upon the constitutionality of a law, I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>considered the questions submitted in this case with earnestness due to their importance.</p>\n<p id=\"AYdv\">The first appears to me to admit of no reasonable j-fc pag peen contended, that a charter having peen granted to the Canal Company for the construe- <em>\u00b0 </em>, , . ,. . . tion o\u00ed a canal along a certain line, it is not within the constitutional power of the legislature to grant another charter for another improvement running side by side with the first, although in the first charter there is no express grant of exclusive right, and although the second improvement does not cross the line of the first. On the other hand, it is contended, that if the grant contained in the first charter be not exclusive, if the law which created it has not provided that no rival improvement shall be constructed by legislative authority, it is at all times competent to the legislature to grant new charters to rival companies upon the same line, even though the value of the first may be impaired or utterly annihilated thereby. In the latter opinion I concur. Such legislation may be, and indeed often is, unwise, unjust and ruinous; but those are considerations which are in vain addressed to us, where the legislative body acts within the pale of its authority. That authority knows no limit but the charter of the government, and in that charter the only relevant provision is that no law shall be made impairing the obligation of contracts. The question then resolves itself into this:' Has the legislature contracted with the Canal Company, that it shall have the exclusive transportation of the Tuckahoe valley, and that no rival company shall be incorporated which may impair its profits or take away its custom ? That it has expressly done this, cannot be pretended. The act of incorporation contains no such provision. Is such a contract on the part of the government to be <em>implied </em>from the grant of the charter for the construction of the canal ? I think not. It can never be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ceded, that the incorporation of one company for internal improvement, is an implied negative of all ture power in the legislature to incorporate other companies for other improvements. Such has never been the interpretation of legislative grants in Virginia, but wherever exclusive rights are intended, express provisions are introduced for the purpose of tying up the hands of the legislature, and restricting the future exercise of legislative power. It never was dreamed, that the establishment of one bank was in itself a negative on the power to establish others. It never has - been admitted, that making one railroad was a negative to all future power to construct another which might rival it; but where that was the design of the charter, it has ever been so expressed; as in the act of 1833, ch. 3, \u00a7 38, the rights of the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad Company are expressly protected, for a limited time, against all rival charters. Were it otherwise, what difficulties would present themselves! Without express and definite provisions and limitations, how could we ascertain the extent of the exclusive right? Experience has proved, that monopoly is very ingenious in extending its rights and enlarging its pretensions. Give it the <em>carte blanche </em>of an implied contract, and we should soon find it without other limit than the limits of professional ingenuity; and the great mischief would at once present itself, of the improvement of the country being arrested by the perpetual objection of interference with chartered rights. Chartered companies are ever sensitive at the approach of a rival, and if the discovery of a possible clashing of interests shall be held sufficiently to nullify a subsequent charter, it is impossible to foresee to what extent the legislative power may be crippled in this important branch of its duties. Already have we seen the passage of an act incorporating a railroad company from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Norfolk to Weldon most vehemently opposed by a former company established between Petersburg and Roanoke. So the making a railroad from Richmond ^ Lynchburg was warmly opposed by the James River and Kanawha Company, And here we see the Tuckahoe Canal Company insisting that their privileges are invaded by the chartering of the Tuckahoe and James River Railroad Company. If these pretensions are listened to, there will soon be an end of the necessary improvement of the country. But they are without foundation. Monopoly is not a matter of inference.. It must rest its pretensions upon express grant. It is a restriction upon common right, and upon legislative power, and cannot be implied. What then is here insisted on? Is it a monopoly of the \u25a0right to take tolls for the transportation on the canal? If this be all, we cannot gainsay it. The canal is their own property; and property necessarily implies a right in the owner, to the exclusion of all others. Is it a monopoly of the right to the transportation of the Tuckahoe valley? If so, the claim is not admitted. Upon the principles maintained by their own counsel, it is denied. What right, upon those principles, has the legislature to take from the colliers the liberty of transporting their coal by wagons, or in any other mode they may elect? What right to prevent their purchasing from the landowners the necessary ground, and constructing a railroad <em>without a charter? </em>So far as respected the Canal Company, the Railroad Company needed no charter to legalize their operations, if they did not cross the canal. It was only necessary to enable them to condemn the lands of others, and to sue and be sued. They do not <em>derive </em>their right to make such a road for transportation of coals from legislative grant. They would have had that without it, and it could never be affirmed, that a charter to them invaded the previous charter, since, so far as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Canal Company are concerned, a charter would have given them nothing more than they had had before, <em>viz: </em>a right to withdraw their coals from the canal transportation, and to transport them by land for themselves and others, according to their own pleasure and ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">After the very able and comprehensive investigation of this subject in the case of <em>The Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>The Warren Bridge, </em>it would be superfluous as well as vain for me to attempt or enforce by any arguments of mine, the principles established by the majority of the court, and sustained with such conspicuous ability by the counsel for The \"Warren Bridge. It will suffice for me to refer to that case, and to express my assent to the proposition it establishes, that the incorporation of a company for the construction of a bridge or other improvement, where the public interest is concerned, is not to be construed as conferring exclusive privileges, where none such are expressly given by the charter; and, by consequence, that by charters of this description the legislature is not deprived of the power of granting other charters to other companies, even side by side with the former, and in the same line of travel, provided there is no express restriction upon their power in the first act of incorporation. Every principle of sound policy, indeed, forbids that this should be lightly done; or that it should be done without securing some indemnity to those who suffer under such legislation. But it is not matter of right in the company; it is matter of discretion in the legislature; and hence, it is very clearly no matter for judicial decision. The injury done is not more direct than that which is in various instances occasioned by laws of unquestioned validity. The inns and villages upon every public road fall into dilapidation and ruin, upon the change of the course of travel by the construction of a railroad, and flourishing towns which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>have risen to wealth and importance on the faith of law, by being made a port of entry, sink into insignificance upon the removal of their custom houses more favoure(j Sp0ts. Yet who doubts the <em>power, </em>though many may doubt the wisdom of the legislature, iu making ill advised changes, which bring ruin upon the enterprising, and misery upon thousands? This sport with human prosperity and happiness, indeed, cannot be too much reprobated; but its corrective is to be found elsewhere, and not <em>here, </em>unless the legislature transcend its <em>power; </em>and we have already seen, that unless exclusive rights are contracted for, the legislative <em>power </em>is without a trammel.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The case before us, however, is unlike any that has heretofore occurred, in one very important particular. The Tuckahoe Railroad Company set up a pretension to run their road <em>across </em>the canal, on a bridge of a certain elevation. They are not content with passing on side by side with their rival, but they assert a right by their charter to <em>cross </em>his line of improvement. This brings us to the inquiry, how far the legislative*power is adequate to the grant of such a right? And here, I imagine, the right of eminent domain, which rides over every other, will be found sufficient for the purpose. It is well observed by my Brother <em>Brooke, </em>in his lucid opinion in the case of <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Upper Appomattox Company, </em>3 Leigh 337, on the subject of the <em>jus publicum, </em>that \u201cthough our institutions and laws are justly tenacious of private' rights, yet the ruling principle of them is, that where <em>private </em>rights come in conflict with <em>public, </em>the former must yield to the latter; in which event, the legislature alone is competent to make compensation.\u201d It may, indeed, be truly said, that this <em>jus publicum, </em>this eminent domain, is the law of the existence of every sovereignty. It is as vital to it as air to animal life; and hence, it has no limit but the necessities of the body politic, of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that body alone must be the judges. It is absolute over the persons, as well as the property, of its members. It commands the sacrifice of life, as well as the surrender of possessions; and it would be strange, deed, if to that sovereignty which can compel me to lay down my life in its service, the power should be denied of taking my property for its uses. At this time of day, it is too late to set up any barrier to that power. It has been in constant exercise since the existence of society, and must continue unrestricted so long as society shall last. It has been exerted in the establishment of every common road through the country; in the erection of public buildings, the condemnation of land for public improvements, the impressment of property <em>flagrante </em>hello, and in various other modes not necessary to be here stated. In its exercise, however harsh, it never has been deemed to be a violation of individual right, or a breach of contract with the subject, either express or implied. For though the sovereignty has granted its land, or its privileges, without an express reservation of a right to take them for public uses, yet that right is necessarily implied; and even if alienable at all, it is not to be presumed to be surrendered without an express abandonment. As was observed by Chief Justice Marshall of the taxing power, \u201c The whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished, and that community has a right to insist that its abandonment should not be presumed where the deliberate purpose to abandon does not appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">It seems to be supposed, however, that the rights of the Canal Company which are called a franchise, cannot be invaded, though the power to take other private property for public uses may not be denied. It is proper, then, to come to a proper understanding of this word franchise, that we may the better comprehend what is to be regarded as trenching upon it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Now, I take a <em>franchise </em>to be, 1. an incorporeal hereditament, and 2. a privilege or authority vested in certain persons by grant of the sovereign, (with us, ^y gpec^a\u00a1 gtatute) to exercise powers, or to do and perform acts which without such grant they could not do or perform. Thus, it is a <em>franchise </em>to be a corporation, with power to sue and be sued, and to hold property as a corporate body. So it is a <em>franchise </em>to be empowered to build a bridge, or keep a ferry, over a public stream, with a right to demand tolls or ferriage ; or to build a mill upon a public river, and receive tolls for grinding, &amp;c. But the <em>franchise </em>consists in the incorporeal right; the <em>property </em>acquired is not the franchise. A bank has a right to purchase a banking house: <em>when purchased, </em>is the <em>house </em>a franchise? Surely not, for it is <em>corporeal, </em>whereas a <em>franchise </em>is <em>incorporeal. </em>So of a railroad company: it has the franchise to condemn land for its road, which at once becomes vested in the company in absolute property; but the <em>land </em>is not the <em>franchise. </em>It is real property held by the company upon the same implied terms, on which others hold <em>their </em>lands, that it may be taken for public uses upon compensation being made. Indeed, in former days, the eminent domain in the establishment of roads was exercised (as we are reminded by Judge Brooke in the case before cited) without compensation; but it is now very wisely and justly provided by the constitution, that in all cases where private property is taken for public uses, just compensation <em>shall </em>be made to the owner for his loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">It is not then perceived that the property of a corporation is less liable to the exercise of the <em>jus publicum, </em>than the property of a private individual. In both eases, the private right must yield to the necessities of the public, and in both the public must make compensation for the loss. In the former, indeed, the necessity is more apparent; for were it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>otherwise, the greatest mischiefs would ensue. The James River Canal running east and west, and the railroads running north and south, might very seriously impede the intercourse between the different parts the state, if the companies have the right to prevent the passage across their line of improvement, and the <em>jus publicum </em>cannot be exercised in the creation of new roads to meet the growing exigencies of the country. A person fifty yards from his mill, or county courthouse, may be driven to the necessity of traveling miles around to reach them, or of submitting to the unreasonable exaction of a monopolist. It would be difficult to make him comprehend, how the legislative power could extend to taking away <em>his </em>land to make the railroad, and could cut <em>him </em>off from his ordinary comforts and conveniences, and yet be inadequate to the exercise of the eminent domain in giving him a right of passage across the line of the improvement thus constructed to his detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Upon the whole, therefore, I think it was competent to the legislature to empower the Railroad Company to cross the line of the canal, whether the Canal Company be regarded as the proprietors of the soil, or of a mere right of way. If they are proprietors of the soil, then they hold it by the same tenure that every man holds his land; that is, subject to the <em>jus publicum. </em>If it is a mere right of way to which they\u2018have title, the argument applies with yet more force, since the power to condemn the land itself is'greater than that of condemning an easement upon it. In the exercise of this power, however, it must never be forgotten, that a just compensation for rights or property condemned must always be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">But several questions here present themselves: 1. Is it necessary to the validity of the act, that compensation should be provided <em>before </em>the property can be taken ? The constitution provides, that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>shall pass no law whereby private property shall be for public uses without just compensation. And although there is no express requisition that the act invades the right shall provide the indemnity, yet, after much reflection, I incline to the opinion that it should do so. The instances which may occur <em>flagrante </em>hello, of impressments and destruction of property, though at first view they may seem to indicate a different construction, yet are rather to be referred to the necessities which war imposes, when the safety of the state is the supreme law, and justice is silenced by the din of arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">2. Conceding, as I readily do, that the question of compensation is a judicial question, and that it is not in the power of the legislature to settle it, since this would be to unite judicial and legislative powers, and to enable the government to decide in its own case, it may next be asked, whether an act invading private property will be held to be void, when it clearly appears to the judicial tribunal, that no injury is done, and nothing taken, which will entitle the party to compensation? To this I should answer in the negative; for however proper and prudent it might be to provide for the establishment of that fact by the ordinary proceedings, yet if, upon full investigation before the proper tribunal, no injury should appear, we should be justified, I think, in considering the statute as not in conflict with the spirit of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"ATt\">In the present case, however, these questions are unimportant, if it shall appear that by the Railroad charter a method <em>is </em>provided for ascertaining and making compensation for property necessary for the road. Row, this I think clear, by the reference in the charter itself, to the general railroad law, as the law of the company. According to that law, they are bound to proceed to condemn the lands necessary for their road. If the Canal Company are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u2022owners of the soil where the road passes their line of improvement, the Railroad Company should have it condemned as <em>their </em>property; if they are not the owners of the soil, they should have proceeded condemn the property as Mr. Wickham\u2019s property, have purchased his rights by private contract; and in either case, they would hold subject to the easement of the canal, precisely as he held it. The record does not shew how this matter is, nor is it material to the question we are considering; for the charter having duly provided for compensation, it is not void, although the company may have failed to pursue its provisions. That is a matter to which I shall have occasion presently to refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We proceed next to inquire, whether the charter authorizes the Railroad Company to cross the line of the canal. This must be decided by reference to several acts: 1. The charter itself, which fixes one <em>terminus </em>of the road at Mrs. Ellis\u2019s land: the other <em>terminus </em>is declared to be such point on the James River canal as the Railroad Company may select. 2. It then vests in the company the liberty to construct their road subject to the provisions of the general railroad law. 3. By the provisions of that statute, the company have a right to <em>enter </em>upon all lands through which they may desire to conduct their road, and to lay out the same according to their pleasure. By this provision, then, they were invested with unlimited power to locate the road between the two <em>termini </em>as they pleased. If, then, the location so made crossed the canal, the law authorized them to cross it; and we have already seen that such authority was within the competence of the legislature to .give. The only obligations upon the company are to avoid encroaching on the dwelling houses, &amp;c., and to pay for the property taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We have, then, it is conceived, established these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>two points: that the Railroad charter is not unconstitutional, and that it authorizes the company to cross the line of the canal. Upon what terms, is the next qlies^on pe solved ? And here, there is some diffieulty in ascertaining from the record what is the state of the fact. It does not appear whether any proceedings have been instituted by the company, or the proprietor, for the condemnation of the land and the assessment of damages. Certain it is, that the Railroad Company cannot pass the canal, without being responsible to the owner of the land for the damages done by the condemnation. In what manner the Canal Company may be entitled to compensation for any injury <em>they </em>may sustain, and to what extent, it\" would be premature in this case to inquire. Satisfied', as I am from the record, that they are not the owners-of the soil, either legally or equitably, and that they have only title to an easement, I have no doubt that the <em>land </em>should be condemned as Mr. Wickham\u2019s. I am also of opinion, that when so condemned,.the title-to the land will vest in the Railroad Company, <em>subject\u25a0 to the easement; </em>and that <em>they </em>will be bound, as Mr. Wickham was bound, not to obstruct or impair its enjoyment. Whether it would be practicable for them, if they so desired, to extinguish that easement by any proceeding now known to the law, it is not necessary in the present state of things to inquire. Our only concern is to know, whether they have undertaken to \u25a0 exercise their right of passing the canal prematurely.. It seemed to be considered by the counsel, that the condemnation must precede the execution of the work.. This is, I conceive, a misconception of the law. The company have a right to proceed with their work before condemnation; and, indeed, there is no absolute obligation on <em>them, </em>to institute the process for assessing the damages to the land, since in case of their default the owner himself may do so. It is,, therefore,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>clear that the work is not to be suspended until the damages are assessed and paid; and this is rendered more undeniable by the 13th section, which in connexion with the previous sections, provides, that the mean time\u201d (that is, while the process of valuation . . ... . . .. ....... or assessment is going on) \u201cno injunction shall be awarded to stay the proceedings of the company <em>in the prosecution of their works, </em>unless &amp;c.\u201d It was then necessary, that the damages should have been assessed and paid before the company proceeded to. the erection of their bridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">\"With these views of the law of this ease, I cannot perceive that the Railroad Company have, in any respect, \u201ctranscended the authority given by the law,\u201d' in proceeding to erect their bridges over the line of' the canal. Nor can I perceive, that they have done,, or are about to do, any injury to the Canal Company which cannot be adequately compensated in damages. On the contrary, it is palpable, that (apart from the competition, which we have already shewn the Canal Company cannot complain of) there is no injury done them whatever. The railroad bridges are much higher above the water than their own bridges. Every load which can pass the canal bridges will be wholly unobstructed by the railroad bridges, while boats that can pass the latter would be obstructed by the former. It is, therefore, not true that any injury whatever, and much less an <em>irreparable </em>injury, has been done, or is likely to ensue. The interference by injunction was, therefore, improvident, and in direct conflict with the statute, and with the established principles of a Court of Equity. I am, therefore, of opinion, wholly to dissolve it, and to dismiss the bill. It will be at its own peril if the Railroad Company so erects its bridges as to obstruct or impede the easement of the canal. It has not yet done so. When it does, it will be time enough to invoke the extraordinary powers of a Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of Equity, by shewing the danger of actual and irreparable injury. It will then also be time enough to decide how far the Canal Company have power to ex-^en(j easement, either laterally, or by raising their bridges, and removing as a nuisance that which is erected by the Railroad Company. Those inquiries, at this time, appear unnecessary and premature.</p>\n<p id=\"ALH\">According to this opinion, the decree of the Circuit Superior Court was right in dissolving the injunction, but erroneous in imposing the restriction as to the height of the bridges. It ought to have been wholly dissolved, as improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Decree, that the Circuit Superior Court ought TO HAVE DISSOLVED THE INJUNCTION AS IMPROVIDENTLY AWARDED, WITHOUT IMPOSING ANY RESTRICTION AS TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FRIDGES, AND THAT THE SAID ORDER IS ERRONEOUS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
