The wife is appointed executrix, and qualifies as such. Afterwards she sells the leasehold estate, and makes a deed in. her individual name (not calling herself executrix) transferring to the purchaser all her right, title, interest and property in the premises. On a bill by the daughter against the purchaser.. Held : The execution of the deed by the executrix in her indi- \u2022 vidual name does not prove that the act was done in the- character of legatee, and she must be considered as holding as execu- \u25a0 trix at the time of the deed, unless there be evidence establishing that she had previously taken as legatee. <em>Accord.

Woodworth covenanted to put on the-lot a brick house, of a particular description,, specified in the lease. And it was agreed that at the expiration of the seven years, Wright should have the liberty of taking the buildings at a fair valuation, to be made in the following manner: Wright having, given Wood-worth or his representatives sixty days notice previous, to the end of the lease, each party was- to choose one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>person, and those two another, and the three together ^w0 o^rs, making five persons in the whole, who were to fix a value on the buildings; payment to be made to Woodworth or his representatives at such valuation, in three instalments of two, four and six months, and thus the lease to end; but in case Wright should think proper to continue the lease for the further term of seven years, he had a right to do so, on the same terms and conditions specified for the first seven years. At the expiration of the fourteen years, Wright might still continue the lease for successive terms of seven years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuG\">On the 17th of May, 1806, Dudley Woodworth made his will, whereby, after bequeathing to his wife Lu\u2022cretia Woodworth his household furniture, to his sister-in-law Elizabeth Hestle 100 dollars, and to his sister Clarissa Roath 100 dollars, he then bequeathed as follows: <em>\u201cItem, </em>I give and bequeath unto my respected father, Jasper Woodworth, 50 dollars <em>per annum, </em>to 'be paid out of the rent arising from the brick house which I hold on a piece of land leased of Stephen Wright, during the term of his natural life and no\" longer. <em>Item, </em>I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Lucretia Woodworth, one-half of the rent arising from the brick house which I hold on a piece of land leased of Stephen Wright, after deducting and paying the legacy to my father, Jasper Woodworth, during her natural life and no longer. <em>Item, </em>I give and bequeath unto my daughter, Harriet Woodworth, one-half remaining of the rent arising from the brick house which I hold on apiece of land leased of Stephen Wright, after deducting and paying the legacy to my father, Jasper Woodworth, to her and her heirs; and in case of her death, it is my will and desire that the whole shall go to my wife, Lucretia Woodworth, after the above mentioned legacy to my father is paid.\u201d After a further devise and bequest to his daughter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>testator desired that all the residue of his property should he sold for the payment of his debts; and might remain of the proceeds after paying his debts, he gave to his wife. The will was admitted to record on the 28th of July; 1806, and Lucretia Woodworth qualified as executrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">On the 15th of March, 1810, a deed ivas made from Lucretia Woodworth (by her individual name, not calling herself executrix,) to John Bonnaud, assigning and transferring to Bonnaud, for the consideration of 6,000 dollars, all her right, title, interest and property, in the leased premises. Bonnaud gave a deed of trust to Peter Hestle, as trustee, to secure to Lucretia Wood-worth 5,000 dollars of the purchase money. It was made for her benefit, by her individual name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">A valuation of the buildings was made the 27th of June, 1811. It amounted to 5,642-dollars. Wright, on the first of August, 1811, paid that sum to Bonnaud, and Bonnaud on the same day conveyed the buildings to Wright, who from that time had possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">At the time of the death of Dudley Woodworth, his daughter Harriet was from three to five years old. Peter \u00cdTestle was the father of Lucretia Woodworth, and the grand-father of Harriet. Hestle qualified as guardian of Harriet, in December, 1811, and died two or three years after the last war. Lucretia Wood-worth .married Francis Wright, about the year 1814 or 1815, and removed to the city of Washington in 1816 or 1817. They carried Harriet Woodworth with them to that city, and she was not in Virginia after-wards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-8\">Harriet having married Jabez Burehard, Burchard and wife, on the 18th of January, 1832, filed their bill in chancery, to obtain the benefit of the provision which the testator intended for his daughter by the clauses of the will above recited. Lucretia Wright, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>in her own right, and as executrix of Dudley Wood-worth, John Bonnaud, Stephen Wright and Jasper Woodworth, were made defendants. Francis Wright died before the suit was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgP\">The bill prayed, amongst other things, \u201cthat the said Lucretia, executrix, as aforesaid, may be required 'to assent to the legacy bequeathed to your female complainant aforesaid.\u201d Whereas the bill was obviously framed upon the idea that the deed to Bonnaud passed the right which Lucretia Woodworth had as legatee, :and nothing more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">Bonnaud answered, that his contract with Lucretia Woodworth wa? in the character of executrix; that he paid her 1,000 dollars in that character, on the delivery \u2022of possession, and secured the payment of the residue, which he shortly after paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">Wright answered, that finding the property in the '\u2022occupancy of Bonnaud, who appeared by a conveyance from Lucretia Woodworth, to have purchased the lease ;and improvements, he treated with him as the assignee \u2022of the lease, paid to him the valuation thereof, and took from him a deed for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">Upon these answers, (supposing the allegations of the bill to be sufficient,) the question arose, whether Lucretia Woodworth had held as legatee prior to her deed to Bonnaud?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">On this question, the fact principally relied on was a-payment on account of the legacy to Jasper Woodwoi\u2019th, the evidence of which was the following receipt:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">\u201cNorfolk, April 29th, 1809. Received from Oapt. Peter Nestl\u00e9 ten barrels of flour, amounting to 77 dollars and 50 cents, and 50 dollars cash; the whole-of which is on account of a legacy due to Jasper Wood-worth, and is to be passed to the credit of Mrs. Lucretia Woodworth, executrix of Dudley Woodworth, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u25a0ceased, the cash being just given by Mrs. Lucretia Woodworth for the purposes aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">[Signed.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">Benjamin Ames.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-9\">Teste:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-11\">Frs.

For the 5,000 dollars for which Bonnaud had credit, he gave a note, as well as the deed of trust before mentioned, and this note appeared to have been assigned by Mrs. Wood-worth to her cousin John T. Deitrick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-14\">The Circuit Court of Norfolk borough decreed that the bill of the plaintiffs should be dismissed as to the defendants John Bonnaud and Stephen Wright, and .that the plaintiffs should pay them their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-15\">From which decree, on the petition of the plaintiffs, .an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-16\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_L\">What will amount to ;an assent to a legacy is treated of in Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, 456-7, and the passage for which Flowden, 540, is there cited as authority is applicable to this case. The doctrine was discussed in this court in <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Leigh, 687. But the case most in point is <em>Young </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>1 Str. 70. For the legacy to Jasper Woodworth being payable out of the rent, and a charge upon it, the payment of that legacy was, according to the case just cited, an assent to the legacy of the rent to the wife and daughter. The circumstances too support this idea. The bill charges that the testator died wealthy, owing little or nothing. The will shews that for the payment of debts other property was directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>to be sold. It is not pretended by the answers that was any occasion to sell this property for debts; and the proofs shew that there was none. Moreover, the deed from Lucretia Woodworth is made in her individual name, the deed of trust from Bonnaud is- <em>* </em>for her benefit in her individual character, and the note secured by that deed was not used by her as executrix in paying creditors, but was transferred by her to a neat relation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">The <em>Attorney-General, </em>for the appellees, called the-attention of the court to the allegations and prayer of the bill, and insisted that the complainants had not taken the ground in the court below, which they now relied upon, and therefore they were precluded by the-cases of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>2 Munf. 310, and <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Carter others, </em>4 Munf. 273, from taking that ground here. He also urged the lapse of 22 years before the suit was brought, as fatal to the claim. And upon, the merits, he insisted that the bequest by the testator to his daughter Harriet was not a bequest of the lease itself, but merely of a part of the rent, and that even, if the lease was bequeathed, the evidence did not sufficiently establish an assent to the legacy, and the recourse of the daughter was against the executrix alone..</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX2\"><em>Robinson, </em>in reply, said, that the act of limitations-was not relied on in the pleadings, and the mere delay to sue had no force. For the daughter was an infant between three and five years old when her father died, and there had been no unreasonable delay since she had knowledge of her rights. He admitted that the-bill was rather unskilfully drawn, especially the praying part of it. But he said that as, under the general prayer, relief might be granted if consistent with the-case made by the bill, the material enquiry upon the pleadings was, what was the case made by the bill and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>answers ? He then examined the allegations in the hill, and the statements in the answers, and insisted that the question properly arose, whether or no legacy was assented to before the deed to Bonnaud.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-5\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Al44\">The appellants\u2019 counsel concedes that if, prior to the deed to Bonnaud, the executrix had not assented to the legacy of the term, the decree is right; but he contends that there was proof of that assent, in the payment of the legacy of Jasper \"Wood-worth. I think not. The testator gave to Jasper Woodworth, during his natural life, \u201cfifty dollars <em>per </em>annum,, to be paid out of the rent arising from the brick house.\u201d This was an annuity or money legacy to Jasper Woodworth, chargeable upon the rents. It gave to him no estate in the lease. It did not make him tenant in common with Lucretia and Harriet, or with the former only. Por if it gave him title to any part of the lease, to what portion had he title ? His legacy was fixed, while the rents were variable. Hence one year he might have title to an undivided half, or indeed to the whole, (if the rent did not exceed'50' dollars,) and the next year to only one undivided thirtieth, which was the proportion his legacy bore to the whole rent when the testator died. This would he absurd. He must therefore be construed to have a-fixed annnity in money, payable out of the rents, and not an undivided part or interest in the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Such being the case, I cannot perceive how the payment of his annuity by the executrix can be taken to he an assent to the legacy to Harriet or to herself. His legacy was to be first paid out of the rents, and they were only to receive the residuum. It might, therefore, very well happen, that there might be enough to pay <em>him, </em>and nothing left for <em>them,. </em>The executrix might, without a <em>devastavit, </em>pay him, if the residue of the rents would satisfy the debts. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>might, therefore, willingly assent to his legacy, which wag \u00a3e \u00a3rg\u00a3 but q,e unwilling to assent to her own or to Harriet\u2019s legacy, as their portion might be necessary for payment of debts. I am therefore of opinion, that, from the payment to Jasper Woodworth, we are not at liberty to infer an assent by the executrix to the legacies to herself and Harriet; and her subsequent sale very strongly fortifies the construction I give of her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>1 Str., 70, is by no means analogous to this. There the testator devised the term to the executor for life, he paying <em>\u00a3 </em>50 to another. This was not \u00a350 out of the testator\u2019s funds, but \u00a350 of his own money. He paid it; and when he had thus paid the consideration, who could doubt his intention to take the term to himself?</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The ease in Plowden, 540, is one replete (as is usual in that excellent work) with sound principles and good sense; but it is very different from the case at bar. The testator gave the rents and profits of a term to hisexeeutrix during his son\u2019s minority, to educate his children, and the remainder to the son when he came of .age. Such at least was the construction given to the will. The executrix did support the children out of the lease, which she could not have done without a <em>.devastavit, </em>unless by assenting to the legacy: and having assented to the particular estate to herself, it was taken to be an assent to the remainder to the son, who was obviously the favoured legatee. In this there is certainly no analogy to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to present at large some other considerations which weigh heavily against the appellants.. The point on which their counsel now places their case is an afterthought. It is no where made in the pleadings, and the defendants have had no opportunity of controverting it. Moreover, the great length of time (from 1810 to 1882) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>which has been suffered to elapse without the asser\u25a0tion of their claim, and the acquiescence in the by the executrix, have been well calculated to lull the purchasers into security, and to prejudice them unjustly if the pretensions of the appellants should be sustained. Lastly, although the doctrine is unquestionable, that the assent of the executor to a specific legacy, vests the legal title in the legatee, (1 Wash., 312; 5 Munf., 103, 175,) yet I am by no means prepared to say that where the assent of the executor is \"by no act of notoriety, and the possession remains uninterruptedly with him, a sale by him to a purchaser without notice of the assent shall be held void. On the contrary, I incline to think that upon the principle of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 T. R., 587; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>1 Cranch, 309, and other like cases, the assent should be taken to be void and ineffectual as to purchasers, where there is no change of possession, and the executor continues to exercise acts of ownership, and to dispose\u2018of the property, without opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">On the whole, I have no hesitation in affirming the \u25a0decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
