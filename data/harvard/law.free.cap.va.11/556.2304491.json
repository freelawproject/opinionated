The court ordered a writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>whereupon a jury was regularly summoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>by the sheriff, and <em>an </em>inquisition returned, finding \u201cthat the lands of no individual would be overflowed or damaged, either above or,below, by the erection of a falling dam sufficient to hold nine feet of water,, save the lands of Smith himself, the applicant; that the water would not overflow the mansion house of any proprietor, or the offices, curtilage 'or garden thereunto immediately belonging, or orchards; that fish of passage, and ordinary navigation would not be obstructed thereby; and that the health of the neighbours would be less or as little annoyed by the stagnation of the waters as it was possible it should be <em>m </em>the erection of any dam.\u201d Upon the return of the inquisition, \"Waddill, a mill owner and farmer, residing about a mile and three quarters from the site of the proposed mill, appeared and was admitted defendant to oppose the application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">At the hearing, Waddill objected to the grant of leave to Smith to build the mill and dam, on the ground, that the finding of the inquisition was not certainly responsive to the inquiry propounded to the jury, touching the annoyance to the health of the neighbours from the stagnation of the waters by the mill dam, if erected; and that if it was certainly responsive on that point, the finding was in substance against the applicant. And Waddill\u2019s counsel at the same time intimated, that they designed to offer testimony, at another stage of the qause, upon the question whether the health of the neighbourhood would be affected by the proposed mill pond; upon which the counsel for Smith called on Waddill\u2019s counsel to produce their testimony at once; insisting that they ought not to be allowed to try the case by piecemeal, to take the chance of a favourable decision upon their objection to the inquisition, and if they should fail in that, then to offer testimony to shew that the health of the neighbourhood would be annoyed by the stag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>nation of the waters by the proposed dam. Waddill\u2019s C0lmS(q gai\u00bf they relied on the inquisition itself as conclusive against Smith\u2019s application for leave to \"build the proposed mill and dam; as ascertaining, in effect, that the stagnation of the waters in the mill pond would be injurious to the health of the neighbourhood : and they insisted, that they could not be required to offer testimony in support of the finding of the inquisition. The court, without deciding whether Waddill\u2019s testimony should be then adduced or not, proceeded to hear the objection founded on the inquisition, and overruled the same. And then Wad-dill\u2019s counsel proposed to introduce evidence to shew, that the health of the neighborhood would be annoyed by the stagnation of the waters in the mill pond, if the proposed dam should be erected. But the court said it had already decided the whole case, refused to hear the evidence offered, and gave Smith leave to erect his mill and dam. Waddill filed a bill of exceptions, stating the proceedings at the hearing, and appealed from the order granting Smith leave to erect the mill and dam, to the Circuit Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">\u25a0 In the Circuit Superior Court, the testimony of witnesses was admitted and heard; but that court did not found its judgment on the testimony, which, therefore, was not inserted in the record. It held, that the inquisition was insufficient and defective, in not finding, with certainty, ^whether the health of the neighbourhood would or would not be injured by the erection of the proposed mill and dam; and, therefore, it reversed the judgment, directed that the writ of <em>ad \u25a0quod damnam </em>and the inquisition should be quashed, and remanded the case to the County Court for further proceedings on Smith\u2019s application; To which \u2022order, this court, upon the petition of Smith, allowed him a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>Lyons </em>and <em>R.

All that was required was, that the inquisition should find, <em>substan</em>tially', that the health of the neighbourhood would not he injured. <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Munf.,, 405. And this was substantially found by the inquisition in this case. The plain meaning of the finding was, that if it were possible that any mill pond would not injure the health of the neighbourhood, the mill pond in this case would not. . The jury seemed to'have had some difficulty in affirming, that there could be any mill pond which might not cause disease in the neighbourhood; but they declared their belief, that the proposed mill pond would do as little mischief of the kind as any mill pond could; which was, in effect, to say that this mill pond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>would not be injurious, unless it should be held,, aga^ng^ aq experience, that every mill pond must be injurious to the health of the neighbourhood, so as to render if impossible, under the existing laws, to build any mill and dam upon a water course, since every dam must more or less stagnate the waters of the stream. Surely, upon the finding in this inquisition, the court might well hold (in the language of the statute) that injury to the health of the neighbourhood was not \u201clike to ensue;\u201d in which ease, the statute authorized the court to grant the leave asked. And if it should turn out, that the jury was mistaken, the statute saved to any party who should be injured, his action for damages; which, if there should be any real grievance, would be an effectual remedy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOX\"><em>R.

The health of others ought not to be in the least degree jeoparded for the profit of the applicant. Anciently, when mills were scarce-, no inquiry was directed as to the effect \u00f3f the mill pond upon the health of the neighbours. Act of 1705, ch. 41; 3 Hen. Stat. at Large, 401; 1748, cb. 26, 6 Id. 55. But afterwards, when the country came to abound with mills, the effect of the stagnation of the waters in the mill pond upon health, was made a primary object of inquiry. 1785, ch. 82, \u00a7 1, 12 Id. 188. And all our subsequent legislation manifested the same care to provide against the possibility of such mischief. They insisted, that leave, ought not to be granted to erect a mill dam, if there was the least doubt, whether the mill would produce so cruel a grievance as ill health in the neighbourhood. The inquisition in this case, they said, shewed that the jury had doubts upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u25a0subject; and that was enough to condemn the application for leave to build the mill and dam. But, 2, they maintained, that the County Court' clearly erred in refusing to hear parol testimony as to the probable \u25a0.effect of the stagnation of the waters in the mill pond .upon the health of the neighbours.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-4\"><em>Lyons </em>replied, as to the last point, that the County \u2022Court did not refuse to hear the evidence as in itself \u2022improper, but because the party would not offer it at the proper stage of the proceedings, but designedly held it back till he could get the judgment of the court \u2022upon his objection to the inquisition; a practice, which, .if indulged, would have enabled the party to divide the questions presented by the case, and to have, instead of one judgment on the whole case, as many .judgments as he could raise points.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-5\"> The statute provides, that upon application made to a County Court, for leave to build a mill, and to make a dam across a water course for working such mill, the court shall order a writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>commanding the sheriff to summon a jury of twelve freeholders to meet at the place proposed for the mill and dam; that the jury shall be sworn and charged to examine the lands above and below, and (among other things)' to say, \u201cwhether, in their opinion, the health of the neighbours will be annoyed by the stagnation of the waters;\u201d that the inquisition of the jury shall be returned to the court; and that, \u201cif, <em>on such inquest, </em>or <em>on other evidence, </em>it shall appear to the court, that the mansion house of any proprietor, or the offices, curtilage or garden thereto immediately belonging, or orchards, will be overflowed, <em>or the health of the neighbours be annoyed, </em>they shall not give leave to build the said mill, and erect the said dam; but if none of these injuries <em>are like to ensue, </em>they shall then proceed to consider, whether, all circumstances weighed, it be reasonable that such leave should be given, and shall give or not give it accordingly,\u201d &lt;fcc. But that \u201cno inquest, and no opinion or judgment of the court thereupon, shall bar any public prosecution or private action, which could have been had or maintained if this act had never been made, other than prosecutions and actions for such injuries as were actually foreseen and estimated upon such inquest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b581-6\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ACH\">I am of opinion, that the inquisition in this case, finds, with sufficient certainty, that the health of the neighbourhood will not be annoyed by the erection of the proposed mill dam. In the present universal conviction of the deleterious influence \u25a0of the stagnation of water in mill ponds, it is probable no twelve men could concur in a verdict, declaring .the entire and absolute freedom from such influence of any mill pond whatever. It is moreover scarcely \u25a0probable, that such could have been the meaning and intention of the statute itself. So to interpret the statute, would be at once to repeal it; for it would establish a condition upon the leave to build a mill, that would be impossible, and thus, one of the daily blessings of life would be denied, from the idle apprehension of a remote and often only a casual injury. \u00a5e should be denied bread, for fear that, in some season or other, the means which gave it to us might bring ill health. This could not be a judicious interpretation of the statute, even if its own terms did not nega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>tive any such rigorous construction. That it does not,, ]j0weyerj require the <em>absolute impossibility </em>of annoyance-to health to he affirmed, appears from the language of 5th section, that \u201cif none -of these injuries are-like to ensue, the court shall proceed to consider whether, all circumstances weighed, it is reasonable to give leave, and shall give or not give it accordingly.\u201d It is only necessary that the court should be assured by the inquisition, or otherwise, that the health of the neighbours is not <em>likely </em>to be annoyed. This, I think,, is substantially found by this inquisition, which declares, that \u201cit will be less, or as little, annoyed as it is <em>possible </em>to be in the erection of any dam.\u201d This construction of the statute is the less objectionable, as the right of no person to abate the nuisance, (if it shall be one,) or to recover damages for injury to health,, will be barred or impaired by the inquisition of the-jury or the judgment of the court. Bor, no such injury having been foreseen and estimated, a prosecution or an action will lie for any person who shall sustain detriment from the stagnant water in the mill pond. And thus, while the convenience of the public-is consulted on the one hand, no injustice is done to-individuals on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The County Court, then, rightly overruled \"Wad\u2014 dill\u2019s objection to the inquisition, and refused to quash.. But it erred in refusing to hear the testimony he offered. The' Circuit Superior Court ought for that er- - ror to have reversed the order of the County Court,. but it erred in quashing the inquisition as insufficient and defective. The orders of both courts, therefore,, must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Cir- - cuit Superior Court, to-be sent back to the County-Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The other, judges- concurred, aiid an order was entered to the-following, effect:. That the Circuit Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>rior Court, though right in reversing the order of the County Court, yet erred in quashing the inquisition, therefore the order of the Circuit Superior Court was reversed <em>with costs. </em>And this court proceeding to make such order as the Circuit Superior Court ought to have made, held, that the County Court rightly refused to quash the inquisition, but erred in refusing to permit the introduction of the testimony which was offered by Waddill, therefore the order of the County Court' was also reversed with costs. And it was ordered,, that the cause should be remanded to the Circuit Superior Court, to be thence remanded to the County-Court, and there further proceeded in.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><em>Lyons </em>afterwards moved, that the order of this court should be so varied, that the cause should be remanded to the Circuit Superior Court, to be there fully heard and decided, instead of directing that it should be remanded from thence to the County Court, and the proceedings resumed in that court.</p>\n<author id=\"b583-5\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6g\">delivered the opinion of the court upon the motion: That the former order should be set aside, and an order to the following effect entered in lieu thereof: That the inquisition was sufficient, and the Circuit Superior Court erred in quashing it, and ought to have proceeded to hear and determine the case upon its merits: That the County Court erred in refusing-to hear and decide upon the testimony, offered -by Waddill, to shew that the health of the neighbourhood would be affected by the erection of the mill dam; but, as the appeal from the order of the County Court cai-ried up all matters of law and of fact involved in the case, the proper mode of correcting that error of the County Court by the Circuit Superior Court, was to receive that and all other proper evidence in relation to all matters in controversy, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>give its judgment on the merits; which, it was preBurned, would have been the course of the Circuit Superior Court, if it had decided (as this court thought ^ ought) that the inquisition was sufficient. That, therefore, the order of the Circuit Superior Court should he reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to that court, for a new hearing and decision there upon the merits.</p>\n<author id=\"b584-4\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AA7\">I cannot concur in the proposition to set aside the former order, and to enter that now proposed. I am of opinion, that the cause must go hack to the County Court for further proceedings, and that we cannot direct it to be retained in the Circuit Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A-_h\">Th.e case stands thus: Smith applied for leave to build a mill. A writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>was issued, and an inquisition was found, and returned. \u2019Wad-dill, who opposed the application, moved to quash it, which the County Court refused. He then offered evidence to prove, that the health of the neighbourhood would be injured. The court would not permit \u2022this evidence to he introduced, and <em>he excepted. </em>The \u25a0court then proceeded (without, it seems, hearing any evidence,) to give the leave asked for. Waddill appealed. The judge of the Circuit Superior Court reversed the order of the County Court, not for its refusal to hear the evidence, but because he considered the inquisition defective. And he remanded the cause to. the County Court for further proceedings, setting aside the former proceedings, up to the petition. This \u25a0court has decided that he erred, and that the inquisition was sufficient. But it has also decided that the refusal of the County Court to hear evidence was also erroneous, and thus the orders of both courts must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In this state of things, I am of opinion, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>cause should go back to the County Court: 1st. Because it is sufficiently manifest, that the Court has heard the case upon evidence: it excluded the evidence, and Waddill excepted to that exclusion; and therefore, the Circuit Superior Court, in going into the facts, will not be proceeding as an appellate tribunal, hut originally. 2ndly. Waddill has a right to have the judgment of the County Court, upon the facts, that tribunal being peculiarly fitted to judge, from all the circumstances, whether it is advisable to grant or refuse the leave. 3rdly. The statute requires, that in reversing the judgment of the Circuit Superior Court, we shall give such judgment as that court ought to have done; which is easy enough, if we have only to correct the error of law upon the face of the judgment; but if the Circuit Superior Court is to proceed to investigate the facts, it is impossible to say, <em>a priori, </em>what that judgment is ultimately to he or ought to he. 4thly, Pursuing the direction of the statute, the judgment to be entered must he, that the order of the County Court be <em>reversed with costs; </em>and either that the cause should, according to the usual course of the court, be sent back to the court which committed the error sought to he corrected; or it must he sent for further proceedings to the <em>Appellate </em>Court (for such the Circuit Superior Court is in relation to this matter, though it is empowered to examine into the whole cause <em>de novo). </em>How this, I think, would he not only an anomaly, but it would produce difficulty and incongruity. The order of the County Court would be now <em>reversed with costs. </em>Suppose the Circuit Superior Court goes into an examination ot the facts, and finds, upon that enquiry, that it was <em>right </em>to give leave to build the mill; then, upon the whole matter, the order of the County Court is <em>right, </em>and it must he <em>affirmed with costs. </em>Here, then, the same order is first <em>reversed </em>and costs adjudged to Waddill; and then it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>affirmed </em>and costs adjudged to Smith. These incongrup\u00a3es seem to me unavoidable, and I am therefore unwilling to pursue the course which leads to them. ^-\u00b0 av\u00b0ih these consequences (I presume) the order is presented in its present form. It proceeds upon the idea, that the Circuit Superior Court pronounced judgment of reversal prematurely; that there should have been no reversal for the error in law, until the- matter of fact had been enquired into. But this mode of proceeding would have done injustice to \"Waddill. The County Court would not hear his evidence on the merits. lie excepted and appealed. Had he not reason? And whether upon a future hearing of the facts he should succeed or not, ought he to pay the costs of an appeal, taken for the purpose of procuring a fair hearing which had been denied by the County Court? I think not. Upon a <em>swpersdeas </em>or appeal from an error in law in a mill case, the party injured is entitled to reversal and costs, if he can shew error, although upon the merits the case may ultimately be decided against him. I think, therefore, the Circuit Superior Court was bound to reverse the order, and send the cause back to the County Court; and if so, this court should render the same judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
