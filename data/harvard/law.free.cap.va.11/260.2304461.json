Nevertheless, the Circuit Court permits the same to be read, and a verdict and judgment are rendered for the defendant. The Court of Appeals, approving the decision in <em>M\u2019Farland </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>8 Leigh, 489, reverses the judgment of the Circuit Court, and awards a new trial, with direction that the answers to the interrogatories are not to be read, unless introduced on the part of the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-9\">In an action of <em>assumpsit </em>in the Circuit Court of Fayette, between Clement Vaughn &amp; Co., plaintiffs, and William V.

Hunter, 8 Leigh, 489. In that case, it is true, the question raised by the bill of exceptions was not as to the <em>admissibility </em>of the interrogatories, and of the answers to them, but as to their <em>conclusiveness. </em>This court, however, went into the question, whether it was competent to the respondent to the interrogatories to introduce them, <em>in invitum, </em>as evidence in his favour. After two arguments, and taking twelve months to consider, a court of three decided unanimously in the negative. I have carefully re-examined the opinions in that case, and am fully satisfied with the decision. The result must, therefore, be a reversal of the judgment, and the award of a new trial, on which the answers of the defendant to the interrogatories filed in the cause are not to be read, unless introduced on the part of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Per curiam\u2014Judgment reversed and new trial AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
