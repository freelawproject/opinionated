that sometime after the marriage, her father, John Higginbotham, delivered into her husband\u2019s possession two female slaves, to wit, Parmelia and Elvira, \u201cdeclaring at the time of said delivery his intention to give the said slaves in trust for the sole and only purpose of the complainant\u2019s use and comfort during her life, and at her death the title and fee simple interest to descend and vest in her children or issue, which she might thereafter have; that the slaves remained in the possession of her husband from the time of said delivery until his death, without any effort on his part in any single instance, and without the assertion on his part, during all that time, of any claim or right in opposition to the said limitation and trust;\u201d that, in addition to the limitation and trust declared at the time of the delivery, the father of the complainant, in 1818, shortly previous to his death, made his will, which was duly recorded in the County Court of Amherst, in which, out of abundant caution, and for the purpose of committing the title of said slaves to record, he confirmed the gift of them to the complainant and her children, in the manner and under the limitations and trust before mentioned; that, since the said gift, Parmelia has had four children, Henry, Edmund, Fleming and-; that, in 1823, complainant\u2019s husband died intestate, largely indebted by specialty and simple contracts; that she qualified as his administratrix, and has administered the whole of his personal assets, (with the exception of a small sum, retained to cover future contingent and unavoidable expenses,) in-the payment of specialty debts, leaving a large amount of them still unpaid, and the whole of the simple contract debts; that her husband died seized of several tracts of land, amounting to between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>1,500 and 1,600 acres, no part of which has been subjected to the payment of his debts; that, among specialty debts left unpaid, is one of large amount, to wit, 857 dollars 81 cents, besides interest and costs, due James Marr, deceased, for the purchase of a part of the said land, for which debt William Turner is bound as the surety of her husband; that, Turner having paid 300 dollars, part thereof, to Alexander Marr, the personal representative of the said James, recovered, upon motion in the Superior Court of Amherst county, a judgment against the complainant, as administratrix as aforesaid, for the said sum of 300 dollars, with interest from the 24th of July, 1826, till paid, and the costs of the motion; that, upon this judgment he has sued out a <em>fieri facias, </em>which he has caused to be levied on the negro boy Henry, a child of Parmelia; that, he alleges he has now paid the balance of the debt to Marr\u2019s administrator, and will obtain a judgment against the complainant, as administratrix, for the same, and upon such judgment will cause execution to be levied on the remainder of the said slaves; that, whatever right her husband had in the usufruct of the said slaves, by virtue of his marital rights, was sold by the complainant, as his administratrix, at a sale of his personal property, made when Turner was present, to wit, in December, 1823, at which time she became the purchaser, at the price of 201 dollars, which sum she was enabled by the bounty of her brother to pay, and which, as administratrix, she has appropriated in payment of her husband\u2019s debts; that, she is advised now that she acted under a mistaken idea of her own rights in purchasing the said slaves and paying the said sum of 201 dollars her own money for them, because, upon the death her husband, no right or interest in said slaves was transmitted to his representatives; that the complainant has, by the said John London, six children, to wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Frances Jane, John James, Anne Eliza, Daniel H., Banks, and William Augustus London, of whom Frances Jane has intermarried with Winston Woodroo\u00ed\u2019 an&lt;t the remaining five are infants under the age of 21 years; that the said Turner has heretofore exhibited several bills in chancery against the complainant and her children, to subject her husband\u2019s lands to the payment ot his debts, which suits are still pening, and she is at a loss to conceive why he should have relinquished the pursuit of those lands to invade the rights of herself and her children, of which rights he must have been apprized, and in which he had heretofore acquiesced. The bill makes Turner, Wood-roof and wife, and the complainant\u2019s other children, parties defendants. And it prays that Turner be in-joined from selling Henry, and from levying upon or selling the other slaves; that, if it be found necessary, an account may be taken of the complainant\u2019s administration, and if it shall appear that she has paid the said sum of 201 dollars, under a mistake of her rights, that she may be reimbursed out of the rents of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\">Chancellor <em>Taylor </em>denied the injunction, but it was awarded by one of the Judges of the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\">Turner, by his answer, after objecting to the jurisdiction of equity, stated, that he thought it probable the marriage took place at least a year anterior to the time stated in the bill; that there was no material lapse of time between the date of the marriage and the time of the delivery of the slaves; that it is untrue that the delivery of the slaves was accompanied by any such declaration as is stated in the bill, or clogged by any condition or limitation whatever, but on the contrary, the said slaves were fairly and unconditionally given by the father of the complainant to herself and her husband, for her advancement in mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>riage, and the husband claimed the slaves as his own \u00a1property, and treated them as such, from the time \u25a0came into his possession until he died; that, for these reasons, the title to the slaves was not subject to the will of the complainant\u2019s father, and that will can have no influence upon the case; that respondent is advised the personal estate of the complainant\u2019s husband must be exhausted before his realty can be \u2022reached; but, at all events, as the complainant and \u2022her children have the same interest in the personal as \u2022in the real estate, it is more just and equitable that the personal estate should be given up for the benefit of creditors, and the matter of subjecting the lands adjusted between the widow and heirs, than that a suffering surety should be delayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">Daniel Higginbotham, the brother of the complainant, deposed, that sometime in the year 1809, (as well as he remembers,) and previous to the intermarriage of the complainant with John London, the deponent was in company with his father, John Higginbotham, who informed him that in the event of the marriage of his daughter Terza with London, he intended to settle some negroes upon her and the issue of the marriage. The names of the slaves were Jenny and her children. He said he intended so to settle them, or any thing else he might think proper, upon his daughter and the heirs of her body, that in the event of her dying without issue, they should return to his estate. He requested deponent at the time to draw up such an instrument as would secure to the said Terza, and her children by the said intended marriage, the said slaves according to his intention, and the deponent thinks he drew such an instrument and left it with his father. \u2022Some short time after this the marriage- took place, and sometime thereafter (perhaps two or three months) the slaves were delivered into the possession of the said John London, as the property of the said Terza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>for life, and at her death to go to her children. Dep0neirfc wag jnformeci this was the character of the gift and the delivery, by conversation with his father, not onty a<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> fhe time first referred to previous to the marriage, but after the marriage and previous to the delivery. The intention of his father is the more strongly impressed upon deponent\u2019s memory, by the remark made by his father in one of the conversations alluded to, that he wished to secure the property to his daughter and her children in such a way as to leave no question of its validity, and that he did not wish to em counter again such a controversy as he had had with his son-in-law Isaac Rucker.* Since deponent drew the instrument referred to, he does not remember to have seen it, and cannot say what has been done with it. It may be that his father determined to substitute his will in lieu of that instrument, as the provisions of the will in relation to the property given to Terza London are substantially the same (so far as deponent recollects) with those contained in the said instrument. In the year 1812 or 1813, (deponent is not certain which,) he was in company with John London, when there was a conversation about the negroes given by deponent\u2019s father, in which London told deponent that two of the negroes had died, and he was apprehensive there was some defect of constitution attaching to the rest, and he believed the interest of the family would be promoted by a sale or exchange of the rest, and he would sell them or put them off if he had the right to do so; but he said, \u201cYou know how they are given, and that I have no right to do so, and therefore have not attempted and would not attempt to do so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">Frances R. Coleman, the sister of the complainant, deposed, that the marriage took place in 1809 or 1810, and her father\u2019s death in 1813; that her father gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to the complainant, at the time of the marriage, and for the sole benefit of herself and children, a woman named Jenny, and her children, Celia, Parmelia and Elvira; that Celia has since died, and Parmelia has several children, Henry, Edmund, Fleming, Jane, and an infant, whose name is not known; that the witness heard John London state, on one or more occasions, that he wished to sell the said slaves, but could not, on account of the slaves having been given to fiis wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">Jesse Higginbotham, a brother of complainant, in answer to interrogatories of her counsel, said, \u201cI do not recollect in what year she was married, nor in what year my father died. I know the slave Parmelia was the daughter of Jenny, given by my father to my sister at or after her intermarriage. The said Elvira, I believe to be the daughter of Jenny, but do not know it. I never heard John London say any thing about the character of the gift.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">The affidavits of Charles Palmer and Alexander Jewell, were taken for the defendant. Palmer deposed, that he lived within 9 or 10 miles of London,, and never heard that London held the property which came by his wife in any other way than as his own. He always understood and believed the property was London\u2019s. Jewell resided nearer to London. He deposed, that he considered the slaves as London\u2019s own slaves, and never heard any thing said to the contrary. London offered to sell him one of the women. \u201cI had,\u201d says this witness, \u201cno doubt about the title, when he offered to sell me the woman. I think her name was Jenny. My wife observed to Mr. London,, that probably his wife would not be willing for him to sell that woman, coming by her. His reply was,, that he cared nothing about that; that the property given to him by her father he would sell as soon as if he had labored for it.\u201d This conversation took place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>15 or 16 years before tbe date of tbe deposition, which wag October, 1828.

The act of 1787, concerning slaves, (1 Bev. Code of 1819, ch. Ill, \u00a7 51, p. 432,) adopts the provision of the act of \u00cd758, which required that gifts of slaves should be by will or deed, duly proved and recorded; but provides that that provision should not extend to gifts of slaves, where the possession was in the donee or those claiming under him; evidently intending to apply to the case of absolute gifts, and leaving the cas^s of special gifts with limitations and trusts for others \"than the donee, to be provided for by will or deed, duly proved and record<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ed, according to the act of 1758. The delivery of possession hy the donor to the donee would be evidence to all the world of the right of property in the' donee, but would be no evidence of any trust or limitation for others; and to admit parol evidence to prove such trust or limitation, would let in all the frauds intended to be prevented hy the will or deed required in the first provision of the section in the case of special gifts of slaves. In the case before us, the delivery of the slaves by the father to his daughter Mrs. London, vested the property in them in her husband, by virtue of his marital rights, and left nothing in th.e father to be disposed of by his will; which disposition, by the way, appears to me, upon the testimony in the ease, to have been an after-thought, when London, the husband, had become much involved, and to have been designed to protect the property in the slaves from his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">I prefer this view of the case to putting it on the last provision in the 2d section of the act to prevent frauds and perjuries, 1 Eev. Code, eh. 101, p. 378, as upon the evidence in the case the possession of the slaves had not remained in the donee five years before the will of the father was duly proved and recorded : a point much pressed in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The order must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b447-6\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AnG\">Prom the evidence in this case, I am satisfied that very soon after the marriage of Mrs. London, her father made her a <em>gift </em>of the slaves, from one of whom the slave in question descended. The testimony does not furnish the slightest foundation for the opinion that the transaction was a loan; and hence \u2022the notion of a reclamation by his will, according to the principles of <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf., 449, is out of the question. The will can have no influence, except to confirm the position that' there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>a gift, and not a loan. If it applies to this transacat all, it recognizes it as a gift; if it does not, it can have no effect in confirming the rights of Mrs. London.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Considering it as a gift, and admitting that it was to the daughter for life, with remainder to the children, what was its effect? It is contended that it was designed as a trust for the daughter, and equity will consider the husband as trustee, if none other be named. The legal title is cast upon him by the gift without the intervention of a trustee, and equity will affect his conscience with the trust, if he received the property upon confidence that he would hold it for her use. This is indeed true, as between the parties themselves, but the question is not between them, but between the wife and the creditors of the husband; and then we are to say whether equity will set up a secret parol trust in behalf of the wife against the creditors of the husband. The statement of the question at once suggests the answer. If there were no statute of frauds, such a course would be against the best received principles of equity. The creditors have the law in their favour, and the equity set up against them is secret and eminently calculated to defraud and deceive. But the statute places the matter beyond question. Here is a limitation of an use pretended to have been made by way of trust, in this property, which was given to the wife, and the legal title and possession whereof <em>eodemflatu </em>vested in the husband. This limitation is by the statute denounced as fraudulent, and the absolute property is declared to be with the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The pretension of a remainder in the children is yet more unfounded. If they take any thing, it is a legal estate in remainder, and not a mere equitable interest. How, it may well be doubted whether a remainder in chattels can pass without deed or will. At common law, such remainders were in no case permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ted. Afterwai\u2019ds they were recognized in deeds and wills, (5 Bac. Abr., 720; 1 Burr., 284; <em>Bradley </em>v. 3 Call, 50,) but I have found no case where a <em>parol </em>remainder has been sustained. But be this as it may between the parties, the statute of frauds very clearly declares such a limitation invalid as to creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">It is suggested, however, that there being no children <em>in esse </em>when the parol gift was made, the remainder was for that cause void, and so the right after the daughter\u2019s death would revert to the father, and was therefore liable to be disposed of by his will. I do not think so. The father by the gitt intended to pass away the property altogether from himself; and where such intention appears, the absolute'property vests in the first taker, if the remainder over is void. 1 P. Wms., 666; 5 Bac. Abr., 722. A gift of personalty, on common law principles, passed the absolute right. The courts afterwards modified that general principle, in behalf of certain remainders and limitations which the law recognized as good. But if the remainder limited is not good, the original rule prevails. So that here the estate of the daughter was absolute if the remainder was void, and the marital rights of the husband were commensurate with hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It may be proper to observe, that if, contrary to this view of the matter, a reversion was reserved to the father, dependent upon the daughter\u2019s life, it would be as literally within the statute of frauds as a remainder is, and would accordingly be void, since it would set up a secret interest in derogation of that absolute property which the law infers from possession, unless it be limited by deed or will duly proved and recorded. There is, indeed, nothing agaiust which the act is so distinctly directed, as a parol reservation of rights in the donor, while to all the world the donee retains that principal <em>indicium </em>of property, the possession of the chattel.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>As to the alleged purchase of London\u2019s' interest by that was so far from being made the foundation of her title, that she alleges it was made1 under a inisteiken view of her rights. The defendant therefore was not called to answer to it. If, upon the cause going back, she choose to amend her bill, and rest herself upon this purchase, the defendant will then answer, and that matter will be determined upon such evidence as she shall produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">I am of opinion to affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">&lt;&gt; Cabell, J., concurred in the opinion of' the' president.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
