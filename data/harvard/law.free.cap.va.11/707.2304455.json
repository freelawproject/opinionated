The Hustings Court of the city of Richmond imposed a fine of 20 dollars on Abrahams, for permitting a slave to go at large and hire himself out contrary to the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. Ill, \u00a7 81, p. 442. Abrahams appeared in court, and made many objections to the regularity of the proceeding, and, among others, that the court had no original jurisdiction in such a case; that the court could not take cognizance of it, until it should have been acted on by a magistrate out of court. The court overruled the objections, and he filed a bill of exceptions, stating the whole proceedings, and all his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>objections thereto. He presented a petition to the ju\u00bfge 0f ^e Circuit Superior Court for the county of Henrico and city of Richmond, <em>in vacation, </em>praying a wr^ error to the judgment; which the judge denied. And now he presented a petition to this court, praying a writ of error to the refusal of the judge of the Circuit Superior Court to award the writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b728-4\"><em>Gregory, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AoU\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5i7\">It is the unanimous opinion of the judges, that this court has no jurisdiction of this case. The common law writ of error can only be awarded to some judgment, order or proceeding, of a court of record: and there is no statutory provision, authorizing this court to award such writ, for the purpose \u2022of reviewing the decision of a judge of a Circuit Superior Court, in vacation, overruling an application for a writ of error. Nor has this court any jurisdiction to award a writ of error to the judgment of the Hustings Court; <em>Anderson's Case, </em>4 Leigh 693. It being wholly unnecessary, we have not examined the record, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was any error in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Writ oe error denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
