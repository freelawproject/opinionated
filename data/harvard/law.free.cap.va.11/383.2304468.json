Held: The objection to the witness was not removed by this release.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">In an action of debt in the Circuit Court of Kanawha county, between Sarah Stephenson, administratrix of Samuel Stevenson, plaintiff, and James B. Rust,, administrator of the estate of Clark Reynolds, unadministered by William Reynolds, deceased, defendant, a verdict was found for the plaintiff on the 28th of' May, 1889, and judgment rendered thereupon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-9\">At the trial, two bills of exceptions were filed by the defendant, one of which presented a question as to the admissibility of Charles G-. Reynolds (a brother of' Clark Reynolds), as a witness for the defendant. The parties agreed that Clark Reynolds died without will and without issue, having real and personal estate; that in December, 1833, administration of his estate was committed to William Reynolds, his brother, who-died leaving a widow and child, which child died and was survived by the widow; that in July, 1835, administration <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of said Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Reynolds was granted to the defendant; that no inventory or appraisement of the estate of Clark Reynolds has ever been returned to the court which granted the said administrations, nor has any settlement been made of the accounts of either of the administrators, nor any appointment made of commissioners to make such settlement; and that the said Charles G-. Reynolds the witness so offered, and two other persons, are the distributees of the estate of the said Clark Reynolds, but that no distribution has been made by either of the administrators in the course of their administration. The testimony of the said Charles G-. Reynolds being objected to by the plaintiff', on the ground that he was interested in the event of the cause, a release was executed and acknowledged by the said Charles G. Reynolds in open court, in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-4\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, Charles G. Reynolds, one of the distributees of Silas Reynolds, deceased, and of Clark Reynolds, deceased, all of the county of Kanawha, for and in consideration of the sum of five dollars, to me in hand paid by James B. Rust, late sheriff of the county of Kanawha, and as such administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the goods and chattels, rights and credits, which were of Clark Reynolds, have remised, released, confirmed and forever quit claim, and do by these presents remise, release, confirm and forever quit claim, unto the said James B. Rust, administrator as aforesaid, all right, title, interest, claim or- demand, which I may or can claim or demand, as one of the distributees aforesaid, in and to the benefits of any judgment or recovery which may be had in favour of the said James B. Rust, administrator, &amp;c., aforesaid, in a suit at law now depending in the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for Kanawha county, wherein Sarah Stephenson, administratrix of Samuel Stephenson, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ceased, is plaintiff, and said James B. Bust, administrator, as aforesaid, is defendant, in as far as such recovery might increase the distributable surplus of the said estate of Clark Beynolds, and of the estate of Silas Beynolds, the common ancestor of the said Charles Gf. Beynolds and Clark Beynolds. And I have also remised and released, and do hereby remise and release to the said James B. Bust, administrator, as aforesaid, all my right, title and interest, in and to the estate of the said Clark Beynolds, deceased, and in and to the estate of the said Silas Beynolds, and in and to the estate of William Beynolds, deceased, as one of the distributees of each of said estates, so far as the distributable surplus of the said estates, or either of them, may or can be increased by a failure of the plaintiff\u2019 in the above described suit, to recover the amount claimed by her in the said suit. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal, this 28th day of May, 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">Oh\u2019s Gf. Beynolds. [Seal.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">The Circuit Court was of opinion that this release did not render the said Charles G-. Beynolds a competent witness, and that to render him competent, it would be necessary that his distributive share in the personal estate of the said Clark Beynolds, deceased, should be released. The court, therefore, sustained the objection of the plaintiff\u2019 to the competency \u00f3f the witness; and the defendant excepted to the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">On the petition of the defendant, a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-7\"><em>B.

Gf.

He was interested in preventing the recovery of the plaintiff. To get rid of this interest, he executed a release. Suppose it good and sufficient for that end: he had a further interest, that the defendant\u2019s costs in the action, which were payable out of the estate, should be reimbursed by a judgment against the plaintiff, unless the liability o\u00ed his distributable share \u00edor a portion of them was released. To effect this, a release from the administrator to him of that liability, would have been proper. <em>Rowt\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Kyle\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>Gilm., 202. I do not see how his release to the administrator can have removed this difficulty. Had he released his whole interest, as the court thought he should do, there could be no question: but as he has not done so, as his release was only of his interest in that controversy, a release from the administrator seems to have been also necessary. If so, the rejection of the evidence was right, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Per curiam, judgment arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
