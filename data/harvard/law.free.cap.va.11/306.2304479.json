Eorsyth, Eli B. Swearingen and John G-oshorn, of the other part, it was recited that Alfred Harkins, son of said William, was indebted to the president, directors and company of the Bank of Mount Pleasant, in the sum of 2,500 dollars, by bond, in which the said James H. Eorsyth and others were his sureties, and that the said William Harkins was indebted to the said president, directors and company, in the sum of 450 dollars, for which the said John G-oshorn and others were his sureties; and thereupon, the said William Harkins and wife conveyed to Eorsyth, Swearingen and Go shorn, a lot of ground in Wheeling, upon condition, that if the said Alfred Harkins, his heirs, executors or administrators, should pay to the said president, directors and company, the debt first mentioned, and all interest that might become due thereon, and save harmless his said sureties therein, and not subject them, or any or either of them, to pay the same, and in case the said sureties, or any or either of them, should pay the said d.ebt, or any part thereof, should'reimburse him or them all money that they should have paid on the same, with its interest, and all costs thereon; and if the said William Harkins should pay to the said president, directors and company, the said debt secondly mentioned, with all interest that might be due thereon, and save harmless his said sureties therein, and not subject them, or any or either of them, to pay the same, or any part thereof, and in case the said sureties, or any or either of them, should pay the said debt, or any part thereof, should reimburse him or them all money that they should have paid on the same, with interest, and all costs thereon; the said indenture, and the estate thereby conveyed, were to cease and determine. Then came 'the following clause: \u201c And it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>hereby declared and agreed, by and between the parties to these presents, that in the mean time, and until-default shall be made by the said Alfred Harkins and William Harkins, in the payment of the debts aforesaid, with their interest, whereby their said sureties shall be compelled to pay the same, contrary to-the-form and effect, true intent and meaning of the provision aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for the-said William Harkins and Elizabeth, his wife, and. their heirs, peaceably and quietly to have, hold and enjoy, the said lot of ground above conveyed, together with the buildings, tenements,, hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and to receive and take the rents and profits thereof to and for their own use and benefit, without, the interruption or hindrance of the said James H.

The hill set forth that the complainants were each .and all of them sureties in the bonds mentioned in the deed; that they have been obliged to pay the bond for 2,500 dollars, which, with interest and costs, amounted, on the - day of May, 1834, to 2,773 dollars, or thereabouts; and that the debt of 450 \u25a0dollars remained due, with a large aniount of interest and costs, all of which they would in a short time be compelled to pay. The prayer was, that the property conveyed might be decreed to be sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">Pending the suit, William Harkins died, and a .supplemental bill was filed, reviving the same against his widow Elizabeth, as his administratrix, and James W. Clemens, as his administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\">Elizabeth Harkins, in her own right, answered, that the original deed was signed by her; that the two justices of the peace asked her, in the absence of her \u2022husband, if she acknowledged it to be her act and -deed, and had willingly signed, sealed and delivered the same, and whether she wished to retract it? And she replied that the same was her act and deed; that she had willingly signed, sealed and delivered the same, and that she wished not to retract it. But she averred, and charged the fact to be, that the justices did not read the deed to her, nor in any manner whatever explain ft to her. She further averred, that at the date of the mortgage, the legal title to the property conveyed was in her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-9\">She also answered in the character of administratrix. Her answer stated that there were no personal assets to pay .the 'demand of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A68\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>On the part of the defendants, the depositions of both the justices were taken. One of them, George Dulty, deposed that he had no recollection of the particular questions propounded to Mrs. Harkins, but he presumed he put the same questions to her, which he-is accustomed to put, as a magistrate, in like cases, which questions are: 1. Do you understand the nature-of the deed? 2. Have you signed it willingly? 3. Have you no wish to retract it? When the party answers that she understands the deed, has signed it willingly, and does not wish to retract it, then he certifies. The deponent stated that he thought these questions were so put, and so answered, in this case. He did not read or explain the deed to Mrs. Harkins, it not being his habit to read or explain a deed to any <em>feme </em>covert, when such <em>feme </em>declares that she understands the nature of the deed. Deponent added, that another question usually put by him to <em>femes covert </em>is, Do you acknowledge this to be your act and deed? And that he would not certify any acknowledgment, unless the questions aforesaid were answered in the-affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-4\">Bichard Simms, the other justice, concurred generally in the statements made by Dulty. It was hie habit, he said, to put his finger on the signature of the feme, and ask her if she acknowledged that to be her act and deed, and desired it to be recorded? He never,, in any instance, read or explained a deed to a <em>feme covert. </em>He asked them if they understood the nature of the deed? And if they answered in the affirmative, that was his explanation. Of Shis particular transaction, he had no recollection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">The cause was heard the 9th of June, 1835. It appearing that the complainants had satisfied the bond for 2,500 dollars, with interest and costs, by paying 1,847 dollars 65 cents, on the 10th of May, 1834, and. 910 dollars 36 cents, on the 27th of May, 1834; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>it also appearing that the defendants had in their hands no assets belonging to the estate of \"William Harkins, wherewith to pay the said sums of money, the court decreed, that unless the sum of 1,847 dollars 65 cents, with interest thereon from the 10th of May, 1834, and the sum of 910 dollars 36 cents, with interest thereon from the 27th of May, 1834, and the costs of this suit, be paid within 30 days, the sheriff of the county, who was appointed a commissioner for the purpose, should proceed to sell the lot of ground conveyed, at public auction, to the highest bidder, at the courthouse of the county upon some court day. The decree then specified the terms of sale, and the time and manner o\u00b1 advertising the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\">On the petition of Elizabeth Harkins, an appeal was allowed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-5\">The cause was argued by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant, and William Smith for the appellees, upon the following points, made by the former:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-6\">1. That the deed was void as to the appellant, for want of that explanation of its nature which the act of assembly positively requires.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">2. That no sale should have been decreed unless the profits were inadequate to indemnify the mortgagees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">3. That the time allowed for the redemption of the land is too short, six months being the regular time for redemption, upon a decree of foreclosure.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-9\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AER\">Among the errors assigned in this case, is the shortness of time allowed by the decree for redemption; the regular allowance, according to the practice of the court, it is contended, being six months. Although, in the view I have taken of this point, it would be unnecessary to give an opinion as to the general rule, yet, as it relates to the every day\u2019s practice of the court, I think it not amiss to say that .1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>know no suck inflexible rule in our courts. According to my recollections, both at the time I was at the bar where Chancellor Carr presided, and when I afferwards succeeded him, the court adopted and pursued the opinion of Chancellor Kent, in <em>Perine </em>v. <em>Dunn, 4 </em>Johns. C. R., 141, regarding it as a matter of sound discretion to fix the period of redemption according to the circumstances of the case. I am very sure there must have been cases in that circuit, where the time allowed was even less than three months; and it is probable the same practice continues. I should be unwilling, therefore, to lay down any inflexible rule on the-subject, as it might lead to mischiet, and is in no wise essential to justice. On the contrary, I think it better that the matter should be left to the sound discretion of the court, and that we should presume the discretion has been properly exercised, where no objection has been made in the court below, and no extension asked for of the time allowed, for redemption. Upon such an application, if refused, the reasons of the court would appear, and the appellate tribunal could then decide whether the discretion had been abused. In the present case, no objection has been made, and the decree, therefore, should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">A second ground of complaint is, if well founded, of much greater importance. It is said that no sale should have been decreed, unless the profits were inadequate to indemnify the mortgagees. .</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">During the argument, it struck me that the conveyance partook somewhat of the character of a welsh mortgage, or of the <em>vivum vadium. </em>I am satisfied I was mistaken. In the welsh mortgage, the rents and profits go against the interest only, (Ooote on Mort., 9,) which would not be the effect of the clause in this deed. And as to the <em>vivum vadium, </em>that is a conveyance to the mortgagee to hold until, out of the rents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and profits, <em>or </em>otherwise, his principle and interest are paid. But here there is an absolute conveyance of the fee, with a defeazance in case of payment; which is precisely of the character of a mortgage. And the clause providing for the entry of the mortgagees after default, is no more than that which is now inserted in many mortgages, except that the words, \u201c for their indemnity,\u201d have been unnecessarily added in this. See 3 Powell on Mort., 1120 a, 1116 a, for the form. The effect of this clause, then, is not to limit, the mortgagees to the perception of the rents and profits for their indemnity, but merely to invest them, in terms, with the right to enter and hold the premises until redemption. Hence it follows, that the right of the mortgagees to foreclose, cannot be impaired by it, nor can \u2022there be any error in decreeing the foreclosure, whether the profits were or were not adequate, in a succession of years, to indemnify the mortgagees.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The other error assigned is, if well founded, vital to the plaintiffs\u2019 demand. It presents a question of great importance, and of the first impression here. It is contended that the mortgage was void as to the <em>feme, </em>for want of that explanation of its nature which the act of assembly requires. \u2022 The certificate of the privy examination, it is admitted, is in due form; but it is alleged that that certificate is false in the point referred to; and the depositions of the justices have been taken to prove its falsity. Let us, then, consider the character of the act, and the meaning and intent of the statute which prescribes it, in order to discover whether dt is susceptible of contradiction by any proof whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">By the common law, a married woman could not, by joining her husband in a deed, bar herself, or those claiming under her, of her own estate. In process of time, however, fines were adapted to this end, and by them the rights of a wife might successfully be passed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>5 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 115, 116. But to prevent imposition upon her, it was at length provided by a statute, that where a <em>feme covert </em>was one of the parties to a fine, s^e should be privily examined, and if she refused her assent, the fine should not be levied. Ibid. This proceeding is the prototype of our privy examination. But though the privy examination was positively enjoined by statute, yet, if a <em>feme </em>was allowed to acknowledge a fine without examination, it nevertheless bound her, and could not be reversed; for she could not contradict the record, which set forth her examination. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">According to the British system of jurisprudence, then, - we see that certain safeguards were thrown around the <em>feme </em>for her protection; but we also see that if those safeguards failed, she was left without a remedy; except in cases of fraud in the'conusee, whom equity would, in such a case, consider a trustee for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In Virginia, as a substitute for the fine, a deed, accompanied by a privy examination of the feme, has been adopted. This privy examination, it is provided, may be taken either before a court of record, or before two justices of the peace. In both cases the same identical requisitions exist. In both it is required that the deed be shewn and explained to her, and that she shall acknowledge it as her act and deed, and declare that she had freely and willingly signed, sealed and delivered it. Where this examination has been made in court, it must be conceded that it is altogether conclusive, and that no allegation can be admitted to contradict the entry upon the record, however much that may be at variance with the, real fact. Though the. judge or justice who examined her may have disregarded every requisition of the statute, yet, when the term is once ended, the truth of the record never can be questioned, but the examination must be taken to have been in truth what by the record it appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>have been. Thus, then, it would seem that like our ancestors, we have, in <em>this </em>provision, been content to throw around the <em>feme covert </em>a certain safeguard, which, nevertheless, may fail to fulfil the-just and benevolent intention of the law-giver. We have not indulged the vain expectation that we have provided against every possible mischief, since we know that perfection is not attainable in human legislation. But we rest upon the assurance, that with these guards, the rights of married women are substantially secured, and that there is much less danger of their suffering by the ignorance or corruption of the courts, than there would be of shaking all confidence in the titles of the country, if <em>femes covert were </em>permitted, at the remotest period, to call in question what has been solemnly recorded in a court of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The second mode of privy examination prescribed by law, is by two justices of the peace; and it seems to be supposed, that because it is a matter <em>in pais, </em>the certificate of the justices may be directly contradicted, and the deed vacated by the testimony of witnesses, and even by the depositions of the justices themselves. Such a position is at variance, I take it, with the spirit and object of the law, and also with the terms of the law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We have already seen that the object of the law was to provide a substitute for the proceeding by fine, whereby the rights of the <em>feme </em>on the one hand might be fenced around, and a sure, indefeasible and unquestionable transfer of her right secured on the other. While the legislature were protecting the wife, can it be believed that they had no regard to the importance of giving confidence to the title ? Can they have been insensible to the ruinous consequences to the prosperity of any commonwealth, of doubt and uncertainty as to land titles? Could they have conceived of any measure more calculated to create these doubts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>than the liberty, at' any remote period, of alleging and proving that the magistrates\u2019certificate is false? \"When they have entrusted the performance of this duty to a Magistracy in whom is even the power of life and death; when they have prescribed the mode of fulfilling it, with a minuteness that one might think would have defied mistake; when they have commanded the act, when completed, to be placed upon the public records; when the act itself is substituted (merely for convenience) for one which, as we have seen, never can be contradicted\u2014can we believe that it ever was contemplated to permit this solemn certificate to be falsified by the testimony o\u00ed witnesses, and even by that of the very magistrates who, under the sanction of their official oaths, have signed and returned the certificate of privy examination? I cannot think it. If such be the law, who will ever resort to this mode of privy examination ? Who will not insist upon the examination before the court, however inconvenient to the parties, or onerous to the courts of justice? Who will sit down content with a title, in all respects complete upon its face, when, upon the death of his vendor, his widow and her magistrates may undo what they have solemnly done by their act, and without the possibility of contradiction, since they alone are permitted to be privies to it? With these startling considerations presenting themselves in opposition to the doctrine, now for the first time, I believe, advanced in our courts, it ceases to be a wonder that, for upwards of a century, no one has ever been found sufficiently adventurous to insist upon such a construction of our statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">But if the door be.once opened to contradictions of the magistrates\u2019 certificates, where is the point at which\u00bb we shall stop? The.writing must be explained; and if the certificate that it was explained can be contradicted, what shall prevent enquiry, whether it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>truly </em>explained? For, if not truly explained, the condition of the <em>feme </em>is surely not better than if the deed were not explained at all. And if, in the complicated provisions of a settlement, the justices become entangled, what shall prevent the proof by the feme, that she has in truth executed a deed altogether different in effect from the explanations which were given to her of that which she had signed? And if these enquiries are to be permitted, and that too when the <em>feme </em>has lain by, during the lifetime of her husband, and rakes up these objections at a remote day, of what value will your privy examinations be? \"Who will take a title depending upon, or which can be traced through them? Ho one. To me, indeed, it seems that the demon of mischief could not suggest a notion better calculated to throw all things, in relation to titles, into their original chaos, than the establishment of the principle here contended for.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\"With these preliminary views of the spirit and meaning of the statute, let us look to its terms. The first part of the clause provides, that if the wife, being examined, shall acknowledge the deed, and such examination and acknowledgment be certified, and such certificate be offered for record, it shall be recorded. Here the clause loses the hypothetical <em>if, </em>and proceeds: \u201cAnd <em>when </em>the privy examination, aeknowlment and declaration of a married woman shall have been so taken in court, and entered of record, or certified by two magistrates, and delivered to the clerk to be recorded, and the deed also shall have been duly acknowledged or.proven as to the husband, and delivered to the clerk to be recorded, pursuant to the directions of this act, such deed shall be as effectual in law to pass all the right, title and interest of the wife, as if she had been an unmarried woman.\u201d Here, then, it is expressly provided, that when the examination shall have been certified and delivered to the clerk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>&amp;c., the deed shall he as effectual as if the maker were sole. The deed, then, is made to depend, not upon the <em>truth, </em>of the certificate, hut upon its existence, and delivery to the clerk; and if so, the enquiry whether it be true or false, is an immaterial enquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">It remains but to qualify the foregoing remarks by observing, that notwithstanding the conclusiveness of the certificate at law, the <em>feme </em>may be relieved in equity, where it has been obtained by the fraud of the party claiming under the deed. Such was the law as to fines, and such must doubtless be the law in reference to this substitute for the fine. Hothine: of that kind is pretended here; so that the deed, I think, stands unimpeached.</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">It may not be amiss, before concluding this opinion, to examine what are the common law principles applicable to the case. And here two enquiries present themselves; first, as to the authenticity attributed by the law to the act itself; and secondly, as to the competency of an officer of the law to unravel a solemn act done by himself in pursuance of its directions. After, a very diligent search, I have been unable to find a case in point, and am therefore compelled to resort to general principles and analogies. How, in relation to the act itself, it has been long the received doctrine, that where the law appoints any person for any specific purpose, it must trust him as far as he acts under its authority. Buffer\u2019s N. P., 229. And it would seem, that \u201c where a written instrument is constituted by law the authentic and sole medium of proving a fact, oral testimony cannot be admitted to prove or disprove it;\u201d and \u201cwhere the law authorizes any person to make an enquiry of a judicial nature, and to register the proceedings, the written instrument so constructed, is the only legitimate medium to prove the result.\u201d 3 Starkie on Evid., 1043,4. Thus, parol evidence cannot be received of the declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u25a0of a prisoner, taken under the statute of Philip &amp; Mary, where the examination has, as required by the statute, been taken in writing; for it will be presumed that the magistrate, who has been entrusted by law to make a memorial of the confession, has acted in conformity with the statute. Id., part 4, p. 50, 1044. So, here, the law has entrusted to the justices to examine a <em>feme- covert, </em>touching the execution of a deed, to take her acknowledgment, and to certify their act to the clerk of the court, in order to its being recorded <em>in perpetuum rei testimonium. </em>It has vested them with the power of doing <em>in pais, </em>for the convenience of the parties, what regularly it is the province of a court to do. It has authorized them to take that privy examination which, in the levy of a fine, constituted part of a judicial proceeding, and never could be contradicted. It has empowered them to take and certify the examination and acknowledgment, which it also makes one \u2022of the functions of its courts of justice, and thus appears to invest them with an authority judicial in its nature. But above all, it constitutes their certificate the authentic and the sole medium of proving that the <em>feme covert </em>has acknowledged the deed, with all the solemnities required by the statute. Ho other testimony can be admitted of the fact, and indeed, from the secret character of the proceeding, none other can exist as to the fact. And when to these considerations we add, that the very object of the privy examination and certificate is to complete, consummate and make final, the contract between the parties, it must be conceded, I think, that there can be no act <em>in pais </em>of the officers of the law, entitled to greater sanctity than thi,s. All the considerations which forbid the introduction of parol testimony to contradict the written contract of the parties, because it is presumed that what has been definitely agreed on is there set down, conspire with-the influence of other principles to protect this solemn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>consummation of a contract, under the sanction of the* magistracy, from being rendered nugatory and void, after the lapse of years, by the slippery testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"AF3E\">hi or is it a new principle in the law, to deem the certificates or returns of a public officer, in the execution of his duty, conclusive of the facts which they contain. Thus, the official return of an execution by' a sheriff, is usually conclusive between the litigating parties, though not as between them and himself; for-he is liable for his false return; as in this case the certifying justices may be liable for theirs. So, I presume, that when the clerk of a court has certified in his deed book, or upon a deed, that it was duly acknowledged by the parties thereto, the certificate is conclusive of the acknowledgment, and cannot he contradicted. By the same reason, the certificate of the-justices, who are equally trusted by the law, must beheld unassailable by the testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Still less consistent with reason or principle would it be, to permit the officer himself to unravel what he-has solemnly done. Can the clerk he permitted to* undo a deed acknowledged before him, after the purchaser has paid his money or fulfilled the consideration, by swearing that his certificate was false ? And' if the clerk cannot do so, upon what principle can the* justice? Upon what principle, in short, could the law permit a contract, closed and consummated by the act of the justice or the clerk, to he opened up and avoided by their testifying to their own official perfidy? I can-see none; nor do I perceive that we violate the principle of <em>Jordaine </em>v. <em>Lashbrooke, </em>7 T. R., 601, in rejecting the testimony of the justices in this matter. Though a mere witness may be admitted to defeat his own attestation, it by no means follows that a public-officer should he permitted to defeat a solemn and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>public act, by contradicting Ms own certificate of tbe manner in wbicb be bas performed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">On tbe whole, I am of opinion to affirm tbe decree in all things.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The other judges concurring, the decree was AEEIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
