Held: Considering the distance of the place appointed for taking the depositions, and the uncertainty of the precise time at which the party would be enabled to have things in readiness for taking them,\u2019 the notice is sufficiently definite.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-9\">\u25a0 A writing, purporting to be tbe. will of Daniel Ilincbeloe tbe elder, of \"Wood county, was proved in tbe court of tbe said county, at tbe August term, 1884, by tbe oatbs of tbe subscribing witnesses, and\u2019was thereupon ordered to be recorded. It bore date tbe 4tb of August, 1826. Tbe testator died tbe 14tb of August, 1834, having' then very nearly completed bis eighty-fourth year. At tbe date of bis will, and at bis death, there were living bis three sons, Nestor, Elijah, and Daniel, an infant son of a deceased daughter, and three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>infant children of another daughter, likewise deceased. The will contained devises or bequests to each of the sons and grand children. The wife of the testator was also a devisee and legatee therein, but she died before him. Daniel Eincheloe, the son of the testator, was appointed the executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-11\">In November, 1884, a bill was filed in the Circuit Superior Court of Wood county, by NTestor Eincheloeagainst Daniel Eincheloe, alleging that the said writing (which he exhibited) was not the will of the decedent; that even if no undue influence had been exerted over him, he was, at the date of the writing,, incapable of making a will, by reason of the imbecility of his mind, arising from extreme old age; that in the enfeebled condition of his mind, the defendant, who was his youngest son, and lived with him, was-enabled to exert, and did exert, an undue influence over him, to induce him to make a will contrary to hi&amp; wishes, and unduly favourable to the defendant; and, that after the execution of the writing, a rigid surveillance was exercised by the defendant, to prevent the testator from making any'alteration in the dispositions, therein contained. The bill called upon the defendant to answer all the foregoing allegations, fully, plainly and distinctly; and also propounded various special interrogatories, of which the most material were, (in substance,) whether the defendant had not frequently heard his father, some years before the date of the writing, declare that he would make no will, that the law should be his will ? Whether the defendant, before and about the date of the said writing, had not frequently said that his father was so infirm as to be incapable of business? And whether the defendant had ever said that his reason for not removing to a farm he had purchased, was the fear' lest his father should alter his will ? The prayer of the bill was, that the court would direct an issue to be made up and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>tried, whether the said writing he the will of the said decedent or not? And if it should he found not to be his will, that the same might be annulled by a decree of the court; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">The answer of Daniel Kincheloe, the defendant, was duly sworn to, and it denied, positively and explicitly, every material allegation contained in the bill, and responded to every material interrogatory in a manner unfavourable to the complainant. Respecting the charges of mental incapacity of the testator, and undue influence exerted over him by the defendant, the terms of the answer were as follows: \u201cRespondent says, that at the time of making and executing the said will, his father was in the full enjoyment of all his mental faculties, and as capable of so doing as at any period of his life; and he fully understood what he was doing. Respondent denies, in the most positive manner, his ever having exercised the least influence over the devisor in making the said will, and declares that all the charges or intimations to that effect contained in the complainant\u2019s bill, are utterly false.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">In April, 1835, it was ordered that an issue be made up, and a jury impannelled on the common law side of the court, to try whether the said writing be the will of Daniel Kincheloe, deceased, or not. At April term, 1836, a jury was accordingly impannelled, and the trial had; when the jury found that the said writing was the true last will and testament of the said decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">Three bills of exceptions were filed by the plaintiff, to opinions of the court given against him upon the trial. Of these, it is only necessary to notice the first and second.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">By theirs? bill of exceptions, it appeared that the plaintiff offered to read in evidence to the jury the depositions of Cyrus Saunders, Abraham Vandiver, George Parker and Elias Kincheloe, taken and certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>fiecl by two justices of the peace of Shelby county, in the state of Missouri, under a commission issued by the Clerk of the Circuit' Court. The commission was dated the 18th of May, 1835, and directed to any two justices of Shelby county aforesaid, requesting them, \u201cthat on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th days of July next, at the house of <em>~W. </em>33. Broughtons, in the county of Shelby, and state of Missouri, between the hours of seven o\u2019clock, A. M., and six o\u2019clock, P. M., of each day,\u201d they should assemble themselves, and examine the said witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-11\">One of the depositions was dated the 10th, another the 11th of July, 1835. Neither the time of taking the two others, nor the place of taking any one of them, was stated or appeared, otherwise than by the certificate of the justices, that each deposition was taken \u201cpursuant to the annexed commission, <em>and also the annexed notice.\u201d </em>And when the depositions were returned to the office of the Circuit Court, under the seals of the justices, no <em>notice </em>was returned with them. It was proved, however, that after the return of the depositions to the office, the counsel of the complainant filed therewith an original notice, from the complainant to the defendant, that the depositions of the said witnesses would be taken on the days, between the hours, and at the place, specified in the commission, and mentioned above; on which notice was an affidavit, dated the 18th of May, 1835, of the service thereof on the defendant, by delivering him a true copy. And it was further proved, that the said counsel enclosed and sent by mail, together with the commission under which the depositions were taken, a true copy of the original notice filed as aforesaid. There being no other evidence that the depositions were taken in pursuance of notice to the defendant, \u2022or at the time and place mentioned in the said original notice, and the defendant having, previously to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>trial, to wit, on the 25th of August, 1885, endorsed upon each deposition an exception, on the ground that no notice of the time and place of taking the same was given him, the court, on the motion of the said defendant, refused to permit the said depositions to he read; to which opinion the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\">The depositions so excluded, contained material evidence for the complainant. Three of the deponents testified, that they were acquainted with the decedent' in the year 1826, and believed that at the date of the writing in question, (the 4th of August, 1826,) he was not capable of making a will. The other deponent testified, that he was acquainted with the decedent from 1815 to 1831, though not sufficiently acquainted to form \u201c any correct opinion as to his capacity;\u201d but from the observations he had been able to make during his acquaintance with him, he did not think him capable of doing any business of importance. This deponent, however, added, that he had no distinct recollection of having been in company with the decedent about the 4th of August, 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\">By the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, it appeared that the defendant offered to read to the jury, as evidence, the bill filed in the cause, together with the answer of the said defendant thereto, and asked the court to instruct the jury, that the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the answer, as evidence bn his behalf, upon the trial of the issue, in the same manner, and to the same extent, that an answer of a defendant would he evidence for him upon the hearing of a cause in a court of equity. The plaintiff objected to the reading of the said answer as evidence upon the trial of the issue, and to the giving of such instruction as to the effect of the answer when read; but the court overruled his objections, permitted the answer to he read, and gave the instruction prayed for; to which opinions the plaintiff* excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The verdict, and all th.e proceedings had upon the trial of the issue, being certified to the court on its chancery side, the complainant moved the court to award a new trial of the said issue, upon the grounds set out in the bills of exceptions aforesaid. This motion the court overruled. The cause then came on to be heard upon the bill and exhibit, the answer of the defendant, and the verdict of the jury; - \u201cwhereupon,\u201d (the record proceeds,) \u201c it appealing to the court here, from the verdict aforesaid, that the will in the bill and proceedings mentioned, is the true last will and testament of said Daniel Kincheloe, deceased, but all parties in interest not being before the court, so as to authorize a decree affirming said will, it is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the bill of the complainant be dismissed,\u201d with costs to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-9\">From which decree the complainant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-10\"><em>Fisher, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-11\"><em>Johnson, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-12\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5e\">In the case of <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Selden, </em>this court decided that the decree dismissing the bill on the merits, ought not to be reversed merely on the ground that some of the persons concerned in interest had not been made parties. It is the business of the plaintiff to make all proper parties. If he fails to do so, it is too late for him, in the appellate court, to take advantage of his own omission, for the purpose of reversing a decree which is correct and proper in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">If, therefore, the decree were right on the merits, it would be too late now to object to the want of parties, whatever may have been the reason which operated on the mind of the chancellor in dismissing the bill. And if it be wrong on the merits, it ought to be reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u25a0on that ground, and not on the ground of the want of parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In a suit in chancery, the object of which is to contest the validity of a will, on an issue <em>devisavit vel non, </em>under the act of assembly, \u00cd do not think that the answer of the defendant becomes, of necessity, evidence In the cause, on the question as to the validity of the will. Where no appeal is made to the conscience of the defendant, where no discovery is sought from him as to facts within his particular knowledge, but he is \u2022called on to answer, merely as a step or part of the proceeding through which it is necessary to pass, for obtaining a trial before a jury; in such a ease, it would be unjust to make the answer evidence as to the validity of the will. In such a case, the statements of the answer are entitled, to no more weight than the allegations of the bill. In such a case, the position of .a party as defendant entitles him to no advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">But, in the case before us, an appeal is directly made to the conscience of the defendant, by various searching interrogatories, which he is called on to answer specially. Being thus called on and required to give evidence which might have operated against him, he ought, on the principle of chancery practice, to be entitled to its benefit when it operates in its favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">I am of opinion, nevertheless, that the decree dismissing the bill, is wrong on the merits. The verdict of the jury ought to be set aside, because it was rendered on a trial in which material testimony, offered by the plaintiff, was excluded from the consideration of the jury. The objection to the excluded depositions, founded on the alleged insufficiency or illegality of the notice, is in my opinion not valid. When we consider the great distance of the place where the depositions were to be taken, the uncertainty of being able to arrive there at a particular day, and the diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>culty and uncertainty of procuring the attendance of the commissioners, and of numerous witnesses, at the same time and place, it was quite reasonable to notify the adverse party that the depositions would be taken on six successive days, so as to justify the taking of them on any of the days, even the last.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">On this ground, I am for reversing the decree, and remanding the cause for a new trial of the issue. And as the cause is necessarily to go back, I think the complainant should be ruled to make all proper parties, and on his failure to do so, that the hill should be dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b436-12\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Tn\">In this case, I am of opinion that the decree of dismission of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, was erroneous. That dismission was not upon the merits, but for want of parties. This distinctly appears to my mind, from the terms of the decree. After reciting the return of a verdict in favour of the will, it proceeds\u2014\u201cbut all parties in interest not being before the court, so as to authorize a decree affirming said will,\u201d it is decreed that the bill be dismissed. Here there is a disclaimer of a decree on the merits, -and a dismission because there are not parties to enable the court to render such decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Considered as a dismission for want of parties, it was erroneous; for the court should rather have ordered the proper parties to be made, and have given time to amend the bill; and the bill should only have been dismissed in case the plaintiff failed to make parties. <em>Allen, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Leigh, 231; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Kirwan, </em>Jacob, 163; 4 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 76; <em>Green </em>v. Poole, 4 Bro. P. C. 122, (ed. Toml. vol. 5, p. 504;) <em>Key </em>v. <em>Hord, &amp;c., </em>4 Munf., 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">But if the dismission be considered as a decree on the merits, it was yet more erroneous. Eor no decree can be properly pronounced affirming the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of a will, (which, is the effect of a dismission on the merits here,) unless all persons concerned in interest .are before the court. For the will cannot be good against some of the heirs, and void as to others; nor can a verdict and decree against one bind the others. The other heirs may therefore file their bills, and on the trial of an issue, it may be found against the will. If so, then the will would be void as to them, and good against hTestor Kincheloe, if this decree is to be taken .as affirming the will .as to him. This cannot be. \"Where it appears that all persons interested are not before the court, the court should require the parties to be made, and if not made in reasonable time, the bill should be dismissed, not on the merits, but for defect of parties. The question of the validity of a \u2022will is integral, and cannot be disposed of piecemeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqr\">With these views, I cannot go into the other questions, which are not before us, as the dismission has been for want of parties only; but am of opinion to reverse the decree of dismission, and send the cause back, that the proper parties may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The decree of the Court of Appeals was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u201c The court is of opinion that the depositions offered by the appellant in evidence on the trial of the issue, were improperly excluded from the jury. The court is \"further of opinion, that though the omission to make .all the heirs of the testator parties, if that were the \u2022only objection to the decree, would not authorize the reversal of it, at the instance and for the benefit of the party guilty of the omission, yet, as the decree is to be reversed on a different ground, and the cause remanded, if is proper, when the case goes back to the Circuit Court, that that court should require the other heirs to be made parties; and as the introduction of the other parties may change the question presented by the appellant\u2019s exception to the introduction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>effect of the answer of the appellee, as evidence on-the trial of the issue, that question need not be (as it is not) decided. Therefore,\u201d decree reversed with? costs, and cause remanded to the Circuit Court, \u201c with; directions to require the appellant to make the other-heirs parties, and on his failure to do so in a reasonable time, to dismiss his bill for want of parties; and in the event the parties are made, for such further proceedings as may be proper.\u201d</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Judge <em>Stanard </em>also delivered a separate opinion in the foregoing case ; but, as he informed the reporter, the manuscript was after-wards mislaid or lost. His opinion, (according to a summary furnished by him to the reporter,) was, 1st. That the answer to a bill for an issue <em>devisavit vel non, </em>cannot be used as evidence for the respondent, in respect to facts alleged in the bill, and thereby urged against the validity of the will, and denied by the answer, except where the facts are suggested to be, or from their nature must ber within the special knowledge of the respondent, and as to.them am appeal is made to his conscience, and a discovery specifically called, for from him. \"When, therefore, the bill suggests invalidity of the will, for want of testamentary capacity of the decedent, by reason of age, or defect of intellect, or other cause, not produced by the immediate agency, nor coming within the particular knowledge, of the respondent, the answer asserting the testamentary capacity, and denying the existence of the suggested defect or cause, is not evidence to the jury for the respondent, to prove such capacity. 2dly. He was also of opinion, that, making due allowance for the distance of the place at which the depositions were to be taken, the notice in this, case was sufficiently definite, and that the court erred in the opinion, by which the said depositions were excluded from the jury. And ha, concurred' in. the decree that was rendered By this court..</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
