For reasons that follow, we reverse the judgments in both cases; we further remand Case No. A17A0918 for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   During divorce proceedings between James Cureton (Husband) and Jennifer Cureton (Wife), Husband cross-claimed that Wife had wrongfully sold certain of his personal property, including a 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air vehicle. Husband identified the individuals he believed had purchased his belongings, and made prayer for either the return of his items, or \"[i]n the event said items are no longer available, said third party defendants should be required to pay the fair market value.\" Additionally, Husband filed a motion seeking to add as party-defendants to his cross-claim those persons he believed had obtained his property, eventually naming Sampson as the individual who had received the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court conducted a hearing on Husband's motion, and Sampson appeared pro se. Thereafter, on August 16, 2011, the court entered an order joining the identified persons. Pertinent to Sampson, the court found that Wife had indeed sold the vehicle to him and that, without Sampson added as a party, \"complete relief cannot be afforded to [Husband].\" The court reserved for subsequent determination issues of whether the vehicle was marital or separate property, whether Wife had held any ownership interest in the vehicle when she sold it, and whether the sale of the vehicle was valid and to a bona fide purchaser. Thereupon, the court ordered that all added parties were \"enjoined from selling ... or otherwise disposing of said property until further Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Several years later, a rule nisi was issued in the divorce action, identifying Sampson as a joined party-defendant and scheduling for March 12, 2015 a hearing to show why the court should not grant Husband's prayers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   that each and every sale of the property of [Husband] and the property of this marriage\n   be set aside, declared null and void, and all property be returned to [Husband] or in the event these items are no longer retrievable, the\n   [joined party-defendants] be required to pay an amount equivalent to the fair market value of each and every item of [Husband].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Service of the rule nisi was attempted upon Sampson at his residence, but he refused to accept any document; the rule nisi was left at Sampson's door. Sampson was neither present nor represented by counsel at the evidentiary hearing held as scheduled. Thereafter, on May 14, 2015, the superior court entered an \"Order and Judgment in Resolution of Claims Outside The Domestic Case,\" determining that the vehicle was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   marital property, but \"the individual property of [Husband].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In that order, the court additionally found that Sampson was not a bona fide purchaser for value, declared Wife's sale of the vehicle to Sampson void, and directed the sheriff to accompany Husband to Sampson's residence to retrieve the vehicle. The court went on to provide in its order that if the vehicle was not returned to Husband's possession within 48 hours of an attempted retrieval,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Husband] may immediately petition this court for a citation of contempt on ... Sampson, and petition for a hearing for a monetary judgment against ... Sampson in the amount of the fair market value of the car, as testified to at the March [12], 2015 hearing, and all associated cost and attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2015, Husband returned to superior court and filed two motions. In a \"Motion to Clarify Order and Judgment In Resolution of Claims Outside the Domestic Case,\" Husband alleged that he had been unable to retrieve the vehicle because Sampson had sold it on eBay. Husband posited:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   While [Husband] would assert that Sampson is clearly in willful contempt of this Court's August 16, 2011 Order [joining party-defendants to the divorce action and enjoining those parties from selling or otherwise disposing of certain items], he would also assert that the evidence in this case is closed and that the Court can determine [Husband's] damages without the necessity of any additional court hearings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thus reciting evidence presented at the March 12, 2015 hearing regarding the fair market value of the vehicle, Husband requested that judgment be entered in his favor for \"the fair market value of the vehicle, which are the damages of [Husband].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a second motion filed that same day, captioned \"Motion for Citation of Contempt and Expenses of Litigation,\" Husband specifically\n   requested that Sampson be held in contempt for failing to comply with two orders: (i) the August 16, 2011 order, enjoining the added party-defendants from selling or otherwise disposing of certain items, including the vehicle; and (ii) the May 14, 2015 order, mandating the return of the vehicle to Husband's possession. Additionally, Husband claimed that Sampson owed him attorney fees under OCGA \u00a7 13-6-11\"for having to pursue this action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The superior court granted Husband's motions. In an order entered August 7, 2015 (hereinafter, \"Money Damages Judgment\"), the superior court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court finds that the evidence is closed in this matter, as a result of the final hearing held on March 12, 2015. [Husband] has shown ... that ... Sampson has not produced the 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air \"vehicle\" within 48 hours of this Court's May 14, 2015 Order. As such, the defendant is entitled to money damages as proven at the final hearing ... for the value of the 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air \"vehicle\" ... in the amount of $44,550.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an order entered August 20, 2015 (hereinafter, \"Contempt Judgment\"), the superior court held Sampson in contempt of the two orders cited by Husband. The court found further that Sampson had acted in bad faith, been stubbornly litigious, and caused Husband unnecessary trouble and expense. The court then ruled that Sampson could purge himself of the contempt by satisfying the $44,550.00 money judgment and additionally paying to Husband $6,746.25 for his incurred attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With those favorable judgments, Husband commenced in the same superior court a separate garnishment action, pursuant to which funds were transferred from Sampson's\n   bank account into the court's registry. Meanwhile, Sampson obtained counsel. In the divorce action, Sampson filed in November 2015 a motion to set aside the Money Damages Judgment and the Contempt Judgment. Among the arguments advanced, Sampson claimed that he was never properly served with various pleadings and orders (such as the order adding him as a party-defendant), and that a judgment for damages against him as a party-defendant joined in a divorce action was impermissible as a matter of law. In the garnishment action, Sampson filed a traverse, citing his challenges to the underlying two judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Opposing Sampson's motion to vacate the judgments entered in the divorce action, Husband cited that OCGA \u00a7 9-11-60 (d) permits a judgment to be set aside on three grounds, then argued that Sampson\n   had failed to establish any of the bases. In the garnishment action, Husband maintained the validity of the underlying judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In both cases, the superior court ruled against Sampson, and in favor of Husband-denying Sampson's motion to set aside, denying his traverse, and ordering that monies collected in the garnishment action be disbursed from the court's registry to Husband. Contesting these rulings, Sampson filed discretionary applications,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which this Court granted, giving rise to the instant appeals. We consider first Case No. A17A1070, wherein Sampson challenges the denial of his motion to set aside the Money Damages Judgment and the Contempt Judgment entered in the divorce action. We consider next Case No. A17A0918, wherein Sampson challenges the garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Case No. A17A1070\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Money Damages Judgment\n   </em>\n   . Advancing multiple arguments, Sampson contends that the superior court erred by refusing to set aside the judgment holding him liable for money damages for Husband's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (a) Relying on\n   <em>\n    Shah v.

In\n   <em>\n    Shah\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Georgia addressed the authority of a trial court to join a third party, who was the grantee of disputed property.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    Id. at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    513 S.E.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The Court held that a third party could be joined\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   as a party to the divorce action only for the\n   <em>\n    limited purpose\n   </em>\n   of determining [the third party's] relative substantive right in the property that [one of the divorcing spouses] claimed was fraudulently conveyed to [that third party]. [Such divorcing spouse] could not use the fraudulent conveyance claim and the joinder of [the third party] in order to make an independent tort claim against him. In the absence of any applicable joinder provision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that claim would have to be asserted against [the third party] in a separate civil action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Citation omitted; emphasis supplied.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    Id. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    513 S.E.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A contrary holding,\" the Supreme Court reasoned, \"would mean that every divorce action in which a fraudulent conveyance claim has been\n   joined would become the potential source of innumerable independent extraneous claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims between non-parties to the original proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Shah\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that it was error to allow a recovery of damages from the third party joined in that divorce action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the instant divorce action, Husband accused Wife of wrongfully selling his vehicle to Sampson, then obtained an order joining Sampson as a party-defendant on such cross-claim. The superior court determined that neither Wife nor Sampson had any right to the vehicle and that it belonged solely to Husband. With those favorable rulings, Husband pursued relief against Sampson on his cross-claim-Husband procured an order directing Sampson to return his vehicle to his possession; and when it became apparent that retrieving his vehicle was not attainable, Husband sought and was granted money\n   damages for the value of the vehicle. But in light of\n   <em>\n    Shah\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the Money Damages Judgment was impermissible because it exceeded the \"only ... limited purpose\" for which Sampson was joined in the divorce action.\n   <em>\n    Shah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    270 Ga. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    513 S.E.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (i) In so concluding, we are unconvinced by Husband's arguments that the Money Damages Judgment should nevertheless stand. Husband points out that Sampson appeared at the initial hearing on the motion to add parties, asserting further that Sampson could have-but did not-file any defensive pleadings or otherwise participate in the case until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Money Damages Judgment was rendered. In essence, Husband contends that the superior court was authorized to enter a default judgment against Sampson in the divorce action based upon his non-participation in the case. But to the extent that the Money Damages Judgment is akin to a default judgment, holding Sampson liable for the fair market value of the vehicle was impermissible as beyond the scope of the \"only ... limited purpose\" for which Sampson was joined to the divorce action.\n   <em>\n    Shah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    270 Ga. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74686\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/270/649/\">\n    513 S.E.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
