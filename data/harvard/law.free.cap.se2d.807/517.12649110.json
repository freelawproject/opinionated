Following that indictment, Almanza's alleged victim (Almanza's stepdaughter) and her mother (Almanza's wife) left Cobb County, and the District Attorney's subsequent efforts to locate these witnesses\n   have been unsuccessful. The State therefore filed a motion in limine seeking an order that would allow prosecutors to introduce into evidence the testimony of two of the child's treating physicians as to statements made to the doctors by the child's mother and in which the mother related both the child's allegations of abuse and the fact that the child had identified Almanza as her abuser. Following a hearing at which both physicians testified, the trial court granted that motion in part and denied it in part. The State now appeals, asserting that the trial court erred when it found that those portions of the mother's statements that identified Almanza as the perpetrator of the alleged\n   crimes did not fall within the hearsay exception found in OCGA \u00a7 24-8-803 (4). For reasons explained more fully below, we affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling as to the admissibility of hearsay evidence only for an abuse of discretion.

The mother reported these accusations to law enforcement, who arrested Almanza on May 28, 2014. Police also instructed the mother to take the child for a physical exam at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (\"CHOA\"), which the mother did on May 29, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After granting the State several continuances, the trial court set trial for Monday, May 23, 2016. On Friday, May 20, the State filed both a motion for a continuance and the motion in limine that gave rise to this appeal. At the October 2016 hearing on its motion in limine, the State presented the testimony of Dr. Lynward Barrett, the pediatric emergency room physician who examined the child at CHOA in May 2014. Dr. Barrett testified that the mother reported that her daughter had told her that Almanza had molested her on two occasions by touching the child's vagina and by placing his penis \"inside of her.\" The mother further related that, according to the child, these acts had taken place approximately one year earlier. Dr. Barrett performed a physical exam of the child, consulted with a social worker to make sure that law enforcement was involved and that the alleged abuser no longer had access to the child, and referred the child for psychological counseling. According to Dr. Barrett, he obtained all his information from the mother, he asked questions only to the mother, and he did not recall the child saying anything either before, during, or after the exam.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The victim's regular pediatrician, Charles Richards, also testified and stated that he had seen the child and her mother in his office on June 6, 2014, for treatment of the child's viral symptoms, including\n   a fever, headaches, and muscle aches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Richards further testified that as he was finishing his exam of the child, the mother became emotional and stated that the child had recently reported that approximately one year earlier Almanza had raped her on two different occasions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Richards testified that all of the information he received regarding the allegations of sexual molestation came from the\n   mother and that the child did not say anything during this visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court entered an order ruling that the doctors would be allowed to testify at trial as to any findings they made during the physical exam of the child and to the mother's statements regarding the fact that the child had reported being sexually abused. The court further ruled, however, that the physicians could not testify as to \"[a]ny identification of [Almanza] as the abuser.\" The State now appeals that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State sought to introduce the out-of-court statements at issue under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-803 (4) of Georgia's current Evidence Code, which went into effect January 1, 2013. That evidentiary rule, which is substantially similar to Fed. Rule of Evid. 803 (4),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that\n   hearsay statements are admissible \"even though the declarant is available as a witness\" if they are\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describ[e] medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   OCGA \u00a7 24-8-803 (4). The language of OCGA \u00a7 24-8-803 (4) is virtually identical to the former OCGA \u00a7 24-3-4, which existed as part of Georgia's previous Evidence Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court therefore relied on cases decided under the former code section in deciding the State's motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Citing our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441348\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/180/\">\n    299 Ga. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441348\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/180/\">\n    787 S.E.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the State argues that the trial court erred in relying on pre-2013 precedent to deny in part its motion in limine.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   involved the application of the sequestration rule found in OCGA \u00a7 24-6-615, which differed in several significant respects from the sequestration provision in the pre-2013 Evidence Code (former OCGA \u00a7 24-9-61.) After addressing the merits of the appeal, the Supreme Court expressed its frustration at the parties' failure to acknowledge the difference between the two sequestration provisions and to cite relevant law in their briefs, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [T]his case was tried under our State's new Evidence Code, and\n   <em>\n    the key evidence rules we must apply\n   </em>\n   - OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 24-6-615 and 24-4-403 -\n   <em>\n    differ from the pertinent provisions of the old Evidence Code and instead track the analogous federal evidence rules\n   </em>\n   , meaning that we will look to those federal rules and the federal case law interpreting them for guidance. Nevertheless, in their briefs to this Court, Appellant cited OCGA \u00a7 24-6-615 only in passing and failed to cite\n   OCGA \u00a7 24-4-403 ; the State cited neither new rule; and neither party cited any case law interpreting these provisions of the new Evidence Code or the parallel provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence. It may be that the result of this case would be the same if we applied the old Evidence Code and our decisions interpreting it, but if so, that is happenstance,\n   <em>\n    at least without careful comparison of the old and new law\n   </em>\n   . Georgia lawyers do this Court no favors-and risk obtaining reversible evidence rulings from trial courts-when they fail to recognize that we are all living in a new evidence world and are required to analyze and apply the new law. It may be hard to comprehend that, when it comes to trials and hearings held after January 1, 2013, the most pertinent precedent to cite on an evidentiary issue\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be a decades-old decision of the Eleventh Circuit (or even the old Fifth Circuit), instead of a week-old unanimous decision of this Court (if we were deciding the appeal of a case tried before 2013 and governed by the old rules, as still frequently occurs).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441348\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/180/\">\n    299 Ga. at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441348\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/180/\">\n    787 S.E.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (punctuation and footnote omitted; emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relying on this language, the State argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it relied on cases decided under former OCGA \u00a7 24-3-4 ; that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   mandates that in the absence of a Georgia appellate case addressing the post-2013 evidentiary rule at issue, trial courts are required to look at federal precedent when interpreting and applying such a rule; and that under relevant federal precedent, the mother's statement that the child had identified Almanza as her abuser was admissible. We find these arguments to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State's argument is based on a misinterpretation of\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   . That case did not invalidate the precedential value of all cases decided under Georgia's former Evidence Code. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   addressed those situations where the new Evidence Code represents a substantive change from the prior code. In such cases, \"to the extent that the new [evidentiary] rule[ ] [at issue] ... borrow[s] from the text of the federal evidence rules,\" courts should \"look for guidance to the decisions of the federal appellate courts, particularly the United States Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit, interpreting the federal rule[ ] in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441348\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/180/\">\n    299 Ga. at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (a) (2),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441348\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/180/\">\n    787 S.E.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

In deciding the admissibility of the mother's statement, therefore, the trial court properly relied on cases decided under the former Evidence Code.

Accordingly, analyzing whether a medical professional considers certain information relevant to a patient's treatment offers no guarantee as to the inherent trustworthiness of the identification information being provided by the declarant. In other words, in the absence of some showing that a statement arose from the declarant's desire for effective medical treatment, there is no inherent trustworthiness in a hearsay statement identifying the perpetrator. See\n   <em>\n    Colvard v.Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323320\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/309/239/#p245\">\n    309 S.W.3d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245-246 (I) (D) (Ky. 2010) (rejecting the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Renville\n   </em>\n   and holding that Kentucky Rule of Evidence 803 (4) did not permit the introduction of identification statements in child molestation cases) (overruling the court's previous decision in\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

And we find that this reasoning applies even though the\n   out-of-court statement may impose on medical personnel certain legal reporting requirements, may impact a child's living situation, or may result in the child being referred for psychological counseling. As the Maryland Court of Appeals explained when declining to follow the\n   <em>\n    Renville\n   </em>\n   rationale,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [t]he state of mind of a declarant vis-\u00e0 -vis anticipated physical treatment is quite different from the state of mind of a declarant vis-\u00e0 -vis anticipated social disposition. The situations may be the same to the doctor; they are not the same to the patient. Physical self-survival dictates revealing even embarrassing truth to avoid the risk of the wrong medicine or the needless operation. Presupposing a declarant conscious of the probable consequences of his assertions, the imperative to speak truthfully is not nearly so strong when the anticipated result is a social disposition. The temptation to influence the result may, indeed, run in quite the opposite direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Cassidy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4444760\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/74/1/\">\n    536 A.2d at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, the trustworthiness of identification statements is even more questionable where, as in this case, the child is not the declarant and the information that a family member is abusing the child is provided by another adult in the same household. Put another way, in cases involving family disputes, a parent or guardian's motive for casting blame for a child's abuse may or may not be in the child's best interest or for the purpose of medical diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Given that out-of-court statements identifying the party responsible for a victim's injuries do not carry with them the same guarantee of trustworthiness as other statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, we conclude that such statements do not fall within the hearsay exception at issue. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the those portions of the mother's statements in which she claimed that her child had identified Almanza as the child's abuser are not admissible under OCGA \u00a7 24-8-803 (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   McFadden, P.
