He makes several assignments of error, including the refusal of the trial court to dismiss the charges against him because the state had failed to bring him to trial within the 90-day period specified by ORS 135.763.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 135.765<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ORS 135.760.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant was in the custody of the Corrections Division when notice described in ORS 135.760(2) was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Under ORS 135.763(1), an inmate defendant may request an early trial on the charges pending against him by serving a written notice on the district attorney of the county in which he is charged. The question here is whether a \"certified true copy\u201d of such a notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>certified by defense counsel, is sufficient to invoke a defendant\u2019s rights under ORS 135.760 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\">ORS 135.760(2) provides that the notice to the district attorney shall be \"signed by the inmate.\u201d The notice served upon the district attorney contained only \"/S/\u201d on the line above the word \"defendant\u201d but the ribbon copy that defendant had filed with the clerk of the court had been signed by defendant personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We are unaware of any case that addresses the question of what constitutes sufficient compliance with the notice provisions of ORS 135.760 enabling an inmate defendant to invoke the statutory right to a speedy trial. We do note, however, that ORS 135.760 <em>et seq. </em>was designed to implement the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial. <em>State v. Vawter, </em>236 Or 85, 87, 386 P2d 915 (1963). To foster that end, we liberally construe the requirement that the notice given to the district attorney be \"signed by the inmate.\u201d The notice filed did bear defendant\u2019s signature and the copy informed the district attorney of defendant\u2019s desire to avail himself of the rights accorded by ORS 135.760 <em>et seq. Cf. Bevel v. Gladden, </em>232 Or 578, 583, 376 P2d 117 (1962); <em>State v. Gray, </em>26 Or App 901, 905, 554 P2d 638 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We hold that under the facts of this case the \"CERTIFIED TRUE COPY\u201d of the notice served on the district attorney was sufficient to cast upon the state the duty of bringing defendant to trial within 90 days. Since the state failed to do so or to ask for a continuance, <em>see </em>ORS 135.763(2), it was error for the trial court to deny defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>ORS 135.765.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-5\"> ORS 135.763 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\"(1) The district attorney, after receiving a notice requesting trial under ORS 135.760, shall, within 90 days of receipt of the notice, bring the inmate to trial upon the pending charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">\"(2) A continuance may be granted upon the request of the district attorney and with the consent of the inmate.
