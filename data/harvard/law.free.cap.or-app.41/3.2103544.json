Defendant moved for a summary judgment on the basis that plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiff appeals from an order granting the motion and entering judgment for defendant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">It is agreed that the two-year statute of limitations applies and that the plaintiff filed his complaint on August 26, 1977. Plaintiff testified by deposition that by March of 1975 the damage caused by the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence was largely done, that he was aware of the damage at that time, and that by July of 1975 he knew that the defendant did not propose to go ahead with the incorporation of plaintiff\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The trial court correctly resolved the issue. <em>Davis v.
