In that proceeding, Wackenhut obtained a preliminary injunction, the language of which was as broad as the contractual language,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barring Kennedy from working for any of Wackenhut\u2019s competitors for a period of three years within 300 miles of any place where Wackenhut, or a subsidiary, engaged in business. Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 65(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wackenhut posted a bond underwritten by defendant Industrial Indemnity Company in the amount of $10,000, as fixed by the court. Approximately one year later, Kennedy\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment was granted on the ground that the contractual covenant was too broad. The injunction was dissolved and, on Wackenhut\u2019s subsequent motion, the action was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>missed without prejudice, but its motion to exonerate the surety on the injunction bond was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">Thereafter, Kennedy commenced this action against Wackenhut and Industrial Indemnity. Both the pleadings and the proceedings in the trial court are pregnant with confusion, and in order to make some sense and order out of them we will interpolate where necessary, sometimes liberally.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The complaint is characterized as an \"Action at Law For Malicious Use of Process and Against Surety Bond,\u201d and alleges two causes of action. We construe the first cause of action to be one for malicious use of civil process against the defendant Wackenhut, adequately alleging the elements of such a claim: commencement and prosecution by defendant of the federal proceeding, termination of the proceeding in plaintiff\u2019s favor, the absence of probable cause to prosecute the action, the existence of malice and damages. <em>See Alvarez v. Retail Credit Ass\u2019n, </em>234 Or 255, 381 P2d 499 (1963). Damages claimed include special, compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We construe the second cause of action, which incorporates by reference the first cause of action, as being a claim against both Wackenhut and Industrial Indemnity for wrongful issuance of an injunction, (see Albrecht v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 159 Or 331, 80 P2d 62 (1938)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with respect to which, if Oregon law is applicable, it is no defense that the injunction was sought in good faith and with sufficient cause<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if it is ultimately determined that the party who obtained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>preliminary injunction was not entitled to a permanent injunction. <em>See Pearson v. Sigmund, </em>263 Or 626, 503 P2d 702 (1972). Apparently under the second cause of action Kennedy sought the same damages against Wackenhut as was claimed in the first cause of action, and as against Industrial Indemnity he sought damages to the limit of its liability under the surety bond, that is, $10,000, plus attorney\u2019s fees incurred for his opposition to the issuance of the preliminary injunction in the federal court, and also attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to ORS 743.114.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">In the trial court, Wackenhut filed a motion for summary judgment on the sole ground that the issuance of the preliminary injunction by the federal court was conclusive evidence of sufficient cause for its issuance, and therefore Kennedy\u2019s claim against it fails as a matter of law. The trial court granted that motion and a judgment was entered in favor of Wackenhut.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We construe the motion to be one for partial summary judgment, because, at most, it only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>disposed of the claim against Wackenhut based upon malicious use of civil process, not the claim for wrongfully obtaining issuance of the injunction. In this court Wackenhut cites no authority to sustain the trial court\u2019s ruling, but relies instead on the doctrine of collateral estoppel, citing <em>Bahler v. Fletcher, </em>257 Or 1, 474 P2d 329 (1970). If the doctrine is applicable, it would apply equally to the federal court\u2019s refusal to exonerate the surety, thereby creating two conflicting collateral estoppels: a stand-off. We hold it to be inapplicable. Wackenhut goes on to argue, we think correctly, that the granting of the preliminary injunction by the federal court constituted <em>prima facie </em>evidence of probable cause,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but since the motion for summary judgment was not supported by affidavits, etc., the allegations of Kennedy\u2019s complaint were sufficient,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if proved, to overcome the <em>prima facie </em>effect of the granting of the preliminary injunction. The trial court should not have granted what we consider to have been a motion for partial summary judgment for Wackenhut.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">After the trial court disposed of that motion, the remainder of the case went to trial. There is an indication at the commencement of the proceedings, which were ultimately tried to the court without a jury, that the trial was only with respect to Industrial Indemnity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, because we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>summary judgment was only partial with respect to Wackenhut, leaving the claim for wrongful issuance of a preliminary injunction remaining, we interpret the proceedings as being a trial on the claim against both Wackenhut and Industrial Indemnity for the wrongful issuance of the injunction. If Wackenhut, as principal, were not liable to Kennedy, we know of no authority holding the surety liable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and there would have been no purpose in going to trial. No prejudice results from so considering the trial because the issues against both defendants are the same, except, possibly, with respect to the amount of damages, which is limited to $10,000 against Industrial Indemnity by the terms of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">It appears from the record that at the outset plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not contend that because it was ultimately determined that the injunction should not have issued, the only issue at the trial was damages. Instead, counsel agreed that the issues of good faith and sufficient cause were questions to be decided,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in addition to special and compensatory damages. Accordingly, the case was tried on this theory. At the conclusion of the trial the trial judge found that Wackenhut had commenced the federal proceedings in good faith and sought and obtained the preliminary injunction with sufficient cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Based upon those findings, the trial judge found for the defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Defendants contend that the trial judge properly held that in order for plaintiff to prevail on his claim for the wrongful issuance of the injunction, it was necessary for plaintiff to prove that the injunction was obtained in bad faith and without sufficient cause. The argument is that the bond was issued pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure, and that if the claim were made in federal court, as it could have been ancillary to the principal proceeding in that court, the federal judge would have discretion to allow or disallow damages against the surety. We need not pursue this question in depth, however, because the remedy sought here by Kennedy is a state remedy and the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Pearson v. Sigmund, supra, </em>held that it was not necessary for the enjoined party to establish that the injunction was obtained in bad faith and without sufficient cause. It is true that in <em>Pearson </em>the Oregon Court was construing ORS 32.020,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which is the Oregon equivalent of FRCP 65(c), and uses substantially the same language. The Oregon Court, however, construed the statute as providing the substantive basis for a claim for the wrongful issuance of an injunction, and we conclude that the state substantive rule ought to be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In light of that determination, we conclude that the trial court erred in entering judgment for defendants after the trial. However, after the court indicated what its ruling would be after the evidence was in, counsel for both parties requested the court to determine what the damages would be under this cause of action. The trial court complied by finding that plaintiff\u2019s damages were limited to his loss of wages and other employment benefits for the four-day interval between the issuance of the preliminary injunction and the onset of plaintiff\u2019s illness which resulted in his total disability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Having agreed that the trial judge might determine those damages, neither party should be allowed to relitigate them. There being evidence to support those findings, we cannot say as a matter of law that the trial court was wrong. The trial court did not, however, determine what attorney\u2019s fees Kennedy should be allowed for defending the application for the preliminary injunction in the federal court, and in seeking to have it dissolved. That amount needs to be determined. The plaintiff is not, however, entitled to statutory attorney\u2019s fees under ORS 743.114.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">We are left with the anomalous situation where Wackenhut\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment was erroneously granted, but the subsequent trial, which we interpret to have been against both Wackenhut and Industrial Ind\u00e9mnity for the wrongful issuance of the injunction, litigated the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Which we conclude were open with respect to the summary judgment motion: whether the federal court action was commenced in good faith and whether there was sufficient cause for the issuance of the preliminary injunction. Those issues were resolved against the plaintiff in the subsequent trial in which those issues were irrelevant. Since the plaintiff had a full opportunity to present evidence on these issues, and stated to the court that he wanted to make the strongest possible record on them, we see no reason to remand the case for retrial of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">However, whether there was sufficient cause to issue the preliminary injunction is a question of law for the court to decide. The rule is stated in <em>Alvarez v. Retail Credit Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 261, quoting from <em>Kuhnhausen v. Stadelman, </em>174 Or 290, 148 P2d 239, 149 P2d 168 (1944):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">\" '[I]t is a firmly established rule in this state that in actions for malicious prosecution the question of probable cause is a question of law which the judge must decide upon established or conceded facts. If none of the facts are in dispute, the court must decide the case without the intervention of a jury; but, if the case cannot be so decided, it must go to the jury with instructions from the court that certain facts, if found by them to exist, do or do not constitute probable cause; and it is not competent for the court to give to the jury a definition of probable cause and instruct them to find for or against the defendant according as they may determine that the facts are within or without that definition. <em>Hess v. Oregon Baking Company, </em>* * * [31 Or 503, 515, 49 P 803 (1897)]; <em>Timmins v. Hale, </em>122 Or 24, 38, 356 P 770 [(1927)], and cases there cited.\u2019 174 Or at 310-311.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">It is clear that Kennedy went to work for a competitor of Wackenhut (Wallace), that he possessed confidential information about Wackenhut\u2019s business and its customers, that two of Wackenhut\u2019s accounts had shifted to Wallace after Kennedy joined Wallace, and that some of Wackenhut\u2019s employees had become, or were about to become, Wallace employees. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>these facts, it cannot be contended seriously that Wackenhut\u2019s federal court action against Kennedy was brought in bad faith; the only real question is whether it had sufficient cause to obtain a preliminary injunction based upon the covenant not to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"> Covenants not to compete are in restraint of trade, and are invalid as being against public policy. However, such covenants made ancillary to an employment contract or to the sale of a going business are valid and enforceable if the restraint is reasonable both as to time and space. <em>See Eldridge et al. v. Johnston, </em>195 Or 379, 245 P2d 239 (1952). The covenant contained in Kennedy\u2019s employment contract,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is unreasonable as to the space within which the restraint applies, at least when it is realized that it would prohibit Kennedy from working at his vocation in almost any major population center in the United States. Nevertheless, some courts have enforced otherwise unreasonable restraints by limiting either the time or space to one that is reasonable. Oregon did so in <em>Eldridge, </em>and Wackenhut contended that Oregon courts would do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">It was and is Kennedy\u2019s position that Wackenhut was entitled to no injunction of any kind because the covenant was void, not that Wackenhut should have sought a more limited injunction for which there might have been sufficient cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Given the battle line so drawn we cannot say as a matter of law that Wackenhut did not have sufficient cause to believe that it was entitled to injunctive relief against Kennedy. <em>Eldridge </em>gave Wackenhut a reasonable basis for believing it was entitled to enjoin Kennedy, to some extent, from working for Wallace or other Wackenhut competitors, although we agree with the ultimate decision of the federal court after discovery developed the extent of the spatial restraint. It was admitted, however, that the federal action was volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>tarily dismissed by Wackenhut, which fact, if unexplained, would justify the conclusion that Wackenhut\u2019s action was without sufficient cause. <em>Alvarez v. Retail Credit Ass\u2019n, supra. </em>Here, Wackenhut explained its dismissal: Kennedy was no longer creating problems for the company, and it had no reason to believe he could respond in damages. We agree, therefore, with the trial court\u2019s conclusion with respect to Wackenhut\u2019s having sufficient cause to obtain the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">It is necessary, however, to reverse the judgment on the cause of action for wrongful issuance of the injunction, but no retrial is necessary; the damages have already been determined, and judgment should be entered for plaintiff against Wackenhut and Industrial Indemnity in the amount of damages previously determined by the trial court pursuant to agreement of counsel for both parties. It will be necessary for the court to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be allowed Kennedy for defending against the application for the preliminary injunction in the federal court, and in seeking to have it dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The employment contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\"2.

Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>159 Or 331, 80 P2d 702 (1972), the Court held that under an allegation of gross negligence, proof may be made and recovery had for simple negligence on the theory that the greater wrong includes the lesser. By analogy here, plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action, incorporated in his second cause of action, would permit his recovery for wrongful issuance of the preliminary injunction because the elements thereof were included in the claim for the greater wrong of malicious use of civil process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> While the rule is stated in terms of there being no defense on the grounds stated, in this case plaintiff assumed the burden of proving bad faith and want of sufficient cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b307-4\"> While the issue is not raised, we have a duty to determine our jurisdiction on appeal. The judgment was entered on Januaiy 19,1978, and the notice of appeal was not filed until June 8, 1978. If the judgment was appealable, the time for appeal had expired. ORS 19.026.

In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the causes of suit or action or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the proceeding as to any of the causes of suit or action or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment or decree adjudicating all the causes of suit or action and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The trial court did not make an \"express determination that there is no just reason for delay\u201d or make an \"express direction for the entry of judgment\u201d as required by the statute.
