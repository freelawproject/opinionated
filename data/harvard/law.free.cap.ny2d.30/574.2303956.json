In addition, such payments represent compensation for services actually rendered and are, therefore, properly includable in the computation of a member\u2019s final average salary. Accordingly, the plaintiff and all others similarly situated have acquired a vested right to the aforesaid benefit, and that benefit may not now be constitutionally impaired. This being so, it follows that subdivision 1 of section 431 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (as added by L. 1971, ch. 503), which eliminates inclusion of cash payments for accumulated vacation credits, violates section 7 of article V of our State Constitution if retroactively applied to the plaintiff and others similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b615-8\">Bbeitel, J. (dissenting in part).</author>\n<p id=\"AzC\">I would modify the judgment rendered to restrict the invalidation of chapter 503 of the Laws of 1971 only to the extent that it impairs contractual rights vested prior to the enactment of the statute on June 17, 1971. That is the date the statute became law by approval of the Governor in accordance with bill section 20 which for relevant purposes provided that the act would take effect immediately. After that date new entrants into the Retirement System acquired contractual rights subject to any statutes then outstanding, whether or not by the terms of the statutes they applied to current or future events. This subordinate issue is as simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>as that. It should not be confused by misusing the substantive language contained in the statute and treating that as \u2018 \u2018 effective date \u2019 \u2019 language, rather than bill section 20, which respondents would do. The April 1, 1972 date in the statute fixes as a substantive matter the date from which accumulated credits would no longer be includable in final annual salary. It is not <em>\u201c </em>the effective date \u201d of the statute in any sense. Since legislation is supreme unless unconstitutional, the court may not abrogate a power of \u20181 interpretation \u2019 \u2019 which patently frustrates the legislative intention. The financial impact of the difference may be trivial, the debasement of principle is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan and Gibson concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Breitel dissents in part and votes to modify in a separate opinion in which Judge Jasen concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
