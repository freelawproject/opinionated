Wray, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>867, 371, 500 A.2d 1085 (1985); <em>see also Gerzsenyi v. Richardson, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>213, 217, 511 A.2d 699 (1986). We consolidate the appeals for the purpose of this opinion only.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In the matters before us, we must determine whether to apply the <em>Mazakas </em>standard (1) to the fifty-day time limitation for confirmation of an arbitration under <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(2) and (3) (in <em>Ippolito), </em>and (2) to an application to vacate a dismissal of the complaint where the arbitration was defective because of the failure to notify plaintiffs\u2019 attorney of the hearing, and where counsel after learning of the arbitration award neglected to take appropriate timely action (in Sprawl). We determine that in both of the situations presented to us the stringent \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">\n<em>Ippolito v. Greater Paterson General Hospital</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">In <em>Ippolito, </em>defendants appeal from a Law Division judgment confirming an arbitration award, after an arbitration held pursuant to R. 4:21A-1 <em>et seq. </em>The arbitration award was filed June 12, 1992, and after the passage of the thirty-day period when either party could request a trial <em>de novo (R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l); <em>N.J.S.A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>39:6A-31), plaintiffs\u2019 attorney forwarded signed releases to defense counsel. Nothing more occurred until plaintiffs\u2019 attorney received an order of dismissal of the complaint. It had been entered by the court since fifty days had expired from the date of the award and no consent order nor motion for confirmation had been filed. <em>See R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(2) and (3). The trial court vacated the dismissal and confirmed the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The <em>Ippolito </em>plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had forwarded the signed releases to defendants\u2019 attorneys, who failed to object or in any way indicate that the delay in returning the settlement draft was caused by anything more than their client\u2019s or carrier\u2019s inability to process the papers and obtain the requisite signatures in a timely manner. Plaintiffs and their attorneys could reasonably have expected that, absent some affirmative indication from their adversaries, the arbitration award was final and that a motion to confirm the award was unnecessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The trial judge noted that defendants\u2019 position became clear only after the fiftieth day had passed. They wanted the case dismissed or, in the alternative, the matter listed for a trial <em>de novo. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 arbitration award for $24,750 would have therefore been extinguished. The trial judge stated that arbitration is favored and finality in the proceedings is sought. The trial judge also noted that defendants neither sought a trial <em>de novo </em>within thirty days of the award nor moved to enlarge the time for doing so. On this basis, the trial judge determined to set aside the dismissal and confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We agree with the action taken by the trial judge. A procedural dismissal, even if provided for by court rule, is subject to vacation under the standards set forth in <em>R. </em>4:50-1, provided that there has been no detrimental reliance upon the parties\u2019 failure to confirm the award in a timely manner. We see no reason to bar a reasonable extension of time if the explanations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>given by the party seeking to confirm the award meet the standards of <em>R. </em>4:50-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Heffner v. Jacobson, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>550, 555, 498 A.2d 766 (1985), relied upon a permissive \u201cmay\u201d defining the prevailing party\u2019s duty to move for confirmation of a statutory arbitration award within the three months provided in the general arbitration statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-7. The Court there permitted the prevailing party to use an alternative method of confirming an award after the three months had run, namely, starting a new action to confirm common-law arbitration, and then moving summarily for judgment. The court rule in the case before us, <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b), uses a mandatory \u201cshall,\u201d but is subject to relaxation under <em>R. </em>1:1-2 and <em>R. </em>l:3-4(a). <em>Mazakas v. Wray, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 372, 500 A.2d 1085. Also, there is no statutory restriction on the fifty-day motion to confirm, as there is with the thirty-day time period to demand the trial <em>de novo. N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">If a late application to confirm the award is made <em>prior to </em>the entry of the order dismissing the case, the fifty-day provision may be relaxed unless good cause to the contrary is shown. If relief is sought <em>after </em>the entry of the order, as in the <em>Ippolito </em>matter, the standards of <em>R. </em>4:50-1 shall control.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\n<em>Sprowl v. Kitselman.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">In <em>Sprowl, </em>plaintiffs have appealed from the dismissal of their automobile negligence complaint on the basis of an automobile arbitration decision finding of \u201cno cause.\u201d Plaintiffs failed to file a trial <em>de novo </em>request within thirty days, <em>see R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-31, and the trial court later dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney claims that he had not received timely notice of the final arbitration proceeding and therefore did not attend, resulting in the no cause award. Thereafter he thought he had filed a motion for the trial <em>de novo, </em>but it was never sent out by his office. He had no cross-check procedure and therefore is faced with this predicament. He claims that the complaint should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Here we see a ease of the attorney\u2019s failure to have a proper follow-up procedure to verify that required actions had been taken. There had been three successive failures to appear at scheduled arbitration hearings. The first two failures were explained by the attorney, asserting that the trial counsel who should have appeared was actually associated with a Philadelphia law firm, notwithstanding that the averring attorney was counsel of record. When notices were received in any matter where the name of the Philadelphia attorney (who also was admitted in New Jersey) appeared on the envelope, the letter merely would be forwarded to Pennsylvania without reference to its contents. Therefore, when arbitration notices or any other similar notices were received by the counsel of record, he would make no note of them, and would just assume that his Philadelphia associate would appear. On two successive occasions the Philadelphia attorney did not appear, and finally the New Jersey attorney was notified of a dismissal. He then moved successfully before the Law Division for an order vacating the dismissals and reinstating the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Thereafter, the matter was scheduled for a third time but, according to the attorney\u2019s unimpeaehed certification, he had received no notice of this hearing. On the day of the hearing, as he was leaving the office to appear in a fee arbitration proceeding that could not be adjourned, he received a telephone call informing him that the arbitration proceeding had been scheduled for that time and if he did not appear the proceeding would be conducted without him. His protestations that he was unable to appear, had received no notice, and that there was no other attorney in the office who could attend (it was a two-attorney firm, and the other attorney was not in the office) were ineffective.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was told that his adversary was there and the arbitration would be concluded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>As may be expected, the arbitrators entered a \u201cno cause\u201d against the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney realized that he could be relieved of the consequences of this hearing merely by properly requesting a trial <em>de novo. R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). He therefore dictated the request and directed his secretary to send it, together with the appropriate fees. He certifies that this was accomplished well within the thirty days required by <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). Unfortunately, his secretary never carried through with his instruction, and he never monitored the file to see that this was done. Defendant did not seek to confirm the no cause award, and as no consent orders were filed, the case was dismissed fifty days following the arbitration as required by <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The <em>Sprowl </em>case, therefore, presents similar, but more egregious examples of neglect than the <em>Ippolito </em>matter. It is one that involves, not an out-of-time confirmation of an arbitration as in <em>Ippolito, </em>but in effect both a late demand for a trial <em>de novo </em>and a motion to restore the complaint based upon plaintiffs\u2019 failure to receive timely notice of the arbitration hearing that resulted in the no cause award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, as in the <em>Ippolito </em>case, we do not find parties seeking to relax time requirements in order to defeat arbitration, but rather parties trying to avail themselves of arbitration. Were this only an attempt to obtain the trial <em>de novo, </em>without a basis to attack the arbitration itself and have the complaint restored, the application would clearly be untimely under the <em>Mazakas </em>standard. 205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 371, 500 A.2d 1085. Failure to supervise one\u2019s secretary does not ordinarily present such \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d as will permit an attorney to make a late demand for a trial <em>de novo. </em>Since, however, there is an unimpeaehed representation that plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>counsel had no notice of the arbitration hearing, plaintiffs should not be forced to lose their opportunity to arbitrate this matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties may proceed to arbitration and thereafter may either accept the arbitration award, if any, or request a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We note that the defendant in <em>Sprowl </em>is virtually blameless in this matter, and that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel could have avoided each step since the arbitration by taking timely action. Our reversal in <em>Sprowl </em>therefore is conditioned upon plaintiffs\u2019 attorney paying to defendant all costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, related to the new arbitration. This should return the parties to the position they would have been in had plaintiffs\u2019 attorney received proper notice of the third application.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In sum, we reiterate that the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard of <em>Mazakas v. Wray </em>is applicable to a motion to relax the thirty-day limitation on requests for a trial <em>de novo. R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). Such an application thwarts the effectiveness of a valid arbitration. The courts, however, may apply a more relaxed standard in dealing with applications for relief from the fifty-day dismissal provisions of <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b), when such relaxation promotes the finality of an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The order in <em>Sprowl v. Kitselman </em>dismissing the complaint is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for arbitration pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-1 <em>et seq. </em>The judgment confirming the arbitration award in <em>Ippolito v. Greater Paterson General Hospital </em>is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\"> We acknowledge, however, that in an exercise of prudence, plaintiffs' attorney should have made a motion to confirm as the fiftieth day approached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\"> It is apparent to us that plaintiffs' attorney fully intended to appear at the rescheduled arbitration. Once the defaults by the Philadelphia attorney were made known to plaintiffs' counsel, immediate efforts were made to restore the matter and obtain an arbitration hearing. It is unlikely that having made these efforts, plaintiffs' counsel would have consciously disregarded the new arbitration notice, had he received it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney's attempt to ameliorate the situation by his abortive direction to file a trial <em>de novo </em>request will not preclude his attempt to obtain a restoration of the complaint, and thus the arbitration previously ordered by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> This is a closer question, but we are mindful of the ramifications if we were to accept defendant's position. The case would be transformed from an automobile negligence action (perhaps to be resolved by arbitration), to a legal malpractice action. The malpractice carrier would, in effect, be responsible for any liability that more properly should be shouldered by the defendant\u2019s insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
