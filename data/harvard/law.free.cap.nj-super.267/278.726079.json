The proofs at trial revealed that defendant entered the victim\u2019s apartment, and committed various crimes including aggravated sexual assault. Defendant then killed the victim. Defendant claimed the victim became violent and threatened him when he discontinued consensual sex with her].</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Defendant contends that the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury on purposeful or knowing murder and passion/provocation manslaughter were contradictory and confusing. He maintains that the effect of the charge as a whole, in conjunction with the verdict sheet, precluded the jury from considering a passion/provocation manslaughter verdict unless it first acquitted defendant of purposeful or knowing murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">The verdict sheet stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-15\">COUNT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-16\">A.

Passion/Provocation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">Manslaughter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-15\">Guilty_Not Guilty_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-16\">(Emphasis added where underscored and italics.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">Defense counsel objected to the verdict sheet prior to the charge because it precluded the jury from considering a passion/provocation manslaughter verdict unless it first found defendant not guilty of purposely or knowingly causing death or serious bodily injury resulting in death. One of defendant\u2019s attorneys claimed that the form was \u201cmisleading\u201d and, in essence, noted that there was no reference on the sheet to the fact that the State would have to prove defendant did not act in the heat of passion based upon a reasonable provocation in order to find defendant guilty of murder. The judge overruled the objection because he felt counsel was reading the form \u201cwithout referring to the jury instructions\u201d and because he intended to instruct the jury that the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only that defendant purposely or knowingly caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death, but also that defendant did so without acting in the heat of passion based upon a reasonable provocation. The judge reasoned that if the jury found defendant guilty of murder, \u201cthe State has proven the elements of murder and disproven passion, provocation manslaughter and there is no need to go to F.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In his instructions to the jury the judge defined murder and explained the elements. He instructed the jury that \u201ca homicide which would otherwise be murder is manslaughter when the killing is committed in the heat of passion resulting from a reasonable provocation.\u201d After instructing the jury on the elements of passion/provocation manslaughter, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has proven that the defendant did, in fact, cause the death of the victim, or that the defendant acted purposely or knowingly, then you must find the defendant not guilty of murder. If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly or purposely caused the victim\u2019s death but you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant did so in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation, then you must find the defendant guilty of manslaughter. If you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly or purposely caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death without acting in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation, then you must find the defendant guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The judge then instructed the jury that \u201cdefendant may be convicted of murder either when he purposely or knowingly causes death or when he purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury resulting in death.\u201d After explaining the difference between these concepts and the meaning of the term \u201cby his own conduct,\u201d the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">Now, if we can for a moment, before I finish with that particular charge, look at the jury verdict form and you will see that the first determination which you must consider is whether the defendant purposely or knowingly that\u2019s A and, B, caused the death of the victim. Now if you enter a finding of guilty of either A and/or B, you are then to go to C below and decide whether the defendant purposely and/or knowingly caused the death by his own conduct and after you do that, then he [sic] would move onto count two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">On the other hand, if you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt as to A or B and the finding is not guilty to both A and B, therefore, you are then required to go to D and E and decide whether the defendant purposely caused serious bodily injury resulting in the death of the defendant (sic.) or under E, knowingly caused serious bodily injury resulting in the death of the defendant (sic.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">Now, if you make a determination of guilt under either D or E or both, you are then to go on to count two. On the other hand, if the finding is not guilty of both D and E above, then you are to go to F which is passion provocation manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">Now, I remind you that this verdict form is not the jury charge and I remind you further that in order for you to find the defendant guilty under A and/or B or I) and/or E, that is purposely or knowingly causing death or purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury resulting in death, <em>the State must convince you beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the defendant purposely or knowingly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death but also that when the defendant so committed such conduct, that the defendant did so without acting in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">So, with respect to A, B, D and E, the State must convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the offense [sic] and additionally must convince you that passion, provocation manslaughter is not present in the case. The State has to do that, as I said, beyond a reasonable doubt. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The judge also advised the jury that the verdict sheet did not set forth \u201cthe elements of the offenses.\u201d Following the charge, one of the defense counsel renewed his objection to the verdict sheet, characterizing it as \u201cstill misleading.\u201d However, he did not object to the judge\u2019s instructions on the elements of murder or passion/provocation manslaughter. The judge thereafter further charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">This jury verdict form again I remind you only itemizes the offenses which you must decide, it itemizes the issues you must decide. It\u2019s not in any way intended to indicate the elements of any particular offense that was given to you in my instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">If there is any question in your mind as you go through these offenses as to what elements are to be considered by you, that is what elements must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt, then write me a note, come back in here and I will repeat whatever you need again so there is no question about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">It is now well settled that whenever there is evidence that a homicide was committed in the heat of passion, \u201cthe State can obtain a murder conviction only if it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the purposeful killing was not the product of passion/provocation.\u201d <em>State v. Coyle, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>194, 221, 574 A.2d 951 (1990). \u201cIf there is sufficient evidence of passion/provocation, a trial court must instruct the jury that \u2018to find murder it must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not kill in the heat of passion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 574 A.2d 951 (quoting <em>State v. Grunow, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>133, 145, 506 A.2d 708 (1986)); <em>see also State v. Wilson, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>233, 238-40, 607 A.2d 1289 (1992); <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 315, 419 A.2d 406 (1980); <em>State v. Vigilante, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 298-99, 608 A.2d 425 (App.Div.1992); <em>State v. McClain, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 416, 591 A.2d 652 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>341, 598 A.2d 897 (1991). Defendant argues that his murder conviction must be reversed in light of <em>State v. Coyle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>supra, </em>where the judge\u2019s murder instructions did not \u201crefer to the State\u2019s burden of disproving passion/provocation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 119 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 574 A.2d 951. The Supreme Court concluded that the later charge on passion/provocation manslaughter, wherein the trial court explained that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not done in the heat of passion resulting from reasonable provocation, was insufficient to cure the initial charge on murder. The Court was convinced that the instructions \u201chad the potential to foreclose jury consideration of whether passion/provocation should reduce an otherwise purposeful killing from murder to manslaughter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted the unique issue which flows from sequential charges in passion/provocation cases, although such charges otherwise generally \u201cprovide a framework for orderly deliberations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 223, 574 A.2d 951, and concluded that a sequential charge coupled with an instruction that inadequately defines the elements of murder \u201ccan mislead the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 574 A.2d 951. Thus, the Court \u201csuggest[ed]\u201d that trial judges should \u201cinstruct jurors in the initial charge on murder about the effect of passion/provocation on an otherwise-intentional killing.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">This case differs from <em>Coyle </em>in that the judge\u2019s instructions on passion/provocation manslaughter were encompassed within the charge on murder. The judge properly instructed the jury that it must find defendant guilty of manslaughter if it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly or purposely caused the victim\u2019s death but had a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant did so in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation. Unlike the situation in <em>Coyle, </em>the judge here did not suggest that the jury should consider passion/provocation manslaughter only if it determined that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the purposeful or knowing murder. Rather, the judge instructed the jury that in order to find defendant guilty of murder, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that defendant purposely or knowingly caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death, but also that defendant did so without acting in the heat of passion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>upon reasonable provocation. Moreover, this was stated both before and after the judge advised the jury that the verdict sheet did not embody the elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant also relies on <em>State v. Erazo, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>112, 594 A.2d 232 (1991), where the Supreme Court reversed a defendant\u2019s murder conviction because the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury on manslaughter \u201cimpermissibly shifted to defendant the burden of proving passion/provocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 121, 594 A.2d 232. The error was \u201caggravated\u201d by the judge\u2019s \u201cinstruction that the jury should first consider whether defendant was guilty of murder and that if it acquitted defendant of that offense, it should then consider the manslaughter charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 594 A.2d 232. The Court noted that this portion of the charge \u201cmay have foreclosed the jury from considering passion/provocation during its deliberations on the murder count.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the charge erroneously indicated that the jury \u201ccould find passion/provoeation manslaughter only if it first acquitted defendant of knowing or purposeful murder.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In reversing, the Supreme Court directed that if, on retrial, the trial court decided to give a sequential charge, \u201cit should make clear both that the absence of passion/provocation is an element of murder on which the State bears the burden of proof and that the jury may convict defendant only of manslaughter when the homicide would have been murder but for the existence of passion/provocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 594 A.2d 232. This case is distinguishable from <em>Erazo </em>because here the trial judge properly and clearly instructed the jury that in order to obtain a conviction of purposeful or knowing murder, the State bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of passion/provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Unlike the Supreme Court precedent involving the reversal of murder convictions following sequential charges regarding the consideration of homicide offenses, here the oral instructions to the jury were correct. <em>See also State v. Vasquez, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 628 A.2d 346 (App.Div.1993) (conviction affirmed where jury was instructed on State\u2019s burden of proving homicide not in heat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of passion upon reasonable provocation during charge on murder); <em>State v. Johnston, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 198-201, 608 A.2d 364 (App.Div.) (no error in charge), <em>certif denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>596, 617 A.2d 1219 (1992); <em>State v. Vigilante, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299, 608 A.2d 425 (error where necessary instruction on absence of passion/provocation not charged as element of murder); <em>State v. Bishop, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 390-91, 589 A.2d 625 (App.Div.1991) (reversal where murder charge did not include absence of passion/provocation). Here the claim of error stems exclusively from the verdict sheet, where the written instructions on their face seem to suggest that passion/provocation manslaughter was to be considered only if defendant was acquitted of purposely or knowingly causing death (A and B) and purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury resulting in death (D and E). The verdict form should have listed the offenses for consideration, as recommended on the forms contained in the <em>Trial Judges Bench Manual for Capital Cases, </em>Appendix G, without any directions as to sequence of consideration. Nevertheless, the jury was clearly aware from the oral instructions that defendant could not have been convicted of capital murder (A and B) or non-capital murder (D and E) unless the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing did not occur in the heat of passion with reasonable provocation. In context, therefore, and particularly given the colloquy concerning defendant\u2019s objections to the verdict sheet and the oral instructions concerning them, we are satisfied that the judge intended to focus the jury\u2019s attention on the verdict sheet for the <em>recordation </em>of its verdict, not for the <em>sequence of its deliberations </em>or the elements of the offense, and we are further satisfied that the jury so understood the verdict sheet. Stated differently, the jury understood from the oral instructions concerning the elements and the verdict sheet that it could find defendant guilty of murder only if he did not kill in the heat of passion and that it was to return a verdict of \u201cpassion/provocation manslaughter\u201d (F) if the State did not disprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the homicide was committed in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>' Because the jury had to focus on the question of purposeful or knowing conduct to consider either murder or passion/provocation manslaughter, the verdict sheet did not have to list the latter first, and the verdict sheet did not have to contain a sequential instruction that it had to find the absence of passion/provocation before considering murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>State v. Reed, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 592 A.2d 4 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>237, 627 A.2d 630 (1993), we reversed a murder conviction because defendant was prejudiced by the jury verdict sheet. 249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 50-51, 592 A.2d 4. Passion/provocation and simple manslaughter were charged <em>to the </em>jury. However, there the form included no verdict for passion/provocation manslaughter, and \u201c[t]he only manslaughter offenses to which the verdict sheet referred\u201d were the \u201clesser included\u201d offenses of aggravated manslaughter and manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 592 A.2d 4. Moreover, the instructions and verdict sheet directed the jurors to consider manslaughter \u201conly if they found defendant not guilty of\u2019 purposeful and knowing murder and aggravated manslaughter. <em>Ibid. We </em>therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he effect of the erroneous form of the verdict sheet was to prevent the jury from considering whether the defendant was guilty of passion/provocation manslaughter.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Supreme Court did not pass upon the issue concerning the verdict sheet in <em>Reed. </em>It denied the State\u2019s cross-petition for certification while granting the defendant\u2019s petition, 127 <em>N.J. </em>552, 606 A.2d 365 (1992), and, while disagreeing with us on the issue advanced by defendant concerning the admissibility of his confession, the Supreme Court affirmed our judgment reversing the murder conviction. 133 <em>N.J. </em>237, 269-270, 627 A.2d 630, 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">This case differs from <em>Reed </em>in that here the verdict sheet included passion/provocation manslaughter. Moreover, immediately <em>after </em>reviewing the verdict sheet with the jury, the judge again instructed that \u201cthis verdict form is not the jury charge\u201d and that in order to obtain a conviction of purposeful or knowing murder, the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>doubt not only that defendant purposely or knowingly caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death, but also that defendant did so without acting in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation. <em>See also State v. Vasquez, supra, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 544-545, 628 A.2d at 354-355 (where the verdict form improperly omitted any reference to passion/provocation manslaughter, but conviction was affirmed because \u201cboth counsel agreed to use merely one category \u2014 second-degree manslaughter \u2014 to encompass\u201d both reckless and passion/provocation manslaughter).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">If there is any doubt about our conclusion that the verdict sheet does not mandate reversal, it is resolved by the fact that the judge\u2019s oral instructions as to the elements of the crimes were submitted to the jury in writing and available in the jury room during the deliberations. The jury deliberated from 12:04 p.m. until just after 4:00 p.m. on August 10, 1989. At 10:23 a.m. on August 11, 1989, the judge discussed with counsel the jury\u2019s written request for \u201ca copy ... of the explanation of charges ... strictly for use for defining the charges.\u201d It was agreed the judge would \u201cgive them one copy [of his instructions] unless they ask for more.\u201d He apparently did so. <em>See R. </em>1:8-8. There were subsequent unrelated proceedings at 4:30 followed by a recess before the verdict was taken sometime thereafter. Our concerns relating to the impact of the wording of the verdict sheet which was in the hands of the deliberating jury is thus dissipated by the fact that the judge\u2019s instructions as to the law were also reduced to writing and in the jury room for a substantial part of the deliberations. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s contention that his murder conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In light of our disposition, we need not consider the State\u2019s argument that any lack of precision in the verdict sheet was harmless because there was insufficient evidence of passion/provocation to warrant a charge thereon in any event. <em>See State v. McClain, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 591 A.2d 652 (failure to charge jury that State had burden of proving beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>doubt that defendant did not act in the heat of passion was harmless because the evidence did not support a charge on passion/provocation manslaughter). Moreover, our conclusion on count one renders moot the contention that plain error was committed because the trial judge failed to instruct the jury with respect to the causation required to prove felony murder. <em>See State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 25-34, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990). We are satisfied that, even assuming error in the felony murder charge, the error had no impact on the conviction for purposeful or knowing murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">[At the request of the court, Points II \u2014 VIII are omitted from publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The judgment of conviction and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
