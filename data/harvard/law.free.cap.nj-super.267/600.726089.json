Johnson, the mayor of the City of Salem, appeals the denial of a handgun permit. Judge Farrell articulated his reasons for denying the permit in a letter decision dated November 13, 1992, noting that Mayor Johnson satisfied two of the three criteria required by statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d. He is a person .of good character not subject to specific statutory disabilities and he is familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns. The permit was denied, however, because the applicant had failed to establish \u201cthat he has a justifiable need to carry a handgun.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In the light of the standards established in <em>In re Preis, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>564, 573 A.2d 148 (1990), and in <em>Siccardi v. State, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>545, 284 A.2d 533 (1971), appellant argues that his statutorily decreed responsibilities as mayor establish the justifiable need to carry a handgun. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40A:61-4. He places particular emphasis upon his status \u201cas head of the police department,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:61-4f, and his duties to \u201cmaintain peace and good order and ... suppress all riots and tumultuous assemblies in the city,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:61-4e.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">There is nothing inherent in a mayor\u2019s status as head of the police department that requires the incumbent to be armed. The responsibility established in the statute is one of supervision, not front line function. Similarly, the duties to maintain peace and good order and to suppress riots and tumultuous assemblies do not bespeak hands-on activities; rather, they require the mayor to use the powers of the executive to achieve the ends specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Accordingly, we view the reason for denial of the permit to have been valid. There is here no \u201curgent necessity for carrying [a gun] for self-protection.\u201d <em>Siccardi v. State, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 557, 284 A.2d 533. Furthermore, there has been no particularized showing \u201c(1) that the applicant, in the course of performing statutorily authorized duties, is subject to a substantial threat of serious bodily harm; and (2) that carrying a handgun is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to reduce the threat of unjustifiable serious bodily harm to any person.\u201d <em>In re Preis, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 576-77, 573 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
