The sole plaintiff operates a full service car wash facility located in Hope Lawn, New Jersey, approximately two miles from High Tech\u2019s location in Perth Amboy. Under the circumstances, we conclude that plaintiff, a non-resident competitor, is not an \u201cinterested party\u201d with standing to challenge the resolution of the Perth Amboy Board of Adjustment. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-4; <em>Paramus Multiplex Corp. v. Hartz Mtn. Ind. Inc., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>104, 107-111, 564 A.2d 146 (Law Div.1987). <em>See also </em>Cox, <em>New Jersey Zoning and Land Use Administration (1993), </em>\u00a7 27-2. <em>Cf., Walker v. Stanhope, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>657, 130 A.2d 372 (1957) (deprivation of commercial opportunity was sufficient stake to permit non-resident to challenge ordinance restricting use of mobil homes outside of trailer camps).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Plaintiff insists that the denial of a motion for summary judgment on standing grounds in a prior Law Division action in which an individual, apparently a principal or predecessor of High Tech, commenced suit and endeavored to overturn the City Council\u2019s action on Car Spa\u2019s first appeal from the Board of Adjustment\u2019s initial action, is <em>res judicata </em>and constitutes \u201claw of the case.\u201d However, the prior Law Division action was dismissed by stipulation \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d by the parties in that case <em>(Stephen L. Bernard v. The Mayor and City Council of the City of Perth </em>Amboy) after summary judgment was denied, and the denial of summary judgment does not constitute a disposition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We are satisfied that the judgment should be affirmed on the merits, even if plaintiff had standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
