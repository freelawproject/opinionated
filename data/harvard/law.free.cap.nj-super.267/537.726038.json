Plaintiff Search EDP, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, operates an employment agency. Plaintiff Neal P. Monda is one of its personnel placement counselors. Search EDP has a personnel consultants\u2019 errors and omissions policy issued to it by defendant American Home Assurance Company. It has a business general casualty and liability policy and a commercial umbrella liability insurance policy issued by defendant Franklin Mutual Insurance Company. Plaintiffs appeal from a summary judgment dismissing, as against both insurers, their complaint seeking a defense and indemnity in an underlying action brought against them by Lisa and Billy Gonzalez. We affirm as to Franklin but reverse as to American Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The facts relevant to the coverage issue are simple and undisputed. The Gonzalez complaint against plaintiffs was filed in September 1991. It alleges a cause of action based on plaintiffs\u2019 asserted professional negligence. More particularly, it alleges that in September 1990, plaintiffs, having negligently screened and evaluated the personal qualifications of one William Donohue, referred Donohue to Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us for employment as a computer programmer. Donohue was hired. Several months later, he \u201cviolently assaulted\u201d Lisa Gonzalez, a co-worker, seriously injuring her. The implication of the complaint is that had plaintiffs properly conducted a background check of Donohue, as its professional undertaking obliged it to do, it would have been alerted to Donohue\u2019s alleged unstable or assaultive tendencies and would either have passed that information on to his prospective employer or not have placed him at all. Consequently, Gonzalez asserts that her injuries at Donohue\u2019s hand were caused by plaintiffs\u2019 professional negligence. Her husband sued per quod.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Search EDP sought a defense and indemnification for it and its employee from both its errors and omissions carrier, American Home, and its general liability carrier, Franklin. Both disclaimed, relying on specific exclusion clauses of their respective policies, and this coverage action ensued. On motion and cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial judge sustained the position of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Franklin policies are typical business liability and casualty policies providing broad coverage for a wide range of business risks and containing the exclusions typical of such policies, such as risks covered by workers\u2019 compensation, automobile negligence, and the like. Exclusion number 11 of the business policy, encaptioned \u201cProfessional,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">We do not cover bodily injury, property damage, or personal injury arising out of the rendering or failure to render any sort of professional services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The commercial umbrella policy contains an even more explicit exclusion, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">It is agreed that this policy shall not apply to liability arising out of the rendering of or failure to render professional services, or any error or omission, malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>or mistake of a professional nature committed by or on behalf of the named insured in the conduct of any of the insured\u2019s business activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The risks excluded by this provision are, of course, precisely the risks covered by American Home\u2019s errors and omissions policy, whose initial coverage statement on the first page of its insuring agreement reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Coverage A \u2014 Errors and Omissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">To pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages resulting from any wrongful act of the Insured, or of any other person for whose actions the Insured is legally responsible, but only if such wrongful act occurs during the Policy Period and arises out of the conduct of the Insured\u2019s business as a Private Personnel Placement Service as herein defined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">It is clear that general liability policies and errors and omissions policies ordinarily cover and are intended to cover different categories of risk. As explained by <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. American Reinsurance Co., </em>796 <em>F.Supp. </em>275, 280 (S.D.Ohio 1991), <em>aff'd, </em>961 <em>F.2d </em>1578 (6th Cir.1992), a case involving a coverage dispute between an employment agency\u2019s errors and omissions carrier and the carrier\u2019s commercial umbrella policy reinsurer, the essential purpose of an errors and omissions policy is to cover liability risks unique to and inherent in the practice of a particular profession and which transcend the customary business risks which the practice of a profession shares with the conduct of other types of business enterprises. As <em>Nationwide </em>also made clear, \u201c[t]his understanding of the purpose of errors and omissions coverage appears to be common in the insurance industry as well....\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It relied for that proposition on this excerpt from an insurance industry publication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">Persons or organizations that render professional services face an additional liability exposure \u2014 the failure to use due care and the degree of skilled [sic] expected of a person in a particular profession. Insurance for this exposure is known variously and without complete consistency, as professional liability insurance, malpractice insurance, or errors and omissions liability insurance ... [Errors and omissions liability is usually limited to non-medical professions.... <em>Id., </em>at 281.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">It seems, therefore, fair to assume that an insured who has both an errors and omissions policy and a general liability policy has so opted based on the understanding that the general liability policy does not cover professional negligence and the errors and omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>sions policy does not cover general business liability. The insured\u2019s reasonable expectation, consequently, is that the risk of claims of professional negligence is protected against by the errors and omissions policy and other claims of negligence by the general liability policy. The insured would, therefore, reasonably expect that all business negligence of whatever character would be covered by one policy or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">We address Franklin\u2019s general liability and umbrella policies in this context. We recognize those well-settled principles governing the interpretation of contracts of insurance that mandate broad reading of coverage provisions, narrow reading of exclusionary provisions, resolution of ambiguities in the insured\u2019s favor, and construction consistent with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>See, e.g., Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 607 A.2d 138 (1992); <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 486-87, 625 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1993). None of these principles can warrant a finding of errors and omissions coverage in the Franklin policies. The exclusionary language for errors and omissions claims is unambiguous and unequivocal, there is no inherent inconsistency between the scope of the included risks and the excluded risks, and there is no indication that reading the exclusion as written would frustrate the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. Indeed, the contrary appears to be so. We therefore affirm the summary judgment in favor of Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We view the matter of the errors and omissions policy differently. American Home\u2019s disclaimer is based on this language which appears on the second page of the insuring agreement under the caption \u201cEXCLUSIONS,\u201d as the first of three numbered paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">The Company shall not be liable to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">1. for bodily injury to, or sickness, disease or death of any person or persons, or for damage to or destruction of any property, including the loss of use thereof; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The remaining two numbered paragraphs exclude coverage for fines and penalties and \u201cdishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious acts or omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The trial judge viewed the bodily-injury exclusion as unambiguous and, therefore, as a proper basis for American Home\u2019s refusal to defend and indemnify. We disagree. We are satisfied that the exclusion cannot be read as extending to bodily injury which results or is alleged to result from professional negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">First among our reasons for reaching this conclusion is our perception that there is a facial conflict between the risks that are covered and those that appear to be excluded. That is to say, we find an inherent conflict in coverage for <em>\u201call sums </em>which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages resulting from <em>any </em>wrongful act of the Insured.... [that] arises out of the Insured\u2019s business as a Private Personnel Placement Service\u201d and an asserted exclusion for bodily injury claims against the insured resulting from just such a wrongful act. We fully subscribe, moreover, to the proximate-cause test for resolving facial conflicts. That test was enunciated by 5 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 3083 at 309-311 (1970), first endorsed by this court in <em>Franklin Packaging Co. v. California Union Ins. Co., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 191, 408 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>434, 420 A.2d 340 (1980), and is regarded as expressing the majority rule in those jurisdictions addressing the issue. <em>See Cavalier Group v. Strescon Indus., Inc., </em>782 <em>F.Supp. </em>946, 956 (D.Del.1992). <em>See also Stone v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 251, 511 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1986); <em>Ariston Airline &amp; Cater. Sup. v. Forbes, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 487, 511 A.2d 1278 (Law Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">According to the proximate-cause test, \u201cLw]here a peril specifically insured against sets other causes in motion which, in an unbroken sequence and connection between the act and final loss, produces the result for which recovery is sought, the insured peril is regarded as the proximate cause of the entire loss.\u201d <em>Appleman, supra, </em>at 309. Put another way by <em>Appleman, id. </em>at 311, \u201crecovery may be allowed ... where the insured risk itself set into operation a chain of causation in which the last step may have been an excepted risk.\u201d We regard the insured risk here to be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>act of professional negligence \u2014 in this case, an alleged failure properly to check a job applicant\u2019s background and references. That is conduct clearly within the fundamental coverage of the policy. The gravamen of the Gonzalez complaint against the insured is that that act of professional negligence \u201cset into operation a chain of causation\u201d whose last step was Lisa Gonzalez\u2019s bodily injury. Her claim for that bodily injury may be read as literally encompassed by the bodily injury exclusion. It was, nevertheless, either caused by the insured as a direct and proximate result of a covered risk or not caused by the insured at all. In these circumstances, application of the proximate-cause rule entitles plaintiffs to a defense and to indemnity as well should the Gonzalezes prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We also conclude that the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations mandate coverage by the errors and omissions carrier. The obtaining of special coverage for acts of professional negligence by way of purchase of and payment for an errors and omissions policy is assuredly understood by the insured as affording protection from whatever consequences might reasonably flow from the conduct which is the subject of the protection bargained for. Here, for example, if plaintiffs had negligently placed with an innocent employer a person with a record of embezzlement who then stole from that employer, they would have expected a defense and indemnification against the employer\u2019s claims and would have been entitled to it. So here. The act of negligence in failing to check a job applicant\u2019s background is the same act of negligence and subject to the same coverage irrespective of the precise nature of the damages flowing therefrom. In our view, the right to a defense and indemnity cannot reasonably be made to depend upon the particular harmful consequence resulting from covered conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Denial of coverage in the circumstances here would defeat the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations in much the same manner as, for example, an automobile liability policy which, in its coverage statement, included all claims for negligent operation and in a later exclusion, excepted claims by injured pedestrians. As Jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>tice Jacobs instructed in <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 483, 170 A.2d 22 (1961), \u201c[w]here particular provisions, if read literally, would largely nullify the insurance, they will be severely restricted so as to enable fair fulfillment of the stated policy objective.\u201d This principle applies here. The purpose of the errors and omissions policy is to protect an insured who commits an act of professional negligence. If an act of professional negligence causes actionable damage to another, but if the insured\u2019s right to protection depends not on the nature of the act but rather on the nature of the resulting damage, we believe that the stated policy objective would be substantially nullified. We thus conclude that the errors and omissions policy here will fairly fulfill its stated objective only by reading the bodily injury exclusion as excepting bodily injury claims alleged to have resulted from an act of professional wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Finally, we reject American Home\u2019s argument that the proximate-cause rule was rejected by this court in <em>Hofing v. CNA Ins. Companies, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 588 A.2d 864 (App.Div.1991). <em>Hofing, </em>in addressing the question of whether there is a duty to defend, stated the general rule, namely, that if the \u201cpleadings state facts bringing the injury within the coverage of the policy, the insurer must defend regardless of the insured\u2019s ultimate liability to the complainant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 88, 588 A.2d 864. It also said that \u201c[t]he nature of the damage claim, rather than the actual details of the accident or the ultimate liability of the insurer, determines whether the insurer is obliged to defend.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>American Home would have us read the phrase \u201cdamage claim\u201d as implying that the nature of the injury rather than the nature of the risk determines coverage. We decline to do so. First, the sentence in which the phrase appears was quoted from <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Flanagin, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>504, 512, 210 A.2d 221 (1965). The use of that language in context persuades us that the Court was using the phrase \u201cnature of the damage claim\u201d to mean the nature of the cause of action supporting the claim. That reading is supported by <em>Ohio\u2019s </em>conclusion, presaging the proximate-cause test, that \u201c[t]he resolution of the problem [of determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>existence of a duty to defend] is to be found in a determination of whether the terms of the policy encompass <em>the causation of the </em>accident....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 210 A.2d 221. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Nor do we view our holding here in any way inconsistent with <em>Hofing. Hofing </em>dealt with an exclusion from attorney malpractice coverage of a client\u2019s claim for the return of fees. The point we there made was that an attorney\u2019s conduct in overcharging or mischarging a client is qualitatively different from an attorney\u2019s negligence in handling the client\u2019s legal matter. Different risks and different exposures are involved. We consequently do not find <em>Hofing </em>apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The summary judgment dismissing the complaint as against defendant Franklin Mutual Insurance Company is affirmed. We reverse the summary judgment dismissing the complaint as against American Home Assurance Company and remand for entry of summary judgment against it and in plaintiffs\u2019 favor for the relief sought in the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
