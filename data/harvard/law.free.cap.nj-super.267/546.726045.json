We reverse. Such a mechanical approach is contrary to the spirit and underlying remedial purpose of the Act. When separate claims in a complaint share a common core of facts with the consumer fraud claim, or are based on related legal theories, the trial judge, when awarding fees, must focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended. We exercise our original jurisdiction, <em>Rule </em>2:10-5, and enter an award of $4,500, plus costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Plaintiff filed a seven-count complaint against defendants Autos of Amboy, Inc., Century Chevrolet (Century), Carl Oliveira, A1 Beyrouty and the Midlantic National Bank (Midlantic). Her claims arose as a result of her purchase of a 1989 Chevrolet Blazer from Century\u2019s showroom in South Amboy. In count one, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>alleges that defendants committed consumer fraud by: concealing the terms of a rebate and a federal price label; selling the Blazer for more than the labeled price; engaging in \u201cbait and switch\u201d; and concealing facts relating to and overcharging for life and disability insurance. In the remaining counts she asserts common-law fraud, technical violations of the Act and its attendant regulations, and violations of federal labeling statutes. In counts six and seven, plaintiff advances her claims against Midlantic, the assignee of her Retail Installment Sales Contract. The allegations in all seven counts relate to the sale of the Blazer to plaintiff. Plaintiff sought compensatory, punitive and treble damages, as well as costs, counsel fees and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Prior to trial all of plaintiffs claims against all defendants were dismissed except for those based on fraud in the execution and alteration of the sales documents. Midlantic successfully moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint against it, except for its potential vicarious liability based on Century\u2019s purported fraudulent conduct. Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her punitive damage claim against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">At trial, plaintiff testified that a Century salesperson agreed to sell the Blazer to her for $17,000. When Beyrouty, a salesman, wrote $17,000 on the written agreement, she signed it. However, she admitted that no one from the dealership signed the agreement with the $17,000 purchase price. When plaintiff later returned to the showroom after visiting her bank, she met with a Century salesman who advised her that the price of the Blazer was $19,000. Plaintiff signed the agreement with the $19,000 purchase price. She explained she did so when Oliveira, Century\u2019s sales manager, told her to \u201csign a whole bunch of papers ... all folded down.\u201d Plaintiff also testified that no one from the dealership explained to her that there was an additional $350 charge for undercoating, rust-proofing, paint sealant and fabric guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The jury found that Century violated the Act by overcharging plaintiff $350 for \u201cequipment and services plus sales tax.\u201d However, it rejected her claim of a $2,000 overpayment on the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>price. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-19, the trial judge trebled the damage award and entered judgment in plaintiffs favor in the amount of $1,113.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">After entry of judgment, plaintiff moved for counsel fees and costs, submitting her counsel\u2019s certification of services requesting $16,968 in fees (70.7 hours multiplied by a rate of $240 per hour), and $729.23 in costs. The trial judge first reduced the total hours expended, 70.7, by subtracting 21.4 hours which plaintiffs counsel had spent awaiting trial calls. He did so because plaintiff did not appear at the first trial call. The judge then reduced counsel\u2019s hourly rate from $240 to $175, noting that the issues \u201cwere not complicated.\u201d Finally, he determined that counsel was entitled to compensation only for one-seventh of the remaining 49.3 hours. Relying on 49 <em>Prospect Street v. Sheva Gardens, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 547 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1988), he concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">[Tjhe only equitable way to determine a pro rata proportion of attorney fees spent on that issue is by dividing it among the counts of the complaint. This was a seven-count complaint. One count was justified by a verdict of the jury. And therefore what I\u2019m doing is taking one-seventh of the requested legal fee as adjusted, being mindful of the fact that I have adjusted it down to $175 per hour, at 49.3 hours. I\u2019ve divided that by seven. And that comes to $1,232.50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The trial judge thereupon awarded counsel fees in the amount of $1,232.50, plus costs of $729.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Century also sought counsel fees and costs incurred as a result of plaintiffs failure to appear at the first trial call. The trial judge granted fees in the amount of $1,906.87, but denied without comment Century\u2019s additional demand for fees incurred based on its counsel\u2019s appearance at subsequent trial calls, when plaintiff was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Plaintiff appeals from the order awarding her $1,232.50 in counsel fees, and Century cross-appeals the denial of its application for additional counsel fees incurred for appearances at subsequent trial calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19 provides that the court \u201cshall ... award threefold the damages sustained by any person\u201d and \u201cshall also award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees ... and reasonable costs of suit.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Facially, the statute mandates the award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, but does not provide guidance as to the manner by which such fees shall be computed when consumer fraud is alleged in a multi-count complaint containing nonconsumer fraud claims. In our view, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19 must be read consonant with the remedial purpose of the Act. The fee provision provides \u201can incentive for an attorney to take a ease and ... encourag[es] private parties to bring their own actions instead of turning to the Attorney General.\u201d <em>Skeer v. EMK Motors, Inc., </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 472, 455 A.2d 508 (App.Div.1982). Hence, the statute ensures that plaintiffs with bona fide claims will be able to retain counsel. <em>Coleman v. Fiore Bros., Inc., </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>594, 598, 552 A.2d 141 (1989); <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 610, 581 A.2d 91 (App.Div.1990) <em>aff'd o.b., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>520, 591 A.2d 943 (1991); <em>see also Wisser v. Kaufman Carpet Co., Inc., </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>574, 579, 458 A.2d 119 (App.Div.1983) (The Act \u201chas the salutary purpose of promoting representation and therefore court access for consumer claims involving a minor loss to the individual plaintiff but a major gain to the community through ridding the marketplace of fraudulent and deceitful conduct.\u201d). Application of a mechanical rule awarding fees based on the number of counts in a complaint undercuts the salutary purpose of promoting independent representation, since it may discourage competent counsel from undertaking the prosecution of bona fide consumer fraud actions, or from including related, meritorious nonconsumer fraud counts in a complaint against a deceitful vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">It is true that, as the trial judge observed, we stated in <em>49 Prospect Street, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 470, 547 A.2d 1134, that when a complaint contains several counts other than those for consumer fraud, and counsels\u2019 efforts are \u201cspread among several other claims upon which counsel were not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d this factor should be considered by the court in fixing counsel fees. <em>Accord Chattin, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 614, 581 A.2d 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>However, in <em>49 Prospect Street, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457, 547 A.2d 1134, plaintiffs had filed an eleven-count complaint which included not only counts alleging a violation of the Act, but claims that defendant-landlord had violated the Anti-Eviction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1; made negligent misrepresentations; breached the warranty of habitability; intentionally inflicted emotional distress; and violated the city\u2019s rent leveling ordinance. Thus, at least some of the counts were seemingly <em>independent </em>of plaintiffs-tenants\u2019 claim of consumer fraud. Indeed, the court, in concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel may not be entitled to fees for the nonconsumer fraud claims, cited <em>Simon v. Solomon, </em>385 <em>Mass. </em>91, 431 <em>N.E.2d </em>556, 570 (1982), where the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that \u201c[a] statutory fee award should not cover effort expended on <em>independent </em>claims that happen to be joined with statutory claims in a single proceeding.\u201d 227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 470, 547 A.2d 1134 (emphasis added). We do not read <em>k-9 Prospect Street </em>or <em>Simon </em>as a signal to trial courts to divide reasonable counsel fee demands by the number of claims when, as here, they are factually and legally interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The federal courts provide some guidance in resolving the issue. New Jersey courts have turned to federal eases interpreting the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fee Awards Act of 1976, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988 (\u00a7 1988), in determining the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under our Consumer Fraud Act. For example, our Supreme Court has noted that both \u00a7 1988 and our Consumer Fraud Act serve the dual purpose of attracting competent counsel and ensuring justice for all citizens. <em>Coleman, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 552 A.2d 141; <em>see also Chattin, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 610, 581 A.2d 91. The seminal decision of the United States Supreme Court defining the standards for computing reasonable counsel fees under \u00a7 1988 is <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>424, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). <em>Hensley </em>expressly rejected \u201ca mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon\u201d because \u201c[s]uch a ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable fee in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>all the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 435 n. 11, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52. Rather, the starting point is to determine the amount of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, <em>id., </em>at 433, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1939, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 50, the product being the so-called \u201clodestar.\u201d That analysis involves a shaving from the fee demand any excessive, redundant and otherwise unnecessary time expended during the litigation. <em>Id., </em>at 434, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51. Moreover, other factors may warrant a modification of the \u201clodestar,\u201d including the important factor of \u201cthe results obtained.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In cases where plaintiff presents \u201cdistinctly different claims for relief\u2019 in one lawsuit, work on those unrelated claims cannot be deemed in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved. <em>Id., </em>at 434-35, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51. However, when the plaintiffs claims for relief \u201cinvolve a common core of facts or will' be based on related legal theories,\u201d such a suit cannot be viewed as a series of discrete claims. <em>Id., </em>at 435, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51. In such a case, the court must focus on the \u201csignificance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 435, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51-52. If a plaintiff achieves excellent results in a lawsuit, counsel fees should not be reduced on the ground that the plaintiff did not prevail on each claim advanced. <em>Id., </em>at 435, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52. \u201cLitigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court\u2019s rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u2018 By contrast, when a plaintiff achieves only partial or limited success, the lodestar may be excessive even if plaintiffs claims were interrelated and raised in good faith. <em>Id., </em>at 436,103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1941, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 52. Again, the Court emphasized that the critical factor is the degree of success obtained. However, no rule or formula exists for determining the amount of a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>fee. Instead, a court can identify hours that should be eliminated, or simply reduce an award to accord with the limited success. <em>Id., </em>at 436-37, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>Hensley\u2019s </em>focus on \u201cthe results obtained\u201d is consistent with our <em>RPC </em>1.5(a)(4), which states that a trial court should consider \u201cthe amount involved and the results obtained\u201d when devising a reasonable fee award. Accordingly, we held in <em>Helton v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 201, 500 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1985), that the small amount of the underlying claim is an important factor in determining an appropriate fee. In <em>Fagas v. Scott, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 193, 597 A.2d 571 (Law Div.1991), the court interpreted <em>RPC </em>1.5(a)(4) and <em>Helton </em>as creating a \u201cprinciple of proportionality between the amount involved, the results obtained and the counsel fees allowable by a court.\u201d Hence, while there is no <em>requirement </em>that counsel fees be proportionate to damages, the amount of damages a plaintiff recovers is relevant to the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded. <em>Chattin, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 616, 581 A.2d 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">This limiting factor, however, must be applied with caution. In <em>City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>561, 574, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2686, 2694, 91 L.Ed.2d 466, 479 (1986), the Supreme Court reconfirmed the <em>Hensley </em>analysis and held that a counsel fee award under \u00a7 1988 is not <em>per se </em>unreasonable simply because it exceeds the amount of damages recovered by the plaintiff in the underlying lawsuit. The Court reasoned that the interests advanced in a civil rights case are broader than those implicated in an ordinary tort suit, and thus benefit the public as a whole. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, regardless of the amount of damages awarded, an attorney\u2019s fee award deters future violators of civil right laws, and tends to attract competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>counsel to civil rights cases. <em>Id., </em>at 575-78, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2694, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 480-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In the wake of <em>Hensley </em>and <em>Rivera, </em>the Seventh Circuit in <em>Ustrak v. Fairman, </em>851 F.2d 983, 988 (7th Cir.1988), rejected the simplistic approach of dividing the plaintiff-inmate\u2019s counsel fee demand by six because the inmate prevailed on only one of six claims in a civil rights suit against a prison warden. The court held that such an approach effectively disregards the actual time spent litigating the successful claim. Instead, \u201c[a] partially prevailing plaintiff should be compensated for the legal expenses he would have borne if his suit had been confined to the ground on which he prevailed plus related grounds within the meaning of <em>Hensley.\u201d Ibid. </em>This determination depends on how much time should have been expended on litigating the successful claim. <em>Ibid. See also Wallace v. Mulholland, </em>957 <em>F.2d </em>333, 339 (7th Cir.1992) (upholding attorneys\u2019 <em>fee </em>award even though plaintiffs did not prevail on all claims asserted in the suit because \u201c[t]he claims on which the plaintiffs did not ultimately prevail were all related to the claims on which they did prevail,\u201d and hence \u201cthe plaintiffs won their case\u201d); <em>accord Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, </em>723 F.2d 1263, 1278-81 (7th Cir.1983); but <em>see Bethune Plaza, Inc. v. Lumpkin, </em>755 <em>F.Supp. </em>223 (N.D.Ill.1991) (because plaintiffs suit was two-thirds successful, the court reduced plaintiffs fee by a corresponding percentage).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Our Supreme Court has embraced the <em>Hensley </em>approach in the context of \u00a7 1988 claims asserted - in state court. <em>See Singer v. State, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>487, 500-01, 472 A.2d 138 <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>832, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>121, 83 L.Ed.2d 64 (1984). We are therefore entirely satisfied that the sound and fundamentally fair <em>Hensley </em>calculus should as well apply to consumer fraud claims prosecuted under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We accordingly reverse the $1,232.50 award. We, of course, could remand to the trial court for new findings, applying the <em>Hensley </em>analysis. However, in the interest of judicial economy we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>undertake to exercise our original jurisdiction for the purpose of achieving a final determination of the matter. <em>R. </em>2:10-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In computing the \u201clodestar,\u201d we are mindful, as was the trial judge, that at least 10.5 hours were unnecessarily spent by plaintiffs counsel because plaintiff failed to appear at the initial trial call. The total hours expended, 70.7, must therefore be reduced by 10.5 to 60.2. We also find no abuse of discretion in reducing the rate charged by plaintiffs counsel from $240 to $175 per hour. <em>See Singer, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 501-02, 472 A.2d 138. \u201cAn award that applies rates charged by attorneys of ordinary ability, skill and experience should be sufficient to satisfy the primary objective\u201d of \u00a7 1988; namely, \u201cto ensure that competent counsel will be available to all persons with <em>bona fide </em>civil rights claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 472 A.2d 138. The same reasoning should apply to bona fide consumer fraud claims. The $175 per hour rate was sufficient to assure that competent counsel would be available to prosecute plaintiffs claim. We therefore conclude that the \u201clodestar\u201d figure should be fixed at $10,535, computed at 60.2 hours multiplied by $175 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">As stated, the trial judge erred in dividing the \u201clodestar\u201d figure by seven, representing the number of counts in plaintiffs complaint. The counts shared a common core of operative facts and were bottomed on related legal theories. Moreover, plaintiff in good faith raised the alternative legal grounds contained in the remaining counts. Our review of counsel\u2019s certification satisfies us that much, if not all, of the pretrial time expended by counsel involved the consumer fraud and overlapping claims. Plaintiff also would have been entitled to discovery and jury trial even had she asserted consumer fraud as a single claim. Dismissal of the nonconsumer fraud counts was, accordingly, not a sufficient reason for a wholesale reduction of the fee. <em>Hensley, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 435, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We must, however, consider \u201cthe amount involved and the results obtained\u201d when devising a reasonable fee award. <em>RPC </em>1.5(a)(4); <em>Hensley, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 435, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1940, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>52. The jury rejected plaintiffs claim that she was overcharged $2,000 on the contract price, and awarded her only $350 damages for overpayment of equipment and services. The nominal amount of the damage award alone justifies a substantial downward adjustment in the counsel fee award. Nevertheless, limiting the counsel fee award to the amount of damages recovered, as trebled, would in our view discourage competent counsel from prosecuting consumer fraud cases involving nominal amounts, and would not deter future violators of the Act. <em>Rivera, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at 575, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2694, 91 L.Ed.2d 480. We therefore conclude, applying the <em>Hensley/Rivera </em>analysis, that a reasonable counsel fee award, considering plaintiffs limited success and other pertinent factors, is $4,500, plus costs. Accordingly, we enter a counsel fee award in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $5,229.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We have considered Century\u2019s cross-appeal challenging the post-judgment order limiting its counsel fee award to $1,906.87 and are satisfied it is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Reversed on plaintiffs appeal. The award for counsel fees and costs is increased to $5,229.23. Affirmed on Century\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> Subsequent opinions of the Court modifying the <em>Hensley </em>analysis concerning <em>upward </em>adjustments of the lodestar figure are not pertinent here since we are concerned with a <em>downward </em>adjustment. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>546, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986); <em>Blum v.
