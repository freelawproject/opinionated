The property damaged by M.N. was separated in the complaint into two counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">1. Count One, charging third-degree arson of a garage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">2. Count Two, charging third-degree criminal mischief of a boat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In April 1992, following a bench trial, the Family Part judge concluded that M.N. did not purposely set the boat or garage on fire, but that, beyond a reasonable doubt, M.N. \u201cpurposely lit a fire\u201d by striking a match. Therefore, the judge found M.N. guilty of third-degree arson of the garage as alleged in count one of the complaint. The judge made no findings on the charge of third-degree criminal mischief involving the boat as contained in count two of the complaint. M.N. was sentenced on June 4,1992, to two years of probation and was ordered to complete one hundred hours of community service and to attend individual counselling.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In his brief on appeal, M.N. argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">M.N.\u2019S CONVICTION OF THIRD DEGREE ARSON MUST BE VACATED AND THE CHARGES DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">A. The Court\u2019s Finding That M.N. Purposely Started A Fire By Merely Lighting A Match Is Erroneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">B. The State Failed To Prove That M.N. Recklessly Endangered Or Destroyed The Property Of Another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">C. The Court Failed To Malee A Finding Regarding Whether Or Not M.N.\u2019s Conduct Toward The Property Of Another Was Reckless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">D. Since M.N.\u2019s Conduct Amounted To Mere Negligence He Could Not Have Been Found Culpable For Anything Other Than Criminal Mischief In The Fourth Degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-16\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-17\">THE DOCTRINE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY REQUIRES THAT THE ALLEGATION OF CRIMINAL MISCHIEF CONTAINED IN COUNT TWO OF THE COMPLAINT MUST BE DISMISSED. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-18\">On December 10,1991, at about 8:00 a.m., twelve-year-old M.N., a seventh grader, was walking to the school bus stop. As was his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>usual habit, he took a short-cut through three owners\u2019 properties. According to M.N., while walking, he found a book of matches near his house. He picked up the matches, lit one, and threw it onto the road. He continued on to the bus stop \u201cthrowing the matches around and cutting through the people\u2019s yards.\u201d When he got to a tree by the yard of the victim, M.N. lit a match, blew it out, threw it, and then threw the entire book of matches away and walked on to catch his bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">An unknown man knocked on the door of a nearby house, shouted \u201cfire,\u201d and ran away. The neighbor saw flames across the street, called the police, and attempted to put out the fire with a garden hose. He observed that the fire was actually coming from a boat parked next to a detached garage which was at the rear of the property. The owner of the property was summoned from work. When he arrived home, he saw his boat and garage on fire. The fire destroyed the boat, a substantial portion of the detached garage, one antique car, sporting equipment, and other personal items. The owner estimated the damage to the boat and the garage and its contents to be approximately $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">A Franklin Township detective, assigned to the Police Arson Squad, investigated the fire. He arrived on the scene at 9:30 a.m. He observed that it had rained overnight and that the ground was very wet. He noted that the garage had burned from the outside in and that there were no \u201cheat sources\u201d (i.e. extension cords, batteries) in or near the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">After finding a piece of paper with \u201cFranklin School\u201d written on it and learning that the school bus picked up students at around the time the fire began, the detective asked a patrolman to go to the school and ask the principal and students if anyone had knowledge of the fire. M.N. became a suspect when the detective was informed by the property owner\u2019s daughter that M.N. had been observed on previous occasions taking a short cut through the yard on his way to the bus stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The detective spoke to the principal at M.N.\u2019s school and expressed his desire to talk with the student about the fire. M.N.\u2019s mother came to school and in the presence of the principal, the detective questioned the young man. M.N., however, lied about the route that he had taken to the bus stop. At trial, M.N. explained that he had not told the truth because he knew he was playing with matches on the property and was afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The following morning, the principal called the detective to say that M.N. and his mother wanted to speak with him again. They met at police headquarters shortly after the phone call. According to the detective, M.N. admitted that he had cut through the victim\u2019s property. M.N. also allegedly stated that he lit a match, blew it out, and threw it on leaves at the rear of the boat. M.N. was said to have further stated that he lit the entire book of matches and threw that away.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">After this meeting, the detective returned to the property to look for a burned book of matches. He was directed by the owner\u2019s daughter to a burned matchbook she had discovered in a neighbor\u2019s backyard, began at approximately seventy feet away. M.N. testified that he was not near the boat that day. Although he was playing with matches on the property, he claimed it was by the street. M.N. asserted that he cut through the yard in front of the garage and did not see the boat at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The detective also testified as an arson expert at trial. He expressed his belief that the fire was a result of arson. He felt that the fire could have been started with only paper or matches and estimated that it began approximately 8:15 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">We first consider whether the judge misconceived the applicable law or misapplied it to the facts. <em>See Kavanaugh v. Quigley, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 158, 164 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">On the issue of whether M.N. purposely started a fire, the trial judge interpreted the statute to mean that merely lighting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>match constitutes the purposeful starting of a fire, because the lighting of a match \u201cstarts a fire, albeit a small fire.\u201d The judge concluded that, in these circumstances, \u201c[t]he purposeful act that the statute proscribes is the act of lighting the match.\u201d The trial judge, however, found that M.N. did not intend to set the boat or garage on fire. He found that M.N. only intended to light the match. Although the detective testified that M.N. had told him that after he lit the match he also lit the book of matches, the judge made no finding regarding the lighting of the book of matches.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:17-lb provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">A person is guilty of arson, a crime of the third degree, if he <em>purposely </em>starts a fire or causes an explosion, whether on his own property or another\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">(1) Thereby <em>recklessly </em>placing another person in danger of death or bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">(2) Thereby <em>recklessly </em>placing a building or structure of another in danger of damage or destruction____ (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">In order for M.N. to be guilty of third-degree arson, two elements of culpability \u2014 \u201cpurposely starting]\u201d and \u201crecklessly placing\u201d\u2014 must be proved. Therefore, the youth must have \u201cpurposely\u201d started a fire and, in so doing, he must have \u201crecklessly\u201d placed the life or structure of another in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\u201cPurposely\u201d is the highest standard of culpability in the Code of Criminal Justice. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(l). According to this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. A person acts purposely with respect to attendant circumstances if he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist____ <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">\u201cCrimes entailing purposive conduct by definition focus on the subjective attitude of the accused: they require not only that he engage consciously in the proscribed conduct, but that he desire the prohibited result.\u201d <em>State v. Harmon, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>189, 201, 516 A.2d 1047 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">The State argues that M.N.\u2019s act of striking a match \u201cstarted\u201d a fire and that is the only purposeful act necessary. The State adds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that it need not prove that M.N. \u201cset\u201d the fire because \u201cstarting\u201d and \u201csetting\u201d are two different things. M.N. submits \u201cthat the court\u2019s finding that he purposely started a fire by merely lighting a match is erroneous.\u201d M.N. further submits \u201cthat while his lighting a match may prove he literally started a fire <em>on a matchhead, </em>it fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u2018purposely start[ed] a fire,\u2019 as within the statutory meaning of the term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">New Jersey\u2019s pre-Code arson statute provided that \u201cany person who willfully or maliciously bums\u201d another\u2019s dwelling house or its adjacent structures is guilty of arson. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:89-1; <em>see State v. Lucas, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>37, 152 A.2d 50 (1959); <em>State v. Schenk, </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122, 241 A.2d 267 (App.Div.1968). This language was changed to \u201c[a] person is guilty of arson, ... if he purposely starts a fire or causes an explosion____\u201d N.J.S.A 2C:17-lb. The definition of purposely provided in N.J.S.A 2C:2-2b(l) means that \u201c[defendant] acted purposely if it was his \u2018conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 630-31, 623 A.2d 800 (App.Div.1993). Facial application of the statutory language to these facts can be seen to support the position of both the State and the defense. Therefore, we must determine the meaning which most comports with legislative intent, common sense, and legal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The Code Commentary to aggravated arson <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2C:17-la) is instructive. That provision uses the same language \u2014 \u201cstarts a fire or causes an eclosi\u00f3n,\u201d notes that the language employed was meant to include culpability \u201ceven though the fire is extinguished before any significant damage is done.\u201d <em>New Jersey Penal Code, Vol. II: Commentary, Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>\u00a7 2C:17-16 at 205 (1971). It is significant, however, that N.J.S.A 2C:17-lb differs from Subsection a in that it does not require that the actor have the purpose of placing persons or property in danger so long as the fire or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>explosion is purposely started. The Commentary specifically gives the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">The requirement of purpose to destroy or damage, in clause (1) of Subsection a, makes it clear that the mere employment of fire with more limited purposes, <em>e.g., </em>use of an acetylene torch to detach metal fixtures from a structure, or to gain entry to a building or safe, does not fall within the crime of Aggravated Arson defined by Subsection a. <em>See State v. Schenk, supra. It may, however, lead to liability for Arson under Subsection b.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\"><em>[Commentary, supra </em>(emphasis added)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">It is against this background that we look to the case law for some assistance on the question of whether in these circumstances merely lighting a match constitutes \u201cpurposely starting] a fire\u201d under Subsection b.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In <em>State v. Krieger, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>256, 475 A.2d 563 (1984), reversed for reasons expressed in the Appellate Division\u2019s dissent, 193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 475 A.2d 608 (App.Div.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>1017, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>431, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984), two fires of incendiary origins occurred within two weeks of each other at a mattress factory. <em>Krieger, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570, 475 A.2d 608. The defendant was a company employee who had applied to be a city fireman. He confessed to having a cigarette and playing with matches in the room where the fire took place. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 475 A.2d 608. He stated that he dropped the matches on the floor in order \u201cto start paper on fire and bum the mats.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>He claimed he had planned to start the fire the day before it happened because he wanted to gain the recognition that would come when he extinguished the fire. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 475 A.2d 608. He gave this same reason for starting the second fire. <em>Ibid. </em>In his confession regarding the second fire, defendant described how he lit a cigarette and put it near the book of matches with the intent of starting a small fire. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 475 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">At trial, defendant denied the truth of his confession. <em>Ibid. </em>The Appellate Division majority reversed the conviction based on the requirement of <em>State v. Lucas, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>37, 152 A.2d 50 (1959), that when a confession is offered for the tmth of its contents, \u201cthe State must introduce independent proof of facts and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>which strengthen or bolster the confession and tend to generate a belief in its trustworthiness, plus independent proof of loss or injury....\u201d <em>Krieger, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 575, 475 A.2d 608 (quoting <em>Lucas, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 56, 152 A.2d 50). In his dissent, adopted by the. New Jersey Supreme Court majority, Judge Michels held that the State\u2019s case was sufficient because it established that the defendant was on the premises at the time of the fire, the defendant\u2019s job duties entailed frequent trips through the area of the plant where the fire occurred, the defendant expressed a motive, and the fire investigators concluded that the fire had been intentionally set. <em>Id. </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580-82, 475 A.2d 608. Even though the issue in <em>Krieger </em>was different than the case at bar, it is informative as to the proofs generally regarded as necessary to demonstrate arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Here, the judge concluded only that M.N. purposely lit a match. There was no finding that M.N. had a purpose to start any other fire, even the leaves, at that time. The judge did not conclude that M.N. purposely lit anything except the match. This is not enough reasonably to constitute an element of the crime of third-degree arson. In <em>Krieger, </em>the plaintiff planned and intended to start a small fire when he dropped the book of lit matches. M. N. had no such plan or purpose under the findings of the trial judge. We are convinced that \u201cpurposely\u201d lighting a match does not, in these circumstances, satisfy the requirements of \u201cpurposely starts a fire\u201d as proscribed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:17-l(b). Moreover, purposely lighting the match, in the absence of an additional act or omission by the accused, could not in these circumstances have <em>\u201c[tjhereby </em>recklessly plac[ed]\u201d the structures of another in danger. <em>N. J.S.A. </em>2C:17-l(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In view of the above, M.N.\u2019s conviction for third-degree arson on Count One cannot stand. We need not consider his argument that his conviction was also deficient because of the failure of the judge to make a finding as to whether M.N.\u2019s conduct was reckless. We do, however, remand to the Family Part for a determination as to whether the juvenile is guilty of criminal mischief, a lesser inelud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ed offense of Count One. <em>See State v. LaPierre, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>156, 166, 188 A.2d 10 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">M.N. was charged in Count Two of the complaint with third-degree criminal mischief <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:17-3) pertaining to the boat. The trial court made no conclusions regarding M.N.\u2019s guilt or innocence on this Count. The State admits that the trial court failed to conclusively resolve this issue. For the first time on appeal, M.N. contends that this charge must be dismissed because the doctrine of double jeopardy precludes him from being prosecuted a second time. The State contends that the remedy for the trial court\u2019s failure to make a determination is to remand the case back to the trial court for additional findings on this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The double jeopardy clause, contained in New Jersey\u2019s constitution, as well as in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution (applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment), guarantees that \u201cno person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. I, \u00b6 11; <em>U.S. Const., </em>amend. V and XIV. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-9 also provides circumstances when prosecution is barred by former prosecution for the same offense. M.N.\u2019s ease does not fall into any of the enumerated statutory circumstances. Nonetheless, we believe that the doctrine of fundamental fairness bars an entry of a judgment or re-prosecution regarding the charge of criminal mischief contained in the second count. In <em>State v. Currie, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>531, 539, 197 A.2d 678 (1964), our Supreme Court stated that a court\u2019s \u201cprimary considerations should be fairness and fulfillment of reasonable expectations in light of the constitutional and common law goals.\u201d Relevant factors that help determine the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d of the double jeopardy principle \u201cinclude the speed with which such violations are generally tried, the extent of the evidential presentation and of the legal representation, and the maximum terms and fines allowable and anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>by the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Yoskowitz, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>679, 706, 563 A.2d 1 (1989) (citing <em>Currie, swpra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 543, 197 A.2d 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The alleged criminal mischief offense occurred on December 10, 1991. M.N. was found guilty of arson on April 21, 1991, and, on June 4, 1992, was ordered to serve two years probation and one hundred hours of community service. We are advised he has completed these requirements. Up to the present time, the State has not sought to expand the judge\u2019s findings or to otherwise proceed on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In determining whether a re-prosecution involves double jeopardy concerns, the doctrine of fundamental fairness is to be sparingly applied. <em>State v. Fullard, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 51, 596 A.2d 779 (Law Div.1991). \u201cIt is appropriately applied in those rare cases where not to do so will subject the defendant to oppression, harassment or egregious deprivation.\u201d <em>Yoskowitz, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 712, 563 A.2d 1. Since the offense occurred almost two years ago and M.N.\u2019s punishment has been fulfilled, re-prosecuting on the additional criminal mischief charge would violate our basic concepts of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Finally, M.N. argues that if he is found guilty of the criminal mischief offense, the grading of the charge should be fourth-degree instead of third-degree. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:17-3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">A person is guilty of criminal mischief if he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">(1) Purposely or knowingly damages tangible property of another or damages tangible property of another recklessly or negligently in the employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous means ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">(b) Grading. Criminal mischief is a crime of the third degree if the actor <em>purposely </em>causes pecuniary loss of $2000 or more____ It is a crime of the fourth degree if the actor causes pecuniary loss in excess of $500.00 but less than $2000.00, or a disorderly persons offense if he causes pecuniary loss of $500.00 or less. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">M.N. points out that an \u201canomaly\u201d exists within the grading section of the statute. The plain language of the grading section pertaining to third-degree criminal mischief requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>actor <em>purposely </em>cause pecuniary loss. Since M.N. has been found not to have purposely caused the damage, his criminal mischief conviction cannot be viewed as a third-degree offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The problem is that the statutory language indicates only that fourth-degree criminal mischief applies if the actor caused loss in excess of $500, but less than $2,000. The damage caused to the victim\u2019s property was in excess of $2,000. Here, the grading provision of the statute fails to take into account the non-purposeful offender, such as M.N., who causes pecuniary loss in excess of $2,000. We conclude, nonetheless, that because M.N. did not act purposely, the charge must be graded as fourth-degree and not third-degree criminal mischief. If the Legislature intended otherwise, it must clarify the ambiguity in the statute. We have no alternative but to strictly construe the language we have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment of acquittal as to third-degree arson and adjudication of whether M.N. is guilty of the lesser included offense of fourth-degree criminal mischief under Count One.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
