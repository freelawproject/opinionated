(Church &amp; Dwight) which he had taken to resolve indigestion. Misdiagnosed as having suffered a perforated ulcer, Graves only came to believe in 1983 that the baking soda caused his injury. On August 8, 1984, he and his wife filed a complaint against Church &amp; Dwight.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The eight-count complaint alleged misrepresentation and mislabeling; negligent failure to warn; strict liability in tort; breach of warranty; and fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The matter was tried over several weeks. Only the strict liability warning issue was submitted to the jury, the other claims having been dismissed. The jury was given four interrogatories to answer pertaining to liability. The questions were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">1. Did the plaintiff consume defendant\u2019s Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda on the night in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">2. Was the Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda product defective by reason of its failure to warn about possible stomach rupture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">3. Was the failure to warn a proximate cause of plaintiffs consumption of Ann &amp; Hammer Baking Soda on the night in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">4. Was the consumption of Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda a substantial contribute ing factor proximately causing plaintiffs stomach rupture?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The jury unanimously found, in response to the first question, that defendant\u2019s product was involved in the incident. By a five-to-one majority it answered questions two in the affirmative and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>three in the negative. Having found that the failure to warn was not a proximate cause of Graves\u2019 injury, the jury did not answer question four.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The trial judge entered judgment in favor of defendant and denied plaintiffs\u2019 post-trial motion. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, and defendant was permitted to file a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>cross-appeal from the denial of its summary judgment motion. However, defendant has not briefed the issue raised in its cross-appeal. Thus, the issue is deemed waived, and the cross-appeal is dismissed. <em>Matter of Bloomingdale Conval. Ctr., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 48 n. 1, 558 A.2d 19 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The trial record discloses the following pertinent facts. As a child, William Graves had been given Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda as an antacid by his grandmother. She would take a teaspoon and measure out \u201ca certain amount\u201d and put it in a glass of water. Plaintiff, however, had not used this home remedy from the time he stopped living with his grandmother in 1939 until August 22, 1979, the date of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">On August 21, 1979, Graves, then 52 years old, was senior assistant editor for <em>National Geographic </em>magazine. He and his wife Joyce, his bride of six months, were in Graves\u2019 house in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. His then 17 year-old son was also there. Graves ate dinner around 6:30 p.m.. He characterized the meal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was finished by 7:45 p.m., as \u201csubstantial but not huge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">He felt fine when he retired to the bedroom shortly after dinner. He took an iced brandy with him, and read for no more than an hour, before going to sleep between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>He awakened around or shortly after midnight with noticeable, although not severe, heartburn. Although he had been diagnosed with an ulcer at twenty-two, he had no real indigestion problems. He infrequently took Bisodol for bouts of indigestion; however, on this occasion, he had no Bisodol and thought of his grandmother\u2019s remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">He went to the kitchen and took a box of baking soda out, \u201csifted some of the baking soda into the bottom of the glass,\u201d and filled the approximately eight-ounce glass with water to within an inch of its top.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was the same technique he used when he took Bisodol. The baking soda was sufficient in amount to cover the bottom of the glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">At trial, Graves demonstrated the amount of baking soda he used on August 22 and the manner in which he mixed it with water. The amount was later stipulated to be 5.7 grams. The half-teaspoon dosage recommended by defendant measures 1.8 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Graves drank the solution down quickly. In four gulps he emptied two-thirds of the- glass. Before he could return the glass to the counter, an enormous pain drove him to his hands and knees. His wife heard his screams and called for help. Graves told his wife that if he passed out, to tell emergency personnel that \u201call he did was take a little baking soda.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Graves underwent surgery on August 22,1979 and was misdiagnosed as suffering from a perforated ulcer. He had six subsequent surgeries for abscesses or hernia repair. His medical specials as of the time of trial totalled $55,085.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Baking soda has been used as an antaeid for more than 100 years. When the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) was formed in the 1930s, baking soda, like aspirin, was accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cGRAS\u201d status; i.e., \u201cGenerally Recommended as Safe.\u201d Such products were exempt from FDA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Over the years, the recommended dosage varied from one-quarter teaspoon to two teaspoons. In 1979, the Arm and Hammer box recommended one-half teaspoon in a glass of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In the 1960s and 1970s, the FDA conducted monograph studies on all GRAS products. Baking soda had its turn in 1974, when the FDA told manufacturers how to label their packaging, including a recommended dosage.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The FDA employed five physicians to help with its baking soda monograph. Two of these, Dr. John Morrissey and Dr. Edward Moore, testified for the plaintiffs at trial. Both said that they relied on the manufacturer to tell them of the potential for, or known, adverse reactions; neither relied on the articles suggesting a causal relationship between baking soda and spontaneous stomach rupture that were included in a bibliography provided to them by FDA researchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">According to Morrissey and Moore, they would have been concerned with the possibility of stomach rupture from baking soda if they had known about these articles when they were consulting for the FDA. As it was, the FDA was concerned with the effect of long-term use on certain chronic conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Much of the testimony at trial focused on these articles and Church &amp; Dwight\u2019s lack of knowledge of their existence. There is no doubt that some of them predate Graves\u2019 accident by more than fifty years. The defendant, however, disclaimed any pre1979 knowledge of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The basic premise of both sides was that Graves\u2019 stomach was overly distended by his meal, and that for some reason it was not emptying normally. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory essentially was that the baking soda combined with stomach acid to create a large volume of gas immediately that, in turn, caused the stomach rupture. Defendant essentially sought to prove that Graves\u2019 stomach, whether emptying properly or not, was full enough that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>volume of water in which Graves dissolved the baking soda was alone sufficient to cause the rupture, that the <em>very small </em>amount of gas produced was alone sufficient, or that the two factors acted together in concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 gastroenterologists Lawrence Feinman, Morrissey, and Moore found baking soda, as an antacid, could be unsafe in any dosage. However, defense expert, Dr. John Fordtran, opined that it was possible for the amount of baking soda taken by plaintiff to cause spontaneous stomach rupture under certain circumstances, which he hastened to add were not present in Graves\u2019 case, and defense expert, Francis Morel, an M.I.T. \u201caqueous chemist,\u201d felt the volume of the bicarbonate solution, but not the bicarbonate, caused the rupture of the overfilled stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In 1979, the Arm and Hammer label read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>AS AN ANTACID</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Effective as an antacid to alleviate heartburn, sour stomach and/or add indigestion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\"><em>DIRECTIONS: </em>14 tsp. in glass of water every 2 hours up to maximum dosage or as directed by physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\"><em>WARNINGS: </em>Do not take more than eight 14 tsp. for persons up to 60 years old or four 14 tsp. for persons 60 years or older in a 24 hour period, or use the maximum dosage of this product for more than 2 weeks, except under the advice and supervision of a physician.' Do not use this product except under the advice and supervision of a physician. Do not use this product except under the advice and supervision of a physician if you are on a sodium restricted diet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Graves vacillated between saying that he had never read the label on the Arm and Hammer box, and saying that he must have read the label as a child in his grandmother\u2019s house. In any event, he did not read the label in the early hours of August 22, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 experts denounced the label, but were far from unanimous as to what warnings should have been given. Dr. Morton Leeds, a pharmacologist, opined that the label, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d should indicate that the recommended dose \u201cshould not be exceeded.\u201d Dr. Feinman testified that the label contained no warning against taking too much baking soda when the stomach was overly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>distended. Dr. Morrissey said the label did not adequately warn of significant medical risks, although he characterized Graves\u2019 injury as a \u201crare phenomenon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Dr. Moore suggested that only if \u201cyou replace the biceps [in the company\u2019s logo] with a skull and cross bones\u201d was it possible that \u201cmaybe somebody would notice\u201d the warning. Dr. Brian Strom, a clinical epidemiologist, opined that the 1979 label gave no notice of possible gastric rupture, and did not reveal the actual dangerousness of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Finally, plaintiffs offered a human factors expert, Dr. Robert Cunitz, to testify about the psychology of warnings. He similarly opined that there should have been a warning as to the possibility of stomach rupture, and that the 1979 label was ineffective. He came as close as any of plaintiffs\u2019 experts to talking about what kind of warning was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Cunitz suggested that the warning be moved to the front of the package:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">You can use the English language. You could use a pictograph of some picture of a stomach rupturing or something along those lines following somebody ingesting this product from a glass. I mean that would be pretty graphie[.] ... [A] circle and a slash through it would do or an x across it would do to let people know not to do that. Alternatively, you might have to spell out the hazard in words but you also need to include an instruction to avoid harm and you might show a cup or a glass with the product in it and a circle with a circle and a slash through it to indicate that one shouldn\u2019t take it this way and then back up with the written language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">After acknowledging that there were probably \u201ctwenty ways\u201d to warn, Cunitz went on to suggest that in order to be effective to change a long established pattern of use, the Arm and Hammer name should be relegated to the top one-eighth or one-quarter of the front of the box the logo moved elsewhere, and that a warning take up the rest of the front panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Defendant\u2019s expert on warnings, psychologist Dr. Donald Horst, offered an opinion that, given the long-accepted practice of using baking soda as an antacid and the general perception of it as safe, warning against a potential danger would be difficult. He did not hold out \u201cmuch hope\u201d of affecting what people will do with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>product if they are generally familiar with its propensities. He believed that using an extreme pictograph simply destroys credibility of the product, and in any event, a skull and cross bones is an inaccurate warning for baking soda. Horst suggested that no warning was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On appeal plaintiffs\u2019 present the following issues for resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW6\">POINT I IT WAS PLAIN ERROR FOR THE COURT TO HAVE SUBMITTED JURY QUESTION 3, WHICH STATED, \u201cWAS THE FAILURE TO WARN A PROXIMATE CAUSE OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S CONSUMPTION OF ARM &amp; HAMMER BAKING SODA ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">A THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPLYING A \u201cBUT FOR\u201d RATHER THAN A \u201cSUBSTANTIAL FACTOR\u201d TEST IN THE VERBIAGE OF QUESTION 3 AND IN INSTRUCTING THE JURY ON PROXIMATE CAUSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">B. BECAUSE DEFENDANT\u2019S PRODUCT BORE NO WARNING ON THE KNOWN RISK OF STOMACH RUPTURE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT INSTRUCTING THE JURY THAT PLAINTIFF WAS ENTITLED TO A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT HE WOULD HAVE READ AND HEEDED A PROPER LABEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">C.

POINT III:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">A THE DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM OF STRICT LIABILITY PREDICATED UPON DEFENDANT\u2019S PRODUCT BEING UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS CONSTITUTED PLAIN ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">B.

Therefore, we affirm the judgment under review for the reasons stated herein.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">In response to the second interrogatory submitted to the jury, the jury found that defendant\u2019s baking soda product was defective by reason of its failure to warn about possible stomach rupture.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first argument on appeal is that \u201c[i]t was error to submit to the jury the issue of proximate cause between the effect of a non-existing warning and plaintiffs ingestion of the product, where he possessed no conscious knowledge of the danger.\u201d The quoted statement from plaintiffs\u2019 brief implies that proximate cause, as found in the third jury question, is not an issue in a strict liability case where the plaintiff is unaware of the specific danger, and the manufacturer fails to warn of the danger in its product instructions. Another way of stating plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that, where a product is found to be defective for a lack of proper warning, there is a conclusive presumption that a consumer would have read and heeded a warning had it been given; thereby relieving Graves of his burden of proving proximate causation between the defect and his consumption of the product. <em>No </em>authority is cited to support plaintiffs\u2019 argument. Indeed, the law is clearly to the contrary. There are a number of cases from our Supreme Court, and this court, that require proof of proximate causation in failure to warn cases where the plaintiff was unaware of the danger. <em>See, </em>e.g. <em>Michalko v. Cooke Color &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>386, 402, 451 A.2d 179 (1982); <em>Freund v. Cellofilm Properties, Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>229, 241, 432 A.2d 925 (1981); <em>Molino v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>261 <em>N.J.Super., </em>85, 98-101, 617 A.2d 1235 (App.Div.1992); <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp., </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 285, 608 A.2d 416 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>596, 617 A.2d 1219 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 question, properly phrased, should be whether there was a genuine factual dispute on the issue of proximate causation which required jury resolution. Evidence that the plaintiff had some knowledge of the danger is, for sure, one way in which such a fact issue may be created. <em>See Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>198, 209, 485 A.2d 305 (1984). That, of course, does not mean to say that the converse is true; i.e., it does not follow that there is no issue of fact simply because plaintiff had no knowledge of the danger. Fact issues pertaining to proximate causation may be created where there is evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">the user was blind, illiterate, intoxicated at the time of the use, irresponsible or lax in judgment or by some other circumstance tending to show that the improper use was or would have been made regardless of the warning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\"><em>[Coffman v. Keene Corp., supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286, 608 A.2d 416 (App.Div.1992), quoting <em>Technical Chem. Co. v. Jacobs, </em>480 S.W.2d 602, 606 (Tex.1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">For the reasons stated <em>infra </em>at LA. there were sufficient facts to submit the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Plaintiffs alternatively challenge the propriety of submitting the third jury question, contending that, in a failure to warn case, a rebuttable presumption that Graves would have read any warning on the box, and heeded it, is created as a matter of law. They argue that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the presumption and direct a verdict in their favor, because there was no evidence in the record to rebut the presumption. On the other hand, plaintiffs argue that, even if there was sufficient rebuttal evidence, the judge should have instructed the jury that plaintiffs were to receive \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d that a warning would have been read and heeded; i.e. the judge should have informed the jury that such a presumption exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Although plaintiffs contended at trial that they were not obligated to prove proximate causation, the precise argument concerning the existence of a \u201cheeding presumption\u201d was not raised until post-trial motions. However, because the heeding presumption is so intertwined with the concept of proximate causation, we deem it appropriate to decide the issue on the merits, rather than procedurally bar plaintiffs from raising it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra., </em>decided before this case was tried, there was a suggestion that a heeding presumption might find favor with the Supreme Court. However, it was not until <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp., supra, </em>was decided, that an appellate court of this state definitively found that the absence of a warning created a rebuttable presumption that a plaintiff would have read a proper warning had it been given. More specifically, <em>Coffman </em>stands for the proposition that the heeding presumption is sufficient to sustain plaintiffs burden of proof on proximate causation where the \u201cdefendant produces no evidence to overcome the presumption.\u201d 257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 290, 608 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We have no doubt that the <em>Coffman </em>court did not intend to limit its holding to asbestos cases, as defendant here suggests. The heeding presumption had its genesis in comment j of the Restatement of Torts 2d, 402A, <em>See, Technical Chem. Co. v. W.T. Jacobs, </em>480 <em>S.W.2d </em>602, 606 (Tex.1972). It has been applied to defective warning cases involving various products in the opinions of other states. <em>See, </em>e.g., the list of cases cited in <em>Coffman, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 287-88, 608 A.2d 416. Subsequent to <em>Coffman, </em>other parts of this court have stated that the heeding presumption has general application. <em>Fabian v. Minster Machine Co., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 278, 609 A.2d 487 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>598, 617 A.2d 1220 (1992) (involving a press/product liability case); <em>Molino v. B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 100-01, 617 A.2d 1235 (App.Div.1992) (involving tire/produet liability case, specifically noting that the \u201cpresumption has been applied to products liability cases not involving asbestos.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Thus, we agree with plaintiffs that a heeding presumption was relevant in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 liability theory. The effect of such a presumption is to require defendant to come forward with evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption, or risk a directed finding against it as to the presumed fact. <em>In re Weeks, </em>29 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 537-38, 103 A.2d 43 (App.Div.1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">While we have looked to the law of other states in deciding whether the heeding presumption should be adopted as a part of the substantive law of this State, <em>see Campos </em>and <em>Coffman, supra, </em>once the presumption has been adopted as a part of our substantive law, it is clear that the effect to be given to the presumption is dictated by the evidence law of New Jersey. <em>Evid.R. </em>14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[I]f evidence to the contrary of a presumed fact is offered, the existence or nonexistence of such fact shall be for the trier of fact, unless the evidence is such that the minds of reasonable men would not differ as to the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Under the rule, an assumed fact must be taken to exist if evidence contrary to the assumed fact does not create a genuine issue of fact; i.e. if \u201creasonable men would not differ as to the existence or non-existence of the presumed fact.\u201d <em>Id.; Harvey v. Craw, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 74, 264 A.2d 448 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>479, 267 A,2d 61 (1970). Conversely, it is logical to conclude that rebuttal evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact so that the \u201cminds of reasonable men\u201d could find that the presumed fact had not been established, is the quantum of evidence necessary to overcome the presumption, and is sufficient to make the existence or non-existence of the presumed fact a-question for the jury. Biunno, <em>Current N.J.Rules of Evidence, </em>1967 Commission Note and comment 1 on <em>Evid.R. </em>14 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The burden of coming forward with evidence to rebut the presumption is on the defendant, but the burden of proof never shifts from the plaintiff. <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Township of Edison, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>290, 314-15, 604 A.2d 580 (1992). That is to say, once the presumption is rebutted, the risk of non-persuasion remains with the party upon whom the burden of proof was originally placed, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>this case, the plaintiff. <em>Rumson Bor. v. Peckham, </em>7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>539, 548-49 (Tax 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Furthermore, under New Jersey law, there is a general prohibition against calling presumptions to the attention of a jury. <em>See Jurman v. Samuel Braen, Inc., </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>586, 222 A.2d 78 (1966) and <em>Kirschbaum v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>133 <em>N.J.L. 5, </em>42 A.2d 257 (E &amp; A 1945). For these reasons, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Nissen Trampoline Co. v. Terre Haute First National Bank, </em>332 N.E.2d 820 (Ind.1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>265 <em>Ind. </em>457, 358 N.E.2d 974 (1976) (holding that the burden of proof on the heeding presumption shifts to the manufacturer), and their reliance on <em>Butz v. Werner, </em>438 N.W.2d 509 (N.D.1989) (holding that a jury should be instructed on the heeding presumption), is misplaced, since the evidence law of the states where they were decided is contrary to that of New Jersey.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Plaintiffs contend that there was no rebuttal evidence contrary to the presumed fact that Graves would have read a warning had it been given, and, for that reason, proximate cause was not an issue in the case. Defendant, on the other hand, calls our attention to several areas of evidence which it claims rebutted the heeding presumption. Although we do not endorse all of defendant\u2019s arguments on this point, there are several areas of evidence which sufficiently support the conclusion that a jury question was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Graves characterized himself as a \u201ccompulsive\u201d reader, especially paying attention to product labels because of a potentially fatal allergy to nuts. In that respect Graves testified, on direct examination, what he would have done if he had seen a warning on the baking soda box:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">Q. My final question to you, Mr. Graves is this: Assume back in \u2014 on August 22, 1979, you picked up or load [sic] from your shelf in your cupboard that box of Arm <em>&amp; </em>Hammer Baking Soda or a similar box____ And you had seen on it a big skull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>and cross bones or bold letters saying, may cause stomach rupture, being a reader and being a man with an allergy such as you\u2019ve described to nuts, what do you believe that you would have done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">A. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it. I would have put up with the heartburn. I\u2019m conditioned all my life to reading warnings and knowing that certain foods are enormously harmful to me and I think I simply wouldn\u2019t have taken it if I had seen an adequate warning or something to call my attention to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">By introducing evidence in his direct case concerning what he would have done had there been a warning on the product, Graves, perhaps, eschewed reliance on the heeding presumption, but, at the very least, put his credibility as a careful reader and heeder of health warnings in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">For at least five years prior to his accident, Graves smoked two to three packs of cigarettes a day, and had a cigarette cough which would sometimes begin in the morning when he got up. He also attributed being winded when climbing stairs to his cigarette consumption. He was aware that cigarettes bore a warning label from the Surgeon General of the United States concerning health hazards. Nonetheless, when asked whether he would have smoked cigarettes on the morning of the accident had a skull and cross bones been on the package of cigarettes, Graves admitted that he \u201chadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The evidence concerning Graves smoking, notwithstanding warnings on cigarette packages, was admitted without objection. Such evidence, in our view, provided the jury with a basis to make an analogy between Graves smoking in the face of the health warnings on cigarettes, and his projected behavior if a warning had been on the baking soda.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Additionally, Graves gave inconsistent testimony as to when he last read the baking soda label. Indeed, a jury could reasonably conclude that he had never done so. In any event, while the inconsistency is not determinative, standing alone, the history he gave on reading the label is. The latest date on which Graves could have read the label, was 1939, the year he stopped living with his grandmother. He never remembers reading the label for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>recommended dosage. Indeed, there is one exchange in the record that puts Graves\u2019 attitude concerning baking soda in sharp perspective, and could reasonably be relied upon by a jury to conclude that he would not have read a warning had it been provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">Q. Did you stand there and read the label that night to find out how much the manufacturer of this product Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda told you to put in the glass?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">A. No. I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">A. I\u2019ve taken it off and on for over half a century and it always worked, and I\u2019ve simply felt I think that a reasonable amount would \u2014 would work again, would do the job.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Graves\u2019 attitude toward the product, coupled with his physical distress after awakening from a sound sleep, could also have been viewed by the jury as producing an instinctive reaction, resulting in Graves reaching for the baking soda, and pouring it into the glass, rather than measuring it as his grandmother had done. Evidence that plaintiff gave inconsistent testimony concerning whether the label provided had ever been read, and/or, evidence that plaintiffs conduct was so instinctive that no warning would have helped, creates sufficient facts to rebut the heeding presumption. <em>Technical Chem. Co. v. Jacobs, supra, </em>480 S.W.2d at 606; <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 485 A.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Plaintiffs, again focusing on the third jury interrogatory, argue that the trial judge erred in applying a \u201cbut for\u201d rather than a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test in his instructions concerning proximate causation relative to that question. Specifically, plaintiffs\u2019 contend that the interrogatories should have stated: \u201cWas the failure to warn a substantial factor in plaintiffs consumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Arm <em>&amp; </em>Hammer Baking Soda?\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 brief fails to point us to any particular place in the record in which that specific objection was made, nor do plaintiffs indicate where in their objections to the court\u2019s instructions this alleged shortfall was brought to the trial judge\u2019s attention. Thus, we address the issue in terms of plain error. <em>Gaido v. Weiser, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>310, 558 A.2d 845 (1989). In any event, plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that the relevancy of the substantial factor test precludes the use of the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the formulation of a jury interrogatory. The substantial factor test is but a modified standard of proximate cause which should be used to explain proximate causation in cases where the occurrence of an event is \u201cproduced by concurrent causes.\u201d <em>Scafidi v. Seiler, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>93, 109, 574 A.2d 398 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Interestingly, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the substantial factor test should have been utilized is a concession that a fact-finder could conclude under the evidence in this case that causes other than the lack of warning contributed to plaintiff\u2019s consumption of the baking soda on the night in question. Although plaintiffs do not specifically say so in their brief, the argument appears to concede that Graves\u2019 overly distended stomach, and the resulting discomfort, were at least contributing causes of his accident, and that is why the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test is appropriate. The very concept of proximate cause \u201cincludes the .notion of concurrent cause when more than one act contributes to the accidental harm.\u201d <em>Brown v. United States Stove Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>155, 171, 484 A.2d 1234 (1984). Certainly, a jury could have found on this record that Graves\u2019s distress resulting from his dysfunctional stomach caused him to ingest the baking soda, and that the absence of an adequate warning of possible stomach rupture was just one, albeit, a substantial factor, in contributing to that conduct. Thus, we agree with plaintiffs that the substantial factor test was the appropriate test of proximate causation in the context of the third jury interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On appeal, a jury charge must be reviewed in its entirety. <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422, 307 A.2d 608 (1973). In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>final analysis, it is a question of whether or not the jury was confused or mislead by the charge in its entirety. <em>Navarro v. George Koch &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 512 A.2d 507 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>48, 526 A.2d 138 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Plaintiffs cite one excerpt from the charge that they now contend shows the imposition of a \u201cbut for\u201d test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">Now, what do we mean [by proximate cause] in the context of a lack of warning case? ... [I]s it probable that such a warning would have been effective in deterring the plaintiff from the conduct, in this case, the consumption of the product in question which he claims caused his injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Plaintiffs do not specifically articulate their quarrel with the portion of the charge they quote. We assume it has to do with the use of the word \u201cprobable,\u201d which arguably invokes the standard definition of proximate cause as \u201ca cause which naturally and probably led to and might have been expected to produce the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Model Jury Charge </em>(Civil), Proximate Cause, \u00a7 7.11 (1973). Assuming that to be the case, plaintiffs, nevertheless, offer no support for the argument that the mere use of the word \u201cprobable\u201d could have interfered with the jury\u2019s function. We are not of the view that the quoted section of the charge reasonably conveyed to the jury an instruction that it could answer the question in the affirmative only if it found that Graves would not have consumed the baking soda \u201cbut for\u201d the lack of warning. As noted earlier, we must look to the charge as a whole in determining whether the jury was mislead. Immediately after the now objected to portion of the charge, the trial judge told the jury that: \u201c[b]y proximate cause we do not mean that be the only cause.\u201d Later in his instructions on the same issue he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIq\">Again whenever I say proximate cause understand there may be more than one proximate cause to any particular accident].] [S]o long [as] its a contributing factor],] to [that] extent it may indeed be a proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Finally, on this point, it is reasonable to infer that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to specifically object to the charge on the specific grounds now advanced can be taken to mean that counsel did not consider the claimed error to be significant in the context of the trial. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 333, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Plaintiffs also contend that the trial judge committed reversible error in instructing the jury to interchangeably apply both subjective and objective standards in determining whether the lack of warning was a proximate cause of plaintiffs ingesting defendant\u2019s product on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">There are different standards for different elements in such cases, as the Supreme Court stated in <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra. </em>There is an objective duty of a manufacturer to produce a defect-free product. <em>Campos, supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 485 A.2d 305; <em>cf. Johansen v. Makita USA, Inc., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>86, 102, 607 A.2d 637 (1992), (duty to manufacture a safe product exists irrespective of plaintiffs conduct). The objective duty of the manufacturer in a warning setting is best exemplified by the Legislature\u2019s recent codification of prior law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">An adequate product warning or instruction is one that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have provided with respect to the danger and that communicates adequate information on the dangers and safe use of the product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, the persons by whom the product is intended to be used[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-4.]</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">It is the subjective knowledge of the plaintiff, however, that is relevant in determining whether a breach of the manufacturer\u2019s duty is a proximate cause of the injury in question. <em>Campos supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 485 A.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In our view, the trial judge maintained that distinction in his instructions. He directed the jury first to apply a reasonable person standard to determine whether defendant\u2019s warning was adequate, and then to determine if an adequate warning would have deterred Graves specifically. Both in his original instructions to the jury on interrogatory number three, and in his supplemental instructions on that interrogatory in response to the jury\u2019s question, the trial judge necessarily had to discuss the objective standard and the subjective standard together because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>he had no idea how the jury was going to respond to interrogatory number two, which specifically addressed the objective standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Nor do we find error in the trial judge\u2019s comment to the jury that the human factors experts could not testify as to what went on in Graves\u2019 mind. The judge\u2019s statement that the best such testimony could do is inform them what the \u201cpublic at large,\u201d or those in \u201ccontrolled groups,\u201d do, was an accurate comment on the testimony offered. The trial judge did not prohibit the jury from drawing an inference from the general proposition to Graves\u2019 subjective thought process. A judge may comment on the evidence when it will assist the jury in its findings. <em>Dafler v. Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 37, 611 A.2d 136 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>601, 617 A.2d 1223 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">At trial, plaintiffs objected to the trial judge\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cthe night in question\u201d with respect to the third jury interrogatory. They argued then, as they now do on appeal, that the use of that phrase foreclosed the jury from considering the effect, if any, that an adequate warning might have had on Graves\u2019 conduct had it been placed on the product years earlier, postulating that the warning could then have been communicated to Graves through third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">There was evidence before the jury, fortified by counsels\u2019 arguments, that defendant could have and should have warned of the risk of stomach rupture many years before 1979. Dr. Cunitz, plaintiffs\u2019 human factors expert, testified that the existence of warnings over a long term have an impact on consumer expectations relative to a product\u2019s qualities. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">Well, what happens is common sense changes. That\u2019s really what it is. Had there been a warning for a good number of year\u2019s on this product, then people\u2019s common knowledge and, therefore, their common sense about the product begins to change and ultimately does change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Indeed, a jury may have reasonably inferred from this testimony, and other related testimony offered at the trial, that a warning, placed on the baking soda before 1979, may have had some impact on Graves\u2019 knowledge concerning the product\u2019s efficacy. If the jury instructions were such that the trial judge foreclosed the jury\u2019s consideration of that issue, we might agree with plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the issue of proximate causation was too narrowly focused. But our review of the instructions do not reveal any such limitation on the jury\u2019s understanding of its function in addressing that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Moreover, the words themselves do not constitute error standing alone. Clearly, plaintiffs had the burden of proving that the defect in the product\u2019s instructions and warnings, whenever that defect is considered to have existed, was a proximate cause of Graves\u2019 consumption of the product on August 22,1979. Certainly there would have been nothing wrong with the question had the trial judge placed the date of consumption in the interrogatory. Substituting the date with the phrase \u201con the night in question\u201d is a distinction without a difference. The important thing is that the judge\u2019s instructions did not limit the jury\u2019s consideration of all the evidence relevant to the subjective aspect of Graves\u2019 conduct and knowledge in determining the issue of proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge erred in dismissing their \u201cunreasonably dangerous product\u201d claim which they contend was set forth in Count IV of their complaint. We have reviewed that count of the complaint and fail to find any clear reference to such a claim. However, we shall address the issue on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Plaintiffs argue that they postulated defendant\u2019s liability on separate theories of a failure to warn, and on \u201chaving placed an unreasonably dangerous product in the market place.\u201d Their reliance upon the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d phrase is apparently based on the words of Restatement of Torts, Second, \u00a7 402A. However, that rubric has long been in disfavor in this State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 174, 406 A.2d 140 (1979). \u201cDefining the strict liability principle in terms of a defect and an unreasonably dangerous condition does not advance an understanding of the concept and will not assist a jury\u2019s comprehension of the issues which it must resolve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 406 A.2d 140. Thus, we are somewhat at a loss to understand the import of plaintiffs\u2019 argument in the context of New Jersey decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">There are but \u201cthree theories under which a manufacturer or seller may be held strictly for harm caused by a product\u2014 defective manufacture, defective design, and defective warnings[.]\u201d <em>Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 94-95, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990). This was so, before and after the New Jersey Product Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 et seq. If plaintiffs are arguing a theory, albeit mislabeled, different from their failure to warn theory, we can only assume that what they are really contending is that defendant\u2019s baking soda product is one whose risks outweigh its utility, a concept used in a design defect liability case. <em>See O\u2019Brien v. Muskin Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>169, 463 A.2d 298 (1983). However, if plaintiffs are claiming that defendant is liable under a design defect theory, their argument is factually unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Undoubtedly, there was expert evidence offered by plaintiffs from which one could infer that the ingestion of any amount of baking soda carried some risk, and that it simply should not have been marketed as an antacid. However, baking soda has other safe uses. No suggestion was made by any of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses that baking soda was a dangerous product for all purposes. No one suggested taking the product off the market. Quite simply, the resolution of the issue plaintiffs\u2019 experts posed in this narrow view of the evidence cannot be resolved in the context of the risk/utility analysis applicable to a pure design defect case, because the crux of the safety problem lies in the warning rather than the physical properties of the product itself. <em>See, Freund, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 242, 432 A.2d 925. (\u201c[Wjhere the design defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>consists of an inadequate warning as to safe use, the utility of the product, as counterbalanced against the risks of its use, is rarely at issue.\u201d) Thus we conclude that the trial judge was correct in determining that the evidence in this case created a product defect issue based on inadequate warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge erred in dismissing their causes of action based upon <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>Second, \u00a7 388 (Chattel Known to be Dangerous for Intended Use), <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>Second \u00a7 402B (Misrepresentation by Seller of Chattels to Consumer) and N.J.S.A 24:5-1, -10, -18a, and -18f (misbranding of a drug product). The trial judge held that these causes of action were essentially based on negligence principles and subsumed by strict liability. In dismissing them, the judge relied upon .this court\u2019s decision in <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 591 A.2d 643 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>390, 599 A.2d 166 (1991) which held that, even before the adoption of the Product Liability Act, our common law had progressed to the point where personal injury claims resulting from product injuries were to be pled and proved on strict liability principles, rather than on breach of implied warranty or negligence concepts. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 591 A.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Defendant contends on appeal, that the causes of action in question were the subject of amendments to interrogatories, rather than amendments to pleadings, after the New Jersey Product Liability Act became effective, and, therefore, are barred by the Act. Defendant also contends that, with respect to the New Jersey statutory cause of action, no private right of action is created by the statute because of its penal nature, or, alternatively, the statute does not apply to products which cause injuries outside of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">We will assume, for the purpose of discussion, that the New Jersey Product Liability Act did not preclude these causes of action, that the causes of action are not based on negligence, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the New Jersey statute concerning misbranding of a drug product creates a personal cause of action, and that the trial judge erred in striking the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">However, it is not sufficient simply for plaintiffs to prove that some legal error exists in the trial record. Plaintiffs are obliged to show that the legal error was \u201cof such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result[.]\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Plaintiffs utterly fail to address in their brief how a strict liability claim based upon a failure to warn differs from the three dismissed causes of action, and how those differences may have impacted on the jury\u2019s determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">It appears to us that the three theories proposed by plaintiff are simply alternative ways in which a jury might determine that the product was defective, i.e. unsafe, because of inadequate warnings. Because that is precisely what the jury found in response to the second jury interrogatory, we are at a loss to understand how plaintiffs were harmed by the consolidation of those theories into the strict liability/warning theory on which the jury was instructed. Under any theory of liability, even those excluded by the trial judge, the jury was required to determine proximate causation. Plaintiffs fail to explain how a finding in their favor on any of the excluded causes of action might have impacted on the proximate causation issue in a more favorable way. Thus, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the subject causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge improperly precluded evidence of both contemplated and actual post-accident label changes. They contend that the actual changes should have been permitted into evidence because they do not qualify as remedial changes, but, rather, reflect on the credibility of defendant in that it took the position that the baking soda could not generate enough gas to cause a rupture but subsequently changed the label to warn against such injury. With respect to the proposed but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>adopted changes, plaintiffs argue that the proposed changes show a continuing course of objectionable conduct on defendant\u2019s part, and that the proposals were therefore admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The evidence, if admitted, was clearly relevant on the question of product defect, and the fourth jury interrogatory which was not answered. Because the jury resolved the product defect issue in plaintiffs favor, the exclusion of that evidence produced no harm to plaintiff. Thus, even if the trial judge was wrong in excluding the evidence, a question we specifically do not decide, such error would not be reversible. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Plaintiffs contend that if the third jury interrogatory was properly submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration, its verdict in response to the question is against the weight of the evidence. However, plaintiffs\u2019 argument focuses on the question of product defect, a question that was resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor when the jury answered the second interrogatory. The question addressed in number three was whether, even if the proper warning had been placed on the product, such warning would have been a substantial factor in preventing Graves\u2019 consumption of it, and the resulting harm. Plaintiffs fail to analyze the evidence on that issue toward a conclusion that reasonable minds could not differ on the subject as required by <em>R. </em>2:10-1. As indicated earlier in this opinion, we conclude that a genuine fact issue was presented on the proximate cause issue. The jury\u2019s resolution of that issue against plaintiffs has a factual basis in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-12\"> References herein to \u201cGraves\u201d or \u201cplaintiff\u201d is to William Graves.

The issue is not, however, being disputed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-12\"> We do not address the issues necessarily in the same order as they were raised by plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\"> We note that <em>Evid.R. </em>301, now effective in this State, is consistent with our rulings concerning the effect of a rebuttable presumption in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b495-12\"> The amount plaintiff actually <em>consumed </em>was approximately three times the recommended dose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
