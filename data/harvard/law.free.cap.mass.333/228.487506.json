It was \u201craining very hard.\u201d The \u201cfloor was very wet.\u201d After looking at a cocoanut display the plaintiff' \u2018 took four or five steps to the rear of the store . . ., all of a sudden, she stepped on something and slid . . . she stepped on something slippery ... it was slipperier than the floor.\u201d In March, 1954, the plaintiff went back to look at the floor. At \u201cthe exact spot\u201d where she fell she \u201cfound a piece of tin that was nailed to the floor.\u201d The foregoing was the testimony of the plaintiff, who, so far as the record discloses, was the only witness. It was agreed at the trial that from the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury there had been no physical changes in the floor. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s only exception is to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">The defendant contends that there is nothing to indicate negligence on his part, and that the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s fall is a matter of conjecture. We cannot agree. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>could find that on a rainy day, when the floor was wet, at the exact spot of the fall a piece of tin was nailed to the floor; that the piece of tin in conjunction with wetness was slipperier than the floor; that the defendant was negligent in maintaining the floor in such a condition; and that this condition was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s fall. There was nothing to warrant, much less to require, a finding that the plaintiff slipped upon a foreign substance of unknown nature or origin which had become superimposed on the piece of tin. The case in general is governed by <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>266 Mass. 12, <em>Correira </em>v. <em>Atlantic Amusement Co. Inc. </em>302 Mass. 81, and <em>Berube </em>v. <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>315 Mass. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
