Hagerty holds an execution against the defendant Myers, his employer, for injuries received on June 10, 1950, by the negligent operation of an automobile on a private way in this Commonwealth. The plaintiff James R. Hagerty, father of Lawrence, who was a minor when hurt, holds a judgment against the defendant Myers for consequential damages. The defendant Merchants Mutual Casualty Company issued a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance to the defendant Myers. In this suit in equity to reach and apply the obligation of the defendant company under the said policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>there was a final decree ordering the defendant company to pay the judgments within the policy limits. The defendant company appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The case was heard on agreed facts. The plaintiff Lawrence was one of three employees of the defendant Myers, who was not required to have workmen\u2019s compensation insurance, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 369, and in fact had none. The motor vehicle policy under coverage B included optional coverage for \u201cA person who is other than a guest occupant . . . while upon or off the ways of the Commonwealth.\u201d The policy contained exclusion clauses, one of which was (f), providing that the policy did not apply \u201cunder coverages B and D, to bodily injury to or sickness, disease or death of any employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured or in domestic employment if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contention, which was apparently adopted by the court below, is that \u201cThe proper construction of the exclusion clause (f) is to exclude from the coverages under the policy the injuries of any employee of the insured while engaged in the employment of the insured if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d In order to arrive at this meaning, it would be necessary to give no weight whatsoever to the words \u201cother than domestic\u201d and \u201cin domestic employment\u201d and to treat their use as utterly pointless. \u201cIt is an elementary rule in the interpretation of contracts that whenever reasonably practicable every word shall be given effect.\u201d <em>Rocci </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co. </em>222 Mass. 336, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Our interpretation of the exclusion clause (f) is that the policy does not cover employees who are not domestic employees, and even in the case of domestic employees the policy does not apply where benefits are payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law. There was some point in drawing a distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>domestic employees and other employees. On the date of the accident domestic employees were not required to be covered by workmen\u2019s compensation. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 369. <em>Sjostedt </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>306 Mass. 344, 345. Their inclusion within the workmen\u2019s compensation law was not achieved until the enactment of St. 1953, c. 656. It was reasonable to make a distinction between employees who had the benefits of the elimination of the employer\u2019s defences in tort cases by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 66, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9A, and employees who did not. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 67, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 10; <em>Pell </em>v. <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Electric Light Co. </em>325 Mass. 239, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">It follows that the final decree must be reversed, and a new final decree is to be entered dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
