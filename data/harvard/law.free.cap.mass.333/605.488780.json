The board had ruled that the claim made was res judicata because it related to a period of disability and a heart condition theretofore \u201cconsidered and passed upon by a single member, a reviewing board and the Superior Court,\u201d and had dismissed the claim without hearing the case. The employee contends that a new cause of the injury is alleged and that the prior finding and proceedings did not foreclose his showing that his admitted heart condition arose from a cause different from that specified when claim was previously made for the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We do not get to that point or to the issue of whether the decree appealed from was correct. That decree is interlocutory. \"... [jA]n appeal from an interlocutory matter cannot be entered in this court, except by report of the judge, until there is a final decree.\u201d <em>McCracken\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 347, 350. <em>Pereira\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 774. <em>Keohane\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 487.
