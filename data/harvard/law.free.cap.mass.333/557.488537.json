The plaintiff had a verdict and the case comes here on the defendants\u2019 exceptions. Many questions have been argued by the defendants but only two, which relate to rulings on evidence, are open on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">1. While testifying with respect to plumbing and heating work done for the defendants, the plaintiff was shown \u201cnine sheets of written records\u201d which he stated were \u201crecord[sJ kept ... in the usual course of business.\u201d He further testified that these records were kept under his supervision and showed the \u201cmaterials and labor that went into the job.\u201d \u201cThe plaintiff then offered these alleged records in' as evidence, to which the defendants objected. The plaintiff . . . testified that he had the originals in court.\u201d The judge \u201cadmitted the alleged copies in evidence\u201d subject to the defendants\u2019 exception. There was no error. These records were plainly admissible under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 78, if the preliminary findings required by the statute were made by the trial judge. Where, as here, nothing to the contrary appears, the admission of the records implies a finding of the facts prerequisite to their admission. <em>Bendett </em>v. <em>Bendett, </em>315 Mass. 59, 62. <em>Sellew </em>v. <em>Tuttle\u2019s Millinery Inc. </em>319 Mass. 368, 371. The defendants argue that evidence admitted consisted of copies of the records rather than originals and hence violated the best evidence rule. But we do not so interpret the record. We think that a fair construction of the record is that the sheets introduced were not copies of the plaintiff\u2019s records but were the actual records themselves. To be sure, they undoubtedly contained entries that were transcribed from other records, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that sense they might be said to be copies. But that did not render the records inadmissible under \u00a7 78. On the contrary, that section expressly provides that the \u201centry, writing or record\u201d shall be admissible notwithstanding the fact that \u201cit is transcribed . . . hearsay or self-serving.\u201d The statute goes on to provide that the court, in its discretion, before admitting the record may require the party offering it to produce the original \u201centry, writing, document or account\u201d from which the record was transcribed. We are of opinion that when the plaintiff stated that \u201che had the originals in court\u201d he was merely showing a readiness to satisfy the provision of the statute just referred to if called upon to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">2. It appeared that the house on which the plaintiff furnished labor and materials was one in a larger tract which the defendants were developing. The defendant Edward Cohen during his direct examination was asked \u201chow much it cost him to improve this property\u201d and the question was excluded subject to the defendants\u2019 exception. The defendants argue that this would tend to establish the value of the development and that they were entitled to show this under their answer in recoupment in proving the damage sustained by them by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged breach of contract. There was no error. It is difficult to see how this evidence was relevant in an action to recover for labor and materials furnished with respect to a particular house. Moreover, the defendants have not shown how they were harmed by the ruling, for they made no offer of proof. <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>Lewis Furniture Co. </em>292 Mass. 500, 504. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Granito, 326 Mass. 494, 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
