One (No. 47282) charged robbery of a wallet from the person of Ronald Rader. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 265, \u00a7 19. The second (No. 47283) alleged that the defendant entered the dwelling house of George A. Rader in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny, and that, after so entering with such intent, he assaulted Ronald Rader and Donna Craddock. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 266, \u00a7 14. The third (No. 47284) alleged that the defendant, with intent to commit larceny, confined and put in fear Ronald Rader and Donna Craddock for the purpose of stealing in the dwelling house of George A. Rader. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 21. The defendant, while represented by counsel, retracted his pleas and pleaded guilty to the three indictments. He was sentenced to the State prison for three concurrent terms not exceeding twelve years or less than ten years, and was notified in open court of bis right to appeal to the appellate division of the Superior Corut for a review of the sentences under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 28A-28D, inserted by St. 1943, c. 558, \u00a7 1, as amended. He did not so appeal. He did, however, file these appeals under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7 33B, as appearing in St. 1954, c. 187, \u00a7 1. The punishment for the offence charged in the second indictment (No. 47283) is \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of not less than ten years.\u201d The punishment for the other two offences is \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years. \u201d As the defendant could not be sentenced for a term of less than ten years on the second indictment, there could be shown no error in the sentence. The defendant\u2019s plea of guilty admitted all facts well charged in the indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>115 Mass. 151. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crapo, </em>212 Mass. 209. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>304 Mass. 268, 270. Further, he made no objection and took no exception of any kind. Accordingly, no question of law is presented for our consideration. If the defendant has any complaint, he cannot raise a question of law for the first time in a brief filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
