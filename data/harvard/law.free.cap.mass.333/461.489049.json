The actions were tried to a jury with three similar actions brought by the same plaintiffs against Three Springs Fisheries Company. There were verdicts for the defendants in all the cases, the verdicts in the instant cases being returned by orders of the court. The cases are here on the respective exceptions of the plaintiffs to these orders and to an evidential ruling made during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The actions arose out of a collision of automobiles on the so called Worcester Turnpike in the town of Northboro on the night of May 22, 1948. The plaintiffs were occupants of an automobile driven by the plaintiff Charles Palm, which at the time of the collision was proceeding on the right of the road in the direction of Boston. A truck alleged to have been operated by Kulesza passed the Palm automobile on its left and in passing swerved or cut in to the right and struck it, thereby causing it to collide with another automobile. The truck continued along the road without stopping. The plaintiffs were injured and the automobile in which they were riding was damaged. The plaintiff Emma Palm testified that as the truck passed she saw its number plate and that it bore a Massachusetts registration number A-8127. After a bench conference at which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney offered to show that she had a conversation with the defendant Kulesza on the Monday following the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>dent he asked her, \u201cyou talked with this defendant . . . on what day?\u201d She answered, \u201cMonday.\u201d She was asked, \u201cThat is Monday following the . . . accident?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s attorney objected. The judge said, \u201cWait a minute. I think [addressing the plaintiff\u2019s attorney], you should establish where this conservation took place.\u201d To the next question, \u201cWas this a telephone conversation you had?\u201d she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d She was then asked, \u201cNow, you tell us what you said and what the defendant Kulesza said.\u201d On objection the question was excluded and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney excepted, after making the following offer of proof: \u201cthe plaintiff said to this defendant that she was injured in an accident the previous Saturday, and that she had the registration number of the truck, Mass. A-8127, and asked Kulesza if he was operating a truck bearing that number on Saturday evening in Westboro, and he said that he did. The defendant said that he was operating that truck, and Mrs. Palm then said, 'Well, why didn\u2019t you stop\u2019 and Mr. Kulesza said he didn\u2019t know that he had hit anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">There was adequate ground for the exclusion of the question. So far as the record discloses the evidence was offered against both Kulesza and Three Springs Fisheries Company. Plainly it was not admissible against Three Springs Fisheries Company. <em>Ouellette </em>v. <em>Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc. </em>321 Mass. 390, 394, and cases cited. In the absence of any limitation on the offer by the proponent it was proper for the court to reject it. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Hoyle, </em>4 Gray, 568, 571. Where evidence is excluded upon a general objection, the ruling will be upheld on appeal by the proponent if any ground existed for the exclusion. It will be assumed that the ruling was based upon the right ground. <em>Tooley </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>70 N. Y. 34. <em>Luckenbach </em>v. <em>Sciple, </em>43 Vroom, 476. <em>Prouty Lumber &amp; Box Co. </em>v. <em>Cogan, </em>101 Ore. 382. <em>Feore </em>v. <em>Trammel, </em>213 Ala. 293. McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 52, page 118. Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 18, page 338. Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence (3d ed.) by Leach and McNaughton, page 38. The rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>different where a general objection is overruled. See <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Dabrowski, </em>295 Mass. 358. There was evidence that the registration number A-8127 had been issued to Three Springs Fisheries Company but no evidence other than the alleged statement of Kulesza tending to identify him as the operator of the truck. Verdicts in his favor were properly ordered in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
