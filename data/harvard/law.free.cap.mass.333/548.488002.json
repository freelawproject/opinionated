It was agreed that if the plaintiff was entitled to full recovery the balance due on the account was $1,062.29 and of this amount $647.72 represented the sale of cigarettes. The defendant contends that the plaintiff violated G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 64C, \u00a7 14 (a), inserted by St. 1945, c. 547, \u00a7 1, by selling cigarettes to him at less than cost, and that under \u00a7 17 the sale is void. The formula for determining \u201ccost to the wholesaler\u201d is stated in \u00a7 13 (c). Such cost is said to mean the invoice cost to him or the replacement cost within thirty days prior to the sale to the retailer whichever is lower, less trade discounts except customary discounts for cash and with the addition of certain overhead costs and expenses. There was evidence that when payments were made on account by the defendant \u201che was either given in cash an amount representing five cents a carton on cigarettes purchased or given credit for such an amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The trial judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for a ruling that \u201cAs a matter of law, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the plaintiff has violated the provisions of \u00a7 14, c. 64C of the General Laws,\u201d and found for the plaintiff in the amount of $414.57, which was the balance of the plaintiff\u2019s account after deducting the charge for cigarettes. On report to the Appellate Division it was ordered that the finding be vacated and a finding entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,062.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The report stated that it contained all the evidence material to the questions raised. The only evidence respecting the cost of the cigarettes to the plaintiff was a copy of a document entitled \u201cWholesalers\u2019 Price List\u201d which contained a list of manufacturers\u2019 prices per thousand for different brands of cigarettes and a list of the prices \u201cwholesale delivered \u201d per carton for the same brands. Under the lists appeared the words, \u201cThe above minimum wholesale prices of cigarettes established by me as of March 3, 1953, are in compliance with \u00a7 13, ch. 64C, Cigarette Excise Law. [Signed3 Henry F. Long Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">As the commissioner had no authority to fix prices at which cigarettes were to be sold at wholesale <em>(Commissioner of Corporations </em>&amp; <em>Taxation </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>323 Mass. 154, 157), and the lists of prices did not purport to be the result of a cost survey of the trade referred to in \u00a7 20, we think that the document must be construed as a statement of the commissioner\u2019s findings respecting the minimum prices generally charged by manufacturers and wholesalers of cigarettes on or about March 3, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The lists did not purport to state the cost to the plaintiff of the cigarettes ascertained in accordance with \u00a7 13 (c). If it could be inferred that the plaintiff paid for any of the listed brands of cigarettes the amounts which are stated to have been the manufacturers\u2019 minimum prices, there is nothing in the record to indicate what brands were sold to the defendant. All that appears is that the latter purchased cigarettes at a price of $647.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The plaintiff was entitled to the requested ruling and to a finding in its favor for the amount of the agreed balance. There was no error in the order of the Appellate Division that such finding be entered. By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 110, the Appellate Division has power, similar to that granted to the Supreme Judicial Court under \u00a7 124, to direct entry of judgment where it is \u201csatisfied that it has before it all the facts necessary for determining the question in dispute.\u201d <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Warwick Stores, Inc. </em>329 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>406, 409. Since the report contained all the evidence bearing upon the issue presented by the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s requested ruling and such evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that the cigarettes were sold in contravention of the statute, there was no occasion to remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
