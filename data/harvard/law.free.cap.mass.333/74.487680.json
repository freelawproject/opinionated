[it] relies in support of its allegation in said indictment of distribution, sale, exhibition, and circulation to persons under the age of eighteen years, of certain books, pamphlets, printed matter, and other things obscene, indecent, and impure.\u201d In response, the Commonwealth specified as follows: \u201cThe exhibition for perusal and sale in an open book rack prominently displayed in the store and the sale of this and other books without restriction or limitation at twenty-five cents to any would-be purchaser. \u201d The book involved was \u201cDuke\u201d by Hal Ellson. The case was tried to a judge who found that the story was one which manifestly tended to corrupt the morals of youth and that \u201cthis defendant had in its possession this book for the purpose of sale, exhibition, loan or circulation to the general public including a person under the age of eighteen years. \u201d He found the defendant guilty and imposed a fine. The case comes here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to certain rulings made by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">One Verville, a police woman employed by the city of Fall River and whose age was thirty-three years, testified that on June 16, 1950, she entered the Hande Shoppe in that city, where books and papers are sold at retail, and purchased a copy of \u201cDuke\u201d from Miss Cash, a clerk employed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Miss Cash, called by the Commonwealth, testified as follows: The book in question was displayed on a rack which was installed in the store by one Shea who was \u201cconnected with the American News Company.\u201d The books were \u201cplaced on the racks by the man who delivered them\u201d; the \u201cstorekeeper had nothing to do with that.\u201d The book \u201cDuke\u201d was \u201csupplied by the American News Company and was on the American News rack.\u201d She was given \u201cno instructions ... as to whom these books should be sold.\u201d Books of this sort sold for twenty-five cents. Ordinarily a customer would come into the store and pick out the book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>he wanted and pay for it, and that is what happened in the sale of \u201cDuke\u201d to the police woman. After books were delivered to the store by a distributor they were charged to the store and were \u201cthe store\u2019s books ... to do with as they pleased and the American News Company had nothing further to do with them.\u201d \u201cThe American News did not control in any way what the witness or the Hande Shoppe did with the books after they were purchased by the Shoppe.\u201d The witness had \u201cno business connection of any kind with the defendant.\u201d The owner of the store, Mrs. Lang, took care of ordering and paying for the books. Most of the customers who came to the store were \u201call grown up but there were children under eighteen who did purchase books\u201d there.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">One Brereton, a police officer, testified that the defendant\u2019s place of business was a \u201cwholesale establishment\u201d from which books were sold and distributed to retail stores and that there was no evidence of any retail sales there.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The indictment was based on G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 272, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 278, \u00a7 1, of which the portions here material are, \u201cWhoever sells or distributes ... to a person under the age of eighteen years a book . . . which is obscene, indecent or impure, or manifestly tends to corrupt the morals of youth, or . . . receives or has in his possession any such book ... for the purpose of sale, exhibition, loan or circulation to a person under the age of eighteen years . . . shall ... be punished . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Several offences are embraced in the statute. But reading, as we must, the indictment with the specifications <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>307 Mass. 239, 243), we think that the defendant was charged in effect with having in its possession a book which was obscene, indecent, and impure, and manifestly tended to corrupt the morals of youth, for the purpose of sale, exhibition, and circulation to a person under the age of eighteen years. Under this charge the defendant coukTbe found guilty if it had in'its possession for the purpose of sale, exhibition or circulation to a person under the age of eighteen years (1) an obscene, indecent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>and impure book or (2) one which manifestly tends to corrupt the morals of youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">At the close of the evidence the defendant presented several requests for rulings. Among those denied were requests 1 and 11 which read: \u201c1. The evidence does not warrant a finding of guilty.\u201d \u201c11. The Commonwealth has failed as a matter of law to adduce facts sufficient to constitute the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charge contained in the indictment.\u201d We are of opinion that the judge erred in denying these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In its motion for particulars the defendant asked thCommonwealth to state \u201cThe date or dates and time or times of day when the said offence or offences are alleged to have been committed.\u201d The Commonwealth specified that \u201cThe time was within the three months next preceding June 16, 1950, at 2:30 p.m.\u201d This specification was not amended under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 277, \u00a7 40, which provides for such amendment where there is a material variance between the evidence and the bill of particulars. Thus the specification affected the indictment and restricted the proof to the matters specified. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>1 Gray, 466. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>247 Mass. 16, 19. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>282 Mass. 401, 412. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>307 Mass. 239, 243. The Commonwealth, therefore, was obliged to prove that at some time within this period the defendant possessed the book in question for the purpose of sale, exhibition, or circulation to a person under the age of eighteen years. But possession of the book by the defendant within this period was not established. All that appears in the record is that prior to the sale of the book to the Hande Shoppe the defendant had possession of the book. When the sale to the Hande Shoppe was made does not appear. It is true that in June of 1950 employees of the defendant \u201cbrought books to the store and put them on the floor or in the racks that were there.\u201d But there is no evidence that the book in question was one of these books. The proof did not conform to the indictment as amplified by the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Because of what has been said it is not necessary to decide whether the judge's finding that the book in question manifestly tended to corrupt the morals of youth was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
