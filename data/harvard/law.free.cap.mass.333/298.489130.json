L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 271, \u00a7 7, the material part of which reads, \u201cWhoever sets up or promotes a lottery for money or other property of value, or by way of lottery disposes of any property of value, or under the pretext of a sale, gift or delivery of other property or of any right, privilege or thing whatever disposes of or offers or attempts to dispose of any property, with intent to make the disposal thereof dependent upon or connected with chance by lot . . . shall be punished by a fine . . . .\u201d A jury found the defendant guilty and he was sentenced to pay a fine. The case comes here upon the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict of not guilty. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The alleged lottery was carried on through the instrumentality of a so called \u201cpinball machine\u201d which was licensed under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 140, \u00a7 177A, inserted by St. 1949, c. 361, the material parts of which, so far as this complaint is concerned, read: \u201c(6) No person keeping or offering for operation or allowing to be kept or offered for operation any automatic amusement device licensed under this section shall permit the same to be used for the purpose of gambling. (7) The provisions of section seven of chapter two hundred and seventy-one of the General Laws shall not apply to machines licensed under the provisions of this section. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">There was evidence that on December 2, 1952, the defendant was employed in a store in Fairhaven which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>owned by his brother. In the store there were two \u201cpinball \u201d machines which were played by the insertion of a nickel for one game. The record does not disclose how but in some circumstances the player won what is called a \u201cfree game.\u201d On the day in question two State police officers, who were presumably in plain clothes, entered the store and after ordering coffee and sandwiches from the defendant one of them started to play the machine. He got nickels with which to play, in exchange for other money, from the defendant who took them from a cigar box under the counter. He played the machine for about half an hour and spent about $3.60 in nickels.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">He won twenty-four \u201cfree games\u201d which showed up on the machine and then he \u201cplayed off\u201d four of them leaving twenty \u201cfree games\u201d showing. He directed the attention of the defendant to these games and asked him for $1. The defendant gave him $1 and then signalled someone who pulled a lever on the machine which released the showing of the \u201cfree games.\u201d There was also evidence that the results of playing the pinball machine and the winning of \u201cfree games\u201d depended almost entirely on chance. The defendant denied that the officer asked him for $1 for the twenty \u201cfree games.\u201d He admitted that he gave him $1 because he thought he had made a mistake in making change for him earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On this evidence the jury could find that the officer had won $1 upon a game of chance so that they were warranted in returning a verdict of guilty. This court has said, \u201cThere are three elements in a lottery, (1) the payment of a price for (2) the possibility of winning a prize, depending upon (3) hazard or chance\u201d and \u201cby the weight of authority a game is now considered a lottery if the element of chance predominates . . ..\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>317 Mass. 264, 267, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>323 Mass. 379, 381, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The defendant argues that c. 271, \u00a7 7, does not apply to machines such as we have here which were licensed under c. 140, \u00a7 177A, and he relies upon paragraph 7 of \u00a7 177A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>which appears to say just that. Section 177A was apparently enacted shortly after the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>which was decided on November 3, 1948, and held that the \u201cfree games\u201d functions of the machine constituted a prize or in the language of c. 271, \u00a7 7, \u201cproperty of value.\u201d We believe that \u00a7 177A which was enacted on May 27, 1949, to become operative ninety days thereafter, was enacted for the purpose of permitting the use and maintenance of automatic amusement devices such as pinball machines, including \u201cfree play\u201d pinball machines, if duly licensed and if used for amusement only.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In this connection it is important to note that paragraph 6 of \u00a7 177A provides that \u201cNo person keeping or offering for operation or allowing to be kept or offered for operation any automatic amusement device licensed under this section shall permit the same to be used for the purpose of gambling.\u201d There is no doubt that if the officer received nothing more of value than \u201cfree games\u201d there would have been no violation of c. 271, \u00a7 7. But in the case at bar there was evidence that the officer who played the game received money for his success and this if believed by the jury plainly constituted a violation of c. 271, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">We believe that if the Legislature intended to modify the effect of c. 271, \u00a7 7, as has been repeatedly stated in our decisions, it would have done so in express terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
