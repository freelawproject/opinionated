The judge directed a verdict for the defendant. At the time of the trial the records of registrations for the year 1949 had been destroyed by the registry of motor vehicles. The plaintiff argues two exceptions, both to the exclusion of evidence offered on her behalf to prove ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel testified on direct examination that on December 10, 1949, he had written a letter, which he identified, to the registrar of motor vehicles, and that he had \u201creceived back\u201d the letter with interlined answers to questions as to the ownership and description of an automobile with the registration number 225262 and bearing a date stamp at the top \u201cDec 12 1949\u201d and another stamp \u201cRegistry of Motor Vehicles\u201d at the bottom. These answers did not have the support of any witness qualified to say that they represented the contents of the original records. <em>Silverstein </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>165 Mass. 512. <em>Shachoy </em>v. <em>Chevrolet Motor Co. </em>280 Mass. 442, 445-446. See Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1277; 10 A. L. R. (2d) 1037. The answers constituted hearsay and did not fall within any recognized exception. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>133 Mass. 439, 440-441. <em>Runels </em>v. <em>Lowell Sun Co. </em>318 Mass. 466, 470. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>324 Mass. 478, 485. The letter with the interlineations obviously was not among the records which the registrar is required by statute to keep. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, as amended; \u00a7 30; \u00a7 34I, as appearing in St. 1949; c. 571, \u00a7 7. It was not admissible as a public record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 417. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>300 Mass. 62, 70. <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>321 Mass. 240, 252. If it be assumed that the letter was \u201creceived back\u201d by mail, there is nothing in the well accepted doctrine of <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Bradish, </em>14 Mass. 296, 300, see Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 2153, which will overcome the fatal objections to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The other exception to the exclusion of a question put to an officer of Auto List, Inc., as to what the printed registrations published by that corporation for the year 1949 would show for the name under registration number 225262 discloses no error, one reason being the absence of an offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
