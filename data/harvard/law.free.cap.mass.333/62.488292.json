The petitioner, which is a distributor of motion pic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ture films and the owner of distribution rights in two specified films, brings this petition for a writ of certiorari to quash the action of the respondent in failing to approve in writing the films for exhibition on the Lord\u2019s day pursuant to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was reserved and reported without decision by a single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The respondent contends that the only action of his which is here brought into question relates to a mere advisory opinion as to what may be expected in the future. It is suggested that the application contemplated by the statute is one by the particular theatre which intends to exhibit a particular film on a particular Sunday. However that may be, we think that it would be hardly worth while to decide this procedural question. In the <em>Brattle Films </em>case we have decided that \u00a7 4 is unconstitutional as applied to the facts in that case. That is enough to dispose of the merits of this matter for all practical purposes. It is not to be assumed that the respondent, who is a public officer and a defendant in the <em>Brattle Films </em>case, will not carry out his duty under the law. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Co-Ray Realty Co.
