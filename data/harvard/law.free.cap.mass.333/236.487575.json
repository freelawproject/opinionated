The employee saw no other physician and returned to work the next day. In the summer of 1953 his back began to bother him again. In January, 1954, he did some snow shoveling and used a power saw. The employer on January 26, 1954, hired a plumber to do some work about a sink and requested the employee to help the plumber.' The employee spent the day acting as the plumber\u2019s helper, and most of the time was spent in working \u201cin a bent over and crouched position.\u201d He was bent down under the sink all day and his back was aching \u201cEke anything.\u201d He was then disabled from working until April 28, 1954. It is for this period that compensation is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">A back strain connected with employment and resulting in incapacity is a compensable injury. <em>Jarvis\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 305. The strain need not result from unusual force or exertion. Stooping down or bending over in the performance of work which results in disabling one from continuing with his duties is sufficient basis for a decree for the payment of compensation. <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113. <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>It is hardly disputed that the employee is entitled to compensation, but the question is whether the insurer on the risk in 1950 or the one on the risk in 1954 is the one which should pay compensation. Only one insurer is chargeable for the same disability. <em>Donahue\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 239, 241. <em>Mizrahi\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 733, 736. Here there was evidence from a physician that he did not regard the happening of April 24, 1950, as significant, and that he would not go so far as to say that the incident of January 26, 1954, was related to anything that took place on April 24, 1950. The board was not in error in finding that the employee sustained an injury on January 26, 1954, while helping the plumber, and that he was thereafter immediately disabled until April 28, 1954. The board followed the usual rule \u201cthat where there are successive insurers, chargeability for the whole compensation rests upon the one covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relation to the disability.\u201d <em>Tassone\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 545, 547. <em>Morin\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 310, 312. <em>Rock\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 428, 429. <em>Peters\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 188. <em>Fitzpatrick\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 298, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The objection to the dependency payment of $2.50 a week to the employee\u2019s mother is argued neither orally nor in the brief and we consider it waived. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>298 Mass. 346, 355. Reasonable costs of attorney\u2019s fees, briefs and other necessary expenses for the appeal which was taken only by one of the insurers are to be allowed by a single justice to the employee under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
