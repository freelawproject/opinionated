L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152 to Margaret M. Hamel for the death of her husband George E. Hamel, Junior. The uncontroverted evidence before the Industrial Accident Board was that Hamel was employed by the Federal Tea Co., Inc., as a house to house salesman. In making his calls he was authorized to use his employer\u2019s truck and to keep it at his home in Haverhill. His hours of employment were from 9 a.m. until his calls were completed. At the time of his death on April 13, 1954, he had been on his regular route and was on his way home at night after making a business call. While driving from Amesbury to Haverhill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the truck overturned and he was killed. It could have been found from other evidence that at the time he was operating at an excessive speed. The single member found that \u201cUpon the aforesaid evidence\u201d the injury which resulted in the employee\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment. The reviewing board adopted the findings and decision of the single member.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The injury to the employee was not compensable under that portion of the act which provides compensation for injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d but was compensable under the provision as to injury to an employee \u201carising out of an ordinary risk of the street while actually engaged, with his employer\u2019s authorization, in the business affairs or undertakings of his employer.\u201d <em>Harvey\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 300, 304. Although as in that case the ground on which the board and the judge of the Superior Court awarded compensation was untenable, the result reached was right. \u201cThe facts which must necessarily have been found by the board in reaching the conclusion that the employee was, at the time of the accident, in the position of an \u2018employee\u2019 also support the conclusion, that the circumstances required to create the right to compensation for an injury arising out of the risk of the street existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The insurer contends that the case should be remanded to the board for a subsidiary finding as to the conduct of the employee and that if found to have been driving at an unreasonable speed his injuries must, as matter of law, be held to have been caused by a condition not contemplated by the terms of his employment. Ordinarily, in a compensation case, subsidiary findings are required in order that the reviewing court may determine whether the ultimate finding was based upon correct principles of law. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 735. But in this case we think no further findings are necessary. See <em>Cahill\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 538. It sufficiently appears that the employee, while engaged in the business affairs of his employer, received fatal injuries arising from a risk of the street. The statute does not restrict risks of this character to those which are not extraordinary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>unusual. <em>Higgins\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 345, 350. See <em>Egan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 11. Nor does it bar compensation where the employee\u2019s conduct is negligent. <em>Lazarz\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 538. Even if guilty of serious and wilful misconduct his dependents, if otherwise entitled, could receive compensation (\u00a727).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Costs under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
