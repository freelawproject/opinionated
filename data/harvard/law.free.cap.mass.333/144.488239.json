There was a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted to the denial of a motion, presented at the conclusion of the evidence, for a directed verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">There was evidence that, while a customer in the tavern, the plaintiff was injured by an assault committed by another customer, one Owen Cadden or Cadigan. The plaintiff was in the tavern for a short time at about 5:30 p.m. He noticed Cadden with others standing at the bar drinking beer and that they were boisterous and talking loudly. He returned to the tavern at about 9:45 p.m. and was seated at a table drinking beer. John Cadden, a brother of Owen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>approached the table and made an explosive noise with a cellophane cigarette wrapper. After a remonstrance by the plaintiff John joined some friends of his at the bar. Owen was in the group, which consisted of five or six persons, and they laughed and \u201cseemed to get a kick out of it.\u201d The group at the bar \u201cwere antagonizing the people who were watching the ball game [on television^ by fooling around, howling, and being quite boisterous.\u201d In about fifteen minutes Owen who \u201clooked as if he was under the weather or intoxicated\u201d came to the table where the plaintiff was then seated with one Smitty and said, \u201cI understand you want to throw my brother out.\u201d Owen then tipped over the table and chair and knocked over the plaintiff and Smitty. He gave the plaintiff a kick. The plaintiff received a broken leg. Owen ran out and the plaintiff called the police. He said to Charles Tarquinio, president of the defendant corporation, who was present, \u201cCharlie . . . my leg is broke.\u201d Tarquinio said, \u201cThat fellow\u2019s been giving me and my bartender . . . trouble all day.\u201d The plaintiff said, \u201cWhat did you serve him for?\u201d and Tarquinio replied, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have served him.\u201d Before this action was brought Smitty, who is now dead, told the plaintiff that \u201cCadigan was there . . . drinking ... all day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The plaintiff was in the tavern as a business visitor at the invitation of the defendant and it was the latter\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care for his safety. The jury could find that Owen was in such a condition due to protracted drinking that he had become a nuisance to other customers and was likely to engage in some altercation similar to that which occurred at the time the plaintiff was injured. They could also find that Tarquinio and the bartender knew of Owen\u2019s condition and that reasonable regard for the safety of others required either that he be excluded from the tavern or restrained in some manner prior to the assault. There was evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. See <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Bancroft Hotel Corp. </em>313 Mass. 56; <em>Fortier </em>v. <em>Hibernian Building Association of Boston Highlands, </em>315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Mass. 446; <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Operating Co.

Compare <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>316 Mass. 615; <em>Addison </em>v. <em>Green Cafe, Inc. 323 </em>Mass. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">No question of the plaintiff\u2019s due care is presented and the defendant\u2019s motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
