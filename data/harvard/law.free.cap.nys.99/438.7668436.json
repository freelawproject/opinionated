Frear, 107 App. Div. 571, 95 N. Y. Supp. 321, this court recently took occasion to refer to the rule governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>power of the County Court to reverse justices\u2019 judgments and grant new trials. There the presiding justice wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\u201cThe jurisdiction o\u00a3 the County Court to review the decision upon the facts, and to determine the weight of the evidence, was conferred by the amendment of section 3063 of the Code of Civil Procedure, effected by chapter 553, p. 1277, of the Laws of 1900. Prior to that amendment, the power to reverse the judgment as against the weight of evidence where the evidence was conflicting did not exist at all. Halsey v. Hart, 85 Hun, 46, 32 N. Y. Supp. 665; Ludlum v. Couch, 10 App. Div. 603, 42 N. Y. Supp. 370; City of Brooklyn v. B. C. &amp; N. R. Co., 11 App. Div. 168, 42 N. Y. Supp. 371; Norton v. Arvernam Co., 14 App. Div. 581, 584, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1099; Clark v. Daniels 29 App. Div. 600, 51 N. Y. Supp. 177. While the amendment referred to undoubtedly did confer the power, it was held by the Appellate Division in the Third Department, in Murtagh v. Dempsey, 85 App. Div. 204. 83 N. Y. Supp. 296, that the authority so conferred should be exercised only when the justice\u2019s judgment is so plainly against the weight and preponderance of proof that it can be seen that the justice could not reasonably have arrived at the decision which he made. And this court, in the very recent decision of Von Der Born v. Schultz, 104 App. Div. 94, 93 N. Y. Supp. 547, held that where the evidence given in an action tried before a jury is so evenly balanced that reasonable men might differ as to the inferences to be drawn therefrom, and such evidence i\u00a3 fairly submitted to the jury, the trial court should not, in the exercise of its discretion, set aside the verdict as against the weight \u00f3f evidence. The rule, of course, is to be applied only with a due regard to the demands of justice in each case, and on giving full allowance to the interest and partnership of witnesses, and the qualifying effects of the ever-varying conditions of time, place, and circumstance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Tested by this rule, we are of opinion that the County Court should not have reversed the judgment of the justice in this case. The plaintiff was a corporation, engaged in the city of New York in the manufacture of clothing. The defendant was a resident of Nassau county, and had been in the business of taking orders for clothing and having them made by the plaintiff, and had dealt thus for about a year prior to the 2d day of <em>July, 1904. As </em>his evidence is printed in the record, Fyfe, the plaintiff\u2019s manager, merely testifies that defendant admitted to him that he had received certain goods; \u201cthat they were of the value of-costs, $125.50.\u201d He then testifies that the action is for $120.34, and that $5 has been credited to him on goods returned.. A bill was then received in evidence marked \u201cExhibit for plaintiff,\u201d which Fyfe testified was a correct statement of goods sold and delivered during the period of the business relations betwen the parties; but such an exhibit does not appear printed. Hockstin, who was shipping clerk for the plaintiff, testified that on October 16, 1903, he shipped a package to the defendant which contained several suits of clothes. The evidence of Rapelyea, Terry, and Cornwell, who, it is sought to be made to appear, were persons for whom clothes contained in the shipment of October 16th were made, is of little weight because of the almost total failure to identify the clothes of which they testified with those contained in the shipment of October 16th. Such is the practical extent of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The defendant testified that he never received any goods from the plaintiff which he did not pay for; that all of the goods sent to him came marked C. O. D.; that he does not owe the defendant anything; that when he received the letter of December 28, 1903, he immediately disclaimed by a reply that there was anything due from him, and offered in evidence this letter, from which it appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>plaintiff was uncertain on that day (scarcely two months after the goods were shipped) whether or not they had been paid for. On this conflicting evidence the jury found a verdict for the defendant, and in it there is no such preponderance in plaintiff\u2019s favor as to justify the County Court in setting it at naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The respondent\u2019s claim of irregularity in the judgment cannot avail it on this appeal. The defendant alone appealed from the judgment of the County Court. If the respondent\u2019s claim is correct, then respondent was in the County Court entitled to a judgment of absolute reversal, instead of to the judgment which was entered reversing the justice\u2019s judgment as against the weight of evidence and granting a new trial. Not having appealed therefrom, the plaintiff must be deemed satisfied therewith, and cannot now urge that the judgment should be affirmed because the County Court should have granted an absolute reversal of the justice\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court affirmed, with costs in this court and the County Court to the appellant. All concur, except MILLER., J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
