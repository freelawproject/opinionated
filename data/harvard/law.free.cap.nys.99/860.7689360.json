Plaintiff appeals. The dismissal as against the city was proper. The plaintiff claims that the mere fact of the overflow makes the city liable. The city, however, on the cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, showed that the sewer was properly constructed, and that the overflow was due to the wrongful act of the other defendant in allowing marble dust to run into the sewer, in violation of a city ordinance. Promptly upon notice the city took steps to remedy the evil. The plaintiff made out a prima facie case against the other defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The judgment is reversed as to the defendant German Grob &amp; Son, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event, and it is affirmed as to the defendant city of New York, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
