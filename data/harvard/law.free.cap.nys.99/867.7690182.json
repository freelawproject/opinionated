The plaintiff was riding in a carriage driven by a Dr. Elynn going northwardly along Eighth avenue in this city. The night was dark and it was raining. As they approached 130th street, and when within 5 to 8 feet of the obstruction with which they collided, the plaintiff, who according to her story was looking out all the time, saw the pile of material on the roadway and called to her companion, warning him-of its existence. She had no control of either driver or horse, and whatever negligence Dr. Elynn may have been guilty of cannot be imputed to her. There is a disputed question of fact as to whether, there were any lights about the obstruction, and upon the whole I am of the opinion that the question of the appellants being guilty of any act of contributory negligence should have been left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
