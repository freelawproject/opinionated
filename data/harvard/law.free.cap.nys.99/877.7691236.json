This litigation arose out of the following facts: The defendant ordered a quantity of steel bars from the plaintiffs. Among others, there were to be 138 bars, size 4 inches by 11/82 of an inch. The defendant claiming that the plaintiffs delivered bars of steel 1/s2 of an inch smaller than ordered refused to pay for them. Plaintiffs brought suit for the whole bill, and recovered for all but the 138 bars, which the defendant proved were not of the size ordered, and which he had not used, but had offered to return to plaintiffs, and then held them subject to plaintiffs\u2019 order. The goods were sold to defendant in May, and the defendant testified that the plaintiffs frequently called upon him for the amount of the bill, but that he repeatedly refused payment for the 138 bars upon the ground that they were not as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ordered. The plaintiffs did not deny that they made frequent demands for their pay, but did deny that the defendant ever called their attention to any alleged discrepancy in the size of the bars, and claimed that the first time their attention was called to it was at the trial. Plaintiffs made no claim at the trial, however, that the bars were of the size ordered, and did not express any surprise at the defendant\u2019s claim nor ask for an adjournment for the purpose of showing the exact size of the steel. A piece of steel alleged to have been cut from the bars delivered was produced in court, and a witness testified that the size was but 4 inches by 10/a2, instead of lx/82&gt; \u00b0f an inch in thickness, and it was substantially conceded that defendant\u2019s order called for 11/s2-inch steel. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs for the amount of their claim, less the price of the 138 bars of steel delivered not conforming to the defendant\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Subsequently the plaintiffs made a motion to set aside the judgment upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, which was granted. The newly discovered evidence consisted of an affidavit made by a man named Smith, who testified that on September 22, 1905, which was three days after the trial, he went to defendant\u2019s shop, asked the bookkeeper for and obtained the sample of steel used on the trial, and upon measuring it found that it measured \u201cover 10/s2\u201d; that he also measured some of the bars in the lot of 138, and they also measured \u201cover 10/s2\u201d; and he says'that the size is what is sold as \u201ca commercial 11/s2 all over the city.\u201d The plaintiff also makes an affidavit, verified the day after the trial, in which he says that \u201cthis morning\u201d he called on the defendant, and that the defendant admitted he had used some of the disputed steel, and also admitted that he had failed to tell the plaintiff of his objection to the size of the steel. These allegations are positively denied by the bookkeeper and the-defendant. This testimony as to newly discovered evidence is not of a character to warrant the setting aside of the judgment. It could as well have been obtained before and introduced at the trial as later on by affidavit. As before stated, plaintiff expressed no surprise at the evidence given at the trial, and so far as his own affidavit is concerned it merely repeats what he had already testified to upon the trial, except that he swears to an admission by the defendant of the use of some of the steel in question. As to this statement, in view of the defendant\u2019s testimony upon the trial and his denial in his affidavit, it hardly seems probable that he would swear to never having used any portion of the steel on the 19th of September, and on the morning of the 20th have confessed to the plaintiff that he had used a portion of it. The fact that the defendant incidentally stated that his contemplated use of the steel was for fire escapes, and that the size required for that purpose was not less than 11/s2 of an inch, when in fact the required size is V/S2, is not important, it was immaterial for what use he intended to put the steel. The plaintiff made no claim at the tria) that the size of steel delivered to defendant was \u201ccommercially known as \u201c/32,\u201d and Smith does not swear that the pieces measured by him equaled in size that ordered b}-- defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The order is reversed, with costs, and the judgment reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">LEVENTRITT and McCALL, JJ., concur in result</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
