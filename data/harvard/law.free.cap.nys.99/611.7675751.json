It appears from the defendant\u2019s affidavits, no affidavits having been filed by the plaintiff, that the summons and complaint were served on the 23d day of January, 1906; that a duly verified answer, properly inclosed and sealed in a postpaid wrapper, was deposited in the post office in the city of Utica on the 12th day of February, 1906, before 6 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, directed to plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the city of New York, at the address designated by said attorney on the summons and complaint. The said answer was not returned, and no notice of any sort, no application for judgment, and no notice of entry of judgment was served upon defendant\u2019s attorney, but a judgment was docketed in the county of New York on the 14th day of February, 1906, as for failure to answer. The due mailing of the answer being made to appear, and no affidavits denying the same having been submitted to the court, it is apparent that the entry of judgment by default was premature, and unauthorized, and that the default was properly set aside. The court, however, imposed conditions upon the opening of the said default, to wit, that defendant should accept five days\u2019 notice of trial, and the cause should immediately be put on the short-cause calendar for trial. The court ought not to have imposed such conditions if the judgment was prematurely entered, because, if the answer was served in time (and there is nothing upon these papers to show that it was not), the defendant was entitled to all his rights, including the opportunity to make a motion, as he had given notice that he would, for a change of venue, to receive full notice of trial, and to oppose the motion to put the case on the short-cause calendar. Yates v. Guthrie, 119 N. Y. 420, 23 N. E. 741. The court at Trial Term, Part 2, has control over the short-cause calendar, the rule requiring a notice of motion to put the case on said calendar upon affidavits, which the defendant may answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Therefore, so much of the order as imposes the foregoing conditions should be stricken out, the order modified accordingly, and, as modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
