The complaint shows that the claimants under these claims were not made parties to the action. The order appealed from denies a motion made by the plaintiff to bring such claimants in as parties, and from such denial plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">It was held in Osterhoudt v. Board of Supervisors, 98 N. Y. 239, that in a taxpayer\u2019s action to vacate, on the ground of illegality, audits of town accounts, and to restrain the levying of a tax for their payment, the persons in whose favor the audits were made are necessary parties. It appeared on the face of the complaint that there was a defect of parties defendant, because of the absence of the claimants. The defendants, comprising the board of supervisors, demurred to the complaint upon that ground. So that we have here a case where both parties agree in insisting that the claimants should be made parties, yet the court has denied the motion of the plaintiff to bring them in and to authorize the issuing of a supplemental summons for that purpose. It is urged by the respondent that all the relief sought for by the plaintiff upon this motion was accorded to him by the interlocutory judgment sustaining the demurrer. But, while we have the fact that a demurrer was interposed upon the ground stated, there is nothing in this record showing that there has been any hearing or decision of the demurrer. Upon the record before us, therefore, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to have his motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements to the appellant, and the motion granted, upon the payment of $25 costs by the plaintiff within 20 days after the service of this order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
