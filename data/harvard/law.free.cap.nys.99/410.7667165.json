The respondent also concedes in his brief that the parties were given one week in which to file briefs. Judgment was rendered upon November 20, 1905. As the time in which to render judgment began to run from the day for the submission of briefs, the judgment was rendered within the 14 days prescribed by section 230 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1557, c. 580). A. M. Eisenberg Co. v. Janzlik (Sup.) 92 N. Y. Supp. 247. The order vacating the judgment was therefore without authority, and must be reversed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Order reversed, with costs, and judgment reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
