He was removed from his position by the defendant without a compliance with section 1543 of the charter (chapter 466, p. 636, of the Laws of 1901), which, so far as material, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-17\">' \u201cBut no regular clerk or head of a bureau, or person holding a position in the classified municipal civil service subject to competitive examination, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>be removed until he has been allowed an opportunity of making an explanation ; and in every case of a removal, the true grounds thereof shall be forthwith entered upon the records of the department or board or borough president, and a copy filed with the municipal civil service</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Upon a former appeal in this case it was held that mandamus, and not quo warranto, was the proper remedy. People ex rel. Corkhill v. McAdoo, 98 App. Div. 312, 90 N. Y. Supp. 689. The issues raised by the return to the alternative writ have now been tried, with the result that the relator has a final order and judgment directing that a peremptory writ of issue to compel his reinstatement. The only question that appears to have been litigated upon the trial was whether the position of the relator was confidential, or that of a regular clerk, and the test applied, apparently by the acquiescence of all parties, was whether the duties of the position were confidential. There does not seem to have been any serious dispute as to the nature of these duties, but the question was nevertheless submitted to the jury, which found that the relator\u2019s duties were not confidential. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In order to decide this case, it is necessary to construe the provision of the statute quoted supra, which is a re-enactment of section 28, c. 335, p. 491, of the Laws of 1873, with the addition of the words \u201cor person holding a position in the classified municipal civil service subject to competitive examination.\u201d The meaning of the words \u201cregular clerk\u201d has been passed upon in People ex rel. Sims v. Fire Commissioners, 73 N. Y. 437, and People ex rel. v. Board of Fire Commissioners, 86 N. Y. 149, which held that the words were used in their popular sense, and included only such positions as did not require any other qualification than the ability to perform purely clerical work. There was no such thing as a classified civil service at the time of the act in 1873, and the addition of the words quoted last above is doubtless accounted for by the classifications provided for by the civil service law, now chapter 370, p. 795, of the Laws of 1899, and I think the expression added includes the former. The Constitution provides (article 5, \u00a7 9), that merit and fitness for positions in the civil service shall be ascertained, \u201cso far as practicable, by examinations, which, so far as practicable, shall be competitive.\u201d In harmony with this constitutional provision, section 12 of the civil service law provides for classification in the exempt class of all positions \u201cfor the filling of which competitive or noncompetitive examination may be found to be not practicable,\u201d and the test prescribed by the Court ot Appeals as to the practicability of an examination is whether the duties are of a confidential character. Chittenden v. Wurster, 152 N. Y. 345, 46 N. E. 857, 37 L. R. A. 809. No reason can be suggested for asserting that a competitive examination is not practicable impositions whose duties are purely clerical, and, as we have seen, those whose duties are more than merely clerical are not \u201cregular clerks.\u201d Of course, the statute must contemplate that all positions in the civil service will be subject to competitive examination, unless such examination is impracticable, and it must, therefore, follow that the expression \u201cperson holding a position in the classified municipal civil service subject to competitive examination\u201d was intended to include every \u201cregular clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>But it is insisted that the classification adopted by the civil service commission is not controlling, and that, although the relator obtained his appointment without competitive examination, he is still granted immunity from removal by this statute in case the court should hold that the commission erred in classifying the position as one for which a competitive examination was not practicable; in other words, that he may be granted immunity from removal from a position by the assertion that he holds it in violation of the Constitution. 'The Court of Appeals has. recently held that the act of classification by a civil service commission is a legislative or administrative, and not a judicial, act, and that it cannot be reviewed by the courts, and that the only control that the courts can exercise over such an act is a limited and qualified one, to be exercised only by mandamus in cases where the act sought to be controlled is so palpably violative of the law as to present no fair or reasonable ground for difference of opinion among intelligent and conscientious officials. People ex rel. Schau v. McWilliams, 185 N. Y. 92, 77 N. E. 785. It will not be claimed that the classification of the position in question could be controlled by mandamus within the rule stated supra. Even the learned trial court was so much in doubt whether the duties of the position were confidential that, although the nature of such duties appeared without dispute, he submitted the question to the jury. If the classification of the commissioners cannot be directly attacked, it should be conclusive when called in question collaterally by a person seeking restoration to a position upon the ground that his appointment to such position was illegal. We do not think the aid of the courts can successfully be invoked for the accomplishment of such purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and the proceedings dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Judgment and order reversed, with costs, and proceedings dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
