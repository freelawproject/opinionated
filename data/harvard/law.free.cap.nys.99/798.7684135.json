She left her house intending to go to the place of her employment, and at Sixty-Fourth street and Second avenue signaled an approaching car bound downtown to stop. It did stop, and while she was endeavoring to board same, and was in the position of having both her feet on the running board, some one, not the conductor of the car, but one of a number of men whom she saw on the back platform, signaled the car to go ahead by pulling the bell, and it started with the plaintiff in the position related. She remained in the same place till the car reached Sixty-Third street, where, as she swears, she intended, on the car stopping, to go inside. At this point, a block away from where she boarded the car, it slowed down, and then started ahead again with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>jerk, which threw the men standing on the platform backwards/ one of them falling against the plaintiff with such force as to loosen her hold, and precipitate her to the street and against a pillar of the elevated railroad, and she suffered the injuries she complained of. From the time she boarded the car until she was thrown therefrom no one had appeared to collect her fare, and she had not paid it. While an endeavor was made to show that the reason she did not go inside the car between Sixty-Fourth and Sixty-Third streets was because the car was moving, the inference is irresistible that the real reason was because the car was crowded and her way was blocked, and she could not get in if she tried; for she says on cross-examination: \u201cI knew I could not get in, and I knew I would fall off if I did not hold on;\u201d and when asked, \u201cHow did you know you could not get.in?\u201d the answer is, \u201cBecause the men were in my way. I tried to push my way through, but nobody would move for me to get in.\u201d And so, when asked still further, \u201cWasn\u2019t it possible between Sixty-Third and Sixty-Fourth streets for you to get on the platform of the car?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo, sir; I tried. The car was going too fast. I tried to push one man aside, but he didn\u2019t seem to move, or pay any heed to me.\u201d Taking the story as told of the happening of this accident by the plaintiff herself, it establishes unquestioned negligence of the plaintiff contributing to the happening thereof by voluntarily placing herself in an exposed and dangerous position in the crowded state of the car when she got upon it.

All concur; LEVENTRITT, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
