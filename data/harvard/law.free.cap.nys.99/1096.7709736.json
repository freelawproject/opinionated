Bathgate v. Haskin, 59 N. Y. 533. Where the client, however, desires to dispense with the s\u00e9rvices, it should only be upon protecting the attorney to the extent of services already performed. We therefore think that the order in this case should not have been denied upon the ground that the petitioner\u2019s remedy was to move for substitution of attorneys, because that would not give her the relief which she desired, which was to end the litigation; and if she substituted new attorneys, she would have -to make the same request of them, and if they refused there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>would be the same result. The simple and direct procedure would have been to grant the application upon condition that the matter be referred to some suitable person to take proof as to the amount of compensation to which the attorneys are entitled, and, upon payment thereof, that they should, if requested by the client, discontinue the action, or, at least, not proceed further with the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The order should be accordingly modified, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
