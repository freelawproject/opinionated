The defendant, desiring to buy certain lots, employed the plaintiff to ascertain the name of the owner, and to enter into negotiations to that end, agreeing to pay for those services in the event that he purchased the property. Upon the issues raised by the pleadings the parties went to trial. At the close of the testimony the complaint was dismissed for failure of proof. The reason assigned for this ruling was that the defendant had not purchased \u2022 the property. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to have that question submitted to the jury was denied. The learned trial judge was led to this conclusion because the defendant\u2019s wife was named as purchaser in the contract for and the deed of the property. These instruments were treated as conclusive against the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendant was the purchaser. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">The record discloses ample evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendant was really the purchaser. Not only did the latter admit in his pleading that he was desirous of acquiring the property, but he testified that he employed the <em>plaintiff; </em>that the plaintiff ascertained and -informed him who the owner of the property .wasc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>that he made an offer through the plaintiff, who reported to him the result; that his wife was never mentioned in his dealings with the plaintiff; that he subsequently conducted the negotiations with the agents of the owner; that he paid the purchase price; that he signed the contract of 'purchase as attorney in fact for his wife. It also appears in evidence from other sources that his wife was not present at any time, not even when the title was closed, and that the defendant had admitted that he purchased the property. Is the effect of all those facts to be nullified merely because the contract was made and the deed taken in the name of the wife? Was not the plaintiff entitled to have those facts weighed by the jury as against the inferences to be drawn from the form of the instruments ? It by no means follows that because the wife\u2019s name was inserted in the contract and deed that she, and not her husband, was the purchaser. On the contrary, the facts developed would justify the conclusion that he had bought in her name; that he had placed the title in her for purposes of his own. If he did so, he cannot thereby deprive the plaintiff of his compensation. If he was in fact the purchaser, his liability follows, whatever name may have been inserted in the contract and deed. So, whether he is to be treated as the actual purchaser or as the agent of his wife, an undisclosed principal, the question of his liability was for the jury, and not for the court. Konner v. Anderson, 32 Misc. Rep. 511, 66 N. Y. Supp. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
