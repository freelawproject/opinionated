New York City Railway Co. (decided by us at this term) 99 N. Y. Supp. 902, and calls for the reversal of this judgment. In the Emma Gasper Case the request of the passenger was clearly made for a transfer \"south\u201d along Amsterdam avenue, and we have decided that this was refused. In the case under consideration the proof is that the plaintiff asked for a transfer to Amsterdam avenue, and she received same. As this action is for the recovery of a penalty based upon the refusal to obey the mandate of a statute, we feel, that judgment should be sustained only upon strict proof of the violation thereof, and upon this record we do not believe the necessary refusal has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
