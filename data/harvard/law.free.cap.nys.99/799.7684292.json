Subsequently the plaintiff moved to vacate the judgment and to open the default. From the order denying that motion this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The plaintiff has mistaken her remedy. There was no default to be opened, hence the denial of the motion was inevitable. The judgment of dismissal was not the result of nonappearance of the plaintiff on the adjourned day, but of the refusal of the justice to grant her request for a further adjournment. That refusal can be reviewed only on an appeal from the judgment, and that appeal has not been taken. Sections 253 and 254 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, pp. 1562, 1563, c. 580) do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs to the respondent.
