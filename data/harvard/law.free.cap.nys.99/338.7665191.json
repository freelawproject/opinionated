The action was for a broker\u2019s commission on a sale of real estate. The defendant states in his moving affidavit that he had employed one Miller to make the sale, and that a demand has been made against him for the sum of $530, and that the claim and demand made by the said Miller \u201cis the same claim and demand made by the plaintiff.\u201d In this latter statement he is clearly wrong. Each claim is based upon a distinct contract alleged to have been made between the claimant and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">This is not a proper case for an interpleader. McCreery v.
