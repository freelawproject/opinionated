Proc. \u00a7 56, subd. 1) of trying the charge of \u201cpetit larceny charged as a first offense.\u201d This question has been expressly determined adversely to the contention of the defendant in the case of People v. Cook, 45 Hun, 34, where Smith,.P. J., in writing for the court, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-15\">\u201cIt is also contended that * * * Courts of Special Sessions can only try cases of petit larceny charged as a first offense. Code Cr. Proc. \u00a7 56, subd. 1. We do not understand that it is essential to the jurisdiction of a Court of Special Sessions in a case of petit larceny that the information or the warrant should allege that the crime charged is a first offense. If it be a first offense in fact, the court has jurisdiction to try the case, and it is to be deemed a first offense unless the contrary is charged; but if such allegation is material for any purpose, the defendant is not harmed by its omission. The provision requiring such allegation is, in the interest of the public, to prevent criminals guilty of a second offense from escaping the full measure of punishment imposed by statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7 688), and which Courts of Special Sessions have not the power to Inflict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">The defendant also urges that the court erred in excluding evidence offered by him to show that the charge was not a first offense in fact. The offer, however, fell far short of this. The offer was that the same complainant had laid, information against this defendant on a charge of larceny upon which a warrant was issued against the prisoner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>upon which he was arrested prior to being arrested on this charge; but there was no offer to show that the offense charged in that information was one committed by the defendant prior to the one for which he was being tried, and it is not to be presumed that he would care to confess the commission of an earlier offense to exclude the court of jurisdiction, when the only other effect of such confession would be to subject himself to a prosecution which might result in a much more severe punishment than could be imposed for a first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The judgment should be affirmed. All concur, except PARKER, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
