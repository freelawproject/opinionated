Upon the trial the treasurer and the president of the plaintiff testified that the defendant ordered the delivery of a certain quantity of beer at the corner of Thirty-Seventh street and Tenth avenue, and they both testified in general terms that \u201cwe delivered it,\u201d although it was not shown that either had any personal knowledge that such delivery was made. The delivery was claimed to have been made between September 3 and September 8, 1903. The defendant denied the ordering of the beer or its delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">All testimony offered by him tending to show that he was not the owner or in possession of or carrying on business at the corner of Thirty-Seventh street and Tenth avenue, and proof that other parties were engaged in business at that place, and that those parties ordered the beer in question of the plaintiffs, in September, 1903, was excluded by the trial judge, upon objection by plaintiff\u2019s attorney. This was error. Such evidence bore strongly upon the probability of the truth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the defendant\u2019s statement that he had not ordered the beer and was not liable therefor, and should have been admitted. Moreover, the evidence of delivery to the defendant, in view of his emphatic denial, should have been much more certain in order to warrant a judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
