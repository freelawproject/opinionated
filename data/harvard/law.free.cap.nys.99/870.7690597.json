The motion for an order vacating the judgment and setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial upon the ground of misconduct of a juror was made on the 20th day of March, 1906. Section 1282 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201ca motion to set aside a final judgment for irregularity, shall not be heard after the expiration of one year since the filing of the judgment roll.\u201d To avoid the effect of this statute, a clear case, based upon sufficient evidence of fraud, must be made out. The moving affidavit is made by the plaintiff, and is solely upon information and belief, without stating the sources of the information or the ground of the relief. In Matter of Peck v. Carghill, 167 N. Y. 391, 60 N. E. 775, 53 L. R. A. 888, the court held that a \u201cpetition in which all the material facts are stated upon information and belief, without disclosing the source of the information or the ground of the belief, is not sufficient basis for any judicial action\u201d\u2014citing Murphy v. Jack, 142 N. Y. 215, 36 N. E. 882, 40 Am. St. Rep. 590; Buell v. Van Camp, 119 N. Y. 169, 23 N. E. 538; Campbell v. Morrison, 7 Paige, 157; Cushing v. Ruslander, 49 Hun, 19, 1 N. Y. Supp. 505. This rule has been applied on motions to vacate attachments for insufficiency of the moving papers (Yates v. North, 44 N. Y. 274; Steuben County Bank v. Alberger, 78 N. Y. 258; Hunt v. Robinson, 52 App. Div. 539, 65 N. Y. Supp. 386); to affidavits of service by mail in an action for foreclosure (Mowry v. Sanborn, 65 N. Y. 581); in motions for an injunction (Rome v. Watertown &amp; O. T. R. Co. v. Rochester, 46 Hun, 149, where the court said: \u201cSuch an affidavit proves nothing, and does not call upon or aid the court in determining any fact necessary to be determined in order to administer relief in any given case\u201d; Matter of Wheaton v. Slattery, 96 App. Div., at page 108, 88 N. Y. Supp., at page 1074; Cupples Envelope Co. v. Lackner, 99 App. Div. 235, 90 N. Y. Supp. 954); and on orders of arrest (McKelvey v. Marsh, 63 App. Div. 396, 71 N. Y. Supp. 541; Price v. Levy, 93 App. Div. 274, 87 N. Y. Supp. 740).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>As the papers, under the decisions above cited, presented no facts upon which .the court at Special Term could act, the order appealed from was clearly right, and should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
