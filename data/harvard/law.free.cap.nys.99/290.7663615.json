The attorneys under their agreement were entitled to one-half of the sum as adjusted. The sum paid in settlement, as established by the uncontradicted evidence, is $150. This must be taken as the basis of the attorneys\u2019 claim (Pilkington v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 49 App. Div. 22, 63 N. Y. Supp. 211), and therefore the judgment could not exceed $75.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, unless the plaintiffs within 20 days consent to a reduction thereof to $75, without costs, in which case it is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
