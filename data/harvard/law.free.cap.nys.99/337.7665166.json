On the first trial plaintiff recovered $4.75 damages and $4.72 costs, and from the judgment entered he appealed to the Appellate Term, on the ground that the damages were insufficient. The Appellate Teipm reversed the judgment appealed from, and ordered a new trial. On the \"former appeal (92 N. Y. Supp. 789) the court held that the defendant had broken her contract with the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff was warranted in \u201csuing for the part performed and for loss of profits on the part which the plaintiffs were not permitted to perform in consequence of the defendant\u2019s repudiation of her obligation.\u201d A new trial was had pursuant to the judgment of reversal. Substantially the same proof was made and with the same result, viz., a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $4.75 damages and $4.72 costs. The plaintiff appealed also from this judgment on the ground1 of insufficiency of damages, and this appeal is now before the court on substantially the same state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">The plaintiffs are the owners of a weekly newspaper known as the \u201cNorth Side News.\u201d The defendant keeps a candy store. She entered into a contract with the plaintiffs under which she Was to pay them $35 for a year\u2019s advertising in the North Side News. These payments were to be made quarterly. At the end of the first quarter defendant notified the plaintiffs to go no further with the advertisement. They thereafter ceased inserting the advertisement, and-brought this action to recover damages for breach of contract. The defendant had paid $4 on account. The space contracted for was about 4J^ inches long by <em>$/% </em>inch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>in width. The contract did not call for space in any particular part of the paper. The main\u201d question here is what rule of damage should be applied in plaintiffs\u2019 behalf. They held a year\u2019s contract. They were to receive $35 for a year\u2019s advertising. The defendant broke tire contract. She must therefore make up to the plaintiffs for their actual loss, the loss of the benefit to them in case the contract had been .carried out. The rule to be applied is to ascertain the amount of money it would have cost plaintiffs to carry out their part of the contract, including in this case\" the expense of commissions, and deduct this amount from the contract price of $35. The difference would represent, the benefit which the plaintiffs would have enjoyed had the contract been carried out. This is the only rule that is fairly deducible from the opinion rendered on the former appeal. See, also, section 618, Sedgwick on Damages (8th Ed.). In estimating these damages we think there should be no deduction from the plaintiffs\u2019 demand based upon the fact that for three-fourths of a year they had the use of the space formerly occunied by defendant\u2019s advertisement. There is unreasonable ground for such a charge against the plaintiffs. It may be that, had the contract provided for a space located in a special and prominent part of the paper, plaintiffs\u2019 claim might be reduced by the amount of their profits from others for nine months\u2019 use of this space. But here the advertisement was to take its place in a very small space anywhere among numerous others. Assume that this space was occupied by another advertisement for the remaining nine months, the acceptance and publishing of this additional advertisement did not depend upon plaintiffs\u2019 having control of the space formerly used by the defendant. It would have been inserted and published whether or not the defendant kept her contract. It needed only a cutting out of a small, amount of reading matter to do this. We therefore think that the court below, should give no consideration in this particular case to what use was made of this advertising space for the remaining nine months of defendant\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On the trial the plaintiffs attempted to prove the cost to them of printing and publishing defendant\u2019s advertisement. They were not permitted to do this under objection from the defendant. In sustaining these objections, we think the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
