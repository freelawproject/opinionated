The defect alleged is that certain set screws used to take up the slack of the chain had become defective and out of order, which caused the chain to loosen, and permit the keg of beer to fall. There is, however, no evidence to support this claim. The. testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>on the contrary, shows that the screws were rigid, and so rusty that they were hard to move, thus showing that their condition in no way contributed to the accident. The elevator had worked properly and the chains were taut up to almost the very instant the accident occurred, and the looseness of the chains developed suddenly and without apparent or shown cause. Under such circumstances, no negligence can be imputed to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
