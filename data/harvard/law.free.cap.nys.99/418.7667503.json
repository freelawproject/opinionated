By section 1670 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is provided that while the notice of lis pendens may be filed before the service of the summons, in that case personal service of the summons must be made; on a defendant within 60 days after the filing, or else, before the expiration of the same time, publication of the summons must be commenced, or service thereof made without the state, pursuant to an order' obtained therefor. It is undisputed that the filing of the lis pendens in this instance was not followed within 60 days by either personal service or the publication of the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The order denying the motion to cancel the lis pendens is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with costs. The appeal from the order denying the reargument and resettlement is dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
