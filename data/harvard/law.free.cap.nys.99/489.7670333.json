Judgment was given for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">We think the judgment should be sustained on the ground that it is shown, without contradiction, that the work of excavation was entirely in the hands of an independent contractor, and that such contractor was a fit and competent person. Hexamer v. Webb, 101 N. Y. 377, 4 N. E. 755, 54 Am. Rep. 703; Roemer v. Striker, 142 N. Y. 134, 36 N. E. 808; Berg v. Parsons, 156 N. Y. 109, 50 N. E. 957, 41 L. R. A. 391, 66 Am. St. Rep. 542. If the work was negligently or improperly done by the contractor\u2019s workmen, the contractor, and not defendant, was liable. The evidence does not warrant a finding that defendant or her husband, as her agent, interfered with the contractor\u2019s method of doing the work, or attempted to direct or control his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
