The eleventh paragraph of the stipulation upon which this proceeding was submitted states that the defendant is, and has been for 20 years last past, the owner of the premises where liquor is sold under the liquor tax certificate by this proceeding sought to be canceled, and that on such premises there is a building ivhich has been used by the defendant and his predecessors as a hotel, in which liquor \u201chas been legally sold continuously, without interruption, for a period of more than 40 years.\u201d It is our view that, if the sale of liquor was legal during the time referred to in the stipulation, it was legal at the time of the institution of this proceeding. It is the contention of the petitioner that the amendment of the Liquor Tax Law (chapter 29, Gen. Laws) made by chapter 104, p. 145, of the Laws of 1905, was such as no longer to allow the lawful sale of liquor on the defendant\u2019s premises, described in the petition and mentioned in the eleventh paragraph of-the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-18\">Section 24, subd. 1, of the Liquor Tax Law (Laws 1897, p. 225, c. 312) prior to the amendment of 1905, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cTraffic in liquor shall not be permitted: (1) In any building or upon any premises established as a penal institution, protectory, industrial school, asylum, state hospital, colony or institution established for the care or treatment of epileptics, or poorhouse, and if such building or premises, other than a county jail or state prison, be situated in a town and outside the limits of an incorporated village or city, not within one-half mile of any building - or premises so occupied, provided there be such distance of one-half mile between such building and premises, and the nearest boundary line of such village or city.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">As amended by chapter 104, p. 145, of the Laws of 1905, the subdivision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">\u201c(1) In any building or upon any premises <em>or lands </em>established as a penal institution, protectory, industrial school, asylum, state hospital, <em>state agricultural and industrial school, </em>colony or institution, established for the care or treatment of epileptics, or poorhouse, and if such building, premises <em>or lands, </em>other than a county jail or state prison, be situated in a town and outside the limits of an incorporated village or city, not within one-half mile of any building, premises <em>or lands </em>so occupied, provided there be such distance of one-half mile between such building, premises and lands and the nearest boundary line of such village or city.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">It is to be seen that, aside from the added reference to the state agricultural and industrial school, the only change in the subdivision is the addition of the words \u201cor lands\u201d after the word \u201cpremises\u201d in three places. The incorporation of the term \u201clands\u201d into the phraseology of the section, however, does not extend its meaning; for \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201clands\u201d are synonyms. If there is a distinction, it is that the word \u201cpremises\u201d is the more inclusive. Bouvier and Worcester define the latter as \u201clands and tenements\u201d; the Century Dictionary as \u201clands and houses or tenements\u201d; and the Standard as \u201cland or lands; land with its appurtenances, as buildings.\u201d It matters little, therefore, whether defendant\u2019s hotel, where he sells liquor, is within or without the half-mile limit. If his traffic in liquor was lawful before the amendment of 1905, and the stipulation says it was, it is now lawful,- no matter whether he is within a half mile of any of the buildings of the Long Island State Hospital, or only within a half mile of contiguous land owned and used by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The order must therefore be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
