The answer denied the allegations of the complaint, but alleged that plaintiff did perform certain work, labor, and services for defendant, pursuant to an agreement, under the formation of which the work was to be completed April 1,1905 ; that the work was not actually completed until June 19, 1905; and that defendant could not transact his business wholly until December 19th of that year. It was also alleged that by reason of plaintiff\u2019s failure to perform a portion of the work properly or in time defendant was damaged to the extent of $2,500, and an affirmative judgment was asked for this amount. The damages to defendant first alleged in the counterclaim were caused by the necessity of employing labor and furnishing materials to complete the repair work which the plaintiff had agreed to do; second, by the necessity of paying rent during the period when defendant could not transact business owing to plaintiff\u2019s delays; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>third, by the loss of profits during the period when defendant could not transact business, or could do so only partially.
