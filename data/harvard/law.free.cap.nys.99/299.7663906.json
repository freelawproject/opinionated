In his complaint the plaintiff alleged full performance on the part of insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">\u201cThat said Henry Victors at all times performed all the duties incumbent upon him as a beneficiary member of said corporation, and at all times promptly paid all dues and assessments as provided in and by the laws, rules, and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>tions of said corporation, and has otherwise complied with all the requirements-thereof, and performed ail the conditions on his part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">This allegation was denied by defendant. Upon the trial plain- \u2022 tiff offered evidence, which was received over defendant\u2019s objection and exception, for the purpose of establishing a waiver \u00f3n the pare of defendant of full performance as a condition precedent to a recovery. It appears that deceased had failed and neglected to pay his premiums-as required by defendant\u2019s'rules, and was suspended from membership, and at the time of his death had not been reinstated. The verdict was directed by the learned trial court upon the theory that defendant had waived the right to insist upon actual reinstatement of the deceased after his suspension, although the laws of defendant required this to be done. We think the admission of evidence tending to establish a waiver was error. The issue presented by the pleadings was whether insured had complied with the rules and laws of defendant, not whether defendant had waived compliance with them, and defendant had a right to insist that the action be tried upon the issues presented by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The .stipulation to which our attention is called does not help the plaintiff. It cannot be regarded as an amendment, or as in any way changing the issues. \u201cEach party expressly reserves any right it may have to show at the trial a waiver,\u201d etc. Neither party had a right to introduce evidence of a waiver. None is given by the stipulation. We cannot say that it will be impossible for plaintiff to establish a cause of action under a proper pleading, and a new trial ought therefore to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
