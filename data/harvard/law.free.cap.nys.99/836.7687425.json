Notwithstanding the objction of defendant\u2019s counsel and the caution of the court, plaintiff\u2019s counsel persisted in charges and accusations in nowise supported by- the evidence. The sole purpose of the impassioned appeal to the jury was to create a bias, and we cannot say that that purpose was not accomplished. Upon three separate occasions the defendant\u2019s counsel moved that a mistrial be declared. , In each instance the motion was denied, and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The motion should have been granted. The insinuative effect on the jury was not removed by the instructions of the justice. The improper conduct of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was so pronounced and persistent that the mild observation of the judge to the jury that they should base their verdict on the evidence alone did not eliminate the false impressions which they must have gained. Benoit v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 94 App. Div. 24, 30, 87 N. Y. Supp. 951; Cosselmon v. Dunfee, 172 N. Y. 507, 65 N. E. 494; Kuperschmidt v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 47 Misc. Rep. 352, 94 N. Y. Supp. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
