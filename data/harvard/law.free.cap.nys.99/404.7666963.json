Objections were then sustained to questions as to whether the daughter stated what injuries had been sustained, and whether she said anything about her mother\u2019s false teeth having been injured. <em>Held </em>that, in view of\u2019 the proper objection to the first question, there was no error in sustaining the objections, as the rulings but held counsel to the rule that a contradicting witness should be asked the precise question put to the principal witness.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b432-17\">Appeal from Trial Term, Kings County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-18\">Action by Margaret Hanselman against Louise R.

When she was hanging washed clothes from a window on a clothes line that ran from the window to a clothes pole in the yard, the pole fell over and struck her. She complains of the \u201ccarelessness and negligence of the said defendant in maintaining the said clothes pole in a defective and dangerous condition, liable to fall, in erecting the same improperly, and in permitting the same to become decayed and weak.\u201d The plaintiff showed by a witness who was a pile driver by trade that a pole left in the ground rots at the top of the earth, right at the earth line. Speaking from observation of a piece of spruce which he had taken from the yard, he testified that it had \u201crotted in over an inch.\u201d He testified that at the earth line the stump was between 8 and 10 inches in diameter, and that the rot had gone in an inch. He further testified that the tests for rottenness were easy, and could be made by axe or gimlet. It appeared that the pole had been set up for six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">I think that the rule of liability is well stated in Alperin v. Earle, 55 Hun, 211, 8 N. Y. Supp. 51, by' Barrett, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cThe rules applicable to public halls and stairways In such buildings govern here. The landlord is responsible for injuries to his tenants resulting from the dangerous condition of those parts of the building which he reserves for the common use, and over which- he retains control, but only when he has been guilty of actual negligence with regard thereto. To bring him within this rule \u2018it must appear,\u2019 as was said in Henkel v. Murr, 31 Hun, 30, \u2018that with some notice of the condition of things, or under some circumstances equivalent to notice, such as an unreasonable omission to ascertain the condition, he had failed to make the necessary repairs or changes called for by the condition or exigency.\u2019 This is the fair rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The learned trial court submitted to the jury the question whether there were \u201ccircumstances which ought to have waked up\u201d the defendant. The circumstances were those attendant upon the previous fall of another clothes pole. The appellant insists that the testimony thereof was erroneously admitted over her objection, and this is the principal question of her appeal. It appeared that the defendant owned two tenement houses side by side, built at the same time and alike, and that two poles were set out at the same time, each in one of the yards. There is evidence that pole No. 1 fell down shortly before the time of this accident, that it was \u201cjust like\u201d pole No. 2, and was of the same size, and that it broke off at the base, just like pole No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The precise question is whether the fall of that pole, without any apparent outside agency for its fall, might naturally call the attention of the owner, in the exercise of due care, to the danger of a fall of No. 2. I think that such evidence was competent on the question of notice, and it was upon this ground that it was admitted and submitted. Brady v. M. R. Co., 127 N. Y. 46, 49, 27 N. E. 368; Ster v. Tuety, 45 Hun, 49; Elliott on Evidence, \u00a7 185; Cavanagh v. O\u2019Neill, 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>App. Div. 49, 50 N. Y. Supp. 207. The criterion is the similarity of conditions (Gustafson v. Young, 91 App. Div. 433, 86 N. Y. Supp. 851), and \u201cthe similarity that is required is, in short, a similarity in essential circumstances, or, as it is usually expressed, a substantial similarity, i. e., a similarity in such circumstances or conditions as, might supposably affect the result in question.\u201d Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 1, \u00a7 442. In view of the similarity in size and appearance, in age, in use, in location, in the fall, and the physical conditions, I think that the court did not err in the ruling or the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s daughter, upon her cross-examination, had testified that she had not stated to a representative of the defendant that her mother\u2019s false teeth had been broken by the accident, and that she wanted $25 to pay for them. The defendant thereafter called the representative, and asked him whether he had any conversation with the daughter relative to the injuries to her mother. This was objected to as incompetent, immaterial, irrelevant, and improper in form. The court ruled \u201cthat may stand simply as introductory,\u201d under exception, and the witness answered that he did have such conversation. Then the counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cQ. Did you ask Mrs. Lotz [the daughter]\u2014did Mrs Lotz tell you what injuries her mother had sustained? Objected to; objection sustained. Q. Did Mrs. Lotz say anything to you about her mother\u2019s false teeth having been injured? Objected to; objection sustained; defendant excepts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The witness was called to contradict. The question was not in accord with the general rule which is stated by Church, J., for the court in Sloan v. New York Central R. R. Co., 45 N. Y. 125:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201cTo lay the foundation for contradiction it is necessary to ask the witness specifically whether he has made such statements, and the usual and most accurate mode of examining the contradicting witness is to ask the precise question put to the principal witness. Otherwise, hearsay evidence not strictly contradictory might be introduced, to the injury of the parties, and in violation of legal rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">If the answer had been permitted, I am not prepared to say that the ruling would have been serious error, for the learned judge further says in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201cBut the practice upon this subject must be, to some extent, under the control and discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">On the other hand, I am far from prepared to say that the ruling which but held the counsel to the rule stated was reversible error. The attention of the learned counsel had been called to the fact that the form was objectionable by the specific objection of the learned counsel for the respondent interposed to the question almost immediately preceding the one thus ruled upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">I advise affirmance of the judgment and order, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
