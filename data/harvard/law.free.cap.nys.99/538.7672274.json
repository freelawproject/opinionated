Defendant set up on the trial a general release, which plaintiff testified he had executed voluntarily, and also that he had received from the defendant the sum therein named. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected that the release was signed without his consent, and it would seem that the learned justice refused to dismiss the complaint and allowed the case to go to the jury for this reason. It is well settled that a plaintiff has a right to settle his action at any time, whether his attorney consents or not. It has also been held that the Municipal Court has no power to enforce an attorney\u2019s lien, if, indeed, such a lien exists in that court. People ex rel. Jaffe v. Fitzpatrick, 35 Misc. Rep. 456, 71 N. Y. Supp. 191. It is apparent, for these reasons, that the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
