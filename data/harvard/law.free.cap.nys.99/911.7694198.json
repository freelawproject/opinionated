The covenant claimed by the defendant to have been violated was that requiring the tenant to surrender the premises at the expiration of the lease in as good condition as he took them, wear and tear excepted. The defendant counterclaimed the damage to the freehold done by the tenant In tearing down horsestalls in the barn, and not restoring them, and proved the fact, and the damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b940-5\">Seven months before the expiration of the lease the defendant sold and conveyed the property. .</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b940-6\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, GAYNOR, and RICH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b940-7\">Herbert Hindes, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b940-8\">Isaac L.

It follows that the right of action set up in the counterclaim is in the defendant\u2019s grantee. He purchased the land subject to the lease, and succeeded to his grantor\u2019s rights under the covenants of the lease. The covenant to surrender the premises in as good condition as received ran with the land. Demarest v.
