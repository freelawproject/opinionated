The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $450. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">The uncontradicted evidence is substantially as follows, viz.: Plaintiff was working on defendant\u2019s building. He loaded with materials a freight elevator, which went from the engine room up to the sidewalk on Broadway. He then got onto the elevator himself, and one \u201cFred,\u201d an employe of defendant, set the elevator in motion on its upward course. It tipped to one side, and caused plaintiff to slip and hurt his right foot, which got jammed between the platform of the elevator and \u201cthe bed of the engine or some connections attached thereto.\u201d The elevator had been inspected a week before by defendant\u2019s engineer, and found to be in good condition. It was again examined immediately after the accident, and found to be in good condition, and worked well. There was a. sign nailed to the wall to the west of the platform of the freight elevator, warning \u201cpassengers\u201d against riding on said elevator. The plaintiff did not see the sign, although it was in plain sight, and had been there for a long time. \u201cFred\u201d told plaintiff to get on the eleyator. \u201cFred\u201d was merely an \u201coiler\u201d in defendant\u2019s employ, with no authority to give such directions. The plaintiff says it was necessary for some one to go up on the elevator to open the doors upon the sidewalk. He went up on said elevator, when empty, just before the accident, and opened the doors. He then descended, and, having loaded the elevator as aforesaid, went up again on it, with the load, and met with the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>jury. Plaintiff says that his foreman was one Spellman, and not \u201cFred.\u201d He says Spellman told him \u201cto put certain steam .fittings on the elevator and take them up to the sidewalk\u201d; but he does not say that Spellman told him to ride himself on the elevator with the steam fittings. \u201cFred,\u201d who ran the elevator, did not himself ride upon it. He remained in the subcellar.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The plaintiff claimed that the doctrine \"Res ipsa loquitur\u201d applies. Assuming this claim to be well founded, it raises a presumption of negligence on the part of the defendant, which has met it by showing weekly inspections of the elevator, and that the same worked properly immediately after the accident, and that nothing seemed to be wrong with it. It had worked well the day previous to the accident. Spellman swears he called out to the plaintiff not to get on the elevator, but that plaintiff did not seem to hear him, as there was considerable noise. It is also shown that it was not customary for men to go on the elevator when loaded. The sign \u00e1bove mentioned read, \u201cNo passengers allowed to ride.\u201d Under the above evidence, which stands uncontradicted, it seems to us that the absence of reasonable care on the part of the defendant is not established, and that the verdict is not supported by the evidence and should not stand.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
