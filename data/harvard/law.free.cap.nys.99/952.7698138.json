The plaintiff agreed in writing to convey to the defendant\u2019s brother the real estate, and the check was given at the same time. The writing satisfied all the requirements of the statute of frauds to bind the plaintiff (the seller), but was not signed by the buyer. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>contained a provision for the making of a contract next day. The defendant sought to show as a defense which was pleaded that the plaintiff refused to sign a contract next day, in accordance with the terms of the first contract, but insisted on putting thereon a restricting covenant against specified occupations and against building contained in the conveyance to her. The trial judge excluded the said conveyance and much of the evidence that would have gone to establish the facts constituting the said defense.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b981-3\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

The refusal of the plaintiff to make the second contract the same in its terms as the first did not defeat the consideration for the check. It was given for a good consideration, viz., the first contract, and that remains and can be enforced. The plaintiff is just as much bound by the contract as it was first drawn as she would be if it were drawn over and signed again. It satisfies the provisions of the statute of frauds, and is complete against her. That the purchaser has not signed it does not detract from its effect against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Judgment of the Municipal Court affirmed. All concur, except MILLER, J., who dissents, on the ground that the plaintiff herself refused to perform the contract.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
