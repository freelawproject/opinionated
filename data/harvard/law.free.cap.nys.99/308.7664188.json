The defendant should have had afforded him the widest latitude in their cross-examination, in view of the fact that they neither attempted to arrest him nor to prevent the consummation of the crime. In view of this fact, and of the fact that the victim, who was apparently in league with the officers to the extent of submitting to the offense in their sight, was not produced as a witness, and in view of the sharp conflict in the evidence on the question of guilt we are satisfied that this is a proper case for the ordering of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The judgment of conviction of the County Court of Nassau county is reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
