The con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>tention of the defendant is that, as a minor between the ages of 14 and 16 years may be employed in case the proper certificate is issued and filed, the mere failure to obtain the certificate cannot have had anything to do with the injury to the plaintiff; but the issuance of the certificate, instead of being a mere formality, is carefully guarded. Among other things, the statute provides that the officer issuing it must make and file in his office a statement respecting the child\u2019s ability to read and write, its age, its development, its health, and its physical ability to perform the work which it intends to do. The effect of the employment of a child under 14 years of age in violation of the statute was considered in Marino v. Lehmaier, 173 N. Y. 530, 66 N. E. 572, 61 L. R. A. 811, which held such employment to be evidence of negligence, and that it could not be held as matter of law that a child thus employed was guilty of contributory negligence, or assumed the risks obvious or incident to the employment. In Sitts v. Waiontha Knitting Co., Ltd., 94 App. Div. 38, 87 N. Y. Supp. 911, it was said that the rules laid down in the Marino Case were applicable to such a case as the present. It is true, as urged by the appellant, that this statement was dictum, but we think it correctly states the law applicable to the case at bar, and that proof of the allegation sought to be stricken from the complaint would establish presumptively that the'plaintiff did not possess the judgment, discretion, care, and caution necessary for engagement in the vocation for which he was employed. It necessarily follows that the motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
