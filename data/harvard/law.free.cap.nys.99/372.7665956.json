At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the court dismissed his cause of action for false imprisonment, but finally submitted that for malicious prosecution to the jury, who found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">The learned trial court charged the jury: \u201cThe basis of an action of this kind is malice,\u201d and, after defining malice, it continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-18\">\u201cThe law says that where a prosecution such as this has been initiated by a citizen, and it terminates favorably to the person proceeded against, it may be presumed that the prosecuting citizen had not probable cause to believe that such defendant was guilty of the offense, and it will imply malice ; so that the cause is ordinarily made out when there \"has been a termination of the criminal prosecution favorably to the defendant, the implication of malice arising as matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">The learned court afterwards explained and qualified its charge relative to probable cause, but, although the charge as to malice was specifically presented to its attention, I cannot find that it receded from the instruction that the law implies malice from the want of probable cause. The defendant protected himself by his exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">I think that the judgment must be reversed for this error, inasmuch as the jury virtually were instructed that, if it found want of probable cause, malice followed on its heel by implication of law. The law does not imply malice from a want of probable cause. It may be inferred therefrom by the jury. Vanderbilt v. Mathis, 5 Duer, 304; Wilder v. Holden, 24 Pick. (Mass.) 8; Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>193, 25 L. Ed. 116; Greenleaf on Evidence (15th Ed.) vol. 2, \u00a7 453, and authorities cited. In Stewart v. Sonneborn, supra, the court (per Strong, J.) say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201cAnd the existence of malice is always a question exclusively for the jury. It must be found by them, or the action cannot be sustained. Hence, it must always be submitted to them, to find whether it existed. The court has no right to find it. nor to instruct the jury that they may return a verdict for the plaintiff without it. Even the inference of malice from the want of probable cause is one which the jury alone can draw. Wheeler v. Nesbitt et al., 24 How. (U. S.) 545, 16 L. Ed. 765; Newell v. Downs, 8 Blackf. (Ind.) 523; Johnson v. Chambers, 32 N. C. 287; Van Voorhees v. Leonard. 1 N. Y. Super. Ct. 148; Schofield v. Ferrers, 47 Pa. 194, 86 Am. Dec. 532.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The judgment and order are reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
