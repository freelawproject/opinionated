Caldwell against the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company. From an order granting an inspection and discovery of plaintiff\u2019s books and papers, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A70l\">Reversed on condition.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1013-7\">Plaintiff sued defendant for commissions on a written contract of employment by which defendant agreed to pay plaintiff 100 per cent, of all admission fees received from life insurance business secured by his personal solicitation, and 25 per cent, on the annual dues of the same so long as they shall be paid; also upon the agents secured or appointed by plaintiff. It was agreed that a commission should be paid to them on business done, and the difference between such agent\u2019s contracts and the 125 per cent, specified should be credited to plaintiff and paid to him monthly on demand, or to his heirs or assigns. The contract required plaintiff to devote all his time for five years to defendant\u2019s business, and in case of his death his commission should be paid on all business done so long as the same should be in force, and also upon the business of his agents so long as they should remain in the employ of the association. Plaintiff devoted all his time to defendant\u2019s business, secured about GO agents, and became entitled to the commission specified. In 1894 defendant refused to pay further commissions to plaintiff, and five actions were brought to recover the same, in which plaintiff applied for and was granted permission to take copies of the records described in his petition, and books containing a report of all business done in the United States from June 22,1881, to December 14, 1905, on policies procured by plaintiff and Ms agents, in accordance with the lists set out in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and of all other books, records, and papers which would show the amount of policies, admission fees paid thereon, annual dues received, etc., and that for the purpose of obtaining such inspection plaintiff and his attorney and accountants should be granted access to defendant\u2019s office, and that in default thereof defendant deposit all the books, papers, and records mentioned in the petition in the office of the clerk of the county of New York, there to remain open to plaintiff\u2019s examination and inspection until such inspection and copy was made.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1013-8\">Argued before O\u2019BRIEN, P. J., and McLAUGHLIN, LAUGH-LIN, CLARKE, and HOUGHTON, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1013-9\">George Burnham, Jr., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1013-10\">Rastus S. Ransom, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1013-11\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AuZO\">The order for inspection in any event is too broad, and that part of it directing deposit of books, papers, and records in the clerk\u2019s office of the county of New York should be stricken out. In view, however, of the long delay on the part of the plaintiff in asking for inspection of defendant\u2019s books, and the character of the action, and the similarity of the contract involved to that construed by this court in Caldwell v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, 53 App. Div. 245, 65 N. Y. Supp. 826, we think this appeal should be disposed of by providing that, in case the defendant shall, within 10 days after entry of order hereon, file with the county clerk and deliver to plaintiff\u2019s attorney a stipulation that it will on the trial of any of the actions herein produce in court for inspection of plaintiff and his counsel any of the books, records, and papers mentioned in the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>appealed from which the trial court may direct to be produced, then the order shall be in all respects reversed, without.costs. In case the defendant shall refuse to file and deliver such stipulation, then the order appealed from, after striking therefrom that part requiring a deposit of books, as so modified, is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
