The deceased and another employe of the defendants got on the elevator with handtrucks to be taken up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>in the defendants\u2019 building in which they worked. After the elevator had gone a few feet the bottom of it was torn out and the deceased fell to the basement and was killed. It was being run by the person employed by the defendants to run it. There was evidence that the elevator was in the habit of shaking and tilting, and of jerking as though the sides of the bottom caught. That the floor or bottom was caught in the shaft and torn out at the time of the accident is beyond doubt. That alone would make the maxim that the thing speaks for itself apply. But the defendants tried to make it appear that the accident happened by one of the handtrucks projecting and being caught at the top of the opening of the shaft at the floor above. It cannot be said that this was shown as matter of law, if at all. No one saw that happen, and the handtrucks wrere frail, one being of papier mach\u00e9 and the other made of a packing box. The jury might have found that if one or both of them had projected in the way claimed, they could not have caused the strong bolted plank floor of the elevator to be torn away as it was. Moreover, the handtrucks do not seem to have had any injury which they might not have received from their fall to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">The exception should be sustained and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions sustained-, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
