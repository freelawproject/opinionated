On January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number><em>25, </em>1906, a motion was made to \u201ccorrect\u201d the judgment. This motion came on to be heard on January 29th, and an order was entered which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">\u201cThat the judgment of dismissal rendered herein on the 16th day of January, 1906, in f\u00e1vor of defendant and against the plaintiffs, be, and the same hereby is, corrected by giving and rendering a judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant for the sum of $17.40, with interest amounting to 87 cents, amounting, in all, to $18.27, as conceded due by the defendant on the trial hereof, as appears by the stenographer\u2019s minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The only power given a justice of the Municipal Court to \u201cvacate, amend, or modify any judgment\u201d rendered by him is conferred by section 254 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws \u00cd902, p. 1563, c. 580). A motion to \u201ccorrect\u201d a judgment is simply another way of asking for an amendment or modification \"of a judgment. Even if a trial justice can, under the guise of a modification of a judgment, entirely change it from being in favor of a party to one against him, the motion for such purpose must be made within the statutory time (five days),which was not done in this case.
