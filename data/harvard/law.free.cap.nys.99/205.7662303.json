The defendant counterclaimed a demand for goods returned in excess of the quantity not paid for. The proof developed disputed questions of fact, the determination of which required a judgment either for the plaintiff or for the defendant on his counterclaim. At the close of the whole case the justice dismissed the complaint on the merits. Section 348 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1561, c. 580) provides for a dismissal without prejudice to a new action, and section 349, so far as material, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-14\">\u201cJudgment that the action be dismissed on the merits with costs may be rendered in the following cases: (1) Where, at the close of the whole case, the court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">It is plain that the dismissal \u201con the merits\u201d must have proceeded on the theory that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover as matter of law; but a disputed question of fact could not be disposed of as one of law. Had the plaintiff entirely failed to prove his cause of action, the question would have been one of law; but even then a nonsuit, instead of a dismissal on the merits, would have been required unless the justice could say upon the whole case as a matter of law that the plaintiff could not recover in any event. By reading together the two sections referred to, supra, their purpose is made obvious. Where, on a new trial, the plaintiff might supply some defect in his proof, a non-suit is proper. Where upon the whole case the justice can see that the plaintiff can never recover as matter of law, a dismissal on the merits is proper. In this case neither one was proper, but a determination of the disputed qeustions of fact was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must therefore be reversed, and a new'trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
