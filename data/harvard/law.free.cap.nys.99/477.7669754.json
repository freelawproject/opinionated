On October 19, 1904, plaintiff\u2019s assignors, Ferris &amp; Kenworthy, shipped to Buffalo two cases of duplicators, consigned to \u201cFerris &amp; Kenworthy, or order, notify J. H. Smith, Buffalo, N. Y.\u201d The property was unclaimed at Buffalo, and under section 46 of the railroad law was stored in a storage warehouse. On October 23,1905, Charles A. Kenworthy called at the office of L. M. Allen, the general Eastern freight agent of defendant, told a Mr. Luyster, an employ\u00e9 of defendant, that the goods in question had been the subject of a lawsuit, and that he had just got the bill of lading, and asked what he thought the charges would be on it, stating that if they were going to be heavy he \u201cwould rather go without the goods than pay twice what they are worth.\u201d Luyster informed him, \u201cYou have got to take that chance.\" Whereupon Kenworthy said, \u201cAll right,\u201d gave him the original bill of lading, and took a duplicate bill as a receipt, signing at the same time an indemnity agreement which constituted defendant plaintiff\u2019s assignors\u2019 agent for the purpose of returning the shipment to them (Ferris &amp; Ken worthy), and agreed to save the company harmless \u201cfrom any lawsuit, legal proceeding, loss, damage, expense, counsel fees, costs, and charges arising from or caused by your attempt to comply with this request.\u201d It appears that the duplicate bill of lading was incorrectly dated October 19, 1905, instead of October 19, 1904. The indemnity agreement seems to have had the date changed, but the agent who made it out swears that when it was signed it was dated 1905. However this may be, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ant\u2019s agent, Allen, wrote to the Buffalo agent, Pollock, ordering the goods returned.. In that letter of advice the waybill was referred to as simply October 19th, no year being given. The Buffalo agent was unable to locate the shipment, and so notified the New York agent, Allen, by a penciled memorandum on the foot of his (Allen\u2019s) letter, which was returned. Allen\u2019s letter was dated October 27, 1905, and the reply from Pollock, the Buffalo \u2022 agent, was received October 31, 1905. Nothing further was done by the railroad company, and the goods were sold by the warehouse in Buffalo on November 7, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Plaintiff seeks -to hold the defendant responsible on the theory that they were negligent in not having gotten the goods from the storage warehouse between the dates of October 23, 1905, and November 7, 1905. It seems to be apparent that the defendant\u2019s agent, who had the original waybill, was careless in not making out the duplicate waybill as of 1905, instead of 1904, and also making the same mistake as to the indemnity agreement; and the letter of Allen to Pollock was written carelessly, in that it contained no year date, and hence failed to secure a prompt location of the shipment. As to this defendant contends that Kenworthy signed the indemnity receipt when it was incorrectly dated, and also took away the duplicate waybill bearing an incorrect date. That is no doubt true. But the indemnity receipt and the duplicate waybill were made out by defendant\u2019s own agent, and he had in his possession and the company retained throughout the original waybill, which contained the correct date and upon which they were bound to act. It is clear that with ordinary diligence, inasmuch as they put the goods in the storage warehouse and must have held its receipt, they could have located the shipment and started it back before November 7th, when the goods were sold. They cannot deny the authority of Euyster to contract for them. The indemnity agreement is addressed to Allen, their general Eastern freight agent, and his letter to Pollock, the Buffalo agent, is a sufficient ratification of the contract of employment, whatever that may be. I am of opinion that the contract was sufficient to hold the defendant liable. Kenworthy gave them the waybill, and, as the goods were still constructively in their possession, they should have made proper efforts to return them. They (the defendants) were specially constituted Eerris &amp; Kenworthy\u2019s agents for this purpose, and were indemnified for all expenses, \u201ccosts and charges\u201d being particularly specified, which would, it seems, require them to pay the warehouse lien, if necessary, and see that.the goods were shipped back; or, if that was impossible, it was at least incumbent upon the company to notify Ferris &amp; Kenworthy that they might make such arrangements to defray this expense as were necessary.. They failed to use ordinary diligence, and they failed because of the carelessness of an employ\u00e9 to locate the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
