Shea as maker and defendant Annie A. Shea as indorser. Said Thomas J. Shea, the maker, does not defend the action. There is a very sharp conflict of evidence as to the facts, and the jury found for the defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">It is conceded that before maturity the indorsement of said Annie A. Shea was canceled. This was done by a representative of defendant\u2019s attorney, who scratched out the indorser\u2019s name in the presence of plaintiff. The parties were negotiating with respect to claims of each against the other, and it is the contention of defendant that as a part of a compromise plaintiff consented to the cancellation of said indorsement. Plaintiff, on the other hand, claims he never authorized such cancellation and protested against the same.' He further claims that there was no consideration for such cancellation. Even so, if he did, in point of fact, authorize and agree to this cancellation, the indorser was released, as a person secondarily liable on a negotiable instrument is discharged \u201cby the intentional cancellation of his signature by the holder.\u201d Negotiable Instruments Act, Laws 1897, p. 744, c. 612, \u00a7 201; Larkin v. Hardenbrook, 90 N. Y. 333, 43 Am. Rep. 176; Schwartzman v. Post, 94 App. Div. 474, 84 N. Y. Supp. 922, 87 N. Y. Supp. 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The fact that the crossing out of the indorser\u2019s name was made, not by the plaintiff personally, but by defendant\u2019s representative in his presence, was a fact which the jury might have considered in <em>determining </em>whether the plaintiff\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s version of the facts was the correct one. They believed the defendant\u2019s version. It is not sufficient, for the purpose of a reversal on the ground that the result is against the weight of evidence, that the appellate court may have reached a different conclusion upon the facts than that arrived at by the jury, if there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict. In order to justify a reversal, it must clearly appear that the fair preponderance of proof is really on the side of the defeated party. Lorenz v. Jackson, 88 Hun, 202, 34 N. Y. Supp. 652; Clinton v. Frear, 107 App. Div. 571, 95 N. Y. Supp. 321. In the case at bar there is considerable evidence, which, if believed, justifies the verdict. This evidence the jury were at liberty to believe, and the appellate court does not feel warranted in setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The learned counsel for the appellant urges that the court erroneously charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">\u201cWhenever any signature on a note appears to have been cancelled, the burden of proof lies upon the party who alleges the cancellation was made under mistake or without authority: and therefore the plaintiff in this case has the burden of proof to establish that fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">There was no error here. Negotiable Instruments Law, Laws 1897, p. 744, c. 613, \u00a7 \"304, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cA cancellation made unintentionally or under a mistake or without the authority of the holder is inoperative; but where an instrument or any signature thereon appears to have been cancelled, the burden of proof lies on the party who alleges that the cancellation was made unintentionally or under a mistake or without authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In the case at bar the signature of the indorser appeared to have been canceled, and plaintiff claimed it was canceled without authority. The burden, therefore, was on him to show that it was so canceled without authority. There are no other exceptions that require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
