V. Kinsey, Eastern manager of the defendant. The defendant denied that the goods were sold to Kinsey on its behalf or for its benefit, and denied his authority to purchase goods for it, claiming he was merely an agent for the purpose of securing and forwarding orders to be filled by defendant. All the goods were delivered to Kinsey or to the Photoscope Company, and the bills therefor were made out against Kinsey as the debtor, and not against the defendant. The plaintiffs accepted a note of the Photoscope Company in payment of the claim in suit and in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cRec\u2019d payment by note Nov. 1st, 1904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201cJohn G. IClumpp\u2019s Sons, per E. D. S.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">But, notwithstanding this, they decided to sue defendant after the note was protested for nonpayment. Plaintiffs contend that the defendant\u2019s liability is established by the fact that in giving two orders for goods Kinsey used the defendant\u2019s letter head on which he is described as \u201cEastern Manager,\u201d and which he signed \u201cAmerican Hardware Mfg. Co., E. M. ICinsey, Eastern Manager.\u201d The unauthorized use of the letter heads does not bind the defendant. The record abundantly shows that the goods were ordered by Kinsey on his own behalf; that defendant knew nothing about the orders, and never received any benefit from them. No cause of action against defendant was made out on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">There are exceptions in the record which were taken by defendant, and which require a reversal of the judgment and order, but it is not necessary to consider them. The motion to dismiss the complaint at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case should have been granted, and the motion for a n\u00e9w trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The order must be reversed, motion granted, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
