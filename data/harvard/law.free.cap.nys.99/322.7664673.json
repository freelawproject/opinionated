Except for certain admissions made by the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s case rested upon his own testimony. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to establish a cause of action. This motion was granted, and judgment for $10 costs was rendered against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We must conclude from this record that the learned trial justice refused to believe the plaintiff and on that ground dismissed the complaint. We can find no good reason in the record for thus rejecting plaintiff\u2019s testimony. His character was not impeached, and he was uncontradicted, although he gave the number of the car and of the conductor who refused to give the transfer. ITis story was not improbable. Plaintiff\u2019s statement, if true, entitled him to judgment. Under the circumstances we think it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
