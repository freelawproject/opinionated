C., and was engaged in the further business of buying and selling cotton and various stocks. One Bramham for some years had been in his employ as secretary, stenographer, and bookkeeper. In December, 1903, Bramham began the buying and selling of cotton through the plaintiffs, as brokers, in the name of defendant, which he signed to all orders, telegrams, and letters; the plaintiffs supposing the communications were from the defendant himself. The first transaction resulted in no profit or loss. The second produced a profit of $400, for which plaintiffs sent a check payable to defendant. The last transaction was an order to sell 2,000 bales of March cotton, which order was filled and closed on the same day, resulting in a loss including commissions of $4,900. All these orders which were closely connected were executed by the plaintiffs without demanding margin from the defendant; they knowing him by reputation as a man of means and large dealings. Subsequent correspondence.with respect to adjustment of the loss, in the course of which the $400 check was returned and credited, disclosed the fact that Bramham had used defendant\u2019s name and as claimed by defendant without authority. This action was brought to charge the defendant with the loss sustained. The plaintiffs\u2019 theory on the trial was that Bramham had actual authority, or, if not, that the defendant had ratified his acts. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that neither actual authority nor ratification had been shown. This motion was granted, and from the judgment entered thereon the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The plaintiffs were compelled to call Bramham as a witness, and, although he appeared quite unwilling to tell all the facts, he did testify that, when the defendant was ill or away from home, it had been his custom to draw checks on defendant\u2019s bank account for incidental expenses connected with the general business, and under instruction to honor drafts generally or specifically connected with calls for additional margin upon various speculations, and to look after defendant\u2019s affairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>generally; that he had closed some business matters when defendant was not present; that in February, 1903, when defendant visited California for several months, for the benefit of his health, defendant\u2019s various accounts (presumably with brokers) were transferred to his (Bramham\u2019s) name, and that he carried them and managed them; that the $400 check received from plaintiffs as profit on the second transaction was credited on defendant\u2019s books, and the memorandum kept therewith placed on defendant\u2019s files, relating to speculative accounts; that defendant was sick at the time he opened the account with plaintiffs, and was confined to his house and could not be seen or consulted with respect to business affairs which continued until the dealings with plaintiffs were closed; that he'gave the order to sell the 2,000 bales of March cotton to meet an \u201cemergency\u201d which had arisen \u201cat the office\u201d; and that prior to the transaction in controversy he had had transactions in stocks and cotton in defendant\u2019s name in many different instances. While the trial court refused to permit the plaintiffs to show what the defendant said concerning these many transactions carried on in his name, it is fair to assume he did not repudiate them, for he kept Bramham continuously in his employ, except that he discharged him for the period of one day on account of the transaction in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We think the facts thus proven by the plaintiffs established prima facie authority on the part of Bramham to deal with the plaintiffs in defendant\u2019s name. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs did not establish ratification by defendant of Bramham\u2019s transactions with the plaintiffs. What the defendant said and did on the occasion when Bramham told him what he had done, and how it had resulted, can very fairly be taken as indicating that Bramham in fact had authority to do precisely what he did. Instead of repudiating Bramham\u2019s acts and declaring that he had no authority to open an account with plaintiffs, and to give the orders with respect to the sales of cotton, defendant simply said it ought not to have been done without consulting him, and that he made enough mistakes himself without anybody helping him to make them, and that Bramham would have to take the matt\u00e9r up and try and effect a settlement with plaintiffs. The defendant was suffering not only from ill health, but from domestic troubles, at this time, and the reply which Bramham made was that he very deeply regretted having brought this misfortune upon the defendant, to add to the misfortunes which he already had, and that it was such an error of judgment on his part that if he could, from his salary of $15 a week, make the loss good he would be glad to do so, to which defendant made no response. From what was thus said and done, as well as from what was not said, it might legitimately be inferred that the defendant recognized that Bramham had authority to do what he did, and simply reprimanded him for doing it so badly and without advice. This, added to the proof of actual authority, made a prima facie case against the defendant, and the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was therefore improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">It is urged that, even-though Bramham had authority, the defendant is not liable, because the transaction was a mere gambling one, and that the complaint was properly dismissed on that ground. This ground was not urged in the court below, and, while we might have the power, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>do not feel called upon, under the circumstances, to decide on this appeal whether the contract was an illegal one or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
