The plaintiffs appeared and set forth their objections in an affidavit, calling attention to the dual form of the application, in that the application, if made under sections 870 and 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure, must be made to a judge (Heishon v. Life Ins. Co., 77 N. Y. 278), and that, if made under section 805 of the Code, such application must be made by petition and not upon affidavits (Bloodgood v. Slayback, 62 App. Div. 315, 71 N. Y. Supp. 809) ; but the motion was granted, and two orders were entered, from both of which orders the plaintiffs appeal. These orders fall exactly within the case above quoted, and for that reason must be reversed. The other reasons urged by the appellants need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Orders reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">McCALL, J., concurs; LEVENTRITT, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
