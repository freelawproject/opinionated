From a judgment for defendants, plaintiff appeals. Judgment for defendant Waldron reversed, and new .trial granted, and judgment for defendant Charles E. Cudney affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-26\">The action is brought upon a promissory note made by the defendant Waldron and indorsed by the defendants Cudney and Ramsey. On March 14, 1905, after the note became due the defendant Waldron gave the plaintiff\u2019s agents a check for $100, which was paid and another check dated April 1, 1905, for $100 and two notes of equal amount for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>balance due on the first note, both indorsed by Cudney and Ramsey. The old note was retained by the plaintiff. The check dated April 1st, for $100 was not paid at maturity and the plaintiff thereupon brought this suit upon the original note against the maker and indorsers, the complaint containing the usual allegations as to nonpayment, protest and notice thereof to the indorsers. The defendant Ramsey did not answer, and judgment has gone against him by default. The defense interposed was a denial and an allegation that the note had been paid. The plaintiff on the trial tendered\" to the defendant the unpaid check and notice of protest thereof and the two renewal notes and offered to surrender them, which offer the defendant\u2019s counsel declined to accept. At the close of the proofs the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint but directed a verdict in favor of both defendants, and the plaintiff excepted. From the judgment entered on the verdict so directed, the plaintiff has appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b590-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

The burden of proof to show that the old note was paid rested upon the defendants, it having been taken in payment \u00f3f a precedent debt. Hall v. Stevens, 116 N. Y. 201, at page 206, 22 N. E. 374, 5 L. R. A. 802. I do not think it can be said that they satisfied this burden, as a matter of law. Whether the taking of the checks and the renewal notes constituted a payment of the note sued upon depends upon the intention of the parties as manifested by the facts and circumstances attending the transaction. Matter of Utica Nat. Brewing Co., 154 N. Y. 268, 48 N. E. 521. The only evidence upon the subject was given by the defendants themselves. They were interested witnesses, and, although not contradicted, a question of fact was presented as to their credibility and the weighfto be given to their testimony. Honegger v. Wettstein et al., 94 N. Y. 252; C. H. Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 191, at page 200, 25 N. E. 402, 10 L. R. A. 676. More than this, most of their testimony was not as to any facts upon the subject of payment, but only as to conclusions. For instance, the defendant Waldron testified with respect to the new notes and checks that the plaintiff\u2019s manager \u201caccepted them as payment\u201d and in answer to the question, \u201cThe renewal notes you gave him that day you gave him for payment?\u201d he answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The defendant Ramsey was asked to state what took place at the time the renewal notes were made and he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201cMr. Utterbaek (the plaintiffs agent) asked me to sign these notes and I said I would and he said he would return\u2019 the old note to Waldron. Q. Did you say you would sign it on the ground that the other note was paid? A. Yes, he said he would send it, and it was all satisfactory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>There was nothing else testified to as to what was said by the plaintiff\u2019s agent at the time the renewal notes and the checks were given from which it could be inferred that the agreement between them was that they were taken in payment. When testimony of this character is given by interested parties and the old note is in fact retained by the payee it cannot be said as matter of law that it has been proven that the new notes were taken in payment, and it was, therefore, error to direct a verdict for the defendant Waldron. With respect to the defendant Cudney a different question is presented. He was an indorser, and denied that the note had been duly protested. The burden to show this was on the plaintiff, as Cudney had served notice with his answer that he had not received notice of protest. The only proof given by the plaintiff on the subject of service of notice was that given by the notary in whose hands the note was placed for protest. He testified that the note contained no designation of the address of either of the indorsers, Ramsey or Cudney, and that notices for the several indorsers were mailed to the bank at Jackson, Mich, (where plaintiff\u2019s principal office was located), \u201cinclosed in an envelope directed to them and accompanied by a postage stamp for mailing notices to the. indorsers.\u201d It was shown that the Jackson bank was a subsequent indorser; but there was no evidence that this bank ever sent the notice to Cudney, who had resided at Corinth, Saratoga county, for 18 years. This was the only notice shown to have been addressed to him, but as this was not mailed to him, but to the Michigan bank, the plaintiff failed to show a fact essential in establishing its cause of action against him. Cudney was also sworn in his own behalf and said that he had never received notice of presentment or protest. There was no conflict in the evidence in this respect, and the court, therefore, properly directed a verdict in his favor on the ground that it had not been shown that he was properly charged as indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The judgment as against the defendant Waldron should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event; and the judgment as against the defendant Cudney should be affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">All concur, except PARKER, P. J., not voting, and COCHRANE, J., who concurs in result as to the defendant Cudney and dissents as to the defendant Waldron.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
