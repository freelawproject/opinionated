J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">The action is brought to recover damages to personal property alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant. While the plaintiff\u2019s servants were driving his team and wagon in the borough of Queens on the night of January <em>25, </em>1905, a collision occurred with one of the defendant\u2019s cars, damaging the wagon and knocking down one of the horses. The horse received bruises upon its side which, while severe, were not essentially serious in character. There were bruises on his shoulder, an abrasion of the skin on his fetlocks, and sores and swellings of the cords from the hock to the fetlocks. A witness, presumably a verterinarian, testified that at the plaintiff\u2019s request he treated the horse on January 31st, February 3d, and 5th. After the last-named date, he saw the horse on the 15th of February, dead. The judgment recovered is chiefly for the value of the horse. There was, however, no evidence in the case tending to prove that the horse either could or did die from the injuries which were received in the collision; and, while there is an intimation or suggestion contained in the evidence offered on behalf of the defendant that the injuries might have produced the death of the \"horse by the supervention of blood poisoning or lockjaw, there is no evidence that they did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s witness who prescribed for the horse was asked the question: \u201cWhen you saw him there was nothing in his injuries to make you think he was going to die?\u201d to which he replied: \u201cWell, the horse was improving.\u201d The veterinary surgeon called by the defendant testified that he examined the horse on February 1st, thai he found certain abrasions only, that most of them were then beginning to heal, that he thought they were of at least a week or 10 days\u2019 standing, and, when asked if the horse could die by reason of any of the injuries which he found when he made his examination, he answered, no; that the injuries themselves could not kill. It is true that he dio suggest, as already stated, that the injuries could have produced death by the intervention of lockjaw and blood poisoning, but that they ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tually did so produce the death of the horse there is no word of proof to be found in the case. It was easy to make direct proof of the cause of death, even without a post mortem. It was sufficient for the plaintiff to prove that the injuries inflicted upon the horse were adequate to cause death, or, if not adequate of themselves, that they afterwards resulted in a condition which was an adequate cause of death, and that nothing but the accident had occurred to which the death could be \u25a0 attributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The court erred in instructing the jury to the effect that in the absence of evidence as to the cause of death there was a legal presumption that it occurred from the accident. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to establish the death as a result of the accident by a fair prepondci \u2022\u2022 anee of evidence, and there is no presumption of law in favor of the claim. The question was duly raised by a motion to strike out all the testimony as to the value of the horse, on the ground that it had not been shown t\u00a1hat the injuries caused his death, and by an exception taken to the submission of the question to the jury. The court charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cThere is no absolute testimony that these injuries were the cause of the death of the horse. That simply left a presumption. They had medical men on the stand, and neither of them testified that these injuries caused his death. It is for you to determine that. You must take into consideration the testimony of Dr. Wright, that when he left the horse last the horse was in good condition and getting better under his treatment\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u201e The logic of the verdict under this charge is that the jury, having absolutely no evidence that the injuries either did cause or could have caused the horse\u2019s death, and being obliged to take into consideration the fact that when last seen by a surgeon he was in good condition and getting better under treatment, must have determined the cause of death adversely to the defendant on the presumption alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
