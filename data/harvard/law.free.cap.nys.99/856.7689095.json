One David H. Hammond and Maggie Hammond, his wife, occupied the plaintiff\u2019s farm as tenants. They had in their possession certain personal property of the plaintiff\u2019s including a team of horses. These horses they were authorized to exchange for other horses. On June 6, 1904, the defendant, one of the firm of Hall &amp; Clark, sold and delivered to the said David H. Hammond one horse, and in payment thereof took one of the horses belonging to the plaintiff, and also took a paper writing, which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b884-18\">\u201c8100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AG4h\">Walton, Delaware Co., N.

The same was not paid upon September 6th, the due date thereof, but upon September 8, 1904, $25 was paid thereon and indorsed thereon by the bank. Upon the 3 0th day of November, 1904, this horse, together with other personal property and the farm, was surrendered and transferred by David H. Hammond and his wife to the plaintiff. Upon the 12th day of November the plaintiff notified the defendant of this transfer, and notified him that he wished to redeem what was against the horse, and asked him if he should leave the money at the bank. In the meantime the horse had been loaned to DaVid H. Hammond by plaintiff to transfer his goods, and had been by David Hammond surrendered up to defendant. This surrender was after defendant had received plaintiff\u2019s notification. Upon the said 12th day of November the plaintiff and defendant met, and the defendant demanded the sum of $85 as a condition of releasing the horse to the plaintiff. Thereafter,, and upon that day and after banking hours, the defendant saw the president of the said bank, and told him to charge that note up to his account, which the president of the bank promised to do. Upon Monday morning, November 14th, at about the time of the opening of the bank, the plaintiff went to the bank and saw the cashier, and asked what was due upon the note. The amount was figured up, and the plaintiff drew his check for the amount from funds which were in the bank at the time, and delivered the same to the cashier of the bank. Upon the next day the plaintiff came into the bank and withdrew his check, and deposited the full amount in cash for the defendant. Of this the defendant was notified, and he refused to receive the same. After the giving of the check by the plaintiff upon the 14th day of November, the bank did in fact charge the note to the account of the defendant. Thereafter the plaintiff demanded the possession of the horse from the defendant, which demand was refused, and this action was brought to recover its possession. Upon the trial of the action the ease was submitted to the court, which decided that the plaintiff was not entitled to the possession of the horse, and dismissed his complaint. From the judgment entered upon this decision, this appeal has been taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b885-7\">Argued before SMITH, CHESTER, KELLOGG, and COCH-RANE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b885-8\">A. G. Patterson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b885-9\">Alexander Neish, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b885-10\">SMITH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AolG\">The first question to be determined is as to the rights of the parties under the paper executed between David H. Hammond and Hall &amp; Clark upon June 6, 1904. That paper was executed contemporaneously with the purchase of the horse, and must be deemed .to be the entire contract between the parties. The purchase price of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>article sold may be secured in either of two ways\u2014first, by a conditional sale, through which the title is reserved in the vendor until the purchase price is paid; secondly, by a chattel mortgage given back by the purchaser. While the object to be accomplished by either form of security is substantially the same, the rights of the parties under the two forms of security are materially different. Hence the importance of determining, first, whether this paper constituted a conditional sale, which would thus become subject to the statutes governing the rights of parties under conditional sales, or whether such paper constituted a transfer of title and a chattel mortgage back, and should be construed in the light of well-settled decisions governing the rights of mortgagors and mortgagees under such an instrument. It seems clear to me that this paper is an instrument of conditional sale. A chattel mortgage cannot be given unless the mortgagor has title, and under this instrument no title ever passed from Hall &amp; Clark to David H. Hammond. While there are some provisions in the contract which are ordinarily found in chattel mortgages, none of them are inconsistent with a contract of conditional sale; and, were it otherwise, the fact that no title passed at the time of the sale to David H. Hammond would preclude the possibility of construing the instrument as a chattel mortgage. The parties chose to secure the purchase price by a contract of conditional sale, and thereby subjected themselves to the statutory restrictions and regulations of the rights of parties under such a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">If, then, this be a conditional sale, David H. Hammond at any time before the&gt; sale of the horse by the defendant had the right to redeem that horse upon the payment of the amount due upon the note. Lien Law, Laws 1897, c. 418, pp. 535, 540, \u00a7\u00a7 83, 112. While the lease of the farm and of the property was in form by plaintiff to Maggie Hammond, the fact is undisputed that David Hammond was the active party, and was leasing the property in the name of his wife, and that upon November 10th both David Hammond and his wife transferred to the plaintiff their interest in this horse, which would transfer all the rights of either of them under this contract. Defendant refused to surrender to the plaintiff this horse except upon payment in excess of that which was due upon the note. The plaintiff\u2019s offer to pay the amount due upon the note at the bank where the note was held, and his deposit of the money therein to pay the same, with full notice to defendant, is a sufficient tender, so as to entitle him to the possession of the horse, under section 83 of the lien law before cited. The judgment should therefore be reversed upon the law and the facts, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
