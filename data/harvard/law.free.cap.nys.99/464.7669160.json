The complaint was- dismissed as to both defendants on different grounds. This appeal is only from the judgment dismissing the complaint as to the defendant Joy Steamship Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">This defendant is a common carrier, and undertook to convey the goods from Boston to New York. The goods were delivered in a greatly damaged condition, but the court below dismissed the complaint on the ground that a release under seal was executed by plaintiff\u2019s agent against any damages occasioned by defendant\u2019s negligence, in consideration of the reduced rate at which the shipment was made. The plaintiff and a truckman named Brown took the goods to defendant\u2019s pier in Boston to have been placed on defendant\u2019s boat for transportation to New York. The plaintiff was in a great hurry, and there were a large number of people ahead of him. He therefore told Brown to deliver the goods to defendant, to get a \u201creceipt\u201d for the same, and to deliver said receipt to plaintiff\u2019s wife. The said Brown did so deliver the goods, and got a bill of lading in return for said goods, in which Brown was named as \u201cowner or shipper\u201d and the plaintiff as consignee. At the same time defendant\u2019s agent handed Brown the release in question and told him to sign it. Brown did so. The release, of course, remained in possession of defendant. Plaintiff sought to show that he in no way authorized Brown to sign said release, but was not allowed to do so. Still the evidence does show that plaintiff merely told Brown to get \u201cthe receipt\u201d for the goods, upon delivering them to defendant, and to give such \u201creceipt\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s wife. It may be remarked that, aside from the fact that the release recites that it is given in consideration for transporting the goods at \u201creduced rates,\u201d there is no evidence whatever that the rates were, in point of fact, in any degree reduced. There is no doubt that a common carrier may limit its liability by contract in consideration of a reduced rate for transportation. Zimmer v. Railroad Co., 137 N. Y. 460, 33 N. E. 642; Kenney v. Ry. Co., 125 N. Y. 422, 26 N. E. 626. Nevertheless such contract must be accepted by the shipper or his agent. The release was signed \u201cM. Brown,\u201d and nothing appears in said release to indicate that Brown acted for anybody but himself. He was never authorized by the plaintiff to sign said release, nor is there anything to indicate that plaintiff in directing Brown to deliver the goods and take a \u201creceipt\u201d therefor, had the remotest anticipation that any such release was io be demanded by the defendant. Brown himself does not appear to have read the release, or had his attention called specifically to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>provisions. He merely signed it mechanically at the bidding of defendant\u2019s agent, who says he told him to sign \u201cthis release.\u201d Brown- was a mere truckman, as defendant\u2019s agent well knew. It seems to us that the judgment and order appealed from should be.reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event..</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
