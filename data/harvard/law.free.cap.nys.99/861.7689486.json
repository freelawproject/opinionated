This motion was granted, with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint upon payment of $5 costs to the defendant, and an order was entered to that effect, and from that order the plaintiff appeals.

Hunken, 40 App. Div. 129, 131, 57 N. Y. Supp. 712), and that such a motion should be treated as a demurrer. Treating it as a demurrer, a judgment should have been entered thereon from which an appeal could have been taken. The order appealed from is not one of the orders from which an appeal may be taken. Leavitt v. Katzoff, 43 Misc. Rep. 26, 86 N. Y. Supp. 495. Neither does an appeal lie from an order sustaining or overruling a demurrer. It must be taken from the judgment. Smith v. Ely (Sup.) 92 N.
