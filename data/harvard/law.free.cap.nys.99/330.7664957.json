There is no allegation from whicn we can tell in what respect the defendants failed in the discharge of their duty to the deceased, and certainly there is nothing which apprises the defendants of the particular act or omission with which they are charged. Judging from the argument and the brief of the learned district attorney, it must have been assumed that the defendants did noL furnish any medicines, medical care, or attendance, but this is not the allegation of the indictment, and if in fact they undertook to furnish any, in what particular they failed to discharge their duty is left wholly to conjecture. The standard for determining what is proper and necessary medical care is too variable for that expression to be used as the description of a definite act. Obviously, nothing more than the mere conclusion of the pleader is alleged, and no fact is stated iron! which we can ascertain what particular act or omission is relied upon as constituting the crime. In the case of People <em>v. </em>Buddensieck, 103 N. Y. 487, 9 N. E. 44, <em>57 </em>Am. Rep. 766, relied upon by the appellant, the acts of negligence were circumstantially described. In the case of People v. Pierson, 176 N. Y. 201, 68 N. E. 243, 63 L. R. A. 187, 98 Am. St. Rep. 666, the indictment charged a violation of section 288 of the Penal Code in the omission, without lawful excuse, to furnish any medical attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As the indictment fails to apprise us of the particular acts or omissions relied upon as constituting the crime, it would be profitless to discuss the other questions presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The order of the County Court of Westchester County sustaining the demurrers to the indictment should be affirmed. All concur, except HOOKER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
