S. 105) to review a judgment of the Court of Claims holding that where the plaintiff was admittedly indebted to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a Government agency, for a balance due on the corporation\u2019s participation in a bank loan to plaintiff; and where the Government was admittedly indebted to the plaintiff for refund of processing and floor stock taxes paid by it under'the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the amount due to the plaintiff for such refund was properly set off against the balance due by the plaintiff to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">The judgment of the Court of Claims was <em>affirmed </em>by the Supreme Court March 25, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">Mr. Justice Black delivered the opinion of the Court, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-18\">1.

The purpose of the statute (28 U. S. Code 250) giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear and determine all set-off's and counterclaims or other demands on the part of the Government against any claimant was to permit the Government to have adjudicated in one suit all controversies between it and those granted permission to sue it, whether the Government\u2019s interest had been entrusted to its agencies of one kind or another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">4. An indebtedness owing by the plaintiff to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a claim or \u201cdemand on the part of the Government\u201d against plaintiff which the Government could set up as a counterclaim in the Court of Claims, under the statute, in an action by plaintiff to recover an indebtedness owing by the-Government for taxes illegally collected.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
