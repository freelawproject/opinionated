H. Vaughn and for a declaratory judgment brought by the executors and trustees under the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased. The prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>cipal question involved is whether an $830,000 Trust should be established for Gary William Vaughn, an adopted son of G. H. Vaughn, Jr., when the will reads that the trustees shall immediately create and establish such a trust only in the event \u201c* * <em>* </em>any child of my son, G. H. Vaughn, Jr., is <em>born </em>after my death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">The will involved was executed on April 16, 1954. G. H. Vaughn died on November 8, 1955, and the will was duly probated on November 28, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The will provided for the creation of \u201cInitial Trusts.\u201d It also made provision for the creation by the trustees of \u201cNew Trusts\u201d under certain conditions. The will directed that upon the death of the testator the trustees, G. H. Vaughn, Jr., J. C. Vaughn, and Dallas National Bank, Dallas, Texas, \u201cshall partition and divide the trust property into two parts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of equal value, which shall be designated, respectively, Part One and Part Two. * * *.\u201d Part One was to be created by said trustees for the primary benefit of G. H. Vaughn, Jr., and his children and more remote descendants. Part Two, in identical language, was to be for the benefit of J. C. Vaughn and his children and more remote descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Both G. H. Vaughn, Jr. and J. C. Vaughn survived the testator, G. H. Vaughn. G. H. Vaughn, Jr., a natural child of the decedent, had one natural child, namely, G. H. Vaughn, III. This child was born March 14, 1942, before the death of the testator. The respondent, Gary William Vaughn, was born on July 2, 1956, after the death of G. H. Vaughn, the testator. G. H. Vaughn, Jr. legally adopted Gary William on November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>26, 1956. The will directs that upon the death of the testator the trustees shall divide and partition Part One into several trusts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of equal value. We are only concerned with the question of whether Part One should be divided by creating a separate equal trust for Gary William Vaughn, adopted by G. H, Vaughn, Jr. after the decedent\u2019s death, just as though he had been a natural child born to G. H. Vaughn, Jr. after the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The suit was tried to the court without the intervention of a jury. The petition for a declaratory judgment submitted eight questions involving the construction of the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased. The trial court answered these questions in the affirmative. The answers pertinent to this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u201c1. (a) That a new, separate, equal and distinct trust be created under paragraph (C) of Section IV of the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased, for the benefit of Gary William Vaughn, such trust to be designated by the name of Gary William Vaughn.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u201c8. That for all purposes in determining the benefiiciaries and construing the rights under the terms of the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased, Gary William Vaughn and his children or more remote descendants or any of them shall be entitled to the same benefits as the natural children born unto G. H. Vaughn, Jr. and J. C. Vaughn after the death of G. H. Vaughn and their children or more remote descendants; and any child legally adopted under the laws of the State of Texas by G. H. Vaughn, Jr., and/or J. C. Vaughn who were born after the death of G. H. Vaughn shall be considered the child, descendant, and heir at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>law of the adoptive father and grand-child, descendant, and heir at law of G. H. Vaughn, deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\">The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 328 S.W. 2d 326. The affirmance sustained respondent\u2019s position that Article 46a, Section 9,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vernon\u2019s Annotated Civil Statutes of Texas, is controlling in determining the intention of the testator, and that under such statutes it should be presumed the testator intended to include Gary William Vaughn. The judgments of both courts are based upon the contention of respondents that Article 46a, Section 9, supra, both by its plain language and when viewed against the background of legislative history preceding its enactment, clearly provides that when any person in a will or other written instrument makes provision for a \u201cchild,\u201d he shall be deemed to have included adopted children unless a contrary intent is manifested by the use of clear language in the instrument itself. The judgment below sustained the further argument that under the wording of the statutes, it is not the intent of the testator which controls, but the intent attributed to him by the Legislaure. Respondens contend that the true question is whether Gary William Vaughn, the adopted child of G. H. Vaughn, Jr., is to be considered a child within the meaning of the language in the will \u2014 \u201c* * * any child of my son, G. H. Vaughn, Jr.\u201d Respondent, Gary William Vaughn, reasons that for the adopted child to take as a member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of the class established by the testator in his will, it is only necessary that he show himself to be a child of G. H. Vaughn, Jr., and that since this relationship is definitely established, and since the testator used no language in the will expressing an intent to exclude him, the trustees had no alternative but to \u201cimmediately\u201d create and establish a new, separate, and distinct trust for his benefit. In other words, the same character of trust should be created and established as was created and established under the terms of the will for G. H. Vaughn, III, the natural son of G. H. Vaughn, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We have concluded to reverse the judgments of both the trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals and render judgment for the petitioners for the reasons now to be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In determining the right of Gary William Vaughn, the adopted son of G. H. Vaughn, Jr. to require the trustee to create and establish a new, separate, equal, and distinct trust under paragraph (C) of Section IV of the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased, Article 46a Section 9, supra, is not controlling, but such statute may be considered as an aid to the construction of the will. The Legislature no doubt, was clothed with power to confer upon the adopted child the right to inherit \u201cfrom and through\u201d its adoptive parents, but in the case at bar, Gary William Vaughn, the adopted child, is not claiming under the laws of inheritance. He is claiming as a legatee under the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased. Therefore, his rights are dependent on what was intended by the testator, as expressed in the will. The intent of the testator cannot be supplied by a construction of the meaning of the words of the statute wherein it is provided that <em>\u201c* </em>* * such adopted child shall be regarded as a child of the parent or parents by adoption for all other purposes, as well, except that where a deed, will, or other instrument uses words clearly intended to exclude children by adoption, such adopted child shall not be included in such class. * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The statute providing for the status of adopted children, while to be used in aid of construction, cannot control or defeat a will\u2019s true construction. In the case of Central Trust Company v. Hart, 82 Ohio App. 450, 80 N.E. 2d 920, the court, in holding1 that the adopted child took no part of the trust, conceded that the adoption statutes showed the legislative intent to make an adopted child an heir, etc. However, the court went on to say, \u201cBut, we are not confronted here with the problem of determining the legislative intent of the General Assembly, our problem is to determine the testamentary intent of James L. Hart.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The ultimate question, therefore, is, not as to the meaning of any statute, but what was intended by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">In 1 Am. Jur., Sec. 64, p. 664, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u201cIn the matter of construing the rights of an adopted child to take under a will, it should be borne in mind that it is not a question of the right of an adopted child to inherit, but simply a question of the testator\u2019s intention with respect to those who are to share in his estate. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">An examination of G. H. Vaughn\u2019s will in its entirety discloses no purpose to include an adopted child as a beneficiary. To the contrary, the will contains language indicating that the testator contemplated that natural children only of his sons were to be included in the class of persons eligible under his will to have \u201cNew Trusts\u201d created for them. The language \u201cIf, as, and when any child of my son, G. H. Vaughn, Jr., is <em>born </em>after my death * * *\u201d shows that G. H. Vaughn did not intend that a new, separate, and distinct trust should be created for the benefit of the after adopted child, Gary William Vaughn. The use of the words \u201cborn after my death\u201d renders it most improbable that he was referring to children born to strangers. The language is conclusive that he meant to include as members of the class established by the provisions of paragraph (C) of Section IV, supra, only those children who were actually \u201cborn\u201d of his son, G. H. Vaughn, Jr. This conclusion is made inescapable in view of the further provision in the will directing the trustees to immediately after such child is born create the new trust. See Third National Bank and Trust Company v. Davidson, 157 Ohio St. 355, 105 N.E. 2d 573. In that case the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe strongest and almost conclusive indication that testatrix intended only her blood grandchildren to be her beneficiary under the Tenth Codicil is the words she used with reference to them. Those words are: I further direct that out of the net income of said trust fund, such trustee shall pay to each of my then living grandchildren, whether born prior or subsequent to my decease * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In the case of Wachovia Bank and Trust Company v. Green, 239 N. Car. 612, 80 S.E. 2d 771, the court emphasized particularly the use of the words \u201cchildren born\u201d in the will in giving primary consideration to the use of such words. The particular language was: \u201cIn the event any child or children shall hereafter be born to either my said niece or my said nephew, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>child or children shall participate equally with others just named, * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">There is another circumstance that convinces us it was not G. H. Vaughn\u2019s intention to include Gary William Vaughn as an eligible person to have created for him a \u201cnew trust.\u201d G. H. Vaughn created two inter vivos trusts. These trusts were created on January 12, 1946 and December 18, 1951, respectively. In both of these trusts, G. H. Vaughn made specific provisions for adopted children. It is significant that the trust of December 1951 and the will of 1954 were both executed after the effective date of the 1951 amendment to Article 46a, Section 9, supra. The will provides for the children \u201cborn after my death,\u201d and the two trusts provide for adopted children. This distinction makes it clear that it was not the testator\u2019s intention to provide for an adopted child in his will. It is clear that the testator by the use of the word \u201cborn\u201d intended the word to mean natural children.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Since Gary William Vaughn and his children or more remote descendants are not entitled to any benefits of any kind under the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased, the judgments of both the trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals are reversed and here rendered declaring that Gary William Vaughn is not entitled to have created for his benefit a new, separate, and distinct trust, under the provisions of paragraph (C) of Section IV of the will of G. H. Vaughn, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Opinion delivered July 6,1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Rehearing overruled July 27,1960.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. \u2014(A) Upon my death, if my son, G.

When a minor child is adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Article, all legal relationship and all rights and duties between such child and its natural parents shall cease and determine, and such child shall thereafter be deemed and held to be for every purpose the child of its parent or parents by adoption as fully as though naturally born to them in lawful wedlock. Said child shall be entitled to proper education, support, maintenance, nurture and care from said parent or parents by adoption, and said parent or parents by adoption shall be entitled to the services, wages, control, custody and company of said adopted child, all as if said child were their own natural child. For purposes of inheritance under the laws of descent and distribution such adopted child shall be regarded as the child of the parent or parents by adoption, such adopted child and its descendants inheriting from and through the parent or parents by adoption and their kin the same as if such child were the natural legitimate child of such parent or parents by adoption, and such parent or parents by adoption and their kin inheriting from and through such adopted child the same as if such child were the natural legitimate child of such parent or parents by adoption. The natural parent or parents of such child and their kin shall not inherit from or through said child, but said child shall inherit from and through its natural parent or parents. Nothing herein shall prevent any one from disposing of his property by will according to law. Such adopted child shall be regarded as a child of the parent or parents by adoption for all other purposes as well, except that where a deed, will, or other instrument uses words clearly intended to exclude children by adoption, such adopted child shall not be included in such class. The legal adoption of a child according to the laws of another State of the United States, residing in the State of Texas, shall be, in all respects, valid and binding as if the adoption had occurred in the State of Texas, insofar as the effects of the adoption and the right of inheritance may be concerned as provided in this Act.
