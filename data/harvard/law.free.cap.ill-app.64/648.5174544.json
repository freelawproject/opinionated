The suit was brought before a justice of the peace; judgment was rendered there for $120. The case was then appealed to the County Court. The material parts of the bond sued on are as follows :</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\" pgmap=\"647\">\u201cHo. 84. $500.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\" pgmap=\"647\">Tontine Bond Investment Association.,</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-10\" pgmap=\"647\">This bond is issued to David S.

L. Tidball, who was then the vice-president of the defendant company, to purchase some bonds of the character set forth, of the defendant association. That he gave to Captain Tidball at the time of the purchase the sum of $27.94, which he said was the cost of the bond, and a day or two afterward received from Hr. Tidball\u2019s hands the bonds. It also appears at the time of the purchase of these bonds a written application was made therefor, and signed by Hr. Geer, the face of which application is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\" pgmap=\"648\">\u201capplication fob bond.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\" pgmap=\"648\">Tontine Bond Investment Association,</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\" pgmap=\"648\">89 Hadison Street, Chicago, 111.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-8\" pgmap=\"648\">I hereby apply for six bonds in Series \u2018 C.

I agree to pay the monthly dues in advance on or before the last day of each month hereafter, without notice, under penalty of forfeiture of my bond or bonds and all payments made thereon; if I do not, I agree to abide by and comply with the terms of this application and the bond or bonds issued to me.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-9\" pgmap=\"648\">David S.

On April 30 th the company-redeemed one; on September 30th the company redeemed one; and on February 29, 1892, the company redeemed one; and that the other two bonds, numbered, respectively, 75 and 84, remained in force and the dues were paid thereon up to and including the dues for the month of November, 1892, Avhich Avere paid on the last day of October, of that year; and that on the 1st day of December, 1892, it being claimed by appellant that the December dues, which were to be paid on or before the 30th day of November, had not been paid, the bonds were declared forfeited by the officers of the company. It is claimed by Mr. Geer that on November 30, 1892, he paid to Mr. Tidball $4, by check; he failed to produce the check, but did produce a receipt for the $4, which is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-4\" pgmap=\"649\">\u201c Chicago, November 30,1892.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-5\" pgmap=\"649\">David S.

On December 2, 1892, it appears that after these bonds had been declared forfeited, Mr. Geer went to the office and tendered the amount due for dues upon these bonds, and was told there by the officers of the company in charge that the bonds had been forfeited, and that they could not accept his money.</p><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b650-4\" pgmap=\"650\">Bulkley, Gray &amp; More, attorneys for appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoz\" pgmap=\"650\">contended that officers of a corporation are special, not general, agents, consequently they have no power to bind the corporation except within the limits prescribed by the charter and by-laws. The principle that persons dealing with the officers of a corporation are charged with notice and authority conferred upon him, and of the limitations and restrictions upon it, contained in the charter and by-laws, is too well established to require to be supported by a citation of authorities.

He acts as president in the absence of the latter from duty, exercising such authority as the president might himself were he present, and although it might be difficult to define, with any decree of certainty, what are his ordinary duties, yet he is an agent of the corporation.

He is a conditional officer. He is an officer at some future time after his election upon the happening of some contingency.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b652-9\" pgmap=\"652\">If all of appellant\u2019s contentions in this regard were conceded, still it would remain that the vice-president of a corporation may act as its agent, and if he be by it so recognized and treated or held out to the world, his acts, within the scope of the authority given to him, are as binding as those of any other agent. In other words, there is no reason why the vice-president of a corporation may not act as its agent, although not acting as president or vice-president.</p> <p id=\"b652-10\" pgmap=\"652\">In the present case, appellant permitted its vice-president, Z. L. Tidball, to solicit appellee to purchase its bonds. From January, 1891, to \u00a1November, 1892, each month, it recognized payments by appellee to Tidball as properly made, and gave appellee proper credit and receipts therefor. Hnder these circumstances, appellant can not repudiate the pavment made in the same manner by appellee, \u00a1November 30, 1892, for which he took the receipt of Z. L. Tidball. Whether or not Mr. Tidball was then the vice-president of appellant is immaterial; he had been by it treated as its agent to receive dues, and still, apparently, was such.</p> <p id=\"b652-11\" pgmap=\"652(22) 653(50)\">Where a party so conducts himself as to lead others reasonably to believe that a person is his agent, such party will not be permitted to deny the existence of a relation he has thus induced others to believe existed.

Co., 152 Ill. 638-640.</p> <p id=\"b653-4\" pgmap=\"653\">That Mr. Tidball did not have an office in connection with the company in October or November, 1892, is immaterial.</p> <p id=\"b653-5\" pgmap=\"653\">Appellee having been told that his bond was forfeited, and that no further payment would be received from him, was relieved from the necessity of making further tenders of payment, and is entitled to recover as if the further payments had been made, they, with interest thereon, being deducted from the amount of the matured bond.
