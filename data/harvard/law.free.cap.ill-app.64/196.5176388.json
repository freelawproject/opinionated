The action is based on an exchange of property, subject to an incumbrance of $7,000. Suit was brought under a warranty deed, to recover \u00a7150 for interest earned on said incumbrance at the date of the deed.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-4\" pgmap=\"195\">The warranty deed is in the usual form, and is from appellants to Fritz and Edward Bohn, \u201c subject to incumbrances in the sum of $7,000, on all of said lots, which is assumed by the grantees.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195\">Judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs for $148.16 and costs, from which judgment the appeal in this case is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-6\" pgmap=\"195\">Henry J.

There is no uncertainty in the deed, and its meaning is too clear for discussion.</p> <p id=\"b195-10\" pgmap=\"195\">It, for the purposes of the trial below, was immaterial from what source appellants derived their title, or whether they had any.</p> <p id=\"b195-11\" pgmap=\"195\">Having warranted that they had, they can not dispute the truth of such covenant.</p> <p id=\"b195-12\" pgmap=\"195\">The existence and payment by William Bohn of interest already earned on the $7,000 incumbrance excepted from the warranty were shown; whether such interest was due when the warranty deed was executed is immaterial; it was earned, and appellees had to pay it to reduce the incumbrance to $7,000.</p> <p id=\"b195-13\" pgmap=\"195\">Many purely technical objections to this judgment are made, none of which appear to be well taken. Without entering upon a discussion of them, it is a sufficient answer to the technical errors assigned to say that the abstract of the record does not show that any motion for a new trial was made.</p> <p id=\"b195-14\" pgmap=\"195\">The judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
