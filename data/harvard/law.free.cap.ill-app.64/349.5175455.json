Keefe, 114 Ill. 222, upon a petition for rehearing, the court say: \u201c A sidewalk is for the passage of persons only, and we have not had in contemplation any use of it otherwise.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b351-9\" pgmap=\"351\">notwithstanding the verdict of, the jury, we think that all persons of average intelligence know that the moving of a safe weighing 1,400 pounds over a wooden sidewalk raised several feet above the ground, is extraordinary. Houses, horses and carriages are sometimes moved over sidewalks; but such walks are not designed for such purposes; they are made for the use of pedestrians; are constructed with a view to the safety and convenience of pedestrians using the Valk in an ordinary manner, and are not designed or held out as capable of supporting heavy freights.</p> <p id=\"b351-10\" pgmap=\"351\">Cities are required to keep the streets reasonably safe for use in the usual manner.

Healy, 16 Mass. 33.</p> <p id=\"b351-11\" pgmap=\"351(10) 352(64)\">In effect, the contention of appellee is that the incorporated cities and villages of this State are each obliged to keep all of their sidewalks in a safe condition for the moving of safes theredn; that is, for a use so extraordinarj that it may reasonably be said that there is not one rod in ten thousand of such walk over which, as often as once a year a safe is moved.</p> <p id=\"b352-4\" pgmap=\"352\">We are asked to declare that it is the duty of cities and villages to keep all sidewalks at all times reasonably secure against such extraordinary use and strain. Such is not one of the obligations of municipal bodies.</p> <p id=\"b352-5\" pgmap=\"352\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b352-6\" pgmap=\"352\">A judgment will be here entered on a finding of facts.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
