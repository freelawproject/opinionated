The train, which consisted of the grip-car and one trailer, stopped on La Salle street, just after rounding the curve, to let off passengers, and it was at this point that the plaintiff stepped on the rear platform of the trail-car, which was a closed one with the seats along the sides. Before she had gone very far along the aisle of the car she fell to the floor, and the cause of this fall is the issue involved in this suit.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\" pgmap=\"547\">She claims that the car started up suddenly, that she was thereby thrown and in consequence stumbled and fell over a satchel standing in the aisle; the defendant claims that the evidence shows beyond question that there was no sudden starting of the car, and that she carelessly stumbled over an umbrella carried by one of the passengers.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\" pgmap=\"547\">At the trial the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and assessed her damages at fifteen hundred dollars. Judgment having been entered on this verdict, the defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-7\" pgmap=\"547\">Egbert Jamieson and John A.

Appellant was bound to exercise the highest degree of diligence for the safety of appellee, who was a passenger.</p> <p id=\"b547-11\" pgmap=\"547\">We find in the record no sufficient reason for reversing the conclusion of the Circuit Court, and its judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
