The money on both of them belonged to the appellee. That the secretary committed frauds upon the appellant, is a defaulter, and has absconded, does not affect the right of the appellee to the money represented by the. warrants, with interest thereon from the respective dates, at six per cent per annum. The statute of 1891, reducing the rate to five per cent, does not affect this case. Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Western Refrigerating Co., 58 Ill.
