Telegraph Companies \u2014 Limitations on the Time to Present Claims.\u2014A condition printed upon a telegraph message, that the company will not hold itself liable for errors or delays in the transmissions or delivery of unrepeated messages in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after the message is filed with the company for transmission, is a condition precedent to the recovery of damages in such cases.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b329-7\" pgmap=\"329\">2. Same\u2014Ignorance of Conditions Printed on Messages.\u2014Ignorance of the conditions printed upon a telegraph message does not relieve the sender of the message. Where such sender is aware of the existence of such conditions his neglect to inform himself of their requirements does not free him, in law, from a knowledge thereof.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\" pgmap=\"329\">Trespass on the Case.\u2014Mistake in a telegram.

Gray, Communication by Telegraph, p. 131, Sec. 74; De la Grange v. S. W. Telegraph Co., 25 La. Ann. 383; N. Y. &amp; Wash. Print. Tel. Co. v. Dryburg, 35 Pa. St. 298; Western Union Tel. Co. v.

Gray, Com. by Tel. 186, Secs. 105,106; Pepper v. Western Union Tel. Co., 87 Tenn. 554; Pegram v. Same, 100 N. C. 28; Shingleur v. Same, 18 So. Rep. 425; Harrison v. Same, 10 Am. &amp; Eng. Cor. Cas. 600.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-11\" pgmap=\"329(19) 330(53)\">That the sender of such telegram was not bound by its altered terms, though not expressly decided, was necessarily involved in the decision of the court in the following cases: Western Un. Tel. Co. v. Dubois, 128 Ill. 248; Harris v. Western Union Tel. Co., 9 Phila. 88; N. Y. &amp; Wash. Print. Tel. Co. v. Dryburg, 35 Pa. St. 298; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Richman, 8 Atl. Rep. 171.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">Printed conditions upon a telegraph blank do not bind the party who uses such blank, unless it be shown by evidence aliunde that he knew and assented to such conditions. Tyler v. Western Un. Tel. Co., 60 Ill. 421; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Fairbanks, 15 Brad. 600.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\" pgmap=\"330\">So it has been repeatedly held with reference to the sixty-day limitation for presenting claims against the telegraph company. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Fairbanks, supra; Same v. De Golyer, 27 Ill. App. 489; Same v. Lycan, 60 Ill. App. 124.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\" pgmap=\"330\">The question whether the plaintiff knew of the sixty-day limitation and assented thereto, is not a conclusion of law, but is a fact to be submitted to and determined by the jury upon a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances. Field v. Chicago &amp; R. I. R. R. Co., 71 Ill. 462; Western Un. Tel. Co. v. Fairbanks, supra; Boscowitz v. Adams Express Co., 93 Ill. 532.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\" pgmap=\"330\">The suit at bar is an action on the case by the sendee of a telegram claiming damages because of the tort of the telegraph company in delivering to him an erroneous message, upon which he has acted to his injury. The telegraph company can not limit the right of the receiver of a message, who sues in tort, by any stipulations contained upon the printed blank upon which the message delivered to him is written.

It is not an attempt to discharge the company of the duties annexed by law to its employment, but is simply a regulation designed to secure good faith and fair dealing between the company and its patrons. As such it is peculiarly applicable to the nature of the telegraph business. W. U. T. Co. v. Fairbanks, 15 Ill. App. 603; W. U. T. Co. v. Beck, 58 Ill. App. 564; Wolf v. W. U. T. Co., 62 Pa.

Co., 57 Wis. 562.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-4\" pgmap=\"331\">Such a requirement is binding not only as a contract to which assent must be shown, but as a rule or regulation affecting all persons chargeable with knowledge of its existence, without assent. Oppenheimer v. U. S. Express Co., 69 Ill. 62; Western Trans. Co. v. Newhall, 24 Ill. 469; Boscowitz v. Adams Express Co., 93 Ill. 523; Breese v. U. S. Tel. Co., 48 N. Y. 132; Becker v. W. U. T.

The question is not one of assent, express or implied, but of simple notice. Croswell, Law of Electr., Sec. 500; Ellis v. Am. Tel. Co., 13 Allen 226; Manier v. W. U. T. Co. (Tenn.), 29 S. W.

In such case he can not avoid the effect of the rule by the simple statement that he never read it. Oppenheimer v. U. S. Express Co., 69 Ill. 62; Birney v. N. Y. &amp; Wash. P. T.

The mistake was in substituting \u201c fifty \u201d for \u201c five \u201d in the message, which was as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"AEi\" pgmap=\"332\">\u201c Form \u00a1No. 168.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b332-9\" pgmap=\"332\">The Western Union Telegraph Company.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b332-10\" pgmap=\"332\">(Incorporated).</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b332-11\" pgmap=\"332\">21,000 offices in America.

He knew that on the printed blanks were conditions but had never read them, nor heard them talked about. We must assume that, in fact, he was ignorant of the terms of the conditions, but being aware that there were conditions, his neglect to inform himself of the contents of the instruments which he had used for sixteen years, does not free him, in law, from a knowledge of such contents. Constructive notice, in cases to which it is applicable, is as effectual as actual notice. Oppenheimer v. U. S. Express Co., 69 Ill. 62; Field v. C. &amp; R. I. R. R., 71 Ill. 458; Merchants D. &amp; T. Co., 88 Ill. 136.</p> <p id=\"b333-14\" pgmap=\"333\">The appellant did not present to the appellee any claim \u201c in writing within sixty days,\u201d as was required by the conditions.</p> <p id=\"b333-15\" pgmap=\"333\">This was fatal to his cause. We adopt the decision in Manier v. Western Union, 29 S. W. Rep. 7832, 94 Tenn. 442, upon this point.</p> <p id=\"b333-16\" pgmap=\"333\">If the law applicable to the case be doubtful, it is better that a case furnishing an opportunity to settle so many questions, should go at once to the final tribunal.</p> <p id=\"b333-17\" pgmap=\"333\">The judgment, holding the appellee barred by neglect to give notice, is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
