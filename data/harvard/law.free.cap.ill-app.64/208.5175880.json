(a corporation of Chicago). There were three counts to the declaration, besides the common counts, but no claim of right to recovery was made under the second count.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-4\" pgmap=\"207\">The first count set up that in December, 1891, defendants employed plaintiffs to negotiate a sale or exchange of the entire stock of Eand, McNally &amp; Co., to parties in England, between that time and May 1,1892, and that the defendants agreed that if they should procure a purchaser before May 1, 1892, defendants would pay to plaintiffs \u00a785,700 in cash, and $64,300 in stock of a company to be organized and to succeed to the business of said Eand, McNally &amp; Co.; that under said agreement the plaintiffs sent W\u201e W. Belvin to London, who entered upon the business of negotiating a sale; that the defendants, \u201c while the plaintiffs were conducting said negotiations, and long prior to May 1, 1892, wrongfully and without any fault on the part of the plaintiffs or either of them, notified them that they would not sell said stock, and that plaintiffs should proceed no further in and about said business; \u201d that by means thereof, the plaintiffs lost the time and services of Belvin for a long time, and expended a large sum of money in necessary expense in going to and returning from London, and maintaining Belvin while there, and in paying for telegrams, correspondence, services and assistance in connection with said business.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">The third count sought to recover for the same thing, but set out more in detail the terms of the employment.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207(123) 208(17)\">Appellees insist that the proof showed that in July, 1891, the appellees made an arrangement with the appellants to sell the stock or business of Eand, McNally &amp; Co., and a contract for that purpose was made between Andrew Mc-Nally and William W. Belvin, for the reason that Belvin was expected to do the business in London, and a power of attorney was given by McNally to Belvin; that Eand &amp; McNally, at that time, either had or controlled 9,200 shares of stock of Eand, McNally &amp; Co., and were to obtain as many of the remaining 800 as they could procure. The\" written contract provided that Belvin should have a commission of $85,700 in cash, and $64,300 in preferred and common stock of the corporation to be organized, and which should succeed to Band, McNally &amp; Co.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\" pgmap=\"208\">The power of attorney then given by McNally to Belvin recited that, \u201c Whereas, Andrew McNally, of the city of Chicago, State of Illinois, owning or controling 9,200 shares of the 10,000 shares, the entire capital stock of Band, McNally &amp; Co., of Chicago, Illinois, a corporation duly organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Illinois, is desirous of selling and conveying the entire capital stock of the said corporation, at and for the price of $2,000,000 in cash in hand paid at the date of the delivery of the said stock, and for the further sum of $1,500,000 in the paid up or non-assessable, fully issued capital stock of a corporation to be capitalized at $4,500,000, in equal shares of stock, of the par value of $100 each, which is to succeed the said Band, McNally &amp; Co.; and in case said capital stock of said new corporation is issued in part as preferred stock, and balance in common stock, the said stock payment of $1,500,000 is to be made in the same proportionate amount of preferred stock and common stock as the entire amount of preferred and common stock are fully issued.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\" pgmap=\"208\">The power of attorney authorized Belvin to procure any European or other parties to purchase the stock at the rate of $200 cash per share, and $150 per share \u201c of said capital stock, at the same time, in the paid up or non-assessable, fully issued capital stock of a corporation to succeed said Band, McNally &amp; Co., capitalized at $4,500,000, in equal shares of stock of the par value of $100 each,\u201d etc.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\" pgmap=\"208\">The contract and power of attorney were executed and dated on the 17th of July, 1891, and the appellants fully understood that Cronkrite and Johnson, who were in business as B. F. Cronkrite &amp; Co., were to share with Belvin in the profits of the transaction.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\" pgmap=\"208\">Having made this arrangement, Cronkrite &amp; Co. advanced to Belvin $10,000 in money and Belvin proceeded immediately to London, with a view of negotiating a sale of the business and earning for himself and Cronkrite and Johnson the commission promised.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\" pgmap=\"209\">At the time of receiving the contract and power of attorney Belvin was furnished with a very elaborate and descriptive statement of the assets and liabilities of Band, McNTally &amp; Co., signed \u201cBand, McNally &amp; Co., by Wm\u201e H. Band, president.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\" pgmap=\"209\">Mr. Belvin testified that at the time of making the July deal, the question whether this property had been ever before offered by any party in London was discussed, and that McNally told him that the property had never before been offered; that he was the first man they had ever discussed it with except Mr. Cronkrite, and that the property had never been offered in London.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">Belvin, on his arrival in London, assiduously set to work to procure a contract for the sale of this large property, but on the \u00cd6th of October learned that the property had previously been on the market in London for sale for $2,500,000 or $1,000,000 less than he was authorized to sell the same for. Thereupon he took the first steamer home after telegraphing to Cronkrite. It appears that Cronkrite was absent when this telegram was received, and Mr. Johnson saw Charles Band about it and then saw McNally. As a result of which a telegram was sent by appellees to Mr. Belvin as follows:</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\" pgmap=\"209\">\u201c McNally corresponded personally over a year ago with Gillig, basis, $2,500,000, all cash, conditions entirely different. Now they have all stock promised. Gillig had no authority to sell. They have been offered more for some of their real estate than when placed with you, also are receiving now for rent $4,000 more than given to you. Tou must exert yourself to place this deal. Can not see what Gillig matter has to do with it, as you have all the facts and figures before you, and if the prospective income was satisfactory when you left here, whatever was done a year or more ago does not affect the sale now.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-7\" pgmap=\"209\">Mr. Belvin, however, does not recollect ever having received this telegram, but before leaving London he obtained from Gillig a copy of his correspondence with McNally and Band.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\" pgmap=\"210\">These letters, appellees claim, show that Rand and Mc-Nally, in 1890, offered to sell the entire property and business for the sum of $2,500,000, and while they then stated that they could not promise absolutely all of the stock, still they say that they can probably obtain five-sixths or seven-eighths; that \u201c some of it is in the hands of the members of departments and foremen Avho would probably want to retain their holdings unless discharged from the service of the company.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-6\" pgmap=\"210\">On arriving in Chicago, Belvin and Cronkrite had a new interview with Rand and McNally, when, as stated, these letters were produced and some discussion had, and Mr. Belvin went to California. He returned about the 14th or 15th of December, had several interviews with Rand and Mc-Nally, and finally, on the 17th of December, Rand and McNally met Belvin, Cronkrite and Johnson in the office of Cronkrite &amp; Co., and had a long interview. Concerning this interview there is a conflict betAveen the evidence of the appellees and the appellants. The appellees (plaintiffs below) claimed that in that interview McNally and Rand authorized them to obtain a contract, sell the property for $2,750,000, $1,000,000 in cash, $875,000 in six per cent debentures, and $437,000 in preferred stock bearing eight per cent, and $438,000 in common stock of the company to be organized, which Avas to succeed to the business of Rand, McNally &amp; Co.; that Rand and McNally agreed to pay the same commission they had agreed to pay under the previous arrangement, viz., $85,700 in cash and $64,300 in preferred and common stock of the proposed corporation in proportion as received; that McNally and Rand objected to putting the new arrangement in writing, but said that they had arranged for the stock and that plaintiffs should go ahead and that the defendants would \u201cstand it,\u201d or carry out the arrangement.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\" pgmap=\"210\">Immediately after the arrangement of December 17th, Mr. Belvin again went to London. Early in March, 1892, he procured an offer for the purchase of the entire business and property of Rand, McNally &amp; Co.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-3\" pgmap=\"211\">When in London, Mr. Belvin employed counsel, Williams &amp; James, and under their direction a proposed contract was executed by Mr. F. B. Behr, the proposed purchaser, by his attorney, and immediately forwarded to Chicago, where it arrived on the 23d of March, 1892.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\" pgmap=\"211\">On the 26th of March, the proposal was sent to Band and McNally, who returned it through Charles Band on March 31st. Cronkrite then had an interview with W. H. Band, who, it is said, \u201creplied, simply, to Cronkrite, that the business was not then for sale; that they had decided not to sell the business and that the contract with them had expired by limitation,\u201d and Cronkrite testified that he pressed Band for his reasons, but he refused to make any further answer. Thereupon Cronkrite sent a telegram immediately to Mr. Belvin, notifying him of the fact, and stating \u201c Band will not accept contract. Says business is not for sale now, and that our contract expired by limitation and was not renewed in any way \u201d</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\" pgmap=\"211\">The proposed agreement was substantially as follows:</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\" pgmap=\"211\">\u201c An agreement made the-day of-, one thou-</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\" pgmap=\"211(162) 212(133)\">sand eight hundred and ninety-two, between Messrs.

Wolseley, attorneys for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b219-11\" pgmap=\"219\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A0Y\" pgmap=\"219\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b219-12\" pgmap=\"219\">The question presented by this case is almost entirely one of fact, viz: Did the appellees make such a sale of the property or stock of appellants as entitled them to compensation therefor ?</p> <p id=\"b219-13\" pgmap=\"219\">Appellees did not make a sale in accordance with the written power of attorney, which sale was to be for $2,000,000 cash in hand and $1,500,000 in paid up stock of a corporar tion capitalized at $4,500,000; this is not claimed. Appellees claim that a new arrangement was made, under which they were to sell the property for $1,000,000 cash, $875,000 in six per cent debentures, $437,000 in preferred stock bearing eight per cent, and $438,000 in common stock\u2014total $2,750,000. Did they make such sale ?</p> <p id=\"b219-14\" pgmap=\"219(9) 220(66)\">The proposed agreement for sale procured by the appellees, recited that the purchaser intended to form an English company with a capital share of 460,000 pounds, divided into 46,000 shares of ten pounds each, of which 23,000 should be preferred shares, entitled to a cumulative preferential dividend of eight per cent per annum, and the remaining ordinary shares with power to borrow not exceeding the sum of 230,000 pounds by an issue of debentures.</p> <p id=\"b220-5\" pgmap=\"220\">The consideration for the sale was to be 567,000 pounds sterling, provided that if the English company was formed the purchase money as to 180,000 pounds might be satisfied by the allotment of debentures of the English company, and as to 90,000 pounds by the allotment of preference shares in the English company to that nominal amount, and as to 90,000 pounds by the allotment of ordinary shares in the English company.</p> <p id=\"b220-6\" pgmap=\"220\">The balance of 207,000 pounds was to be paid in cash as follows: one-tenth within fourteen days of issue of the English company\u2019s prospectus, and the balance by three equal installments, the first within seven days of the first allotment of shares in the English company, the second within six weeks, and the balance within ten weeks after such allotment.</p> <p id=\"b220-7\" pgmap=\"220(174) 221(39)\">The several sums agreed to be paid, other than the final balance, and the interest thereon, to be paid in, the first to the-bank to the joint account of the vendors and purchaser, to remain in escrow awaiting the completion of the purchase. The purchaser was, within forty-five days of the receipt by him of a report on the properties, to procure the incorporation of the said English company, and as soon as was reasonably prudent, having regard to the then state of the London money market, offer by a prospectus for public subscription the whole of the shares in the English company, less those to be taken by the vendors, also all the debentures, less those to be taken by the vendors, provided that if the purchaser should be unable to satisfy the vendors within four months from the date of the said report that responsible persons, other than the vendors, had agreed to subscribe for shares and debentures deemed satisfactory to the vendors, or that shares and debentures to the like amount were underwritten, then the vendors might rescind the agreement, and if any part of the purchase money should remain unpaid for six months from the date of the said report, the vendors might by notice rescind the agreement.</p> <p id=\"b221-4\" pgmap=\"221\">We do not see how it can be seriously contended that such proposed sale was a fulfillment of an undertaking to sell for $1,000,000 cash and $1,750,000 in stock and debentures.</p> <p id=\"b221-5\" pgmap=\"221\">The proposition was perhaps fair enough, but appellants did not see fit to accept it, and they did not authorize appellees to sell or to procure an offer under which appellants might never receive either cash or anything else of value.</p> <p id=\"b221-6\" pgmap=\"221\">The offer of payment, so far as it had value, was wholly contingent upon the success that might follow an offer for sale of the stock and debentures of the proposed English company.</p> <p id=\"b221-7\" pgmap=\"221\">It is said that Mr. Eand did not put his refusal to accept the offer upon the ground that it was not in accordance with the terms he had given appellees. If this be so, it did not make the offer a compliance with such terms. Appellees claim to have procured a bona fide offer of purchase from a responsible party on the terms proposed by appellants. The question is, did appellees procure such offer, not what appellants said about the proposal.</p> <p id=\"b221-8\" pgmap=\"221\">Appellees urge that appellants having placed their refusal upon the ground that the time for making a sale had expired, can not now object that they had never authorized a sale upon the terms proposed; and appellees cite the remark of the Supreme Court of the United States appearing in Railway Co. v. McCarthy, 96 U. S., page 258-267, that \u201c where a party gives a reason for his conduct and decision, touching anything involved in the controversy, he can not after litigiation has been begun, change his ground and put his conduct upon another and a different consideration. He is not permitted thus to mend his hold. He is estopped from doing it by a settled principle of law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b221-9\" pgmap=\"221\">As applicable to the facts of that case the statement was proper and pertinent, but if cited as a declaration of the law as to all controversies, it is incorrect and entirely unsupported by authority.</p> <p id=\"b222-5\" pgmap=\"222\">It is not the case that if one agree to purchase 100 fat sheep if delivered to him in thirty days, he is responsible in damages when 100 lean hogs are tendedlo him in twenty days, if the only objection he makes to their reception is that the contract has expired. \u00a1Nor is one who borrows money, agreeing to pay in six months with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum, bound to pay interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum because when, at the end of six months, payment with such interest is demanded, his only objection is, that the debt is not due.</p> <p id=\"b222-6\" pgmap=\"222\">The principle invoked by appellees applies only to defects in form, matters of detail, objections which a party could easily have, and it is to be presumed would have, removed had they been objected to, so that an after insistence upon them is an injustice, they not being of the substance of the contract. Johnson v. Oppenheim, 55 N. Y. 291; Bigelow on Estoppel (5th Ed.), p. 662; 28 Am. and Eng. Ency. 530, and cases cited.</p> <p id=\"b222-7\" pgmap=\"222\">There is no authority for holding that a mere arrangement for a sale, with no cash paid down, but a condition that if at the end of six months all the cash has not been paid, the vendors may rescind the contract, is a fulfillment of an authority to sell for, among other things, $1,000,000 cash.</p> <p id=\"b222-8\" pgmap=\"222\">That where, by express or implied contract, an agency has been created to endure for a definite period, it may not be terminated by the principal unless for the agent\u2019s default, or by virtue'of some agreement to that effect, without liability to the agent, is the case.</p> <p id=\"b222-9\" pgmap=\"222\">And where, though the agency is not for a definite time, yet the act is one which requires time and labor for its completion, the agent is entitled to a reasonable time within which to complete his undertaking. Mechem on Agency, Sec. 620; Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co., 83 N. Y. 378; Warren C. &amp; M. Co. v. Holbrook, 115 N. Y. 586; Day v. Porter, 60 Ill. App. 386.</p> <p id=\"b222-10\" pgmap=\"222(19) 223(16)\">And if the principal unjustifiably terminate the agency, he is liable to the agent for the damages occasioned thereby, as in any other case of a breach of a contract. Mechein on Agency, Sec. 621.</p> <p id=\"b223-4\" pgmap=\"223\">We are not, however, called upon to say what the rights of appellees would have been had they, when the proposed contract of sale was rejected, gone on and effected a sale in accordance with the authority given to them. Instead of doing this, or insisting upon their right so to do, they stood upon the proposal by them procured and tendered, sending to appellants the following letter:</p> <blockquote id=\"b223-5\" pgmap=\"223\">\" Gentlemen ; You authorized us to procure for you a purchaser for all the property belonging to Rand, McRally &amp; Company, a corporation, upon certain terms and conditions. After much labor and expense, we have procured a purchaser, who is ready, able and willing to purchase the property of the corporation for the price and upon the terms and conditions named by you, and we have a contract signed by him for the purchase of the property, which we are ready to present to you for signature.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b223-6\" pgmap=\"223\">Will you kindly advise us, upon the receipt of this letter, when and where we can meet you and close the matter up ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b223-7\" pgmap=\"223\">Yours truly,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b223-8\" pgmap=\"223\">B. F. Croekrite &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b223-9\" pgmap=\"223\">Thus claiming that the terms of sale agreed to by Mr. Behr were such as appellants had agreed to accept.</p> <p id=\"b223-10\" pgmap=\"223\">Appellees rested and rest upon this proposition; they do not claim to have done more than this.</p> <p id=\"b223-11\" pgmap=\"223\">Such proposition was not a fulfillment of the undertaking of appellees.</p> <p id=\"b223-12\" pgmap=\"223\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
