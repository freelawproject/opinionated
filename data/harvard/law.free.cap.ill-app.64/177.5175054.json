The contention of the appellant is that the provision of the statute, section 12, page 224, Laws of 1895, refers only to imprisonment for non-payment of a fine or judgment when the ca. sa. is issued by virtue of the judgment alone, and has no application to those cases where a ca. sa. is issued, in pursuance of said section 4, by virtue of an affidavit charging a refusal to surrender goods on execution, or that debtor has fraudulently conveyed or concealed his goods. Ho other question was raised, and there is none other involved in this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-5\" pgmap=\"176\">Lemma &amp; Cope, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b176-6\" pgmap=\"176\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AFC\" pgmap=\"176\">delivebed the opinion of the Couet.</p> <p id=\"b176-7\" pgmap=\"176\">Section 12 of article 18 (p. 224, Laws of 1895), Hurd\u2019s Statutes 1895, 973, is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b176-8\" pgmap=\"176\">\u201c Ho person shall be imprisoned for non-payment of a fine or a judgment in any civil, criminal, quasi criminal, or qv/i tarn, action, except upon conviction by a jury; provided, that the defendant or defendants in any such action may waive a jury trial by executing a formal waiver, in writing, and when such waiver of jury is made, imprisonment may follow the judgment of the court without conviction by the jury.
