ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">We are confronted on this review by two questions. One is whether the Federal Power Commission properly declined to pass on a municipality\u2019s claim of rate discrimination by an electric utility prior to completion of a full hearing designed to enable determination of a just and reasonable rate for the utility. The other is whether the Commission properly expanded the scope of the proceeding to assure that the rate would not discriminate or operate unreasonably against other municipal customers of the utility. We answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-17\">Otter Tail Power Company, a public utility subject to the Federal Power Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sells electricity at retail in several hundred communities in Minnesota and two adjoining states. For many years the Village of Elbow Lake, Minnesota, purchased its requirements from Otter Tail at retail rates. In 1966, the citizens of Elbow Lake voted to establish their own municipal distribution facilities, but Otter Tail refused to provide Elbow Lake with power at wholesale. Otter Tail was also unwilling to transmit\u2014 \u201cwheel\u201d \u2014 over its lines energy which Elbow Lake could have bought at wholesale from the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior and various electric cooperatives. Thus isolated from these sources, Elbow Lake set up a generating plant for its distribution system and brought its case to the Commission, asking that Otter Tail be directed to interconnect with its system and supply it with wholesale power. In Opinion No. 551, the Commission initially granted a temporary connection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which in Opinion No. 603 it later made permanent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-18\">Meanwhile, the Government instituted an antitrust action against Otter Tail in the District of Minnesota, charging monopolization of retail distribution of electricity in its service area. The District Court held that Otter Tail had endeavored to block communities from replacing its expiring retail distribution franchises with municipal distribution systems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prominent among the monopolistic techniques condemned was Otter Tail\u2019s refusal to sell energy at wholesale or to wheel power to proposed municipal systems in communities in which it retailed power.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court enjoined these practices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>but specified in its judgment that Otter Tail \u201cshall not be compelled ... to furnish wholesale electric service or wheeling service to a municipality except at rates which are compensatory and under terms and conditions which are filed with and subject to approval by the\u201d Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">On direct appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision in these respects,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but with a caution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-5\">We do not suggest, however, that the District Court, concluding that Otter Tail violated the antitrust laws, should be impervious to Otter Tail\u2019s assertion that compulsory interconnection or wheeling will erode its integrated system and threaten its capacity to serve adequately the public. . . . [T]he Commission may not order interconnection if to do so \u201cwould impair [the utility\u2019s] ability to render adequate service to its customers\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. . . . The District Court in this case found that the \u201cpessimistic view\u201d advanced in Otter Tail\u2019s \u201cerosion study\u201d \u201cis not supported by the record.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, it concluded that \u201cit does not appear that Bureau of Reclamation power is a serious threat to the defendant nor that it will be in the foreseeable future.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since the District Court has made future connections subject to Commission approval and in any event has retained jurisdiction to enable the parties to apply for \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d relief<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and presumably will give effect to the policies embodied and in the Federal Power Act, we cannot say under these circumstances that it has abused its discretion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-16\">When the Supreme Court so ruled, Elbow Lake was purchasing, as we have said, electricity from Otter Tail at wholesale. Promptly after the decision, Elbow Lake contracted with the Bureau of Reclamation for wholesale power and called upon Otter Tail to wheel it in. It then became incumbent upon Otter Tail to design, and upon the Commission to scrutinize, rates and other terms for the wheeling arrangement. Otter Tail asked the Commission to set a compensatory rate, which Otter Tail calculated at 5 mills per kilowatt hour.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-17\">At the time, Otter Tail was wheeling preference power to 17 municipalities in Minnesota and South Dakota pursuant to a contract with the Bureau of Reclamation setting a wheeling rate of 1 mill per kilowatt hour, on quadrennial determinations by Otter Tail of excess transmission capacity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It also contracted individually with municipalities for transmission firming service at 1.5 mills, discounted for customers with generation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In response to Otter Tail\u2019s petition, Elbow Lake asserted that the 5-mill rate was unduly discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>because it greatly exceeded the rates which Otter Tail charged the neighboring communities, and sought relief accordingly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">By order issued October 31, 1973, the Commission held that Otter Tail\u2019s tendered rate was an initial rate for a new type of service.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AChy\">Although Opinion No. 603<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provided for the interim nature of Otter Tail\u2019s interconnection and wholesale service ordered therein and anticipated future sale of [Bureau of Reclamation] power to Elbow Lake, Otter Tail\u2019s submittal cannot realistically qualify as a change in rate schedule . . . because it effects a change in the nature of service to Elbow Lake by supersedence of all-requirements wholesale service by wheeling of [Bureau] power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-6\">The Otter Tail filing amounts to a new rate for a new type of service and should so qualify pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and Part 35.12<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of the Regulations issued thereunder.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiN_\">The Commission thus concluded that it \u201cshould (1) accept the filed rate as an initial rate schedule in order to implement wheeling service as directed, and (2) enter upon a hearing to determine the justness and reasonableness thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoM\">Elbow Lake applied for rehearing, arguing that the wheeling service afforded it differed in no way from that furnished the 17 municipalities under the Otter Tail-Bureau of Reclamation contract and associated special municipal service agreements with Otter Tail. Elbow Lake sought a survey of the wheeling services and approval of the 17-town rate for itself, with resultant treatment of Otter Tail\u2019s tendered rate as a request for a rate increase. The Commission denied rehearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-13\">The Commission\u2019s exposition that it would not, without hearing, order Otter Tail to file a rate which differs from that submitted, does not, of course, preclude the Commission from ordering Otter Tail to file a different rate or conditioning the tendered rate appropriately <em>after </em>the conduct of a hearing thereupon. It was the intent of the Commission in fact to institute a hearing and investigation herein to best determine the very issues raised by Elbow Lake\u2019s allegations. Commission predetermination based upon the pleadings of whether the accepted rate is compensatory, just, reasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential would be premature and unwarranted at this stage.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">Hearings before an administrative law judge then got under way, and had proceeded to completion on some issues, including discrimination and rate of return, when the judge felt it necessary to recommend reconsideration by the Commission of the scope of the remainder of the inquiry. While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>presentations to the judge were designed to establish the cost of service to Elbow Lake and a rate of return therefor, Otter Tail\u2019s wheeling contracts with some of the 17 towns had expired in the interim and all but three of the rest were approaching their terminal dates. During the hearings, Otter Tail had voiced its view that the long-since fixed 1-mill flat rate to the 17 towns was noncompensatory, and had manifested as its expectation, and later had declared as its intention, replacement of the 1-mill-rate contracts with service agreements specifying whatever rate the Commission eventually approved for Elbow Lake.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Since none of the 17 towns was a party to the proceeding, and since some possibly were even unaware of it, the judge recommended that the Commission\u2019s hearing order \u201cbe revised to show that the scope of the hearing is to cover the rate for the transmission service to all communities receiving such service, including the 17 towns now being served in addition to Elbow Lake; that the 17 towns ... be formally notified . as in the ease of any rate change; that they be permitted to participate and intervene if they are so advised; and that the parties be called upon to furnish copies of their cost studies and exhibits to any who intervene and wish to participate in the hearing . . ,.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-4\">Alternatively, if the foregoing program is not approved, the Commission may consider whether, in the interest of over-all saving, to permit the \u201cphasing\u201d of the presently-ordered proceeding, so as to come to decision first on the sole issue of discrimination (hearing on which has now been completed). The point is that Elbow Lake most earnestly and repeatedly has asserted the present rate as charged them since last November is unduly discriminatory and unlawful, quite regardless of the rate level and whether or not it is a \u201ccompensatory\u201d one, as called for by the District Court\u2019s judgment. Equally earnestly and repeatedly the Company denies the discrimination, asserting a significant difference in the type of service rendered. That issue is now ready for briefing, and should its resolution go against the Company there will be no occasion to hear the cost of service evidence, at least until such time as all 18 towns are put on the same footing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">Over Elbow Lake\u2019s objection, the Commission agreed that the proceeding should be expanded as recommended by the administrative law judge. In its order of November 29, 1974, the Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abj\">[I]t is clear that this proceeding is likely to affect many municipalities in addition to Elbow Lake. In order that those municipalities be treated fairly, it is essential that the issue in this case be redefined so as to refer to the legality of the rate for wheeling power provided by Otter Tail to any and all municipalities receiving wheeling service. It is also essential that the municipalities in question be given notice of this proceeding and an opportunity to participate fully in it. We so provide in this order.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">The Commission disagreed with Elbow Lake\u2019s argument \u201cthat the proceeding should not now be expanded but should instead be decided promptly on the basis of the question of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Said the Commission,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>Otter Tail for so long a period, and such rate is not now subject to refund. But Otter Tail points out that if its wheeling rate to Elbow Lake becomes the rate applicable to all of its municipal customers as is Otter Tail\u2019s expressed intention, then the question of discrimination becomes moot. Although we are unwilling now to say that the question of discrimination would then disappear, it is clear to us that the question would at least be subject to different facts and considerations. Accordingly, a decision on the discrimination question at this time would be premature.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Elbow Lake applied for rehearing of that order, but the Commission adhered to its decision to expand the hearing and defer determinations on the issue of discrimination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Commission granted a petition by ten of the towns to intervene<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and, in response to their own objection to the Commission\u2019s proposal, elucidated the nature of further hearings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-5\">The Towns also apply for rehearing of [the order expanding the scope of the hearing], arguing that we cannot hold hearings to determine the justness and reasonableness of the proposed Otter Tail rate to them in the absence of an appropriate tariff filing by Otter Tail. We agree with much of the Towns\u2019 argument. We agree that \u201cOtter Tail\u2019s announcement\u201d as to its intentions \u201cis no substitute for a proper filing\u201d, and that \u201cno rate may be changed if it is not on file with the Commission\u201d. We acknowledged in our [hearing-expansion] order that Otter Tail had not yet filed rate changes with respect to the 17 towns, and because that is so, we further stated that \u201cwe may not be able, in this proceeding, to dispose finally of all aspects of the foreseen rate changes as they apply to each of the communities\u201d. Differently stated, our conclusion in this case as to the rate that Otter Tail may charge Elbow Lake will not result, without more, in a change in the rate that Otter Tail may charge any or all of its other 17 municipal customers. Certainly any rate change as to any such customer must begin with a rate filing, and certainly no rate filing by Otter Tail has here occurred, except in the case of Elbow Lake.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">And, once again rejecting Elbow Lake\u2019s effort to obtain immediate resolution of the discrimination question, the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-10\">Elbow Lake argues that the question whether it is the victim of discrimination is ripe for decision now, and that our deferring a decision results in irreparable harm to Elbow Lake because the rate charged it by Otter Tail is not subject to refund. Elbow Lake rightly points out that we can decide and have decided questions of discrimination without undertaking a full blown rate case. The difficulty here, however, is that the question of discrimination cannot be segregated, for our responsibility, as we stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>our order of October 31, 1973,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> is to determine a rate for Otter Tail\u2019s service to Elbow Lake that is not only non-discriminatory but also \u201ccompensatory . just and reasonable\u201d. . Inasmuch as the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s referral to us makes clear that cost of service evidence, among other things, remains to be heard, there is not yet available to us a record that permits us to fix a rate that demonstrably meets all of the necessary tests.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5M\">Elbow Lake and the ten towns now petition separately for review.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">The Federal Power Act commands relevantly that \u201c[a]ll rates and charges . for . the transmission of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and \u201cany such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is [t]hereby declared to be unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Act specifies additionally that \u201c[n]o public utility shall, with respect to any [such] transmission . . ., maintain any unreasonable difference in rates [or] charges ..\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Commission is required, \u201cafter a hearing\u201d and upon a finding \u201cthat any rate [or] charge ... for any [such] transmission ... is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential,\u201d to \u201cdetermine the just and reasonable rate [or] charge . . . to be thereafter observed and in force, and . fix the same by order.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-18\">Continually since Otter Tail filed its 5-mill wheeling rate for Elbow Lake, the latter has pressed a discrimination claim based upon its wide divergence from the 17-town rate.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> And Elbow Lake is emi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>nently correct in its position that an unjustifiable difference in rates for substantially similar service works an unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The appropriate inquiry, however, in the present posture of this case is not whether the rate to Elbow Lake is actually discriminatory but whether the Commission was compelled to proceed immediately to ascertain whether it is or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">The Act, while explicitly imposing upon the Commission a duty to rectify rate discrimination, is silent as to the point in the administrative process at which that obligation is to be discharged. We have not been referred to, nor have we found, either legislative history or judicial precedent bearing directly on the question. But as in the recent past we have declared, the Act\u2019s \u201cprimary aim is the protection of consumers from excessive rates and charges.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and certainly that wholesome purpose is best served by expeditious resolution of rate-discrimination claims. Moreover, as the Commission acknowledges,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> it has had past occasion to hold that patent discrimination may be removed without awaiting the outcome of a full-blown rate investigation.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We perceive no obstacle<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> to that course when the discrimination issue is discrete and the administrative record is sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>developed to enable a sound determination.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">That, however, is not nearly the situation here. Otter Tail insists that the 17-town rate<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> would operate confiscatorily were it to measure the charge for wheeling power to Elbow Lake,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and we cannot dismiss that possibility as merely fanciful.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The 17-town rate was fixed in 1955 by a contract between Otter Tail and the Bureau of Reclamation.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The contract had not been subjected to a rate investigation prior to the instant proceeding,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and consequently the 17-town rate had never been found to be just and reasonable.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Elbow Lake argues that the rate must be regarded as compensatory because Otter Tail voluntarily made it available to the towns for a service similar to its own. But aside from a dispute as to whether the wheeling service provided the 17 towns is comparable to that afforded Elbow Lake,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> the incontrovertible fact is that the contract rate was set more than twenty years ago in a radically different economic climate. We cannot shut our eyes to the notorious fact that the cost of well-nigh everything has risen dramatically over the past two decades,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> nor can we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>ignore Otter Tail\u2019s inability during that period to unilaterally alter the 1955 rate.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus we are not persuaded that the Commission erred in declining to accept that rate as the benchmark for recompense to Otter Tail for the wheeling service supplied Elbow Lake.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Otter Tail\u2019s entitlement to a compensatory rate springs not only from the provisions of the Act<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> but also from the judicial order that Otter Tail furnish wheeling, service to Elbow Lake.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The judgment of the District Court incorporating that directive specifies that Otter Tail</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-7\">shall not be compelled by the Judgment in this case to furnish wholesale electric service or wheeling service to.a municipality except at rates which are compensatory and under terms and conditions which are filed with and subject to approval by the . . . Commission.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">The Supreme Court, in its affirming decision, noted that \u201cthe District Court has made future connections\u201d required of Otter Tail \u201csubject to Commission approval.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> So, as the Commission said when it denied rehearing of its hearing-expansion order,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adg\">[t]he . District Court ruling determined that initiation of wheeling, ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>vice falls within the public interest. It left for the Commission to give effect to that mandate to implement wheeling service to Elbow Lake by accepting and determining rates therefor which are compensatory, nondiscriminatory, just and reasonable.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">It is evident that the mandate cannot be obeyed without a fuller hearing leading to determination of a just and reasonable rate for the wheeling service that Elbow Lake now enjoys. The Commission put its finger on the crux of the problem when it stated that \u201c[t]he difficulty here . is that the question of discrimination cannot be segregated\u201d from the question of a just and reasonable rate for Otter Tail.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> To be sure, Elbow Lake is entitled to a nondiscriminatory rate but Otter Tail, we repeat, is entitled to a compensatory rate; as put by the Commission, its \u201cresponsibility . is to determine a rate for Otter Tail\u2019s service to Elbow Lake that is not only nondiscriminatory but also \u2018compensatory . just and reasonable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> These twin objectives can, of course, be achieved once the administrative record on a just and reasonable rate is completed. But, as the Commission found, \u201c[i]nasmuch as the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s referral to [the Commission] ma[de] clear that cost of service evidence, among other things, remain[ed] to be heard,\u201d the inevitable conclusion was that \u201c[there was] not yet available to [the Commission] a record that permitted] [it] to fix a rate that demonstrably meets all of the necessary tests.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> As we review the matter, the Commission must be sustained on this branch of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-13\">The petitioning towns \u2014 ten of the 17 \u2014 also complain of the order by which the Commission expanded the scope of the hearing to enable consideration of the broader implications of the rate to be set for Elbow Lake. Pointing out that Otter Tail had not filed a proposal to change the rate charged them, the towns contend that the order violates the ratemaking scheme of the Act and their right to proper notice of the rate against which they must defend.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We cannot accept this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>It should be noted at the outset that the Commission promulgated the hearing-expansion order in an effort to safeguard the very right which the towns invoke. Otter Tail had made known its intention to eventually limit all communities receiving wheeled power to the type of service provided Elbow Lake and to the rate which the Commission would establish therefor.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> This prompted the administrative law judge to raise with the Commission the question whether the proceeding should be enlarged to enable participation by the towns.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Realizing that the controversy between Otter Tail and Elbow Lake was \u201clikely to affect many municipalities in addition to Elbow Lake,\u201d the Commission, \u201c[i]n order that these municipalities be treated fairly,\u201d deemed it \u201cessential that the issue in this case be redefined so as to refer to the legality of the rate for wheeling power provided by Otter Tail to any and all municipalities receiving wheeling service,\u201d and \u201calso essential that the municipalities in question be given notice of this proceeding and an opportunity to participate fully in it.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In our view, the Commission acted commendably in thus exercising its discretion to protect the potentially affected communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">The towns\u2019 resistance to the hearing-expansion order, and thus their several arguments, seem to stem primarily from their understanding that the expanded proceeding will produce a new rate for them. We cannot be positive as to the extent of use of that proceeding, particularly in light of recent developments,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> but as we read the expansion order in no event will it have that purpose or effect. The Commission acknowledged that Otter Tail\u2019s revelation of their intended fate could not substitute for a tariff filing undertaking to alter the rate applicable to them;<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> indeed, the Commission emphasized that \u201cthe rate that Otter Tail may charge Elbow Lake will not result, without more, in a change in the rate that Otter Tail may charge any or all of its other 17 municipal customers.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> And because \u201cany rate change as to any such customer must begin with a rate filing,\u201d and since \u201cno rate filing by Otter Tail [had then] occurred, except in the case of Elbow Lake,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> the Commission \u201crecognize[d] that [it might] not be able, in this proceeding, to dispose finally of all aspects of the foreseen rate changes as they apply to each of these communities.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Although, as the Commission realized, its efforts \u201cmay not result in a final resolution of all questions as to all 18 towns,\u201d it did \u201cintend herein to resolve the rate question as fully as [it] possibly can.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">It may safely be said, then, that no rate effective for the towns will emerge from the expanded proceeding, but that expansion of the hearing, assuming that it endures,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> will foster two principal goals. One, to which we have adverted, is a desirable measure of protection for the towns. The other, as the Commission indicated, is the maximum possible administrative resolution of the continuing conflict between the utility and the towns. In settling the issues between Otter Tail and Elbow Lake, the Commission expects to put to rest at least some of the issues in which the other towns share an interest with Elbow Lake.

Otter Tail, on the other hand, contends that its contract with the Bureau of Reclamation for wheeling service to the 17 towns was vitiated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the antitrust case. See Part I <em>supra. </em>The shortcomings of that claim have already been exposed. On January 29, 1975, Otter Tail tendered to the Commission a schedule for firm transmission service to two of the towns at the 5-mill rate. The Commission rejected the filing as premature because the term of the Bureau-Otter Tail contract had not then expired. <em>Otter Tail Power Co., </em>No. E-9240 (F.P.C. Mar. 31, 1975). Otter Tail reasserted its theory in a petition for rehearing, which the Commission denied. <em>Otter Tail Power Co., </em>No. E-9240 (F.P.C. May 16, 1975). Subsequently, on June 23, 1975, Otter Tail sought to raise from 1 mill to 5 mills the transmission rate for the remaining 15 of the 17 towns. The Commission likewise disallowed that filing, but gave notice that it was initiating an investigation of the Bureau-Otter Tail contract pursuant to \u00a7 206 of the Act, <em>Otter Tail Power Co., </em>No. E-9507 (F.P.C. Aug. 29, 1975), and thereafter declined to rehear that ruling. <em>Otter Tail Power Co., </em>No. E-9507 (F.P.C. Oct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>10, 1975). On Otter Tail\u2019s petition for review of these orders, the Eighth Circuit affirmed, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-6\">We are unconvinced by Otter Tail\u2019s central contention that its existing contractual responsibility, as established by the [Bureau]Otter Tail agreement, was vitiated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision . .. The Supreme Court rendered invalid only the provision of the contract that permitted Otter Tail to refuse to sell power at wholesale rates to proposed municipal systems in the communities where it had been transmitting power at retail rates. The Court held that such a provision, which was designed to prevent municipal systems from eroding Otter Tail\u2019s monopolistic position, constituted a per se violation of the Sherman Act .. Although one provision of the [Bureau]-Otter Tail contract was invalidated, there is a clear policy favoring the severance of invalid restrictions appearing in agreements in restraint of trade and supporting the continued validity of the remainder of such contracts. . . . The determination of the viability of the [Bureau]Otter Tail contract involved a question of law, rather than a dispute of fact, that the [Commission] could resolve without an evi-dentiary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\"><em>Otter Tail Power Co. v. FPC, </em>536 F.2d 240, 242 (8th Cir. 1976) (footnote omitted). We are in full agreement with the court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">The Bureau-Otter Tail contract expired on December 31, 1976. That does not mean, however, that Elbow Lake\u2019s bid for a ruling on the discrimination issue is aborted. Although, as we later point out, see note 65 <em>infra, </em>Otter Tail has now filed a new rate, comparable to Elbow Lake\u2019s rate, for transmission service to the towns, the town-rate is currently under suspension by order of the Commission. Consequently, the differing rates paid by Elbow Lake and the towns remain as they were before expiration of the Bureau-Otter Tail contract. As the Commission concedes, and we agree, there can be no present argument for mootness. We intimate no view as to whether, but for the suspension, such an argument might be successful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">. <em>E. g., St. Michaels Utils.

It is settled law that a rate set by a contract cannot be changed by the unilateral act of either party thereto during the contract term. <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases (Continental Oil Co. v.

True it is that notwithstanding this principle \u2014 the so-called <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine \u2014 the Commission is empowered to alter contract rates in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity. <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases (Continental Oil Co. v. FPC), supra, </em>390 U.S. at 822, 88 S.Ct. at 1388-1389, 20 L.Ed.2d at 367; <em>FPC v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., supra </em>note 42, 350 U.S. at 353-355, 76 S.Ct. at 371-373, 100 L.Ed. at 394-395. But \u201cit does not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate affording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355, 76 S.Ct. at 372, 100 L.Ed. at 395 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">We are mindful that Otter Tail has long since been free to request agreement by the Bureau of Reclamation to an increase in the contract rate. That prerogative is incidental to any contractual arrangement, and is not tantamount to power to unilaterally make the change. We could not, without utterly discarding the Aio-<em>bile-Sierra </em>doctrine, attach particular significance to Elbow Lake\u2019s complaint that Otter Tail has not sought to secure the Bureau\u2019s consent to modification of the contract rate. Nor are we impressed by the argument that Otter Tail could have asked the Commission to raise the rates specified in its supplemental contracts with the towns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1090-11\">. We cannot accept Elbow Lake\u2019s additional argument that the invalidation in the antitrust litigation of a portion of the Bureau-Otter Tail contract establishes the remainder of that contract as the definition of Otter Tail\u2019s obligation to wheel power to Elbow Lake. The antitrust decisions nullified provisions of the contract which Otter Tail relied upon as justification for not providing service, but neither the District Court nor the Supreme Court set a rate for Elbow Lake. On the contrary, the District Court required, and the Supreme Court approved, the service \u201cat rates which are compensatory and under terms and conditions which are filed with and subject to approval by the . . . Commission.\u201d See text <em>infra </em>at note 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1090-14\">.

After earlier unsuccessful attempts to increase the rate for transmission service <em>to </em>the towns, see note 40 <em>supra, </em>Otter Tail recently filed a new rate for that service, effective upon expiration of the Bureau-Otter Tail contract. The rate, we are informed, is comparable to Elbow Lake\u2019s 5-mill rate. All of the ten petitioning towns, save one no longer served by Otter Tail, are parties to the proceeding addressing the new rate, which by Commission order is currently in suspension. With these developments, both Otter Tail and the Commission have moved, on grounds of mootness, to dismiss from this litigation the towns\u2019 complaint respecting their inclusion in the Elbow Lake proceeding as expanded. We think, however, that while undoubtedly the latest rate-filing against the towns has removed one of their objections, another remains to keep the controversy very much alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">The towns\u2019 opposition to implication in the expanded Elbow Lake proceeding has rested partly upon the claim that without the formal filing of a rate specifically applicable to them, they did not know just what rate they would have to defend against in the expanded proceeding. The new filing designating the rate that Otter Tail would have them pay eliminates so much of the towns\u2019 argument, if indeed Otter Tail\u2019s previously-announced proposal to eventually charge them the 5-mill rate had not already done so. See note 24 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. But, on the premise that a rate for the towns would inexorably emanate from the expanded proceeding, they also assert that the filing of such a rate was a jurisdictional prerequisite to exertion of the Commission\u2019s ratemaking authority against them in that proceeding, and thus to their involvement therein at all. Brief for Petitioner\u2019s at 31-34, 37-38. See also text <em>supra </em>at note 32. That issue persists, for so far as we are advised the Commission has not professed any intention whatever of rescinding the expansion order, and we can only presume that the expanded proceeding will be utilized as originally planned. If the towns are not to prevail, it is because their position lacks merit and not because the issue has disappeared. We accordingly deny the motion to dismiss for mootness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">.
