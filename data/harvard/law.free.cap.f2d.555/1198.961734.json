Fowler contends chiefly that the government failed to show that the bookmaking operation in which he concededly participated comprised five or more persons as required by \u00a7 1955(b)(1)(ii). Milton and Areaux contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>solely that expert witnesses for the prosecution \u201cinvaded the province of the jury\u201d by testifying with respect to ultimate facts in the case. We find both contentions merit-less and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">THE BOOKMAKING OPERATION REVISITED</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">As we explained in <em>United States v. Box, </em>530 F.2d 1258 (5th Cir. 1976), a successful bookmaker is not a gambler but a businessman. He makes his profits not from winning bets, but from collecting a certain percentage of the amount bet that the losing bettors must pay for the privilege of betting. This percentage, usually 10%, is called \u201cjuice\u201d or \u201cvigorish.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A bookmaker normally has a \u201cline\u201d or \u201cpoint spread\u201d on each game on which he is taking bets. The calculation is that an equal number of wagered dollars will be attracted to either side of the point spread. Thus, if the line in pro football is Washington by six over Dallas,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the bookmaker expects some bettors to wager as much on Dallas to win or to lose by six or fewer points as others will bet on Washington to prevail by more than six points. When this is true, the bookmaker is guaranteed a profit of exactly 10%. When it is not, he may win more than 10% or fail to clear 10%. When the bets placed with a bookmaker, are unbalanced, the risk-averse entrepreneur will adopt one of two strategies. The bookmaker may adjust his line up or down until it reaches equilibrium. More likely he will seek to \u201clay off\u201d a bet to another bookmaker or to a mere bettor. That is, the bookmaker will bet the more popular of the two teams in the amount (ideally) by which bets on that team exceed the sum bet on the disfavored team at a given point spread. If the popular team wins, he will thus pay out to his bettors more than he took in, but will offset this disbursement by his own lay off winnings. By this device the bookmaker seeks to balance his books and assure himself neither more nor less than a 10% profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-12\">If a bookmaker sets his line badly, he may find it difficult to lay off a sufficient number of bets to offset the risk of loss. Hence accurate \u201cline information\u201d regarding the expectations of his customers proves crucial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, bookmakers in a relevant market will seek to set a common line. If a particular bookmaker gives the Cowboys 6 points when all others give the Cowboys 3 points, all rational Cowboys fans will bet with the bookie who was out of line, and the rational Redskin fan (possibly an oxymoron) with all others. A rational bettor, as opposed to a rational fan, however, will bet equal amounts on the Cowboys plus six <em>and </em>the Redskins minus three. At worst, this cynical but rational bettor will win one bet and lose the other, suffering a net loss of 10% of the losing bet; at best, he will win both wagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>These hazards of the bookmaking business may be minimized, then, by lay off bets and frequent exchanges of line information among bookmakers. The difficult question in cases of this kind is typically whether lay off wagers and exchanges of line information among individuals or bookmaking operations suffices to create an illegal gambling operation comprising five or more persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">THE JURISDICTIONAL FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">For assessing appellant Fowler\u2019s claim that the bookmaking organization in which he participated lacked five members, we have our pick of seven conceded bookmaking operations from which potentially to fashion the critical mass of five individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Appellant Fowler concedes that he was a clerk for James Kent\u2019s bookmaking operation, that Thais Nix was a runner for that operation, and that Joseph Mills was a commission bookmaker working for James Kent. Fowler denies that more than four people were involved in the enterprise. The jury disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Evidence at trial, including transcripts of conversations recorded by government wiretaps, indicated that James Kent\u2019s bookmaking operation exchanged lay off bets and line information with bookmaking organizations operated by Angelo (Uncle Lon) Nicotri, Victor Candiotto, Tony Martinez, Maxie (Fat Man) Milton, Andrew Areaux, and John (Rose) Kent. The jury\u2019s conclusion that the prosecution met its burden of establishing the jurisdictional five need only have rested on the premise that any one of these bookmakers was part of James Kent\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Much of the government\u2019s evidence is, nevertheless, at best problematic and at worst insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s conclusion, and we take this opportunity to reiterate why this should be so. Simply put, evidence that two bookmakers occasionally exchange line information does not itself warrant the conclusion that one bookmaker is a participant in the other\u2019s operation for purposes of \u00a7 1955. Rather, it must be shown additionally that the receipt of line information by one bookmaker substantially affects the other\u2019s business or that there is a constant exchange of line information between the two. <em>See United States v. McCoy, </em>539 F.2d 1050, 1061-62 (5th Cir. 1976). Similarly, isolated and casual lay off bets between bookmakers may not be sufficient to establish that one bookmaker is conducting or financing the business of a second. <em>See id. </em>at 1061; <em>United States v. Thomas, supra, </em>508 F.2d at 1206. Moreover, bets between bookmakers may be personal wagers that are not lay off bets. On the other hand, evidence of a consistent pattern of lay off betting or exchanging line information between two bookmakers may establish the essential link between them for purposes of \u00a7 1955.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">We need not explore these complexities in the case at bar; even without considering the pattern and frequency of lay off betting and exchanging line information, the evidence showing Fowler\u2019s bookmaking organization to comprise the jurisdictional five excluded all reasonable contrary hypotheses. For example, evidence showed that appellant Andrew Areaux collected wagers from customers on behalf of James Kent\u2019s bookmaking organization and received commissions from James Kent for his efforts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence that Areaux was a commissioned bookmaker for James Kent may be broken down into four elements. First, the transcripts produced by the government\u2019s wiretap surveillance revealed that Areaux frequently called in bets to the Kent office, where Fowler received the calls. In at least some of these it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>that Areaux was calling in bets made by others.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, the transcripts show that Fowler and Areaux discussed customers of the Kent organization. Fowler admonished Areaux to make sure that the customers continued to bet.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Third, the record discloses that Fowler telephoned Areaux to apprise him of line changes made by the Kent organization. An efficient bookmaking organization must constantly alert its commissioned agents to line updates. The main organization is obligated' to honor all bets collected by its agents at the point spread the sub-bookies announce to their customers. The agent is often out of contact with the main organization and the line he peddles may thus lag dangerously behind market fluctuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-26\">Hence the line updates Fowler offered Ar-eaux are significant. Finally, police seized from Areaux the latter\u2019s \u201ccatch up\u201d records, revealing the base amounts on which he expected to earn a commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-27\">In short, the evidence showed that James Kent\u2019s organization employed Areaux as a commissioned bookmaker. Areaux consistently passed on his customers\u2019 bets to Kent and expected in return a percentage of the profits. His efforts were not sporadic or casual, but rather evince a carefully planned and coordinated effort between Ar-eaux and Kent\u2019s agent, Fowler.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-28\">We conclude that there was ample evidence to support Fowler\u2019s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The juice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>spread and Fowler and Areaux were spliced into the quintant arc of conduction. The circuits were serpentine and heavily insulated, but the conduction points equalled or exceeded the quintet required by \u00a7 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">EXPERT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"A7h\">The sole issue raised by appellants Milton and Areaux is that the government\u2019s expert witnesses \u201cinvaded the province of the jury\u201d by interpreting transcripts of conversations among the defendants. Specifically, Milton and Areaux object to the witnesses\u2019 interpretation of certain bets as lay off bets, to the experts\u2019 inferences regarding each defendant\u2019s role in Kent\u2019s organization, and to expert testimony that a bookmaker who for commission passes wagers on to a central gambling operation becomes part of that operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">We reject appellants\u2019 attack. Rule 704 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-7\">Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">To be sure, Rule 704 does not paint with a broad brush, and expert opinion evidence may still be excluded if its prejudicial impact substantially outweighs its probative value, if it wastes time, <em>see </em>Rule 403, Fed.R. Evid., or if the trial court determines that the expert\u2019s specialized knowledge will not assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid. Although the qualifying of a witness as an expert does not render his every conclusion immune from challenge, see <em>United States v. Ragano, </em>476 F.2d 410 (5th Cir. 1973), the mere fact that an expert\u2019s conclusion trenches upon a jury issue does not compel its exclusion. Wigmore aptly characterizes the basis usually assigned for the \u201cultimate issue\u201d rule \u2014 that the witness may not usurp the province of the jury \u2014 as \u201ca mere bit of empty rhetoric.\u201d VII Wigmore \u00a7 1920 (3d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">Rule 704 abolishes the per se rule against testimony regarding ultimate issues of fact. By the same token, however, courts must remain vigilant against the admission of legal conclusions, and an expert witness may not substitute for the court in charging the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>See Huff v. United States, </em>273 F.2d 56 (5th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">The trial court in the case at bar did not err in allowing the government\u2019s experts to characterize certain wagers as lay off bets or to interpret the transcripts with respect to appellants\u2019 respective roles in James Kent\u2019s gambling organization.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This court recently observed in a \u00a7 1955 case presenting a similar issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-14\">Although we have, on occasion, frowned upon the practice of asking an expert to give his conclusions as to the entire case <em>(see United States v. Ragano, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 476 F.2d 410, 416-17) admissibility of an expert\u2019s conclusion depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>on the nature of the issue and the circumstances of the case, and involves a large element of judicial discretion. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 Cir. 1934, 73 F.2d 357, 358-59.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-4\">Here, in characterizing certain transactions as lay-offs, the expert was correctly drawing \u201cinferences from the facts which a jury would not be competent to draw\u201d. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 13 (1954). It is questionable that these conclusions concerned an \u201cultimate issue\u201d. Even if they did, that does not require their exclusion. <em>Hamilton, supra. </em>The testimony challenged here is not unlike that referred to in upholding \u00a7 1955 convictions in <em>United States v. Bohn, </em>8 Cir. 1975, 508 F.2d 1145, 1149-50, <em>cert, denied, </em>421 U.S. 947, 95 S.Ct. 1676, 44 L.Ed.2d 100. <em>See also </em>Fed. Rule Evid. 704.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\"><em>United States v. McCoy, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">A third aspect of the expert testimony objected to by appellants raises a more col-orable claim. The court allowed a government witness who was interpreting the transcripts to enumerate certain activities that ostensibly established the actor as \u201ca part of the gambling business.\u201d The witness\u2019s statement in context is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axg-dedup-1\">There\u2019s a statement almost halfway through the page where Mr. Rose says: \u201cA friend of mine gave me Florida plus And then further on: \u201cI\u2019ll hold a couple of dollars on that myself.\u201d An individual who accepts wagers either from a friend, usually a bookmaker\u2019s immediate customers, or, of course, his friends, but a person who accepts wagers from other individuals, whether they be friends or associates, he passes them all on to a gambling business; if he does this for profit in the case of an agent or a sub-book or as a commissioned book that makes him part of that business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Vol. III, Trial Transcript at 372-73. Appellants urge that this statement should have been excluded as a legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">The conclusion that one who passes on bets for a percentage of profits is a part of the central gambler\u2019s business may, if taken out of context, seem more like a legal than a factual conclusion. In the context in which this statement appears, however, and under the circumstances of this complex case, we cannot say that the district court erred in allowing it. The government\u2019s witness was interpreting an otherwise obscure transcript and drawing upon his experience in the field to give some content to the role of the commissioned bookmaker. There is no contention that, insofar as the agent stated the law, he stated it incorrectly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event, the statement is more amenable to interpretation as an empirical observation that a commissioned bookmaker is characteristically part of a central bookmaking operation. The statement was not likely taken as promoting a legal doctrine that for purposes of \u00a7 1955 one who passes on bets for profit necessarily conducts the central gambling business. Indeed, the witness mentioned neither \u00a7 1955 nor any of its operative terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s admonitions to the jury to accord no unusual deference to expert testimony and to take the court\u2019s instructions as the sole source of applicable law, and its careful instructions regarding the necessary factual conditions for finding that a person \u201cconducted\u201d a gambling business for purposes of \u00a7 1955 helped protect against the jury\u2019s misconstruing this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">The provinces of judge, jury and expert witness are not cartographically immutable and precise. Courts must accommodate to the expertise that the jury must receive from those who possess it, lest the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>flounder in confusion begotten by the arcane. The trial judge must have discretion to discern the needs presented by a particular case and the forms of expert testimony that may best guide the jury over unfamiliar terrain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">In this case the jury\u2019s task was to parse the argot of gambling. A predilection for gambling may be a constant in societal arrangements, but its modes have changed and not every person is acquainted with its permutations and variations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">The odds were that both judge and jury needed some expert guidance in penetrating the lines, finding the lay offs and putting all the odds together to decide whether the composite was gambling within the ambit of \u00a7 1955. The court was obligated to see the bookmaker\u2019s lexicon made intelligible to those unlearned in the argot if not the art. The jurors had to understand the gambler\u2019s lyric before they could sing the fateful quintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1259-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-14\">(a) Whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-15\">(b) As used in this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-16\">(1) \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d means a gambling business which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-17\">(i) is a violation of the law of a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-18\">(ii) involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-30\">(iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-31\">(2) \u201cgambling\u201d includes but is not limited to pool-selling, bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, roulette wheels or dice tables, and conducting lotteries, policy, bolita or numbers games, or selling chances therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-32\">Louisiana Revised Statutes, \u00a7 14:90, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-33\">Gambling is the intentional conducting or directly assisting in the conducting, as a business, of any game, contest, lottery, or contri-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>vanee whereby a person risks the loss of anything of value in order to realize a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-7\">Whoever commits the crime of gambling shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars, or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">.

Appellant Fowler also objects to an instruction given the jury. Because he failed to object to that instruction at trial, he must, of course, demonstrate that the court\u2019s offering it was plain error. The instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-31\">If you find that five or more persons knowingly associate themselves together to carry out a common plan or arrangement, with the intent either to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or to accomplish some lawful purpose by unlawful means, there arises from the very act of knowingly associating themselves together with such intent, a kind of partnership in which each member becomes the agent of every other member so, where the evidence in the case shows such a common plan or arrangement beyond a reasonable doubt, evidence as to an act knowingly done or a statement knowingly made by one such person while the common plan or arrangement is continuing, and in furtherance of some object or purpose thereof, is admissible against all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1262-32\">Fowler contends that giving this instruction was plain error because it is a classic conspiracy instruction and the appellants were not on trial for conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-33\">The instruction did not charge the jury to find a conspiracy violation. Strictly speaking, it deals only with the admissibility of evidence rather than with the basis for conviction. Even considering the instruction as a guide to the admissibility of evidence, however, it is worth noting that the theory underlying it has been applied in \u00a7 1955 cases. In <em>United States v. DiMuro, </em>540 F.2d 503 (1st Cir. 1976), for exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>pie, appellant bookmakers had been connected to a centrally controlled gambling organization. Appellants argued that it was improper to admit against a defendant information from branches of the organization with which that defendant was not directly concerned. The court disagreed, holding that it was proper to admit all such information against all appellants connected with the organization. <em>Id. </em>at 508 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">In any event, the appellants have not demonstrated that this instruction was prejudicial on the facts of this case. Without endorsing the use of this instruction in future \u00a7 1955 cases, it is clear to us that, on the facts of this case and taking the court\u2019s charge as a whole, its use in the case at bar did not amount to plain error. The charge elsewhere made clear that each defendant had to be connected by virtue of his or her own acts with a gambling organization meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1955.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1263-16\">. Ironically, a survey of the trial transcript reveals at least twelve instances in which defense attorneys clearly sought to elicit on cross-examination precisely the kind of conclusions about which appellants now complain. See Vol. I at 326, 377, 332, 500; Vol. II at 112, 194, 215, 225, 227, 229; Vol. III at 56, 190. This appears to have been ignored by appellants\u2019 counsel on appeal, who cites as an example of the abuse of expert testimony a conclusion that defense counsel elicited on cross-examination. See Brief for Appellants Milton and Areaux at 13, quoting Vol. III, Trial Transcript at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">. The touchstone for determining whether an accused \u201cconducts an illegal gambling business\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1955 is whether that person \u201cperforms a necessary function other than as a mere customer or bettor in the operation of illegal gambling.\u201d <em>United States v. Joseph, supra, </em>519 F.2d at 1071, <em>citing United States v. Jones, </em>491 F.2d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
