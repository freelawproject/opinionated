The sole issue on appeal is whether Appellant was deprived of due process of law when the Ohio Adult Parole Authority revoked his parole without holding a revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-24\">On June 15,1970, Appellant pled guilty to burglary of an inhabited dwelling and was sentenced to a term of five to thirty years imprisonment. On March 25, 1974, he was placed on furlough and on April 20,1974, he was paroled. While on parole, Appellant was indicted in the September, 1974 term of the Franklin County, Ohio, common pleas court for one count of forgery, one count of aggravated robbery, and one count of possessing a weapon while under a disability. On November 20, 1974, Appellant pled guilty to forgery, assault, and possession of a weapon while under a disability and was sentenced to two to five years on the forgery and weapon counts, and six months on the assault count, to be served concurrently.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 13, 1974, Appellant was declared a parole violator. In accordance with regulations then in force, he was not afforded a parole revocation hearing. Appellant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus from his sentence on the 1970 conviction, but the petition was denied by the District Court. The Court noted that Appellant\u2019s violation of a condition of parole is conclusively established by the 1974 felony convictions. A parolee is not free to relitigate intervening criminal convictions in a parole revocation hearing. The District Court also decided that it would be futile to hold a final revocation hearing on mitigating circumstances because Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.41 automatically precludes reinstatement on parole until after a statutory minimum sentence is served.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>purpose would be served by a revocation hearing, the District Court held that the Adult Parole Authority had not deprived Appellant of due process by summarily revoking his parole. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480-82, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), the Supreme Court recognized that a parolee has significant liberty interest in a parole which is entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause. At minimum, due process requires that the parolee be given a hearing before revocation of his parole. 408 U.S. at 487-90, 92 S.Ct. 2593. \u201cThe parolee must have an opportunity to be heard and to show, if he can, that he did not violate the conditions, or, if he did, that circumstances in mitigation suggest that the violation does not warrant revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 92 S.Ct. at 2603. We agree with the District Court that Appellant may not relitigate his 1974 felony convictions at a revocation hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 490, 92 S.Ct. 2593. However, in <em>Preston v. Piggman, </em>496 F.2d 270, 274 (6th Cir. 1974), this Court held that, even if a parolee admits violation of a condition of parole, he is still entitled to present evidence in mitigation. <em>See also Pope v. Chew, </em>521 F.2d 400, 404-05 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Caton v. Smith, </em>486 F.2d 733, 735 (7th Cir. 1973). We are not convinced that provision of a revocation hearing is a useless gesture where a condition of parole is violated by an intervening felony conviction. Counsel for the Adult Parole Authority admitted that since the decision in In<em>mates Councilmatic Voice v. Rogers, </em>No. C 72-1052 (N.D.Ohio 1974), <em>aff\u2019d and modified, </em>541 F.2d 633 (6th Cir. 1976), the Adult Parole Authority has promulgated rules pursuant to stipulations entered in that case which afford final revocation hearings in all cases, including those where a parolee is convicted of a new crime. The construction placed on Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.41(b)(3) by the District Court would render those regulations a nullity in cases involving a subsequent felony conviction, or at best, transform the hearing into an empty formalism. In <em>Preston v. Piggman, </em>496 F.2d at 275 n.1, the Court commented that \u201c[t]he automatic revocation of parole for every parole violation regardless of the mitigating circumstances clearly runs counter to the dictates of the [Supreme] Court in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer.\u201d </em>To construe Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.41(b)(3), as did the District Court, would create a class of cases where parole revocation is automatic, without benefit of a meaningful hearing on mitigation. This result would conflict with the doctrine expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>and its progeny, as interpreted by this Court in <em>Preston v. Piggman. </em>A more reasonable construction of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.41(b)(3) is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with when a parole should be revoked, but was designed to set out rules for the imposition of sentence on a subsequent conviction after a parole has been revoked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Regardless of how the statute is construed, we adhere to the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>expressed in <em>Inmates Councilmatic Voice v. Rogers, </em>541 F.2d at 636, that a parolee convicted of a subsequent crime is entitled to a parole revocation hearing if he requests it and the hearing should be held within a reasonable time. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and remanded, with instructions to order the Adult Parole Authority to provide Appellant with a revocation hearing within a reasonable time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-20\">. The common pleas judge stipulated that the two to five year sentence imposed in case number 74CR-11-2047 was to be served consecutively to Appellant\u2019s present parole sentence. The District Court characterized Appellant\u2019s confinement on the prior sentence as a consequence of his guilty plea on the 1974 charge rather than as incident to a parole revocation. More likely, however, the common pleas judge assumed revocation of Appellant\u2019s parole when sentencing Appellant on the 1974 conviction so the principles of <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>are still applicable. <em>See also </em>discussion note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Afc\">.
