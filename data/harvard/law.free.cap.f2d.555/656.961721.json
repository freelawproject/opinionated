C. Brimer was subsequently moved to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia then transferred petitioner\u2019s cause to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The record before us is silent as to the reasons or authority for this transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">Brimer\u2019s pro se petition sought relief in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis and requested the expunction and correction of allegedly illegal and erroneous entries on his FBI rap sheet. Brimer alleged that his attempts to have these records corrected by responsible local authorities had failed. Because the relief sought by Brimer could not be properly granted by a writ of error coram nobis, the District Court for the Western District of Missouri construed Brimer\u2019s petition to be one seeking a writ of mandamus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1970) and noted that if petitioner\u2019s allegations could be substantiated, he might be entitled to relief pursuant to <em>Menard v. Saxbe, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 284, 498 F.2d 1017 (1974). The District Court held, however, that venue was not proper in the Western District of Missouri and, accordingly, dismissed the petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (1970) without prejudice to Brim-er\u2019s right to refile his suit in a proper court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">We agree with the District Court that venue does not lie in the Western District of Missouri. The statute controlling venue provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-18\">A civil action in which each defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity * * * may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which: (1) a defendant in the action resides, or (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>cause of action arose, or (3) any real property involved in the action is situated, or (4) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Clearly, the first three subdivisions of \u00a7 1391(e) have no bearing on the present case. Thus, the only possible basis for venue in the Western District of Missouri would depend upon petitioner\u2019s residence in Missouri. Petitioner does not allege that he is a resident of Missouri or that he is domiciled in Missouri. A review of the record reveals no ground for believing that Brim-er\u2019s presence in Missouri is anything other than involuntary and temporary. We conclude, that Brimer is not a resident of Missouri and that venue, accordingly, is not proper in the Western District of Missouri. Obviously, this action could not have properly been brought in the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">When venue has been improperly laid in a district court, that court has two alternative means of disposing of the cause so filed. It is empowered to dismiss the cause or, if it be in the interest of justice, to transfer the cause to any district in which it could have been brought. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). The District Court here chose to dismiss Brimer\u2019s petition. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, which suggest the possibility of a nascent Catch 22 situation, we deem this disposition inappropriate. We believe that the administration of justice would be better served by a transfer to the District Court for the District of Columbia, which we consider not only a district in which this action might have been brought, but also a more convenient forum therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Remanded to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
