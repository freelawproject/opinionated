The Pennsylvania statute provides for reimbursement of a plaintiff-employee\u2019s counsel fees under the heading \u201cSubrogation of Employer\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-30\"><em>\u00a7 671. Subrogation of employer to rights of employee against third persons; sub-rogation of employer or insurer to amount paid prior to award </em>Where the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>omission of a third party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe, his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, against such third party to the extent of the compensation payable under this article by the employer; reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other proper disbursements incurred in obtaining a recovery or in effecting a compromise settlement shall be prorated between the employer and employe, his personal representative, his estate or his dependents. The employer shall pay that proportion of the attorney\u2019s fees and other proper disbursements that the amount of compensation paid or payable at the time of recovery or settlement bears to the total recovery or settlement. Any recovery against such third person in excess of the compensation theretofore paid by the employer shall be paid forthwith to the employe, his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, and shall be treated as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future instalments of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">When it was enacted in 1915, \u00a7 671 made no mention of counsel fees. The section codified the employer\u2019s subrogation rights to prevent double recovery by the employee, <em>Skoda v. National Mines Corp., </em>213 Pa. Super. 489, 249 A.2d 829 (1968), and to encourage participation in the then-voluntary program by limiting the employer\u2019s indemnification liability. <em>O\u2019Neill v. United States, </em>450 F.2d 1012, 1017 (3d Cir. 1971). In the original scheme, the employer recouped 100% of its prior compensation payments but effectively reduced the employee\u2019s recovery by contributing nothing to the cost of obtaining the fund. This inequity was corrected in 1937 by an amendment which allowed subrogation in the amount of compensation benefits, \u201cless reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Conrad v. Aero-Mayflower Transit Co,, </em>152 Pa.Super. 477, 33 A.2d 91 (1943). A further refinement, which survived subsequent amendments to the section, provided that attorney\u2019s fees be prorated between employer and employee in the manner quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Under Pennsylvania law, an employer joined as a defendant and found liable may not recover prior compensation payments. Appellant, the unlucky employer in the proceedings below, argues that \u201csubrogation\u201d under \u00a7 671 applies only when the employer actually recovers part of the employee\u2019s fund. Notwithstanding that its liability to the original defendant may not exceed amounts paid or payable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, <em>Burke v. Duquesne Light Co., </em>231 Pa.Super. 412, 332 A.2d 544, 547 (1974), appellant protests that it has realized no benefit from the employee\u2019s endeavors and should not be required to subsidize them.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">This court last discussed \u00a7 671 in <em>Dowhy </em>v. <em>Harvey B. Moyer, Inc., </em>278 F.2d 753 (3d Cir.), <em>aff'g per curiam </em>184 F.Supp. 31 (E.D. Pa.1960). In <em>Dowhy </em>the employer\u2019s entire liability for compensation benefits had not yet been determined when it was joined and held liable as a defendant in the employee\u2019s action against a third party. The district court held that the accepted formula for satisfaction of the judgment against the original defendant, <em>Maio v. Fahs, </em>339 Pa. 180, 14 A.2d 105 (1940), was inappropriate where the employer\u2019s payments were unliq-uidated. If the employer were given credit for the partial payments already made, the original defendant would actually receive the counsel fee due the employee. Since attorney\u2019s fees could not be prorated until compensation was fully paid, the court directed the original defendant to pay the verdict in full and enforce his judgment for contribution against the employer in a subsequent action, at which time \u201cthe employer will then recover from the employee such sum as he is entitled to.\u201d 184 F.Supp. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">For our purposes, the reasoning in <em>Dowhy </em>is more relevant than the result. As this court stated in its affirmance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">It is perfectly clear that by virtue of the amendment, the employee is entitled to a pro rata counsel fee measured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>amount of the employer\u2019s liability to him for compensation whether the compensation has been paid or not. <em>Soliday v. Hires Turner Glass Co., </em>1958, 187 Pa.Super. 44, 142 A.2d 425, allocatur refused. The statute makes no exception for the case where the employer has been found liable for contribution as a joint tort-feasor. Appellant would have us construe the statute to require an innocent employer to pay counsel fees but allow one who was at fault to recover in full. [T]he statutory amount that the employer can recover under this [sub-rogation] right is the amount of payments of compensation less a pro rata share of counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">278 F.2d at 754-55. <em>See also DiVirgilio v. Norton Co., </em>344 F.Supp. 552 (W.D.Pa.1972); <em>Curtis v. Simpson Chevrolet, </em>348 F.Supp. 1062, 1064 (E.D.Pa.1972); <em>Quinones v. Township of Upper Moreland, </em>199 F.Supp. 758 (E.D.Pa.1961). Section 671 clearly applies to situations in which the employer is a joint tortfeasor: \u201cWhere the compensable injury is caused <em>in whole or in part </em>by . a third party . . . reasonable attorney\u2019s fees . . . incurred in obtaining a recovery . . . shall be prorated between the employer and employe . . . .\u201d The employer benefits even when it does not actually recoup the compensation actually paid, since its exposure as a tortfeasor and, therefore, its liability to other defendants, is expressly limited. Having benefitted from the employee\u2019s action in the proportion of compensation paid to the total recovery, the employer should be responsible for counsel fees to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b185-13\">JAMES HUNTER, III, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Alb\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Once again we are, because of diversity jurisdiction, required to guess what the Pennsylvania law would be. Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conjecture as to Pennsylvania law, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">As I see it, the overriding concern of the Pennsylvania legislature is to provide limited liability<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the workmen\u2019s compensation employer. The employee who is covered by workmen\u2019s compensation cannot sue an employer for negligence. That much is clear. What has been unusual in Pennsylvania, and what ties the Gordian knot in this case, is a court-created right of contribution against an employer. When the injured employee sues an outside party, that party can join the employer, who, if found jointly liable, can be held responsible for contribution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">If there were no right of contribution, the defendant would pay the entire amount, and the employer could then recover, under 77 P.S. \u00a7 671, any amounts paid in workmen\u2019s compensation. Section 671 also provides that an employer who receives that recoupment benefit must pay a prorated share of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. That, indeed, is the standard Pennsylvania subrogation procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">The abnormal procedure, which allows a defendant to receive contribution from an employer, who would be otherwise immune from a tort suit, was created by the Pennsylvania courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Equity seemed to demand that an employer who was also negligent should not get off scot-free when the employee successfully sued someone else. On the other hand, essential to a successful compensation program is the assurance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>an employer\u2019s outlay is strictly limited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The compromise effected by the courts was to make the negligent employer contribute an amount not to exceed the employer\u2019s liability under workmen\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The conflict between the statutory mandate that a subrogated employer must pay a share of attorney\u2019s fees and the courts\u2019 allowance of limited contribution has never been resolved by the Pennsylvania courts. Perhaps aware of the insoluble tangles created by the superimposition of contribution on subrogation, the Pennsylvania legislature has now expressly prohibited contribution in such cases. 77 P.S. \u00a7 481 (Purdon\u2019s Supp.1976-77). Unfortunately, we have this term been presented with two cases in which we must guess at Pennsylvania\u2019s preferred solution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The stage is set as follows. The employee receives a verdict against an outside defendant; the employer, a third party defendant, is found jointly liable; workmen\u2019s compensation has been or will be paid. The original defendant is, therefore, entitled to a \u201ccredit\u201d of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This can be effected either by deducting that amount from the verdict, as happened in the case <em>sub judice, </em>or by having the defendant pay the full verdict and then go against the employer for the compensation amount, as happened in <em>Cianfero, see </em>footnote 6 <em>supra. </em>The next step is our narrow issue: should the employer pay a share of attorney\u2019s fees <em>in addition </em>to paying the full workmen\u2019s compensation amount?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">By focusing on the employer\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses one can appreciate the significance of the question. As between a non-suing employee and his or her employer, the employer will not be out of pocket any more than the ceiling of payments due under the workmen\u2019s compensation program. If the employee recovers against an outside party who does not join the employer, the employer can recoup payments made <em>less </em>a share of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, the employer will be out of pocket <em>less </em>than the workmen\u2019s compensation program\u2019s ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">Now, in the case before us, the employer can be forced to pay in contribution \u201can amount not to exceed his liability under the Act.\u201d Suppose the employer pays, to the original defendant, the maximum under the regular compensation program. If a share of attorney\u2019s fees is <em>added </em>to that amount, the employer will be out of pocket <em>more </em>than he or she could be under the state compensation program. That is the result reached by the majority opinion, and that is where I disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>First, this additional cost to the employer ean only occur when contribution has been allowed. And, when the state courts devised their contribution theory, they repeatedly specified that in no event was the employer\u2019s liability to exceed the amount in the usual compensation program. To demand that Evans Products Company pay attorney\u2019s fees here is to demand payments in excess of Evans\u2019 liability under the Act. It has the additional drawback of requiring an employer to pay <em>more </em>when someone else is also negligent than when solely the employer is negligent. See footnote 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">But, it is argued, if the employer does not pay a share of attorney\u2019s fees, the plaintiff will be unduly burdened. Here, for instance, Grimm would pay a contingent fee based on the total award even though part of that award represents his workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. I agree that this would be unfair.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">My solution would be to deduct the prorated share of attorney\u2019s fees from the workmen\u2019s compensation amount that will be contributed to the original defendant. The employer would then be out of pocket no more than under the Act; yet the injured plaintiff would not be unfairly charged with legal fees. The burden, of course, would fall on the original defendant. One way of looking at it would be to say that, under my plan, the original defendant would be paying the employer\u2019s share of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. I prefer to view it as: the original defendant, who receives any contribution only by the state courts\u2019 desire to do equity, will receive only that amount which does not leave the employer out of pocket more than he or she would be under the normal statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">My solution can also be visualized mechanically as follows. The original defendant pays the total amount of the verdict, then asks the employer for contribution. The employer will contribute what can be recovered from the employee via subrogation. As payment to the employee for re-coupment, the employer receives back the workmen\u2019s compensation amount <em>less </em>a share of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That lessened amount is then contributed to the original defendant, who, as I said, is fortunate to receive anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Finally, I am convinced that we approve just such a procedure in <em>Dowhy, supra. </em>The issue before us in <em>Dowhy </em>was whether the original defendant had satisfied his judgment when he paid the verdict amount as reduced by the entire amount paid to the employee as workmen\u2019s compensation. We hold he had not, <em>because </em>the employee was entitled to receive a prorated share of.counsel fees from the employer. We said that the original defendant was, in effect, trying to use the employer\u2019s right of subrogation\u2014 which he could not do \u2014 but even if he could, the employer would recover only \u201cthe amount of payments of compensation <em>less </em>a pro rata share of counsel fees.\u201d 278 F.2d at 755 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">The district court in <em>Dowhy, </em>with whose opinion we fully agreed, described the state procedure as I have done. Before attorney\u2019s fees were a factor, the original defendant would deduct compensation received, and pay the balance. This worked a short-cut. Otherwise the defendant would pay all; the employee would remit to the employer compensation payments; the employer would then contribute that amount to the defendant. But with attorney\u2019s fees as a factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The same procedure . . . would not be doing equity between the parties. It is certain that some of the money received by the plaintiff as compensation payments should not be paid over by him to his employer, because he is entitled to retain a counsel fee by reason of the benefit which he [has] conferred upon his employer by his success in this litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZb\">184 F.Supp. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The clear implication is that now the defendant could deduct the compensation amount <em>less </em>a portion representing plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees. Otherwise, said the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">the defendant, in effect, would be taking the employee\u2019s money (counsel fee) which the latter is entitled to keep and applying it to his (defendant\u2019s) judgment for contribution against the third party (employer).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Dowhy, </em>however, the unliquidated amount of compensation payments made it impossible to arrive at an exact amount, so the court ordered the defendant to pay the full verdict after which he could work out the employer\u2019s contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">To reach a result that would be correct in my view, this court should order the contribution credit to be reduced by a prorated share of the employee\u2019s counsel fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\">. I use this term for convenience. See <em>Socha v. Metz, </em>385 Pa. 632, 637, 123 A.2d 837, 839 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-11\">. <em>See, e. g., Brown v. Dickey, </em>397 Pa. 454, 155 A.2d 836 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-12\">. The first case to allow contribution was Maio v. <em>Fahs, </em>339 Pa. 180, 14 A.2d 105 (1940). The court was faced with a conflict between the state contribution among joint tortfeasors rule and the exclusivity of workmen\u2019s compensation payments as the employer\u2019s liability. The compromise was to allow contribution but to limit it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-19\">The limit of the contribution which may be obtained by the paying defendant from [the employer] is the limit of <em>that </em>defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff under the Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-20\">339 Pa. at 192, 14 A.2d at 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. Such assurance is particularly important in Pennsylvania, where participation in the workmen\u2019s compensation program is voluntary. <em>O\u2019Neill v. United States, </em>450 F.2d 1012, 1017 (3d Cir. 1971) (dicta).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">. The <em>Maio </em>holding was carefully re-examined in <em>Brown, supra </em>note 2. The court concluded that the original defendant\u2019s equitable right to contribution must bow to the employer\u2019s statutory right to be free from common law liability. 397 Pa. at 459, 155 A.2d at 839.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">. The other case is <em>Cianfero v. American La-France Corp., </em>Civ.No. 76-1808. There the original defendant paid the full verdict, and asked the joint tortfeasor employer for contribution. The employer recouped, from the employee, workmen\u2019s compensation paid <em>less </em>a portion retained by the employee for counsel fees. The employer tendered the reduced amount to the defendant who refused it, claiming entitlement to the full compensation amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\">. To simplify we will assume the compensation payments have already been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b186-14\">. Two federal district courts have ruled on this issue. In <em>Quinones v. Upper Moreland, </em>199 F.Supp. 758, 762 (E.D.Pa.1961), the court said no, as for past compensation, the employee must remit to the defendant that amount <em>iess </em>a share for counsel fees; as for future payments, the employer would pay two-thirds to the defendant, as contribution, and one-third to the employee, for counsel fees. <em>See </em>footnote 10 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-15\">On the other hand, the court in <em>DiVirgilio v. Norton Co., </em>344 F.Supp. 552 (W.D.Pa. 1972), said yes, when the entire compensation amount had been applied as a credit, the employer must, in addition, pay a share of plaintiffs counsel fees.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b186-16\">. The strong state policy of limiting the contributing employer\u2019s expenses is repeated in <em>Elston v. Industrial Lift Truck Co., </em>420 Pa. 97, 216 A,2d 318 (1966) (per Roberts, J.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-17\">Absent such a limitation on contribution, the employer could complain with considerable cogency that he has been compelled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>contribute to a recovery by the employee beyond the amount that the latter would be entitled to under workmen\u2019s compensation. Thus, he would be exposed to a potentially larger liability in those circumstances in which a third-party tortfeasor was involved than where his own negligence was the sole cause of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">420 Pa. at 103 n. 3, 216 A.2d at 320 n. 3 (dicta).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AdP\">. On this, I agree with the majority\u2019s reliance on our opinion in <em>Dowhy v. Eastern Engineering Co., </em>278 F.2d 753 (3d Cir. 1960): the employer remains liable for a proportionate share of counsel fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b187-13\">. If there are also future workmen\u2019s compensation payments due, the employer can turn over those payments, as the time comes, in a bifurcated fashion \u2014 a part of each going to the plaintiff-employee as reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees. This, incidentally, was the treatment ordered by the lower court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
