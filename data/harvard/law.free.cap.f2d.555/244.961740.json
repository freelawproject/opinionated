Code of 1954, \u00a7 2035.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Since the property was transferred for less than adequate consideration within three years of Lowe\u2019s death, it is presumed to have been transferred in contemplation of death \u201cunless shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. % </em>2035(b). <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, </em>488 F.2d 575, 576 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>Estate of Compton v. C. I. R, </em>532 F.2d 1086, 1087 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Berman v. United States, </em>487 F.2d 70, 72 (5th Cir. 1973). The Tax Court held that the estate had not met its burden of proving to the contrary, and it found that the transfer in trust was made by Lowe \u201cin contemplation of death.\u201d <em>See Allen v. Trust Co., </em>326 U.S. 630, 635-36, 66 S.Ct. 389, 90 L.Ed. 367 (1946); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>283 U.S. 102, 115-20, 51 S.Ct. 446, 75 L.Ed. 867 (1931); <em>Gillette\u2019s Estate v. C. I. R, </em>182 F.2d 1010, 1015 (9th Cir. 1950). Having given due consideration to the factors advanced by the parties \u2014 including Lowe\u2019s state of health at the time of the transfer, his previous marriages and eventual third marriage, and the numerous wills, codicils, and <em>inter vivos </em>trusts which he executed between 1961 and his death in 1969 \u2014 we cannot say that the Tax Court\u2019s finding of fact, <em>see Allen, supra </em>at 636, 66 S.Ct. 389, is clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); Int.Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 7482(a); <em>Gillette's Estate, supra </em>at 1013-14 (applying former \u00a7 1141(a), now \u00a7 7482(a)); <em>Sullivan\u2019s Estate v. C. I. R, </em>175 F.2d 657, 658 (9th Cir. 1949) (same); <em>Estate of Compton, supra </em>at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. Section 2035 has recently been amended. <em>See </em>Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. 94-455, Title XX, \u00a7 2001(a)(5), 90 Stat. 1848. Includa-bility under the revised \u00a7 2035 no longer turns on a construction of the prior statutory phrase \u201cin contemplation of death.\u201d The amendments to \u00a7 2035, however, are not applicable to transfers made before January 1, 1977. <em>See </em>Tax Reform Act of 1976, \u00a7 2001(d)(1), 90 Stat. 1854. The transfer in trust at issue in the instant case took place in 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
