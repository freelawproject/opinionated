We affirm the district court on the basis of its memorandum opinion entered on August 25, 1976, and appended to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-27\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b539-28\">MEMORANDUM OF OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b539-29\">This litigation arises from a multi-vehicle accident which occurred on a public road in rural Sumter County, Alabama. The drivers of two of the vehicles, Cathrene E. Greenhaw and Harvis L. Carney, were sued by the occupants of a third vehicle \u2014 by its driver, Charles Dale Tholen, who claimed both property damages and personal injuries,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by its two passengers, Betty Lee Tholen and Kerry Lee Tholen, who claimed personal injuries. Tholen\u2019s insurance carrier, Safeco Insurance Company of America, intervened to seek by subrogation the $3,219.56 it had paid Tholen for damage to his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The cases, consolidated for trial, were submitted to the jury for findings by special verdict. The jury found that the accident was proximately caused by negligence of both Greenhaw and Carney, and not by any contributory negligence on the part of Tholen. The jury fixed the property damages at $3,500 and for personal injuries awarded Charles $10,000, Betty $20,000 and Kerry $30,000. Given these facts, judgment would ordinarily be entered against both defendants and in favor of Charles in the amount of $10,280.44, in favor of Betty in the amount of $20,000, in favor of Kerry in the amount of $30,000, and in favor of Safeco in the amount of $3,219.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Entry of judgment, however, is obfuscated by the fact that Safeco intervened not merely to seek reimbursement for its payment of property damages, but also to obtain a determination of its liability to the Tholens under the uninsured motor vehicle section of its policy. This issue arises because Carney\u2019s vehicle was not covered by liability insurance and is complicated by virtue of the fact that the other defendant, Greenhaw, had liability insurance coverage sufficient in amount to satisfy all awards by the jury. Having failed at trial to persuade the jury that Carney was free from fault, Safeco now attempts to limit \u2014 if not avoid \u2014 liability to the Tholens under the uninsured motor vehicle coverage and, to the extent called upon to pay for damages caused by Carney\u2019s negligence, Safeco demands judgment over against Carney.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The central question may thus be put: to what extent is Safeco\u2019s liability to its insureds <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the uninsured motor vehicle section of the policy affected by the fact that the insureds\u2019 injuries were found to have been caused by negligence of both an uninsured motorist and an insured motorist?</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Analysis starts with certain basic principles, well recognized in this jurisdiction: Where there are several joint tortfeasors responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s damages, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the full amount against each, as if the others did not exist. That is, there is no apportionment of damages among joint tortfeasors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff can seek recovery of these judgments against all or any of the judgment debtors; however, to prevent \u201cdouble recovery\u201d, amounts recovered from one reduce the amounts recoverable from the others. The tortfeasors do not by reason of unequal payments to the plaintiff obtain a right of contribution from the other tort-feasors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">It follows that the Tholens, armed with judgments against both Carney and Green-haw, are entitled to collect, if they can, the entire amount of the judgments from Carney alone; and this is so even though Greenhaw is insured. Yet, under its policy, Safeco has agreed \u201cto pay all sums which the insured . . . shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the . operator of an uninsured motor vehicle\u201d; . e., to pay the Tholens all sums which they are legally entitled to recover from Carney.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Safeco would argue that other language in the policy limits its liability to situations where there are no other jointly liable persons from whom the plaintiffs could recover their judgments. The provision so relied upon, however, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>This clause does no more than prevent double recoveries. It does not make Safeco\u2019s liability secondary to other sources for recovery. As to the Tholens\u2014putting aside, as beyond the confines of the litigation, any claims for indemnity or by subrogation which Safeco may have against State Farm \u2014 Safeco is liable for the sums which the Tholens may otherwise recover from Carney. <em>Cf. Security National Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hand, </em>31 Cal.App.3d 227, 107 Cal.Rptr. 439 (1973); <em>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tomanski, </em>27 Ohio St.2d 222, 271 N.E.2d 924 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u201cAny loss payable under the terms of this coverage shall be reduced by: * * * (3) all sums paid by or on behalf of the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle and any other person or organization jointly or severally liable together with such owner or operator for bodily injury to an insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Of course, Safeco does enjoy the benefits of the limits of liability specified in the policy, interpreted in accordance with applicable state law. The policy limits are $15,-000 for \u201ceach person\u201d and $30,000 for \u201ceach accident\u201d. The plaintiffs (and Greenhaw) contend, however, there should be a \u201cstacking\u201d of coverages because the Safeco policy insured more than one vehicle owned by Tholen.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">This question must be answered by reference to California law;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and California, unlike Alabama, does not allow \u201cstacking\u201d. <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Shmitka, </em>12 Cal. App.3d 59, 90 Cal.Rptr. 399. Accordingly, Safeco\u2019s liability is limited to a maximum of $15,000 as to any plaintiff and to a total of $30,000 for all of the plaintiffs. It is unnecessary to \u201capportion\u201d this coverage for the accident among the plaintiffs in any particular way. Rather, Safeco\u2019s liability under the policy will be exhausted at such time (if ever) that it pays the full $30,000. Of course, it cannot be called upon to pay more than the amount awarded to a plaintiff for personal injuries ($10,000, in the case of Charles Dale Tholen), or more to either of the two passengers than the $15,000 \u201ceach person\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Safeco is entitled to judgment over against Carney for such amounts, if any, as it may have to pay to the Tholens because of Carney\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">This the 25th day of August, 1976.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-30\">. For convenience, the term \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d in this opinion includes, as appropriate, medical expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">. Safeco\u2019s contention that it can recover from Greenhaw\u2019s insurer (State Farm) all, or a portion, of any amounts it may have to pay the Tholens cannot be dealt with here because State Farm is not a party to this litigation. The issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is directed towards Safeco\u2019s liability to its insureds (the Tholens), leaving for perhaps a later day any claims Safe-co may have against State Farm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b540-12\">. <em>E. g., Anderson v.
