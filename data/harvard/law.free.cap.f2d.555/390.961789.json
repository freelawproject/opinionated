The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered summary judgment against the employee, Harold Rosenthal. We find no error in the disposition of the Fourteenth Amendment claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand, however, as to the First Amendment claim for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-22\">Harold Rosenthal was appointed to a $14,257-a-year position as an Administrative Assistant II in the Commercial and Industrial Relocation Department of the Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia on October 24, 1972. When Augustine Salvitti took over as the Authority\u2019s Executive Director in January, 1974, he fired Rosenthal without a prior hearing. On January 29, 1975, Rosenthal filed an action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Authority, Salvitti, Frank Rizzo (the Mayor of Philadelphia), and Phillip Carroll (the Deputy Director of Philadelphia). Rosenthal based his action on 42 U.S.C., .\u00a7 1983 and pendent state claims. His primary allegations were (1) that his discharge without a hearing violated his right to due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>under the Fourteenth Amendment, and (2) that he had been discharged because of his political affiliation, in violation of his First Amendment rights of political association. He set forth factual allegations in support of both claims. On April 30, 1976, the district court granted summary judgment against Rosenthal as to all defendants, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Rosenthal\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claim was that he had an \u201cobjective expectancy of continued employment\u201d and could be dismissed only for \u201ccause.\u201d Under <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2077, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976), \u201cthe sufficiency of the claim of entitlement must be decided by reference to state law.\u201d The court below properly ruled against Rosenthal, because under Pennsylvania law, public employees have no contractual entitlement to dismissals only for cause unless the legislature has expressly provided tenure for a given class of employees. <em>Mahoney v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em>13 Pa.Cmwlth. 243, 320 A.2d 459 (1974), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1122, 95 S.Ct. 806, 42 L.Ed.2d 822 (1975). Since the legislature had not provided for tenure in Rosenthal\u2019s job classification, he had no right to a \u201ccause\u201d hearing before discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Rosenthal\u2019s First Amendment claim, however, was more substantial. In general, a state may not condition hiring or discharge of an employee in a way which infringes his right of political association. <em>E. g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967); <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 6 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976). An exception to this First Amendment protection exists in the case of (state employees who formulate policy.) This exception is designed to insure \u201cthat representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.\u201d <em>Elrod, supra, </em>at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2687.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">For Rosenthal to obtain relief on his First Amendment claim, then, he had to show that he was a non-policymaking employee. Paragraph 10 of his complaint, Appendix at 6a, alleged that his \u201cwas a \u2018non-policy-making\u2019 position.\u201d In their answer, Appendix at 13a, defendants Salvitti and the Redevelopment Authority admitted the truth of that allegation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Defendants Rizzo and Carroll never filed an answer; however, in their motion for summary judgment, they did contest Rosen-thal\u2019s allegation that he did not formulate policy. Evidence as to the nature of Rosen-thal\u2019s duties, in the form of depositions, was imprecise and cut both ways. On the one hand, there was testimony that Rosenthal was merely a \u201csoldier,\u201d Appendix at 72a; that he merely oversaw bidding practices to uncover corruption and to make sure policies implemented by others were carried out, Appendix at 113a; indeed, defendant Salvitti himself declared that Rosenthal\u2019s primary duty was to act as a spy for the former Director of the Authority, Appendix at 94a; that he had no power to decide which bids for relocation work would be accepted, Appendix at 115a; that he merely worked for the actual policymaker in his department, Appendix at 117a. On the other hand, there was testimony to the effect that he helped rewrite the relocation code, Appendix at 51a; that Rosenthal was a \u201ctop line\u201d employee, Appendix at 7a; that he oversaw work and reviewed bids, 99a.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Thus, two of the defendants admitted Rosenthal\u2019s status as a non-policymaker, while as to the other two defendants, Rosenthal\u2019s status represented a genuine issue of material fact. Nevertheless, the district court took it upon itself to weigh the conflicting evidence and resolve the issue against Rosenthal on a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This was error. Under Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c), a district court can grant summary judgment only when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact . . .\u201d Professors Wright and Miller have explained that requirement:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-J\">A motion for summary judgment lies only when there is no genuine issue of material fact; summary judgment is not a substitute for the trial of fact issues. Accordingly, the court cannot try issues of fact on a Rule 56 motion but only is empowered to determine whether there are issues to be tried. Given this function, the district court examines the affidavits or other evidence introduced on a Rule 56 motion simply to determine whether a triable issue exists rather than for the purpose of resolving that issue. Similarly, although the summary judgment procedure is well adapted to exposing sham claims and false defenses, it cannot be used to deprive a litigant of a full trial of genuine fact issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\"><em>Accord, Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>might have been inclined, as is the dissent, to resolve the evidentiary conflict in defendants\u2019 favor and conclude that Rosenthal had no duties apart from ones involving policy formulation, \u201ca motion for summary judgment should not be granted on the ground that if a verdict were rendered for the adverse party the court would set it aside as against the weight of the evidence.\u201d 6 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 56.-04[2], at 2067 (2d ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Rosenthal was improperly deprived of a full trial on the issue of his status as a policymaker;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> consequently, his claim that he was fired because of his political affiliations, in violation of the First Amendment, was not considered. Therefore, the judgment of the district court will be reversed as to all defendants and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-23\">. We express no opinion as to Rosenthal\u2019s pen- . dent state claims, since the district court apparently felt it unnecessary to pass upon them after the grant of summary judgment as to all federal claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\">. Rosenthal subsequently amended his complaint with respect to the First Amendment claim, but the amended complaint expressly declared that \u201cPlaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein paragraphs 1-27, and 29-36 of plaintiffs original complaint.\u201d Appendix at 136a. Thus, the crucial paragraph 10 was realleged, and defendants made no attempt to withdraw the admission in their answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\">. The district court may have believed that Rosenthal\u2019s status as a policymaker <em>vel non </em>was a question of law, for in addressing the First Amendment claim, the court indicated that there were no facts in dispute: \u201cSince there is no substantial dispute as to the facts there remains solely the question of whether plaintiff\u2019s employment was a \u2018policy-making\u2019 position.\u201d Appendix at 139a-140a. The court\u2019s approach to the issues, however, belies such an interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\"><em>Based upon our review of the affidavits and deposition transcripts we f\u00ednd </em>that plaintiff was employed in a policy-making position by the R.D.A. His duties included the investigation and supervision of the bidding procedures for moving contracts and thereby he made, at the minimum, an indirect contribution to the formulation of R.D.A. policy. <em>As a result of this finding, </em>we have concluded that as a matter of law plaintiff cannot successfully challenge the termination of his employment on the basis of infringement of his First Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Appendix at 140a (emphasis added). Thus, the district court apparently was aware that it was making a <em>finding of fact </em>based upon its weighing of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">. 10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2712, at 378-82 (1973) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">. Examination of the <em>Elrod </em>plurality\u2019s criteria for determinations of policy-making status reveals how difficult the job of weighing evidence on that issue can be and, consequently, how inappropriate it is on a Rule 56 motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">No clear line can be drawn between policy-making and nonpolicymaking positions. While nonpolicymaking individuals usually have limited responsibility, that is not to say that one with a number of responsibilities is necessarily in a policymaking position. The nature of the responsibilities is critical. Employee supervisors, for example, may have many responsibilities but those responsibilities may have only limited and well-defined objectives. An employee with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely functions in a policymak-ing position. In determining whether an employee occupies a policymaking position, consideration should also be given to whether the employee acts as an adviser or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals. Thus the political loyalty \u201cjustification is a matter of proof, or at least argument, directed at particular kinds of jobs.\u201d <em>Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis, supra, </em>at 574. Since, as we have noted, it is the Government\u2019s burden to demonstrate an overriding interest in order to validate an encroachment on protected interests, the burden of establishing this justification as to any particular respondent will rest on the [state] on remand, cases of doubt being resolved in favor of the particular [employee].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOk\">427 U.S. at 367-368, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. Thus, the determination of status as a policymaker <em>vel non </em>presents a difficult factual question. Where there is evidence to support the employee\u2019s claim that he does not make policy, as there is here, he is entitled to a full trial on the issue. Indeed, the state bears the burden of persuasion on that question at trial. Certainly, then, it was improper for the district court to weigh the evidence and rule against Rosenthal on this issue on a Rule 56 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">It is true that Mr. Justice Stewart\u2019s concurrence in <em>Elrod </em>refers to a \u201cnonpolicy making, nonconfidential government employee\u201d. 427 U.S. at 375, 96 S.Ct. at 2690. In our view the additional . adjective \u2014 nonconfidential\u2014does not change the basic thrust the plurality opinion, which is directed at policy <em>formulation </em>and representative government. A \u201cconfidential government employee\u201d in this sense would not necessarily be one \u2014 as Rosenthal may have been \u2014 who has covert activities as part of his duties, but instead one who is privy to the discussions and information involved in the policymaking process. Rosenthal held a job with a specific title and certain responsibilities. The fact that he may have engaged in covert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>activities in addition to discharging other, everyday duties ought not, as the dissent insists, to be dispositive of his claim to retain the basic job.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">. We need not, and do not, address the district court\u2019s power to permit amendment of the pleadings \u2014 i. e., the admission of Rosenthal\u2019s non-policymaking status by Salvitti and the Authority \u2014 on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b454-5\">ALDISERT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the district court for two discrete reasons. First, summary judgment was the proper disposition since no dispute existed among the parties as to the actual, historical or narrative facts of this case. Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Harold Rosenthal was fired for political reasons, the proscriptions of <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), cannot operate in cases such as this, where appellant is clearly a \u201cconfidential\u201d, policymaking employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">In granting summary judgment, the district court properly treated the issue of whether Rosenthal was a \u201cpolicymaking\u201d employee as a matter of law. There existed no real dispute as to the historical or narrative facts. Rosenthal held the position of Administrative Assistant to the Director of Commercial and Industrial Relocation for the Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia. He was hired by his stepsister Lynn Abraham, then Executive Director of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Authority, to report to her on the activities of the Commercial and Industrial Relocation Department of the Authority. Appendix at 58a, 112a. Abraham explained that she wanted somebody whom she could \u201ctrust\u201d to tell her what was happening in that department, which, according to Abraham, was operating in an allegedly questionable fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 58a. Appellee Sal-vitti described Rosenthal\u2019s hiring as being \u201cfor one specific reason, that was to spy on the department for Lynn Abraham.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94a.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Behind such emotive linguistic tags as \u201csomeone to trust\u201d, or \u201ca spy\u201d, there lies a consensus which belies the majority\u2019s concern that the \u201cconflicting evidence\u201d should have precluded summary judgment: namely, all parties agreed that Rosenthal was hired as Lynn Abraham\u2019s personal investigator. Since there was agreement on what Rosenthal actually did \u2014 the \u201cbasic\u201d facts\u2014 the only remaining question was how to characterize his job. Whether it should be characterized as a policymaking position was not a remaining issue of basic fact, but an issue of <em>ultimate </em>fact, and therefore a matter of law for the court, and not the jury. \u201cThe ultimate finding is a conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact. It is to be distinguished from the findings of primary, evidentiary or circumstantial facts.\u201d <em>Hel-vering </em>v. <em>Tex-Penn Oil Co., </em>300 U.S. 481, 491, 57 S.Ct. 569, 574, 81 L.Ed. 755 (1937). Justice Frankfurter\u2019s explanation in <em>Watts v. Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49, 51, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 1348, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949), has particular significance here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">But \u201cissue of fact\u201d is a coat of many colors. It does not cover a conclusion drawn from uncontroverted happenings, when that conclusion incorporates standards of conduct or criteria for judgment which in themselves are decisive of constitutional rights. Such' standards and criteria, measured against the requirements drawn from constitutional provisions, and their proper applications, are issues for this Court\u2019s adjudication . [It is] important to distinguish between issues of fact that are here foreclosed and issues which, though cast in the form of determination of fact, are the very issues to review which this Court sits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\"><em>See also United States v. Delerme, </em>457 F.2d 156 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The district court here did not shirk its responsibility in meeting the question of law. Nor should this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">The <em>Elrod </em>plurality itself provided guidance for discerning the essential character of a job:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">No clear line can be drawn between poli-cymaking and nonpolicymaking decisions. While nonpolicymaking individuals usually have limited responsibility, that is not to say that one with a number of responsibilities is necessarily in a policymaking position. The nature of the responsibilities is critical. ... An employee with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely functions in a policymaking position. In determining whether an employee occupies a policymaking position, consideration should also be given to whether the employee acts as an advisor or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">427 U.S. at 367-68, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. In the present case, ample information in the record supports the district court\u2019s characterization of Rosenthal\u2019s job as a policymaking one. Along with the undisputed fact that Rosenthal \u201cact(ed) as an advisor\u201d to Abraham, considerations supporting the district court\u2019s ultimate finding include Rosenthal\u2019s exercise of supervisory responsibilities, Appendix at 107a-08a, 119a-21a, 125a; his actions as liaison between two Authority departments, <em>id. </em>at 118a-19a; his recommendations regarding bid acceptances, <em>id. </em>at 118a; and his participation in the revision of the moving and relocation code. <em>Id. </em>at 55a.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">An alternate ground for affirming the district court\u2019s judgment lies in the necessary conclusion that even if Rosenthal is not viewed as a \u201cpolicymaker\u201d within a particular judge\u2019s conception of that term, he was clearly at least a \u201cconfidential\u201d employee. As such, his dismissal still falls within the <em>Elrod </em>plurality\u2019s exception, fashioned to insure \u201cthat representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of [a] new administration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.\u201d <em>Elrod, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In <em>Elrod, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a claim that patronage dismissals of non-civil-service employees of the Cook County,. Illinois, Sheriff\u2019s Office, were violative of the First Amendment freedoms of political belief and association. Justice Brennan, in a plurality opinion joined by Justices White and Marshall, concluded that any contribution which political patronage might make to the democratic process was not sufficient to override its encroachment on First Amendment freedoms. As support for this view of patronage, the plurality quoted from <em>CSC v. Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973): \u201c[T]he judgment of Congress, the Executive, and the country appears to have been that partisan political activities by federal employees must be limited if the Government is to operate effectively and fairly, elections are to play their proper part in representative government, and employees themselves are to be sufficiently free from improper influences.\u201d 427 U.S. at 354, 96 S.Ct. at 2680, <em>quoting Letter Carriers, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 564, 93 S.Ct. 2880. This statement, however, was used by the <em>Letter Carriers </em>Court for a far different reason \u2014 to support the constitutionality of the Hatch Act\u2019s prohibition against federal employees\u2019 taking an active part in political management or political campaigns. It is well to note a passage from <em>Letter Carriers </em>which appears shortly after the plurality\u2019s truncated quotation: \u201cAlthough Congress is free to strike a different balance than it has, if it so chooses, we think the balance it has so far struck is sustainable by the obviously important interests sought to be served by the limitations on partisan political activities now contained in the Hatch Act.\u201d 413 U.S. at 564, 93 S.Ct. at 2890. In effect, then, the <em>Elrod </em>plurality attempted to extend by case law the application and scope of a statute, the Hatch Act, regulating certain federal employees, to state or county employees not covered by the federal statute. Thus, the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the <em>Elrod </em>plurality is somewhat tenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Fortunately, five Supreme Court justices (Justices Stewart and Blackmun, concurring; Chief Justice Burger, and Justices Powell and Rehnquist, dissenting) could not ascribe to the <em>Elrod </em>plurality\u2019s broad renunciation of the patronage system, in Justice Stewart\u2019s formulation, a \u201cwide-ranging opinion.\u201d 427 U.S. at 374, 96 S.Ct. 2673. Thus, in concurrence, Justice Stewart articulated the rule of the case: <em>\u201c[A] nonpolicy-making, nonconfidential government employee </em>[cannot] be discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that he is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs.\u201d 427 U.S. at 375, 96 S.Ct. at 2690 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Harold Rosenthal was, at the very least, a \u201cconfidential\u201d employee. He was hired by his step-sister because she had to find someone whom she \u201ccould trust implicitly.\u201d Appendix at 51a. His mission was to investigate a certain department and report directly back to Abraham on its activities. Once Abraham left the Authority, her successor understandably determined that he could not utilize appellant in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The majority attempts to limit the thrust of the confidential employee exception by suggesting, in footnote 5, that a confidential employee would not be one \u201cwho has covert activities as part of his duties, but instead one who is privy to the discussions and information involved in the policymak-ing process.\u201d Yet the majority admits that the purpose of the <em>Elrod </em>exception is to insure that our system of government \u201cnot be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration\u201d. Majority Opinion at 2, <em>quoting Elrod, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. Rosenthal was not an integral part of the Commercial and Industrial Relocation Department; rather, he was a personal extension into that department of its administrator, Lynn Abraham. As such, he was privy to the \u201cdiscussions and information involved in the policy-making process.\u201d When Abraham left the Authority, Rosen-thal no longer had a role to play. His original, confidential function now defunct, he could not implement the policies of the new administration. His presence could only obstruct new policy implementation, the very danger sought to be avoided by the <em>Elrod </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Accordingly, there being no role to be played by a factfinder in these proceedings, the basic facts not being disputed, it remained for the court to draw a legal conclusion from those facts. The district court did just that. It faced up to an obligation to decide a question of law. And I would affirm what it did.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">. Iam troubled by the lack of support in the discovery materials and affidavits for the allegation that Rosenthal was fired for his political associations, a necessary starting point for the majority\u2019s analysis. Plaintiffs initial complaint did not allege that he lost his job for political reasons. There is no indication in the record that Rosenthal was ever asked to change his party registration or that he was pressured to support a particular political party in order to retain his job. On the other hand, there <em>is </em>evidence that appellee Salvitti fired Rosenthal because Rosenthal was \u201cunqualified\u201d for the job. Appendix at 94a-95a. This situation is factually distinct from <em>Elrod, supra, </em>in which the appellants were fired because of their lack of affiliation with the Democratic party.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The district court, however, granted leave for Rosenthal to file an amended complaint substantiating his claim of abridgement of First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and association. The amended complaint, on its face, elevated this case to a level far exceeding the quality of the proofs offered. Nevertheless, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that politics played a part in Rosenthal\u2019s dismissal, for reasons discussed hereinafter he cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">Nor do I attach critical importance to defense counsel\u2019s failure to contest the allegation in the tenth paragraph of the original complaint that plaintiff was in a non-policymaking position. First, as heretofore observed, plaintiffs initial complaint did not allege that he lost his job for political reasons. Second, what was ultimately before the district court, and what is presently before this court for adjudication, is not the original complaint, but an amended complaint. At the time the amended complaint was filed, the legal issue had been joined, and the parties, both sides, met it on the strength of the depositions, not pleadings. Although I am reluctant to resort to Mechanical Jurisprudence, for it is established that the purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was to avoid fact pleading formularies, if I did I would conclude (a) the original answer to the original complaint has minimal jurisprudential significance, because the original complaint was superseded by an amended one, (b) no answer was filed to the amended complaint and therefore no admissions can be drawn from any answer, and (c) as hereinafter developed, I perceive the question of \u201cpolicy maker\u201d to be one of law, and not of fact, and therefore not subject to any rules relating to admitting facts in pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. Were I writing on a cleaner slate, I would not even embrace the limitations imposed by the concurrence. Neither the plurality nor the concurrence supplied sufficient rebuttal to Justice Powell\u2019s claim, in dissent, that patronage and the material incentives it provides stimulate \u201cpolitical activity and by strengthening parties, thereby [help] to make government accountable.\u201d 427 U.S. at 382, 96 S.Ct. at 2694. The plurality\u2019s assertion that the abolition of patronage dismissals will not \u201cbring about the <em>demise </em>of party politics\u201d is simply not responsive to the question of accountability in government.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Acknowledging that abuses may inhere in the patronage system, I nevertheless am not prepared to conclude that there has been a corresponding increase in the quality of city, county, state and federal services since the wholesale .granting of permanent tenure to government employees, by civil service legislation, and now by judicial fiat, began. My own experience is that municipal streets seem dirtier; police protection less efficient; highway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>maintenance virtually non-existent (in my own state of Pennsylvania); postal service a national disgrace; metropolitan garbage collection a matter of grace, not right; refuse collection a matter of private contract; and a constantly increasing headless federal civil service bureaucracy approaching the cruel, impersonal inefficiency of that of the French. Accountability to elected officials, and thus to the public, seems to be an historical concept only. Edward N. Costikyan suggests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">[A]ll the histories of the political machines and their workings have been written from a reform orientation. It should be observed, however, in the absence of fairer contemporaneous data, that the political machines built the cities, paved their streets, dug their sewers, and piped their water supply systems. Furthermore, under the administration of the machines, mass transit systems, school systems, and massive developments of new housing were constructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">It would be laughable to suggest that any of our present city administrations could accomplish one-tenth of what the political machines accomplished during the period from the Civil War to World War I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">The reform answer to the machine as the personnel pool for government was the creation of a competing source of manpower: civil service. As long as civil service and the machine remained in competition for the staffing of the government, the administrative result was good. But with the collapse of the machine, civil service has monopolized the field, and the administrative results have been disastrous, for the bureaucracies have a double layer of protection that deprives any elected official of the power to get the bureaucrats to do their jobs. One layer is the impossibility of firing a civil servant. The other is the civil service unions, which have such power over the city \u2014 in the absence of alternative sources of manpower \u2014 that in the final analysis the bureaucracies are in a position to dictate to elected officials and their appointees. The bureaucrats can specify what they will and will not do (such as inspect boilers during a cold wave), what they will wear, and where they will work. The elected official (or his appointee) is at their mercy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">Our cities will survive and be governable only if those we elect have effective power over those who are supposed to do the work, [and] only if those we elect are responsible and accountable to the people who elect them. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">Costikyan, \u201cCities Can Work\u201d, Saturday Review, April 4, 1970, 19, 20, 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
