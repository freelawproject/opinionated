Liner, sued under the Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq. and Regulation Z of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 et seq. to recover for alleged violations arising when he borrowed a sum of money from defendant, Aetna Finance Co., and received a federal disclosure statement from them. The trial judge found no violation of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(d)(3). Since the \u201cfinance charge\u201d consisted of only one item, interest, the finance company did not need to itemize the \u201cfinance charge.\u201d Second, the judge failed to find a violation of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(d)(1), which requires itemization of the \u201camount financed,\u201d because he deemed the listings \u201cPaid to Globe Finance,\u201d and \u201cPaid to Hibernia Bank\u201d sufficient. Finally, the court rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that the absence of his signature beneath the words \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>desire Credit Life Insurance\u201d on his copy created a violation of \u00a7 226.8(a). Appellant brings forward the first two points. We find that the point concerning itemization of finance charge is without merit, but are required to reverse and remand on the point concerning itemization of amount financed for reconsideration in light of <em>Pollock v. General Finance Corp., </em>535 F.2d 295 (5 Cir. 1976), pet. for reh\u2019g denied, dated May 27, 1977, 5 Cir., 552 F.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Appellant first contends that the Federal Reserve Board abused its powers in issuing 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.820, which states that where only a single type of charge comprises the finance charge, disclosure of the total dollar amount of such charge, using the term \u201cfinance charge,\u201d complies with the requirements of \u00a7 226.8(d)(3). The guidelines delineated in a case appellant relies on heavily, <em>Continental Oil Co. v. Burns, </em>317 F.Supp. 195 (D.Del.1970), demonstrate that \u00a7 226.820 is an interpretation of \u00a7 226.8(d)(3), rather than a substantive change in the rule. The language of \u00a7 226.-820 clarifies the regulation, and does not make it any more onerous or in any way effect a \u201cdrastic change.\u201d <em>See also LewisMota v. Secy, of Labor, </em>469 F.2d 478 (2 Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">A recent Fifth Circuit case controls the second issue. In <em>Pollock </em>this Court held that a creditor must disclose the amount of cash given to the debtor or given on the debtor\u2019s behalf, the charges individually itemized, and the total of the previous two amounts. The disclosure statement involved in the instant case is identical to that in <em>Pollock, </em>in that although it itemized the fees and insurance charges, it failed to disclose the principal amount of the loan. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with <em>Pollock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
