Bechtle, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b413-24\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"AS_\">GARTH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">This appeal calls into question once again the propriety of a sentence imposed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>judge who, convinced that the defendant has lied, adds additional prison time to the defendant\u2019s sentence for that reason. In <em>Poteet v. </em>Fauver<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decided May 7,1975, this Court held that the sentencing judge may not add a penalty because he believes the defendant lied at the defendant\u2019s own trial. In <em>United States v. Grayson,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that holding was reaffirmed. Because we are satisfied that the circumstances of Moriani\u2019s having been charged with lying at allocution during sentencing and as a witness at the trial of his codefendant, (rather than at his own trial) should yield no different result, we reverse as to the sentence imposed and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Moriani was indicted with others (including one George Murphy) on two counts of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) (Count 1) and 2113(d) (Count 2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, in connection with his guilty plea to Count 1, Moriani agreed to testify truthfully in the trial of his codefendant Murphy. In exchange, the government agreed to move for the dismissal of Count 2 when Moriani was sentenced, and also agreed to inform the sentencing judge of Moriani\u2019s cooperation in those cases involving his co-defendants that still remained to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Moriani\u2019s plea proceeding was under oath<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was unexceptional, with the district court judge making the necessary inquiries to assure himself that Moriani\u2019s plea was voluntary. <em>See </em>F.R.Crim.P. 11. Mor-iani acknowledged the conditions specified by the government and that the offense to which he was pleading guilty carried a maximum prison term of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">After retracting his not guilty plea on March 20,1975, but before his sentence was imposed, Moriani testified at the trial of George Murphy. Murphy was ultimately convicted on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Both Moriani and Murphy were sentenced on June 20, 1975. Moriani when asked at that time if any promises as to sentence had been made to him, responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-15\">\u201cThe prosecutor said they would make a recommendation for a very light sentence and it would be served at Lewisburg and you asked the prosecutor and that was verified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">The district court judge determined that Moriani\u2019s statement was at variance with the statements made at the plea proceedings and after citing various aspects of Moriani\u2019s involvement in the robbery and concluding that Moriani had lied both at Murphy\u2019s trial and during his own sentencing proceeding, sentenced Moriani to 20 years in prison.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">Two briefs on appeal were filed in support of Moriani\u2019s position. A <em>pro se </em>brief filed by Moriani seeks \u201cA three-judge constitutional court to convene and motion for interlocutory injunction and motion for a temporary restraining order . . . ordering his release from confinement. That brief challenges the constitutionality of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2113,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> asserting a lack of federal jurisdiction. Moriani in this brief argues that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a privately owned institution; that the FDIC insures depositors, not banks; that no federal law could be violated, unless and until, by reason of theft, the bank was rendered insolvent (a circumstance which would force the FDIC to make good on its depositors\u2019 accounts); and that therefore Congress lacks the power and means to legislate in this area. There is no merit to this argument. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>458 F.2d 988 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Moriani\u2019s counsel, on the other hand, by a brief which seeks resentencing, raises the following three points: (a) that the sentencing judge was prejudiced against Moriani by reason of Moriani\u2019s testimony in the case of <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>(b) that the sentencing judge believed Moriani to be a liar and perjurer and improperly considered these factors in the imposition of Moriani\u2019s sentence; and (c) that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office failed to follow the plea bargain on the strength of which the appellant entered his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">All of the issues raised by Moriani center on three events: Moriani\u2019s plea proceeding (March 20, 1975); Moriani\u2019s appearance at the trial of his codefendant (April 17,1975); and Moriani\u2019s sentencing (June 20, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">At his plea proceeding on March 20,1975, Moriani\u2019s counsel made the following representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">We are prepared to come forward at this time and retract a previously entered plea of not guilty and at this time enter a plea of guilty to the first count of the indictment. Your Honor please, we are entering this plea on the strength of a conference that I had with the United States Attorney\u2019s office to the effect that at the time of sentencing the second count of the indictment would be dismissed. Also, Your Honor, that if there is any cooperation given by Mr. Moriani in any other cases that may remain, that would be made known to the Court. That is the extent of any kind of pre-ne-gotiations that we had, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Moriani was then sworn. A routine and thorough plea proceeding followed. Then the following colloquy between the court and Moriani took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">[THE COURT] Q. And are you aware of the fact that this [and is] an offense which carries with it a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, a fine of $5,000 or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">Q. Understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-17\">Q. Now, have any promises been made to you by your attorney or the United States Attorney or anybody at all as to what the sentence of the Court will be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-18\">A. Just what was stated previously, that count 2 will be dropped and a recommendation will be made if I cooperate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-19\">Q. Is that your sole understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-20\">A. That is my sole understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-21\">THE COURT: Mr. Carlamere, [Moria-ni\u2019s counsel] you have indicated that that is your version of the negotiations you have had with counsel for the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-22\">MR. CARLAMERE: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-23\">THE COURT: Now, what is the government\u2019s version?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-25\">MR. KURZWEIL: [Assistant United States Attorney]: Your Honor, essentially, we concur with what has been stated to you; the only difference I would note is that another condition of our moving to dismiss count 2 is that if called upon Mr. Moriani will testify truthfully in the trial of <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>his codefend-ant. We won\u2019t move to dismiss count 2 until such time as he does so testify if called upon to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-26\">THE COURT: Will you do that, Mr. Moriani?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">BY THE COURT: Q. You understand that the Court can\u2019t compel you to testify\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">A. I know this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Q. \u2014against your codefendant, nor can the United States Attorney compel you to testify against a codefendant, nor can your own attorney compel you to do that? Understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">Q. All the government is saying is that if you do that, that will be a recommendation to the Court for the Court to consider in the imposition of sentence. A. I realize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">Q. \u00danderstand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">A. I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">Q. And you further understand that only the judge can impose sentence upon you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">Q. Nobody else can?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">Q. And the judge isn\u2019t bound by any understanding or agreement that may</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-20\">have been made or reached by your attorney and the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-21\">A. I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-22\">In essence therefore, the plea agreement was a simple one. Moriani pleaded guilty to count 1 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)) of the indictment. He did so in exchange for promises made by the government that: (1) the government would at sentencing dismiss count 2 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d)) if Moriani had testified truthfully at the trial of Murphy, his codefendant; and (2) if Moriani cooperated with the government, such cooperation would be made known to the trial judge at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-23\">Thereafter, Moriani testified at Murphy\u2019s trial, which was held approximately one month after Moriani had pleaded guilty. Moriani, although subpoenaed by the government, was not called as a government witness. Rather, he testified for the defense. His testimony can best be characterized as exculpatory as to Murphy. He denied that Murphy had taken any part in the bank robbery and he denied statements which he, Moriani, had purportedly given to the FBI.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>After Murphy\u2019s conviction, sentencing of both Moriani and Murphy was set for June 20, 1975. The same district court judge who had presided at Murphy\u2019s trial and who had earlier taken Moriani\u2019s plea presided at the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Addressing Moriani first, the court inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">Q. Were any promises made to you by anybody at all as to what the sentence of the court would be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">A. [Moriani] The prosecutor said they would make a recommendation for a very light sentence and it would be served at Lewisburg and you ask the prosecutor and that was verified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">At this point the district court judge recessed to obtain a transcript of Moriani\u2019s plea proceeding. After the transcript had been produced by the court reporter, it was read to Moriani. The court inquired of Moriani where it appeared (in the transcript of the plea proceeding) that the United States would recommend a lenient sentence and that he, Moriani, would be confined to Lewisburg.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The colloquy at sentencing continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">Q. [BY THE COURT] At the time you entered your plea you stated and the United States Attorney stated and your attorney, Mr. Carlamere, stated that no promises were made of any kind other than, other than that the second count would be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">A. [Moriani] Not no promises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">Q. And if you cooperated with the government and if you testified truthfully during the trial of Mr. Murphy, that would be brought to the Court\u2019s attention to be considered by the Court in the imposition of your sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">A. Here, again, not no promises, a recommendation. He kept within the law. I say a recommendation. Even during the course of Murphy\u2019s trial that I brought up I was being threatened, and so forth, and so on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">It was then after additional colloquy that the district court judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM0\">THE COURT: Well, that is my recollection [of the plea bargaining] too, but rather than rely upon my recollection or yours or Mr. Carlamere\u2019s or Mr. Moria-ni\u2019s, I had the court reporter find his notes, and they were just read to me and to all of us and they clearly indicate that no promises were made as to the placement or the section under which sentence would be imposed or that the United States Attorney\u2019s office recommended a lenient sentence. The only promise made, the only condition that was entered into in the plea bargaining negotiations was that the second count, which carries with it a penalty of five years, [s/c<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] would be dismissed upon the imposition of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">Mr. Moriani, the Court has rather limited sympathy for you. You were the mastermind, admittedly so, from what I just read, or just heard, as did you, of this entire robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">This was a serious offense, armed robbery. You have a previous record, and the most aggravating part about the commission of your offense is that you enlisted to aid you in the commission of this offense a juvenile who was armed with a sawed off shotgun standing at the door and you enlisted a nineteen year old boy who went in and took the money from the bank employees and a young lady who is about twenty years of age\u2014 Richard Adams was nineteen at the time of this offense, and Margaret Hudson, who was outside with an automobile is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>twenty years of age and with no record at all \u2014 as your codefendants and participants in the commission of this armed bank robbery, wherein over twenty-one thousand dollars was taken from the bank. If there had been twice that much or five times that much, I am certain that all of that would have been taken too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">I don\u2019t feel that you have cooperated with the Government at all, and <em>I don\u2019t think that you told the truth when you testified in Mr. Murphy\u2019s case. </em>I have never imposed the maximum sentence since I have been on the bench, but if there is any case in which the maximum sentence is warranted in view of your entire attitude this is it. <em>You lied to this Court even during these proceedings where you indicated that\u25a0 the United States Attorney would recommend or did recommend that a lenient sentence be imposed upon you, that the place of confinement will be recommended and that the Section 4208(a)(2) provision would be employed in the imposition of sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">THE DEFENDANT: No Sir, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">THE COURT: The record clearly indicates that nothing whatsoever was so recommended and even your own attorney says that the record conforms with his recollection of what occurred at the time the plea was entered .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Transcript of June 20, 1975 at 11-14 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Moriani was then sentenced to a 20 year prison term and Count II of the indictment was dismissed. As previously noted <em>(see </em>n.4 supra), Murphy was sentenced to a 14 year prison term pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Moriani\u2019s argument that the plea bargain into which he had entered had been breached by the government requires little discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">His argument is phrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">He [Moriani] was threatened, harrassed [sic], and then promised a lighter sentence in return for his guilty plea and the withdrawal of his various pro se motions regarding subject matter jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agz-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">. [Moriani] contends that in return for his plea of guilty, it was promised that he would receive a lighter sentence than that given to his co-defendant, George Murphy, who was standing trial. And that if he were to testify truthfully at the trial of his co-defendant, this fact would be made known to the court of the United States Attorney\u2019s office as a recommendation for consideration. It was this part of the plea negotiation that was not followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">Based on these assertions, it is contended by Moriani that because he gave testimony favorable to Murphy, the district court judge \u201cbecame prejudiced against [Moriani] at [Moriani\u2019s] sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">The difficulty with this argument is manifest. First and foremost, the record does not support Moriani\u2019s claims. As stated, the government agreed to dismiss Count II if Moriani testified truthfully at Murphy\u2019s trial. Whether or not that condition was satisfied by Moriani, the fact remains that the government <em>did </em>live up to its part of the bargain: Count II was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">Second, Moriani himself testified at trial that he expected to be sentenced to 20 years, and that his attorney during a recess at Murphy\u2019s trial told him [Moriani]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-19\">Look, you are killing yourself. . I don\u2019t know what you are doing this for. . When I go in front of that man now [the district court judge], I can\u2019t ask him to give you no kind of a break.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXW\">Transcript of April 17, 1975 at 72, <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>Crim. No. 74-447 (D.N.J. June 20, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-22\">He also affirmed once again that he understood that the court was not bound by any recommendation that might be made by the United States Attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-23\">Third, in the context of these proceedings \u2014 where the same district court judge conducted Moriani\u2019s plea proceeding, presided at Murphy\u2019s trial, and then at Moriani\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>sentencing, discussed the extent of Moriani\u2019s \u201ccooperation\u201d \u2014 it is evident that the terms of the plea agreement were met. <em>Cf. United States v. Grusco, </em>536 F.2d 21, 25-26 (3d Cir. 1976). Moreover, Moriani at no time ever sought to set aside or withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His endeavors have been limited to seeking either vacation or reduction of his 20 year sentence. His complaint was and is that the sentence imposed upon him was too severe, exceeding whatever expectations he initially entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We are satisfied in light of the overall record that Moriani\u2019s plea bargain was in no way breached by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">While we are satisfied that Moriani\u2019s plea proceeding was properly conducted, we cannot say that Moriani\u2019s contention respecting the increase of his sentence because he lied, is without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Just recently we have reaffirmed the principle established in <em>Poteet </em>v. <em>Fauver, </em>517 F.2d 393 (3d Cir. 1975), that a trial judge is prohibited from increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence because he believes that the defendant has lied. <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>550 F.2d 103 (3d Cir. 1977). In both <em>Poteet </em>and <em>Grayson </em>the increased sentence had been imposed upon a defendant who himself had testified at his own trial before the particular sentencing judge and who was found by that judge to have lied either during, or subsequent to, the trial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Here, Moriani\u2019s situation is somewhat different. Moriani, if he lied, lied as a witness during the trial of a codefendant \u2014 not at a trial to determine his own guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, Moriani also was deemed to have lied at his sentencing proceeding when he apparently recited the promises made to him by the government in a form different that that which the district court judge remembered from the time that Moriani retracted his not guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">It is evident beyond question that the district court judge imposed a 20-year maximum sentence on Moriani because of his belief that Moriani lied. The judge\u2019s observation just prior to sentencing is crystal clear in this respect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS-\">I don\u2019t feel that you have cooperated with the Government at all, and I don\u2019t think that you told the truth when you testified in Mr. Murphy\u2019s case. I have never imposed the maximum sentence since I have been on the bench, but if there is any case in which the maximum sentence is warranted in view of your entire attitude this is it. You lied to this court even during these proceedings where you indicated that the United States Attorney would recommend or did recommend that a lenient sentence be imposed upon you, that the place of confinement will be recommended and that the section 4208(a)(2) provision would be employed in the imposition of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW0\">While we can understand and sympathize with the sentencing judge\u2019s perturbation at Moriani\u2019s testimony and representation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> nevertheless, under the law of this Circuit, Moriani\u2019s sentence was improperly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Although, as we have acknowledged, Moriani\u2019s allegedly untruthful testimony was given not at his own trial, but rather at the trial of a codefendant, we discern no substantive difference between this case and <em>Poteet </em>and <em>Grayson. </em>The rationale un-dergirding <em>Poteet </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Gray-son </em>is every bit as applicable to the situation here as to the situation where the \u201clie\u201d occurs at the defendant\u2019s own trial. As we said in <em>Poteet:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">A man may not be punished except upon a charge and opportunity for hearing. There having been no charge of perjury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>or conviction for that crime, due process would be denied if further punishment were inflicted for that crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">517 F.2d at 395, <em>quoting State v. Poteet, </em>61 N.J. 493, 495-96, 295 A.2d 857, 858 (1972). <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>544 F.2d 681 (3d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, even though Moriani was deemed by the trial judge to be a thoroughly incredible witness, it must be recognized that Moriani\u2019s testimony was not at variance with his plea, and that the government at all times could have sought an indictment against him for perjury. <em>See United States v. Hawthorne, </em>502 F.2d 1183, 1188 (3d Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">While we concede that a comparison of Moriani\u2019s testimony at his plea proceeding with his testimony at his sentencing reveals appreciable and significant differences, even without the rule of <em>Poteet </em>we would be most reluctant to permit punishment by added prison time for what perhaps could have been no more than the product of a faulty memory. Of one thing we are certain \u2014 no one was fooled or misled by Moria-ni\u2019s recitation of his plea particulars. Indeed, this case at least in one respect highlights the protection afforded by the <em>Poteet </em>rule \u2014 for even the district court judge apparently erred in attributing to Moriani the promise or representation that Moriani\u2019s sentence would be imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2). (See note 8 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">We appreciate the restraint and patience displayed by the district court judge in dealing with a difficult situation and a rather freewheeling individual. However, we are also confident that no matter how aggravating these circumstances may have been, the learned district court judge would have withheld increasing Moriani\u2019s sentence had the instructions and guidelines of <em>Poteet </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>Grayson </em>been available at the time of sentencing. Nonetheless, in light of those precedents, we are obliged to reverse and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">For the reasons hereinabove set forth, we will reverse and remand to the district court with directions that Moriani\u2019s sentence be vacated and that he be resentenced without consideration of his alleged false testimony at trial and at sentencing allocution. Under the circumstances presented, we think it advisable that another district court judge be assigned for resentencing. <em>See Poteet v. Fauver, supra, </em>517 F.2d at 398.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\">. 517 F.2d 393 (3d Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\">. 550 F.2d 103 (3d Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) proscribes the taking of money from a bank by force and violence or intimidation.

Moriani\u2019s codefendant, Murphy, who after pleading not guilty had been tried and convicted by a jury, was sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 concerns robbery of a bank \u201cthe deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2113(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b416-16\">. Although the government had Moriani under subpoena, it chose not to call him as a witness. Instead, Moriani testified for the defense and by his testimony sought to exculpate Murphy. According to Moriani, he, Moriani, had planned, organized and executed the robbery with others \u2014 but not with Murphy. Moriani claimed that Murphy had been babysitting with his [Moriani\u2019s] daughter and had neither participated in, nor had knowledge of, the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">In his charge, the district court judge, after noting the \u201csharp conflict between the testimony of the government\u2019s witnesses and that of defense witness Moriani,\u201d summarized the government\u2019s theory of Murphy\u2019s involvement in the robbery as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-18\">It is the theory of the government\u2019s case, supported by the testimony of witnesses produced by the government, that four men, Richard Adams, his brother, Ronald Adams, a juvenile, Robert Moriani, this defendant, George Murphy, and one woman, Margaret Hudson, knowingly and willfully participated in a planned armed bank robbery of a branch of the Heritage Bank at Camden, New Jersey, on October the 16th, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-19\">The government contends that three men, Moriani ^nd the two Adams brothers, were inside the bank, one armed with a revolver, another with a shotgun, who actually committed the robbery. Miss Hudson was outside somewhere near the bank with a waiting stolen getaway car, and it is also the government\u2019s theory and also the testimony of the government\u2019s witnesses that George Murphy, the defendant in this case, was in another waiting stolen getaway car which he stole and which was further removed from the bank and which was knowingly used by him to aid the robbers\u2019 flight from the bank in pursuance of a common criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-25\">Defense witness, Robert Moriani, admits the commission of the armed robbery, admits his role therein and that of the others, but he denies that the defendant, Murphy, played any part at all in the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-26\">An FBI agent (Waller) testified that in his interview with Moriani, Moriani admitted that he had discussed the robbery with Murphy and that Murphy and he had stolen the getaway cars; but that, if Murphy was prosecuted, he, Moriani, would \u201ctell the jury during the trial that Murphy had no involvement in the bank robbery even though he had just told me [Waller] otherwise.\u201d Transcript of April 17,1975 at 79-80, <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>Crim. No. 74-447 (D.N.J. June 20, 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\">. The Court also inquired with respect to what it evidently felt had been represented by Moria-ni, i.e., that Moriani would be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b417-14\">. As earlier noted, the maximum prison penalty for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) is 25 years (see n,3 supra). It is obvious that the district court judge in this colloquy with Moriani was referring to that penalty, which is five years more than the maximum prison penalty for a violation of \u00a7 2113(a), the subject of the first count to which Moriani pleaded guilty. No issue has ever been raised with respect to this discussion. Nor could such an issue, if raised, be supported in light of the entire record including references in Moriani\u2019s testimony at Murphy\u2019s trial to the plea agreement,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\">. Such an application would have to be made in the district court in the first instance. The record is silent as to any such proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\">. As earlier noted, Moriani had entered a guilty plea to one of the charges for which his codefendant was standing trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b419-17\">. It should be noted that although Moriani had been sworn at his plea taking, he was not under oath at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">. In <em>Hawthorne </em>this Court recognized the value of an independent proceeding in protecting the integrity of, in that case, plea proceedings. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">Considering the increasing number of applications for withdrawal of guilty pleas predicated on \u2018promises,\u2019 \u2018representations,\u2019 \u2018predications\u2019 and the like, allegedly made by defense counsel to defendants, it now becomes apparent that what we may have once considered merely an advisable measure for Rule 11 proceedings has now become imperative. We believe that the district courts should place defendants under oath for the Rule 11 proceedings, and that the <em>Paradiso </em>and <em>Valenciano </em>advice and disclaimers should be included as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">While we recognize that such disclaimers, even under oath, may not obviate the necessity of subsequent \u00a7 2255 evidentiary hearings, <em>they may furnish a basis for an independent proceeding against the defendant who answers the court\u2019s inquiries under oath and later attempts to withdraw his plea, claiming that the answers previously given were untrue.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) Where added imprisonment is involved, as it is here, the considerations to which this Court gave attention in <em>Hawthorne </em>and <em>Poteet </em>appear even more impressive.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b420-16\">. The <em>Poteet </em>opinion was filed May 7, 1975. It is extremely doubtful that the opinion in printed form was available to the bar and bench prior to Moriani\u2019s sentencing in June 1975. Prior to <em>Poteet, </em>this Circuit had not ruled on the issue of sentence enhancement and, as we pointed out in <em>Grayson, </em>many differing views existed in the various courts as to what constituted appropriate standards for sentencing in the context at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
