On February 1,1977, the clerk of the district court received a notice of appeal on behalf of plaintiffs. As it was received four days after the expiration of the 30 day time period allowed for filing notices of appeal, F.R.A.P. 4(a), plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal was marked \u201clodged\u201d rather than \u201cfiled.\u201d Thereafter, on February 4, 1977, plaintiffs filed a motion for an extension of time for filing their notice of appeal, alleging excusable neglect. On February 8, 1977, following a hearing, the district court denied the motion. Plaintiffs now appeal from that denial, contending that the district court abused its discretion in finding no excusable neglect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of excusable neglect was premised on the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-16\">A. That Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney was out of town until January 13, 1977.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-17\">B. That the Plaintiffs\u2019 contact with the class member leader was attempted on numerous occasions by phone and was unsuccessful because he was out of town or on various work shifts and unavailable by phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-18\">C. That a letter was sent by Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to the class member leader to set up a conference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-19\">D. That other class members had to be reached by the class member leader in order to hold said conference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-20\">E. That the members of the large class had to converge and obtain a necessary retainer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-21\">F. That the class was so numerous as to make necessary appeal arrangements difficult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-22\">G. That said appeal was prepared timely and placed in the office bin to be mailed timely; that said appeal was mailed Monday instead of Friday, one day late.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-23\">In general, excusable neglect may be found where a party has failed to learn of an entry of judgment, or in extraordinary cases where injustice would otherwise result. <em>See Dugan v. Missouri Neon &amp; Plastic Advertising Co., </em>472 F.2d 944 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Winchell v. Lortscher, </em>377 F.2d 247 (8th Cir. 1967). We cannot say that plaintiffs have made such a compelling showing of excusable neglect that the district court\u2019s finding to the contrary was an abuse of its discretion. We note that plaintiffs have been represented by co-counsel throughout this litigation, and that only one of its attorneys was alleged to have been out of town until January 13. We note further that within the initial 30 day period for filing appeals, plaintiffs could have sought an extension of time <em>ex parte. </em>F.R.A.P. 4(a). Finally, even if plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal had been mailed on Friday, January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>28, rather than Monday, January 31, it would still have been untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an extension of time is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-15\">. The time for filing a notice of appeal may be extended an additional 30 days upon a showing of excusable neglect; however, only the district courts are empowered to grant such an extension. F.R.A.P. 4(a). Our inquiry, therefore, is limited to whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to find excusable neglect. <em>See, e. g., Buckley v. United States, </em>382 F.2d 611 (10th Cir. 1967); 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 204.13[4] (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
