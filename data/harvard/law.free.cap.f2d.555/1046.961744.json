ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1107-25\">In March, 1962, the Federal Communications Commission disqualified its licensee broadcasting from Pasadena, California, on the 1110 kHz (AM) frequency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Interim authorization was issued lest the channel fall silent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Commission invited applications from would-be successors to the frequency. The ensuing proceeding generated no fewer than eight opinions during its twelve-year administrative lifespan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing examiner, the Review Board and the Commission each favored a different applicant, and for different reasons. Although each struggled valiantly with the bevy of complex issues presented, the net result was error, and so we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-27\">Of those responding to the Commission\u2019s call for applications, seven are parties to these appeals. Four of these proposed service from facilities in Pasadena,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one each from Whittier,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fullerton<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Costa Mesa-Newport area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pasadena borders on Los Angeles; the other communities lie roughly on a line from Pasadena south-southeasterly to Newport, which is about twenty miles from the Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>city limits and about forty miles from Pasadena. The Newport applicant proposed one-kilowatt daytime service, only while the rest \u2014 the \u201chigh-power\u201d applicants \u2014 contemplated operation on the same basis as the prior licensee: 50 kilowatts daytime and 10 kilowatts nighttime, unlimited service.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-3\">No useful purpose would be served by blueprinting every aspect of the Commission\u2019s architectonics. The keystone of the decisional edifice it constructed is the collective view of Section 307(b) of the Communications Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-4\">(b) In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each-of the same.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">The Commission\u2019s Review Board .disqualified the Newport applicant because his proposal would have provided daytime service to only about three million people,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> wherer, as all of the high-power proposals would have reached over five million people day and night.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus the Newport submission was deemed to run afoul of the \u201cefficiency\u201d mandate of the section,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which at each level of the administrative process was read as a direction to allot the frequency \u201cso as to provide service to the greatest population and area possible\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> after such matters as interference had been taken' into account.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That Newport had at that time no AM transmission facility \u2014 a factor heavily to be weighed in Section 307(b) decisions<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 gave it no advantage in the Review Board\u2019s eyes, for the same was true of the other commu-, nities represented in the proceeding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus considerations of fairness and equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>in the allocation of the spectrum were not brought into play, and the greater efficiency of the high-power proposals led the Review Board to prefer all of them to the Newport aspirant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Had matters ended there, our task would have differed significantly. As it was, the Commission sustained the Review Board\u2019s denial as to Newport without further ado.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but went on to request argument solely from the high-power candidates addressed to the theory on which the Review Board had chosen among them.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the Commission\u2019s hands, all the high-power plans became designs for transmission service for the entire Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area rather than for any one community therein.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Once that transformation eliminated the necessity of choosing among Fullerton, Pasadena and Whittier on the basis of need for additional service, the Commission, like the Review Board, found dispositive the question of greatest efficiency of the applicants\u2019 proposals<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, again like the Review Board, did not resort to standard comparative issues in reaching its</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-15\">decision. The upshot is that the Commission awarded the 1110 kHz frequency to Los Angeles, which it found to be served by over a score of AM stations, twelve of which specify Los Angeles as the city of license,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> over Newport, to which no AM transmission service is specifically dedicated.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-17\">In support of this disposition, the Commission considered only the larger population to be served by the \u201cLos Angeles\u201d applications than by that for Newport.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A finding on that score is, however, merely tangential to the congressional imperative to assure \u201cfair, efficient, and equitable\u201d distribution of the broadcast band \u201camong the several States and communities.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Congress was, of course, concerned that radio service extend to as large an audience as possible,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but that is not to say that the license is to be awarded to the applicant who would encompass the most listeners within the range of his signal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>were so, all frequencies likely would be assigned - sooner or later to\u2019 powerful stations in major population centers \u2014 precisely the result Congress meant to forestall by means of S\u00e9ction 307(b) as eveh'cursory examination of its ancestry indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Concentration of radio service in the big city was a problem at the time Section 307(b) was first enacted as part of the Radio Act of 1927,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and its purpose was to ehjoin \u201can equitable distribution of stations over the entire country.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Many feared that the standard was t\u00f3o pr\u00f3t\u00e9\u00e1n, however,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and that apprehension was fanned by the omission from the bill emerging from conference-of the requirement in the Senate and House bills of \u201cdue consideration of the right of each state to have allocated to it or to some [entity] within it, the use of a wave length. . . \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Vigorous efforts to reinsert that language failed,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> but the next year brought an amendment specifying-that the Commission allocate broadcasting service fdrmulaically according to population to each state and among five \u201czones\u201d into which the Nation was divided.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Unfortunately, the mechanical formula thereby imposed resulted in \u201cthe concentration of the use of frequencies in centers of populati\u00f3n, and the restriction of facilities in sparsely populated states, even though interference consideration [s/c] would permit the operation of one or more additional stations.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> At the Commission\u2019s behest, therefore, Section 307(b) was substantially restored to its original form \u2014 in which it remains.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The purpose of this reversion was twofold: to loose the Commission from the fetters imposed by the quota system, and to allow \u201csparsely populated\u201d areas, especially in the West and Middle West, to \u201csecurfe] the facilities we ought to have to meet' the demands of that section of the country.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-14\">Section 30.7(b)\u2019s emphasis on wide dispersion of radio transmission service gave rise long ago to the rule that \u201cwhen mutually exclusive applicants seek authority to serve different communities, the Commission first determines which community has the greater need for additional services and then determine[s] which applicant can best serve that community\u2019s need.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Local transmission service bestows such important benefits <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> that we have consistently interpreted Section 307(b) virtually to ensure an applicant for first local service preference over one who proposes merely to complement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>preexisting local operations.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In the wake of this body of precedent, the Commission makes no showing that it did compare Los Angeles\u2019 need for still another AM station with Newport\u2019s need for its first; nor does it satisfactorily distinguish its action here from that on previous occasions in finding fairness and equity to substantially favor first local service.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> These omissions render its order infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">One other matter deserves mention. The Commission found the engineering and siting specifications of every high-power \u201cLos Angeles area\u201d submission \u201cdeficient in some respect,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> chiefly because each proposed operation would produce objectionable interference with the signals of one or more other radio stations.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The absence of a technically-qualified applicant motivated the Commission to an exhaustive consideration of which plan permitted the \u201cmost efficient use of the 1110 kHz frequency in the southern California area\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u2014 shorthand for saying that the most auditors should, in the aggregate, be served.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> At the same time, the Commission totally disregarded the standard comparative issues that purport to test for the applicant that most closely conforms with the desired industry structure and the proposal that would deliver the best practicable service.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Surprised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>by this apparent departure from long-settled precedent,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> we requested that the Commission further elucidate its elision of the comparative issues;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The Commission\u2019s response taxes us with an \u201capparent misunderstanding\u201d that its focus on technical questions is traceable to Section 307(b)\u2019s \u201cefficiency\u201d criterion.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> It at once concedes that efficiency in this sense \u201cmay be considered as a comparative issue,\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and postulates that \u201cwhere \u2018efficiency\u2019 considerations under 307(b) are dis-positive, comparative issues need not be reached.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> To hold otherwise, the Commission continues, \u201cwould be to suggest that even, in the case of flagrantly inefficient proposals and marked violations of our technical \u2019 standards, a full comparative hearing would be mandated . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Finally, it suggests that whatever may obtain in the Usual case, the disparity here between the victor's technical presentation and those of the vanquished is so vast that we should proceed as if there were only one qualified candidate.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">Underlying the agency\u2019s <em>apologia </em>is the premise that Section 307(b), with its requirement of \u201cfair, efficient, and equitable\u201d spectrum allocation,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> is a talisman whereby the rigors of a comparative hearing may be avoided if only grounds for decision can be found that smack of \u201cefficiency\u201d \u2014 or, presumably,\u2018\u201cfairness\u201d or \u201cequity.\u201d We reject such a notion. To be sure, courts have countenanced rules dispensing with full-dress hearings on proposals that are, in the expert eyes of the Commission, dramatically wasteful or inequitable.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> One of many is the Section 307(b) policy, sustained in <em>FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Company,</em><footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of allocating transmission service among communities without reference to the relative qualities of their respective champions,, lest \u201cthe needs of the community\u201d be \u201csub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>ordinated to the ability of an applicant for another locality.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> But we do not think that an aspirant within the scope of the rules established by the Commission may, ad hoc, be refused a comparative hearing merely because a rival appears who is somewhat more \u201cefficient.\u201d After all, his other attributes might show that the satisfaction accorded to those who will listen counterbalances, as far as the public interest is concerned, the fact that fewer could hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">In the case at bar, of course, there is no surfeit of qualified candidates for the 1110 kHz frequency. Nor do we face a situation like those in which unwaived violations of the Commission\u2019s rules narrow the field to but one qualified contestant.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> All were in violation, and so presumptively their applications were not efficient nor otherwise in the public interest; the Commission felt called upon to decide to whom, if anyone, a waiver was to be granted. We find ourselves at a loss to understand why the Commission should have disdained guidance from the other applicant characteristics normally explored in comparative proceedings. Should the Commission be forced to a similar decision on remand, it will be well advised to seek enlightenment from that quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1107-13\">. <em>Eleven Ten Broadcasting Co., </em>32 F.C.C. 706, <em>reconsideration denied, </em>33 F.C.C. 92, <em>aff\u2019d sub nom.

The Review Board, which the Commission sustained, noted two other defects in the Newport application but, in view of the treatment accorded to high-power applicants who shared these deficiencies, we cannot presume that the Commission regarded them as dispositive. One indisputably legitimate concern of the Commission was protecting the international allocation of the frequency to the United States by virtue of the penetration of the Mexican border by the prior licensee\u2019s signal. See <em>Review Board Decision, supra </em>note 3, 29 F.C.C.2d at 540-541. The Newport proposal, specifying daytime service only, could only partially conserve this advantage to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 543. Yet another applicant whose signal penetrated .the border neither by night nor by day was assessed only a \u201cslight demerit\u201d therefor. <em>Final Decision, supra </em>note 3, 45 F.C.C.2d at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-10\">A second defect in the Newport proposal was uncovered when the Hearing Examiner found that it unacceptably overlapped the contours of a preexisting San Diego station. <em>Initial Decision, supra </em>note 3, 29 F.C.C.2d at 760. The Review Board, taking official notice of an intervening change in the San Diego station\u2019s operations, discounted the importance of the overlap, <em>Review Board Decision, supra </em>note 3, 29 F.C.C.2d at 543 n.16, which led it to assume that the Newport application comported with-engineering standards. <em>Id. </em>Though, with respect to other candidates, the Commission\u2019s final decision rejected this apparently unobjectionable reference to matters of public record, <em>Final Decision, supra </em>note 3, 45 F.C.C.2d at 591, it attributed but \u201cminor significance\u201d to the other, albeit less egregious, instances of the now-hypothetical overlap. <em>Id. </em>at 594. We are loathe, therefore, to speculate on what the Commission\u2019s posture would be once its \u00a7 307(b) error with respect to Newport was brought to light. Additionally, since these proceedings must in any event be remanded, to the Commission for a fresh look, we find it unnecessary to pass upon its refusal to take official notice of this and other matters. No rationale now appears for deciding these already, hoary cases on obviously outmoded factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">.

See authorities cited <em>supra </em>at note 38. The Commission asserts that preexisting broadcast stations can be maintained even though their continuance does not satisfy the strictures of \u00a7 307(b). See, e. g., <em>Final Decision, supra </em>note 3, 45 F.C.C.2d at 577-578; <em>Review Board Decision, supra </em>note 3, 29 F.C.C.2d at 538-539. This contention is, we think, belied by the face of the statute, which applies not only to changes in the structure of spectrum allocation, such as grants of new licenses or modifications, but to license renewals as well. <em>Cf. e. g., Fidelity Television, Inc. v. FCC, supra </em>note 38, 169 U.S.App.D.C. at 235, 515 F.2d at 694. Our inference is buttressed by the section\u2019s adjuration that the Commission consider the propriety of allocation \u201cwhen and insofar as there is demand\u201d for service. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(b) (1970). Satisfaction of these statutory commands is not, nor ought it to be, a one-time thing, for the balance of demand for service will shift among communities over time. Admittedly these cases are distinguishable from those in which we have held that \u201cwhere cities are competing for channel allocation, a temporary allocation to one city rather than another should not operate to create vested rights.\u201d <em>Fort Harrison Telecasting Corp. v. FCC, supra </em>note 38, 116 U.S.App.D.C. at 354, 324 F.2d at 386. See <em>Beloit Broadcasters, Inc. v. FCC, </em>125 U.S.App.D.C. 29, 30-31, 365 F.2d 962, 963-964 (1966). <em>Cf. Community Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>107 U.S.App.D.C. 95, 101, 274 F.2d 753, 759 (1960). It is clear, moreover, that the Commission should not be required to compromise its considered judgment as to what distribution is proper every time someone is dissatisfied with existing allocations. <em>Cf. Logansport Broadcasting Corp. v. United States, </em>93 U.S. App.D.C. 342, 345-346, 210 F.2d 24, 27-28 (1954). On the other hand, the Commission is required to reasonably respond to changing conditions and here, at least, where the Commission had designated the \u00a7 307(b) issue, see <em>Initial Decision, supra </em>note 3, 29 F.C.C.2d at 612-614, it may not cleave to the status quo without a legally acceptable justification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1111-13\">. <em>Final Decision, supra </em>note 3, 45 F.C.C.2d at 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1111-14\">.
