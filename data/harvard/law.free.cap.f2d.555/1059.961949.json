We are in general agreement with Judge Robinson\u2019s opinion. We find it useful only to emphasize that, as presented to us upon appeal, the \u201cfundamental issue\u201d is, in appellant\u2019s submission, whether the Food and Drug Administration, in promulgating the challenged regulations with respect to seafood cocktails and frozen heat and serve dinners, was required to utilize the formal rulemaking procedures prescribed in \u00a7 701(e) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as distinct from the informal (or notice and comment) general rulemaking authority vested in it by \u00a7 701(a). Whatever may have been the case in the District Court, appellant before us did not pose the issue in terms of rulemaking as contrasted with case-by-case adjudication in complaint proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">The District Court in its opinion (at pp. 553-554) addressed the precise issue of formal versus informal rulemaking as the procedure required to be followed in this instance. It concluded, contrarily to appellant\u2019s contention, that the two regulations under attack did not constitute the establishment of definitions and standards of identity within the meaning of \u00a7 701(e). On this premise, with which we fully agree, the District Court concluded that it was proper for the FDA, invoking the general rulemaking power confided to it by \u00a7 701(a), to promulgate the challenged regulations in aid of other substantive provisions of the Act, notably \u00a7\u00a7 403(i) and 201(n). We think that the District Court was correct in so doing, and in its final conclusion that the resulting regulations, by reference to the administrative record, are neither arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion under the applicable standard of review. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">The judgment of the District Court is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
