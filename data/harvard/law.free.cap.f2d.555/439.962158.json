In 1970 Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq., </em>\u201cto assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 651(b). In this proceeding we review enforcement of a citation by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. That citation was based on petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with regulations requiring a guard rail or cover for skylight openings in a roof work area. Deciding the employer has the burden of demonstrating that compliance with the regulations is impossible, we find substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the finding of the Review Commission that compliance was feasible. Its decision enforcing the citation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">The facts are undisputed. Petitioner Ace Sheeting and Repair Company is a roof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>repair company. In September 1973 J. C. Ledger, the owner of Ace, and employee Stroud were replacing corrugated metal panels on the roof of a warehouse in Houston. The roof was pitched rather steeply and contained 60 skylight openings arranged in two rows running the length of the building. The skylights were covered with a translucent plastic material called coralux. There was no guard rail or cover around or over any of these skylights. While walking to another section of the roof to obtain additional materials Stroud stepped in the middle of one of the coralux sheets. The sheet gave way beneath his 175-pound weight, and Stroud fell 25 feet to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">A few days after this fatality the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 657(a), inspected the job site. On the basis of this inspection, Ace was served with a citation for violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.500(b)(4). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4o\">Wherever there is danger of falling through a skylight opening, it shall be guarded by a fixed standard railing on all exposed sides or a cover capable of sustaining the weight of a 200-pound person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"alf-dedup-0\">This regulation was promulgated by the Secretary under the Act. Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 654(a)(2) imposes on all employers covered by the Act the duty to comply with such regulations. The proposed penalty in the citation served on Ace was a $30 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Ace challenged the citation, and a hearing was held before an administrative law judge. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659(c). Only the Secretary offered evidence at the hearing. The sole evidence concerning the feasibility of taking the prescribed measures to reduce the risks caused by the unguarded skylights came from an Occupational Safety and Health Administration compliance officer. The administrative law judge vacated the citation on the ground that the Secretary had failed to prove that compliance with the regulation was feasible under the circumstances. The Commission reversed by a two-to-one vote. Ace petitioned this Court for review of that decision. Jurisdiction in this Court is provided under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The outcome of this case turns on who has the burden of proof. Must the Secretary prove that compliance with the regulation is feasible, as thought by the administrative law judge; or is feasibility of compliance assumed unless the employer proves otherwise?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 654(a) creates two kinds of obligations requiring employers to take steps for the occupational safety and health of their employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Each employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">(2) shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Paragraph (1) has come to be called the \u201cgeneral duty clause,\u201d while paragraph (2) is referred to as the \u201cspecific duty clause.\u201d This case involves a safety standard promulgated under the specific duty clause. The Act itself gives no guidance as to who must bear the burden of proving the feasibility of eliminating a particular hazard under either clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Ace relies on <em>National Realty &amp; Construction Co., Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 489 F.2d 1257 (1973), to show that this burden is properly placed on the Secretary. But <em>National Realty </em>dealt with the general duty clause. No regulation or standard guided the employer as to the way to eliminate the hazard there involved. The D.C. Circuit for that reason placed the burden on the Secretary of demonstrating in what manner the Company\u2019s conduct fell short of the statutory mandate. The court reasoned that \u201cthe Secretary must be constrained to specify the particular steps a cited employer should have taken to avoid citation, and to demonstrate the feasibility and likely utility of those measures.\u201d 489 F.2d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Two circuits have extended the <em>National Realty </em>principle to \u201cspecific duty clause\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>situations. In <em>General Electric Co. v. OSHRC, </em>540 F.2d 67 (2d Cir. 1976), a standard promulgated by the Secretary required employees to wear protective eye equipment. The Commission had upheld a citation because of the company\u2019s failure to take sufficient steps to have the employees use the safety glasses that were provided. The Second Circuit set aside the Commission\u2019s order, however, because the Secretary had not proved enough, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">The violation cannot stand upon unsupported generalizations that an employer\u2019s efforts to secure employee use of equipment have not gone \u201cfar enough\u201d and that such non-use is \u201cpreventable\u201d without evidence of what more the employer could have done and some basis to conclude that further efforts would have been feasible and successful, or at least substantially increased the likelihood of employee use. This record is silent on these subjects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">540 F.2d at 70. In <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and Alsea Lumber Co., </em>511 F.2d 1139 (9th Cir. 1975), another specific duty case, the regulation also concerned employee conduct, <em>i.e., </em>the method of operating machinery and the wearing of protective equipment. The Ninth Circuit applied <em>National Realty </em>in upholding the Commission\u2019s requirement that the Secretary assume the burden of proving the employer\u2019s knowledge that his employees were failing to comply with the safety standards. See also <em>ITO Corp. of New England v. OSHRC, </em>540 F.2d 543 (1st Cir. 1976), and <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. OSHRC, </em>534 F.2d 541 (3d Cir. 1976), where each court assumed without discussion that the employer bears the burden of proving that compliance with a regulation is infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In both <em>General Electric </em>and <em>Alsea Lumber, </em>however, there was no specific direction as to what the employer should do. The regulations involved did nothing more than create, in effect, a general duty of the employer to meet a safety standard, without stating what specific employer conduct was required for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Here, the regulation stated specific ways for the employer to eliminate the hazard. If the employer put up guard rails or covered the skylights, the safety standard would have been met. If for any reason guard rails or covers are not feasible, the employer knows this better than anyone else, and it is reasonable to require him to come forward with the evidence to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Regulations are promulgated only after industry-wide comment during which time general feasibility considerations can be voiced. If a regulation contains a proposed method of abating a safety hazard which employers consider to be infeasible in the ordinary case, they can directly challenge the regulation as factually unsupported. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(f). Furthermore a particular employer who finds that he cannot comply with the safety measures required by the regulations can request a variance under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(b)(6). When the citation stage is reached, it is eminently reasonable for courts to cast upon the employer the burden of proving impossibility of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The standard prescribed the precise conduct required of the employer. It may be easily complied with in many shops. Others may have difficulty, but where compliance with either of two specific alternatives, a guard rail or a cover, would eliminate the hazard with which the deceased employee in this case was confronted, the employer should prove why he cannot meet either of those alternatives. We therefore hold that where a specific duty standard contains the method by which the work hazard is to be abated, the burden of proof is on the employer to demonstrate that the remedy contained in the regulation is infeasible under the particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">To state this rule is to decide the present case. The factual decisions of the Commission are to be sustained if supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a). Ace argues that even if it did have the burden of showing infeasibility, that burden was carried by the testimony of the Secretary\u2019s witnesses. Ace itself presented no evidence as to why it could not use skylight covers on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>this particular roof. Although the Secretary\u2019s witnesses did express some concern that skylight covers might slide off the pitched roof, the possibility of using \u201csome type, of abrasive surface on the bottom of a covering to . prevent the covering from sliding off the roof\u201d was also discussed. In any event, on the state of the record, it was not the Secretary\u2019s job to describe precisely how covers or guard rails could be placed on Ace\u2019s premises. There is therefore sufficient evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that \u201c[ijmpossibility has not been established in this case.\u201d That being so, the citation for violation of 29 C.P.R. \u00a7 1926.500(b)(4) was proper, and the Commission's decision enforcing the $30 penalty is</p>\n<p id=\"AtU\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
