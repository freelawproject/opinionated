On or about May 2, 1972, the defendants NORMAN \u201cNorm\u201d GLICK-MAN, ALFREDO \u201cFreddie\u201d SALAZAR, and ROBERT RAINES, traveled to Har-lingen Industrial Airport, Harlingen, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-16\">9. On or about May 2, 1972, the defendants WILLIAM DENNIS \u201cBill\u201d SCHEBERGEN, JOSEPH EDWARD \u201cEd\u201d GUNNINGHAM, and JOSE \u201cPepe\u201d MIGUEL MUNOZ-INFIESTA, had a meeting in Detroit, Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-17\">All the foregoing in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 846.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adh\">No present appellant now disputes that government proofs were such as to offer overwhelming evidence of the existence of a large (and for a time successful) international conspiracy to bring a variety of illegal drugs to Detroit for ultimate street sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">It is clear, however, that the present appellants were not principals who were at the heart of the conspiracy charged. Indeed, they contend that they were not a part of the conspiracy at all, or in defend- , ant Glickman\u2019s case, if there was proof that he was engaged in a conspiracy, it was an entirely different conspiracy, to possess and distribute only marihuana. They also dispute the fairness of the trial, arguing that the District Judge\u2019s rulings on admission of evidence and his charge to the jury contained serious and prejudicial errors which mandate reversal for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">THE GENERAL CONSPIRACY</p>\n<p id=\"AjX\">Proofs at trial were supplied largely from two sources \u2014 coconspirators who turned state\u2019s evidence and a multitude of tapes and transcripts resulting. from court-ordered wiretaps.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Defendant Gunningham, who obviously was the key figure in this conspiracy, pled guilty before this trial took place. He was sentenced to 10 years, and subsequently appealed. This court has already entered a summary order affirming Gunningham\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The first evidence of the conspiracy concerned a meeting at a bar in Detroit in (or about) the month of February 1971. Present were Gunningham, Schebergen, Le-Blanc, Rees and Bantle. Thereafter Bantle went to Pharr, Texas, and purchased a house with money furnished to him by Gun-ningham and which house he promptly deeded to Gunningham. Bantle, who pled guilty and testified for the government, gave evidence concerning his role as a courier carrying money between Gunningham in Detroit and a man named Salazar in Texas. At the house in Pharr, Bantle testified that he saw suitcases of marijuana. He saw Rees, Weston and Fye at the Pharr house. He also saw Glickman at an airport near Pharr and flew from Texas to Detroit with Rees, who had a plane load of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Bantle also testified to being at the Detroit headquarters of the drug ring on Keating Street near Seven Mile Road and there seeing similar suitcases of marijuana. He also testified that he saw marijuana and heroin being cut at the Keating Street headquarters operated by Gunningham.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Still another coconspirator who testified for the government was Sadak. Sadak worked for Gunningham at the Keating Street headquarters. He testified to seeing Gunningham, Schebergen and Weston cutting heroin in one room at Keating and cutting cocaine in another. He also testified to the fact that all kinds of drugs were sold from the Keating Street house, including cocaine, heroin', marijuana, LSD and barbiturates: Sadak\u2019s work particularly involved distribution of Mexican marijuana. He testified that the Gunningham operation handled very large quantities of marijuana. Another coconspirator who turned state\u2019s evidence was Patricia Rasico, who at the times concerned was living with Greg Weston, another of Gunningham\u2019s employees in drug distribution. Rasico also testified to seeing large quantities of heroin, cocaine and marijuana at the Keating Street headquarters. Among those she identified was Rees, who was introduced to her as Gun-ningham\u2019s pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">THE MEXICAN CONNECTION</p>\n<p id=\"azo-dedup-0\">The evidence leaves no doubt that the large amounts . of marijuana which were sold in Detroit from Gunningham\u2019s Keating Street headquarters came from Mexico. The marijuana was taken to the house at Pharr, Texas, which Gunningham had bought, and subsequently was flown into Detroit. Two pilots, Rees and Glickman, worked for Gunningham. They owned their own planes, but when Rees was in jail in Peru, Glickman flew Rees\u2019 plane. Glick-man was identified as being at the house in Pharr and at the Keating Street house. Rees was identified as being at the house in Pharr. Glickman also chauffeured Gun-ningham in Texas. When he was arrested he had $25,000 in cash on his person and said he worked for Gunningham. There was testimony that Gunningham referred to Rees as his employee. The evidence was such as to allow the jury to view Glickman and Rees as the major couriers of drugs and money for the conspiracy. Raines, himself a pilot who flew some Texas flights for the conspiracy, gave a particularly vivid account of accompanying Glickman on a flight to Pharr to pick up suitcases of marijuana and bring them back to Detroit. Raines testified that Rees had a key to the Pharr house and that Rees said he was flying for Gunningham.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">THE FLORIDA CONNECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Ron Kuranty was identified by direct evidence of coconspirators and tapes of phone calls as a major Detroit distributor of drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>for the Gunningham operation. He also had a source in Florida for cocaine which he supplied to Gunningham. Sadak testified that Kuranty told him about his (Kuranty\u2019s) May 1972 trip to Florida with Glickman flying him, after which Kuranty called Schebergen to tell him he had cocaine for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">THE PERUVIAN CONNECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Gunningham\u2019s direct source of cocaine was Peru and he boasted repeatedly that his Peruvian cocaine was better than Ku-ranty\u2019s cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The most direct description of the Peru connection is contained in the Sadak testimony. In January of 1972, Rees had been jailed in Peru and Valdes, a Los Angeles bailbondsman and purported Mexican lawyer, was contacted by Gunningham. He estimated that his total fee for freeing Rees (and checking on related charges pending against Gunningham) would be $25,000. Valdes agreed to meet with Gunningham in El Paso. There he was met by Gunning-ham, Schebergen and Glickman. In negotiations with Gunningham, Valdes agreed to go to Lima and received $5,000 of his fee. After several calls from Valdes demanding more money, Gunningham sent Sadak to Lima with $10,000 in $100 bills in a money belt. When Sadak got in touch with Valdes in Lima and paid over the $10,000, he also asked him about some cocaine for his own use and Valdes told him he could get some in \u201cthe mountains.\u201d When Sadak was about to return to Detroit, Valdes gave him a tape cassette for Gunningham which Sa-dak was leery of carrying back. Valdes told him that it could not get him into trouble and played part of it for him.\u2019 Subsequently Sadak testified that he and Ku-ranty played the entire cassette before turning it over to Gunningham. The tape, according to Sadak, described a deal for purchase of 15 objects variously referred to as \u201ctransistors\u201d or \u201ctranslators\u201d at a price per unit of $5,000 in Peru, $6,500 in Bolivia, and $8,500 in Northwest Mexico. The jury could have concluded that the unit under discussion was, as Valdes testified, a device for rebroadcasting television pictures. Or it could, as it obviously did, have accepted Sadak\u2019s testimony that the word used on the tape was a euphemism (not Sadak\u2019s term) for a kilo of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">WIRE INTERCEPTION EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Thus far the facts have been stated chiefly from the testimony of coconspirators who had pled guilty. Much of the government\u2019s case, however, consisted of transcripts of telephonic interceptions authorized by court-ordered warrants. Over 2,000 calls were thus intercepted and many were introduced. Most of these calls while probative of the existence and scope of the conspiracy, pertained directly to principals who were closer to the heart of the operation than the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">There were, however, telephonic interceptions of important conversations of three of the appellants, Hajal, Valdes and Glickman. In the instance of these three appellants, the - conversations admitted in evidence were in themselves sufficient to allow the jury to find that appellants Hajal, Valdes and Glickman were knowing participants in the general conspiracy described above. The most relevant of these conversations are set out in Appendices A, B and C attached to this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wire interception number three on the telephone at the Pharr, Texas, house provided two conversations between Glickman and Salazar (both in Texas) which the jury could have viewed as Salazar\u2019s inquiry as to whether Gunning-ham wanted to buy heroin and Glickman\u2019s day-later response that he did. As to appellant Rees, there was ample testimony from which the jury could have concluded that he was working for Gunningham as both courier and pilot from the beginning of the conspiracy until interrupted by his stay in the Peruvian jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">We therefore hold that this record contains ample evidence from which the jury in this case could properly find each of the above-named appellants guilty as charged beyond reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>OTHER APPELLATE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"AsY\">In addition to disputing the adequacy of evidence linking them to the conspiracy, defendants Hajal, Glickman and Rees also claim reversible error in the fact that at one point the District Judge admitted hearsay evidence saying that it might be used to establish a defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy. The evidence thus admitted pertained to appellant Hajal. Witness Sadak was allowed to testify to the fact that he heard Gunningham and Schebergen talking about Hajal, and the fact that Hajal owed Gunningham $7,500, and Gunningham, as a result, would not supply him with any more drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We have no doubt, as the District Judge himself recognized before the trial was concluded, that the ruling objected to was error. The latest of many Supreme Court pronouncements upon this issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">The hearsay rule does not automatically bar all out-of-court statements by a defendant in a criminal case. Declarations by one defendant may also be admissible against other defendants upon a sufficient showing, by independent evidence, of a conspiracy among one or more other defendants and the declarant and if the declarations at issue were in furtherance of that conspiracy. The same is true of declarations of coconspirators who are not defendants in the case on trial. <em>Dut-ton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 81, 91 S.Ct. 210, 215, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\"><em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 701, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3104, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In our instant case the District Judge repeatedly charged the jury as to the necessity that there be evidence which convinced the jury of the existence of the conspiracy charged in the indictment and evidence which convinced them that a defendant had knowingly and purposefully joined the conspiracy before any hearsay evidence could be considered in weighing the guilt of that particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Three such charges \u2014 all given before the episode with which we now deal \u2014 are printed in Appendix D to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">At the end of the trial, counsel for Hajal made a motion to dismiss, based upon the hearsay objection set out above. The District Judge thereupon ruled out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">First of all, last night at the close of the ease I invited Mr. Gillis and Government counsel into chambers, and in their presence and mine, the testimony of Mr. Sa-dak with regard to the claimed hearsay statements that the Court permitted Mr. Sadak to testify to in conversations that he had with Mr. Gunningham and Mr. Kuranty were alluded to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">The record will note that Mr. Gillis indicated that I had made a ruling at the time which was inconsistent with the instructions on the law that I was giving to the jury in the proposed instructions that I had prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">Consequently, I had that testimony read back, as I say. I think that the record did not, should not only meet Mr. Gillis\u2019 objection, which it does, but my response to the objection which has not been on the record heretofore. At the time that I permitted the evidence to come in from Mr. Sadak there was already testimony in the record through the telephone calls that had been introduced by the Government against Mr. Sadak\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">MR. KAUFMAN: Mr. Hajal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">THE COURT: \u2014against Mr. Hajal, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-15\">And there was also other testimony at that juncture to show two things: and that is proof of the conspiracy and proof that Mr. Hajal joined the conspiracy. With that proof already in the record, I am convinced that the order of proof permitted me to allow hearsay statements in thereafter for any purpose against Mr. Hajal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-16\">And I do not believe, as Mr. Gillis urged, that I had to give at that juncture a limited statement as to how the jury could use the hearsay statements of the witness Sadak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>I do believe that my rulings were correct but at one point in the record I think I gave the wrong reason for the ruling. It came about, as I recall it, in this way: Having announced the general rule with regard to the admissions of and statements of the coconspirators and without indicating that there had already been testimony from which the jury could link Mr. LeBlanc \u2014 Mr. Hajal to the conspiracy, I said to Mr. Gillis, \u201cLet\u2019s pass that point, and then incorrectly stated a proposition of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">I want the record to note that while my rulings were correct, my reason at the time for giving the ruling was not. I do not believe, on reflection, that it would be either wise or proper for me to allude to this now in the instructions to the jury, since I believe the admission of that testimony was proper. And the record will so note, but it also notes Mr. Gillis\u2019 objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">He thereupon repeated in his instructions to the jury still another admonition that hearsay could be considered only if there was direct evidence that each defendant had \u201cknowingly and purposely entered the conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We agree with the District Judge. The evidence concerning Hajal which had been admitted was admissible \u2014 subject to the admonitions already given and repeated in the charge. We also agree, however, that in saying it could be used to connect Hajal with the conspiracy, the District Judge had misspoken and was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In the total context of this three and one-half month trial, however, we believe that the error must be weighed against the standard of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">Rule 52. Harmless error and plain error. \u2014 (a) Harmless error. \u2014 Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Thus weighed, we find these factors. First, proper rulings on the use of hearsay had already been given before the erroneous statement. Second, the material admitted as to Hajal was admissible under standard conspiracy law. Third, the facts shown in the material admitted were also proved in direct evidence in conversations quoted in Appendix A between Gunning-ham and Hajal. And, finally, the jury was given still another instruction on the proper use of hearsay in the Judge\u2019s charge. We hold that the District Judge\u2019s misstatement was harmless error as to Hajal and the codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">We have also reviewed the District Judge\u2019s charge with care in relation to the additional claims of error therein asserted in the briefs of Hajal, Glickman and Rees. Taken as a whole, we believe the charge was a fair and accurate statement of conspiracy law. We find no reversible error therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">INDIVIDUAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">Appellant Hajal claims that the conspiracy for which he was convicted was one not charged in the indictment. Actually, the first paragraph of the indictment and paragraph 2(d) specifically charge the participation of Hajal as a distributor of drugs in Detroit, as to which we have previously found ample evidence to support the jury verdict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Hajal also asserts that his conviction should be vacated because the Attorney General failed in timely fashion to republish the schedule of controlled substances. The simple answer to this argument is that we do not read the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 \u00a7 202, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (1970), as terminating the published schedules of drugs on any date certain \u201cunless and until amended pursuant to section 811 of this title.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the language pertaining to updating and republishing as directory only. We will leave for a case presenting the issue any argument as to whether a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>schedule amendment which made criminal the possession or sale of a previously legal drug would violate the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. Here, clearly, heroin, which evidence allowed the jury to find was used, possessed and sold by Hajal, had been an illegal drug all the while. <em>See generally United States v. Grummel, </em>542 F.2d 789 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Mundt, </em>508 F.2d 904 (10th Cir. 1974), <em>cert, denied, </em>421 U.S. 949, 95 S.Ct. 1682, 44 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); <em>United States v. Nocar, </em>497 F.2d 719, 722-23 (7th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1038, 95 S.Ct. 526, 42 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Appellant Glickman relies upon a number of issues discussed and ruled upon above. He also claims prejudicial error in the admission at trial of $29,000 found in a suitcase which he had just loaded into a plane belonging to appellant Rees. Appellant Glickman and appellant Rees were specifically named in paragraph 2(c) of the indictment, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">2. Among the means by which the defendants would carry out the aforesaid conspiracy, were the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">C. It was further a part of said conspiracy that the defendants and co-conspirators NORMAN \u201cNorm\u201d GLICK-MAN, CHARLES \u201cChuck\u201d \u201cFlyboy\u201d REES, and ROBERT RAINES, would deliver funds used in purchasing heroin, cocaine, marihuana and other controlled substances, would transport other co-conspirators to different geographic locations to negotiate the distribution of heroin, cocaine, marihuana, and other controlled substances, by use of aircraft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">We believe that Glickman\u2019s and Rees\u2019 roles as couriers in the transportation of money for purchase of drugs was directly involved in the criminal conspiracy and that the unusual sum of money found in the plane at the point of arrest was relevant proof for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Appellant Rees presents an additional individual argument not thus far dealt with. A Canadian constable was testifying about Gunningham, who after arrest jumped bail and fled to Canada. In doing so he testified that appellant Rees had been introduced to him in Canada by Gunning-ham as \u201cAndy Watson.\u201d The District Judge originally admitted this evidence, even though it followed the termination of the conspiracy, because it pertained to conversation in appellant Rees\u2019 presence. Later, however, he granted a defense motion to strike this evidence, but denied a motion for a mistrial. Appellant testified that he turned himself in voluntarily. Our review of the District Judge\u2019s rulings on this issue do not demonstrate any abuse of judicial discretion or error prejudicial to appellant Rees\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">The most difficult of appellant Rees\u2019 issues pertains to the fact that information concerning Rees\u2019 incarceration in Peru came to the attention of the jury. The route by which this occurred is important.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Appellant Valdes\u2019 chief defense to the government\u2019s charges against him was that he was employed by Gunningham as a lawyer to go to Peru to represent Rees concerning the drug charges on which Rees was confined. One month after this trial began, counsel for Valdes first raised the question of Rees\u2019 being in jail in Peru by a question addressed to the government agent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>charge on cross-examination. A hearsay objection prevented an answer. Next Valdes\u2019 counsel made it known that he intended to question Sadak about why Gun-ningham had sent Sadak to Peru. This promptly brought Rees\u2019 lawyer to object first on the ground of lawyer-client privilege, and then on the ground of prejudice to his client by revealing to the jury an unproven drug charge not the subject of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The conflict of interests approached the classic. The District Judge attempted to weave his way carefully between <em>Scylla </em>and <em>Charybdis. </em>He ruled that testimony from Sadak could not invade any lawyer-client privilege and he allowed the jury to hear the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">Q (By Mr. Smith): Mr. Sadak, do you know the purpose for your trip in March of 1972 to Peru, in March of 1972?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">A Yes, I was told the purpose of my trip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">Q What was that purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">A The purpose of my trip was to deliver money to a Mr. James Valdes for the benefit and release of Mr. Charles Rees, who had been in trouble of some sort in Lima, Peru.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">MR. DURANT: I object to that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">THE COURT: The answer may stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">(By Mr. Smith): Mr. Valdes, specific\u00e1l-iy\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">THE COURT: Let me say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the matter of the witness\u2019 answer with regard to Mr. Rees may not be considered by you in any way, shape or form in connection with the charge that Mr. Rees faces here. And I think that in order to make that cautionary instruction as telling as possible, I will instruct you that that part of Mr. Sadak\u2019s answer that had to do with Mr. Rees and the fact that he was in some trouble, as Mr. Sadak said, in Lima, Peru, should be stricken from your minds and not considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-16\">(All jurors answer affirmatively.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">MR. DURANT: Your Honor, in addition to that cautionary instruction, I would like to make it clear, again, .that my objection goes to the point where I feel that I am entitled, in the defense of my client, to show the outcome of it and the acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">THE COURT: Well, if you wish to do that on your side of the case, the door has been opened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">MR. DURANT: Thank you, your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-20\">THE COURT: But I am indicating to you, ladies and gentlemen, that that matter of whatever happened in Lima, Peru as far as Mr. Rees is concerned, cannot be taken to bear on his guilt or innocence in the trial in this case. I will have more to say about that when I give you my final instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-21\">Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-22\">Q (By Mr. Smith): In fact, Mr. Sadak, knowledge had been supplied to you that Mr. Rees was in jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-23\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-24\">In both instances counsel for Rees moved for severance and mistrial and now claims reversible error in the District Judge\u2019s denial of both motions. The District Judge, however, repeatedly instructed the jury that the answers complained about should not be considered \u201cin any way, shape or form in connection with the charge that Mr. Rees faces here.\u201d Subsequently, the District Judge allowed Rees\u2019 lawyer to establish through Rees\u2019 testimony that he . had been exonerated on the Peruvian charges and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">In time sequence, the testimony here complained about came into the record before the government had introduced rebuttal evidence designed to show that Valdes was not a Mexican attorney at all, and while appellant . Valdes\u2019 defense was that his mission in Peru was as retained counsel for Rees.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-26\">It should also be noted that Rees\u2019 motion for severance and mistrial, based on the colloquy printed above, came late in this three and one-half month trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>We measure the claims of error in this regard against two general rules of evidence now formalized in the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">Rule 403 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">Rule 404(b) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">While these rules did not become effective until July 1, 1975 \u2014 well after completion of this trial \u2014 we believe they serve to state preexisting law on the subject concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Because of the complexity of problems of evidence presented by differing trial situations, both rules are written to recognize numbers of exceptions. And the accompanying notes emphasize the great discretion necessarily possessed by the trial judge in admission or exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">In this trial Rees\u2019 right to be tried only on the charges in the indictment without being prejudiced by irrelevant charges brought by a foreign sovereign had to be weighed against Valdes\u2019 right to develop his defense that his actions were in pursuance of his duties as a lawyer and the government\u2019s theory that all of Valdes\u2019 actions in Peru were part of the international drug conspiracy in which he was charged with participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">If these conflicts had been fully developed prior to commencement of trial on a motion to sever Rees\u2019 trial, we might have a different case. Sometimes, however, the facts complained about as prejudicial are so much a part of the res gestae of a crime as to be impossible to avoid. Thus in a very recent decision (dealing with a bank robbery committed by three inmates of the Milan Federal Correctional Institution while out of the walls on a \u201cwork release\u201d program) this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">The motion to limit testimony required the district court to weigh the probative value of the evidence offered against the possible prejudice of revealing the fact that the appellants had been previously convicted of some crime. Rule 403, Fed. R.Ev. The jury is entitled to know the \u201csetting\u201d of a case. It cannot be expected to make its decision in a void \u2014 without knowledge of the time, place and circumstances of the acts which form the basis of the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\"><em>United States v. Roberts, </em>548 F.2d 665, 667 (6th Cir. 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">Turning now to appellant Valdes we note that counsel for him asserts prejudicial error on his behalf in the District Judge\u2019s admission of witness, and coconspirator, Sadak\u2019s understanding of the meaning of the word \u201ctranslator\u201d employed in the tape recording Valdes asked him to take from Peru to Detroit and deliver to Gunningham. We find no rule of evidence or case law precisely in point on this issue. Our review of this issue convinces us that Sadak was an \u201cexpert\u201d in the murky recesses of the international drug traffic and that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the jury to hear Sadak\u2019s opinion that \u201ctranslators\u201d referred to cocaine in the context of the taped message.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Appellant Valdes\u2019 second claim of reversible error is founded upon alleged improper authentication of foreign documents which the government introduced to dispute appellant Valdes\u2019 claim that he was an attorney licensed to practice in Mexico. Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is made applicable to admission of foreign official records in a criminal trial by Rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This record indicates that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Judge carefully followed the present version of Rule 44 in admitting two rebuttal documents and in refusing to admit another.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Throughout the record of this case, we have noted the patient and thorough consideration given by the District Judge to every defense objection. We also have noted his many rulings in favor of exclusion of prejudicial evidence and his admonitions to the jury designed to see that they considered only the charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We do not suggest that this trial was error free \u2014 but we have yet to review a perfect jury trial, let alone one of this length. As to this (and all other complaints about admission or exclusion of evidence which we have not deemed meritorious enough to discuss), we find no abuse of judicial discretion and no error prejudicial to the rights of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Finally, we have reviewed with care the District Judge\u2019s charge in this complex case. We find it balanced, coherent and, taken as a whole, just to both the prosecution and the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"ACU\">Valdes</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">All of the taped phone calls pertaining to Valdes were obtained from Wire Interception # 1, a phone in the Keating Street house.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">On April 2, 1972, at 8:48 a. m., Valdes left the following message on a tape recorder answering device (Call # 312): [PCM = Valdes and PAF = Unidentified tape operator]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">PCM: Yes, Ed, would you give me a call at Lima as soon as you can, I have something important to tell you. Uh, call me at the usual number, 246928, and uh, uh, I\u2019ll wait for your call today.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">PAF: OK.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">On April 2, 1972, at 1:49 p.m., a phone call was made from the Keating Street phone to number 246928 in Lima. (Call # 340). In the following excerpt, Gun-ningham, at Keating Street is speaking to Valdes in Peru:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-17\">[PAM = Valdes and PCM(2) = Gunning-ham]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-18\">PAM: What\u2019s happening, brother?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">PCM(2): How are ya\u2019? I got your message.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-20\">PAM: Yes, well, we\u2019re, all ready on this end and the less we talk about it the better off we are.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-21\">PCM(2): Uh huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-22\">PAM: We\u2019re, uh, uh, in a, in a position to, to do it where we said way up there, no problems?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">PCM(2): All the way you mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">PAM: Huh?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-25\">PCM(2): You in a po-</p>\n<p id=\"b629-26\">PAM: No, not all the way, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-27\">PCM(2): Oh, the last spot that I talked to you about.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-28\">PAM: Yeh.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-29\">PCM(2): Uh huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-30\">PAM: That\u2019s all ready to go.

At this stage I think it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-35\">PCM(2): Yeh.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-36\">PAM: Because it\u2019s gonna be, uh [PCM(2): Here let me get] Kansas City if we don\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-37\">PCM(2): Do you want me to give you this guy\u2019s name and phone number that I got this letter from?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-38\">PAM: Uhm.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-39\">PCM(2): Or do you think it\u2019d be.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-40\">PAM: The only thing about that, I\u2019m worried about, are you sure it came from him?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-41\">PCM(2): Huh?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-42\">PAM: Are you sure it came from him?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>PCM(2): Oh, yeh. He wouldn\u2019t know the, uh, the information if it didn\u2019t, you know, what I mean, that\u2019s in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">PAM: The address is available here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">PCM(2): Yes, but, uh, not from Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">PAM: (Inaudible) he didn\u2019t know, huh?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">PCM(2): Huh? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">PAM: There were other things he didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">PCM(2): Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">PAM: OK.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">PCM(2): I mean just, just, uh, give him a phone call and tell him that you\u2019re, uh, calling for me and that, uh, uh, you\u2019ll get back with him, uh that I\u2019m not in a position right now to, to do anything but I\u2019m still interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">PAM: OK, what\u2019s his, what\u2019s the number?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">PAM: So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to, to come in or, or do you want to say yes or no on this or what?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">PCM(2): No, I say yes on it. Its being all taken care of right as of now, you know, Tuesday, uh, everything is being worked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">PAM: OK.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">PCM(2): Tell him that. Everything\u2019s being.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-18\">PAM: Well, uh, how do you want us to do the exchange, what do we do?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-19\">PCM(2): Well, what I should do is probably meet you say, uh, in Mexico City. ******</p>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">PAM: So that could put me in Mexico City over the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">PCM(2): That sounds good.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">PAM: OK, let\u2019s, let\u2019s do it then and, uh, the, the thing is you\u2019ve got the tape, [Defendant\u2019s version: Keep] right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">PCM(2): Yeh.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-24\">PAM: All right.

I\u2019ve looked at it from all angles, that\u2019s the best way to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-29\">PCM(2): That would be, that\u2019s okay with me as long as the, the, that one, the whole thing is to be transacted right there, its not to be transacted in Lima.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-30\">PAM: Yeh, well, I don\u2019t know if we can do that or not. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll uh, we\u2019ll work out the details.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-31\">PCM(2): Yeh, okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-32\">PAM: I doubt that.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-33\">PCM(2): Well, I hate to put up the thing before it gets to where.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-34\">PAM: I\u2019m stayin\u2019 on top of it, don\u2019t worry about that.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-35\">PCM(2): Yeh, okay, good enough then, uh, uh, work it out as of that, you know that, as of that way and, uh, possibly, uh, uh, a few more than what was actually calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-36\">PAM: All right, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll see what we can do.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-37\">PCM(2): Okay, and uh, I\u2019ll get back with you, try to be able to meet you this coming weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-38\">PAM: Allright, that\u2019ll be fine.

But a case has to start somewhere, and that\u2019s why, in a sort of building block situation, the law permits the prosecutor to put in some evidence subject to connecting it up later.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-26\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b635-27\">Now, I am permitting these recordings to be presented to you, subject to connection. That is to say, they may not be received as evidence against any of these defendants until the government has shown that a conspiracy has been proved. That is to say, until a conspiracy is shown, the statements and conversations of persons other than the defendants may not be used against the defendants, and that is for a very plain and simple reason. If the Jury finds that the defendants have knowingly and wilfully joined the alleged conspiracy, then whatever the conspiracy did or whatever the co-conspirators did, is binding on each of the parties who joined the conspiracy even though they may not have known of it at the time, or even though they may not have participated in the act or in the statement that was made. And the reason for that legally, is that if a conspiracy is shown\u2014 and it will be for you to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether or not the government does show that \u2014 then a partnership is formed between those who joined that conspiracy knowingly and consciously, and any of the acts of one partner to the conspiracy become the acts of all of the partners to a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-28\">So, with that caution, these conversations that are being presented to you and read to you are being received subject to that connection. I will have more to say on that in my final instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-29\">With those observations, then, I will admit government\u2019s Exhibits 350, 351, 352 and 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>As I will explain to you at the close of the case, those acts or statements must be in furtherance of the conspiracy, and must be a part of the conspiracy, as he correctly said, and that should be kept in mind, and I will instruct you further in that regard. So, these tapes are being provisionally accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Heretofore, I have talked to you about the law of conspiracy, and I will have, at the close of the case, a full explanation of all of the instructions as they apply to the manner and form of your deliberations. But as these tapes are being played, you have heard the defendants, through their counsel, state that they object to the introduction of these tapes as it applies to their clients, the defendants, because there has as yet, they urge, been no proof of the commission of the conspiracy itself. And you will recall that my rulings have been: subject to connection, the tapes may be played and heard by you.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Now, so that you are more fully informed at this stage in the trial as to what the meaning of these concepts or terms are, let me say to you that there are four essential elements that are required to be proved in order to establish the offense of conspiracy charged in this indictment against these defendants:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">First, that the conspiracy be described in the indictment was wilfully formed and was existing at or about the time alleged; second, that the defendants wilfully became members of the conspiracy; third, that one of the co-conspirators thereafter knowingly committed at least one of the overt acts charged in the indictment at or about the time and place alleged; and fourthly, that such overt act was knowingly done in furtherance of an object or purpose of the conspiracy as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Now, with regard to the acts or declarations of co-conspirators \u2014 and you\u2019ll recall that in the indictment the indictment contains reference to the allegations that there were other co-conspirators alleged, and you have been hearing tapes with regard to their conversations, and we arrive at this point: that these acts or statements that are passing between these other co-conspirators can only be received and considered by you against the defendants who are in trial here when the conspiracy has been shown and not before. That\u2019s why I have repeatedly said to you that these conversations are being listened to by you on a provisional basis, and that it is the responsibility of the government to show a conspiracy and that the defendants here on trial wilfully joined that conspiracy. And the four elements that I have just indicated to you will have to be shown to you beyond a reasonable doubt..</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Now, with regard to these tapes, these conversations, whenever it appears, beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence in the case that a conspiracy existed and that a defendant was one of its members, then the statements thereafter knowingly made and the acts thereafter knowingly done by any person likewise found to be a member; may be considered by the Jury as to the defendant found to be a member, even though the statements and acts may have occurred in the actions and without the knowledge of the defendants, provided such statements and acts were knowingly made and done during the continuance of such conspiracy and in furtherance of some object or purpose of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Otherwise, any admissions or incriminatory statements made or acts done outside of court by one person may not be considered as evidence against any person who was not present and did not hear the statement made or see the acts done.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Therefore, statements of any conspirator which are not in furtherance of the conspiracy or made before its existence or after its termination, may be considered as evidence only against the person making it. So, that when I say that these tapes are being taken subject to connection, it means that they have to be taken in that light and understood in that light, and I repeat that instruction to you again, as I have earlier: that this is being taken subject to these connections being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">* * * * * #</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-12\">.
