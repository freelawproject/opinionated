We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The relevant facts are discussed in <em>Smith v. Grimm, </em>534 F.2d 1346 (9th Cir. 1976). Briefly, Smith is an attorney who represented Grimm, on a contingent fee basis, in an action in which it was established that Grimm had been wrongfully discharged from the Air Force. Smith now seeks a declaration that he holds an attorney\u2019s lien on amounts of retirement pay the Air Force owes Grimm. Smith alleges that Grimm has refused to pay him 50% of the amounts recovered from the Air Force as agreed under the terms of the contingent fee agreement. We reversed a judgment in Smith\u2019s favor in <em>Smith v. Grimm, supra, </em>because we were unable to discern any basis of federal subject matter jurisdiction as to the individual defendants. We remanded the cause to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the action, but we stated, in an order denying a petition for rehearing and rejecting a suggestion for <em>en banc </em>rehearing, that \u201cnothing in this order is intended to preclude such amendment of allegations of federal jurisdiction as the trial court may deem proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">On remand, Smith filed a motion to amend his complaint. The District Court rejected each proposed jurisdictional amendment as inadequate and, as we have said, dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Alternatively, the court held that even if the allegations were sufficient to confer jurisdiction, leave to amend would be denied because Smith could not prevail on the merits against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">We agree with the district judge. Even if federal subject matter jurisdiction exists in this case under one or more of the proposed jurisdictional allegations, it was within the discretion of the district court to deny leave to amend when the amendment would be \u201cfutile\u201d because Smith could not prevail on the merits because of the Government\u2019s immunity. <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>Brennan v. University of Kansas, </em>451 F.2d 1287, 1289 (10th Cir. 1971); <em>Smith v. Grimm, supra </em>at 1351 n. 6 and 1352 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The only proposed allegation which might support subject matter jurisdiction over the claim against the Grimms was a contention that the suit \u201carises under\u201d 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a). That statute allows Air Force officers, under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Air Force, to assign their pay accounts \u201cwhen due and payable.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Smith cites no cases holding that an action by the assignee of an account allegedly assignable under 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a) \u201carises under\u201d that statute for the purposes of conferring federal question jurisdiction. Nor has our own research disclosed such a case. Moreover, we have already determined that the operation of the Anti-Assignment Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 203, is \u201ccollateral\u201d to this state law action and does not confer federal jurisdiction. <em>Smith v. Grimm, supra </em>at 1351. The statute upon which Smith now relies would, at most, carve out an exception to \u00a7 203 and raise, like that statute, federal questions \u201ctoo attenuated or collateral to provide jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\">. We would interpret the quoted phrase as referring to the time when obligations, such as salaries, would ordinarily become \u201cdue and payable\u201d in the first instance and not after becoming \u201cdue and payable\u201d as a result of subsequent litigations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
