The primary issue is whether there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings that Centeno (1) violated Section 8(a)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.Code, Section 158(a)(1), by interrogation and surveillance of employees, threats of reprisals against employees if they selected a union, and the granting of wage increases and other new benefits to discourage self-organization of its employees, and (2) also violated Section 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S. Code, Section 158(a)(3) and 158(a)(1), by discharging 10 employees because they supported unionization. Additionally, respondent Centeno raises a question as to whether the Board\u2019s order was overly broad, and hence improperly required the reinstatement of terminated employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Centeno is a family owned business composed of three grocery markets in San Antonio, Texas. In July, 1974, Retail Clerks Union, Local 455, began organizational efforts at Centeno\u2019s three stores, with the first meeting occurring on July 22. Within a few weeks of this meeting several employees were discharged. The Board found that the employees were fired because of their pro-union activity. This was supported by the testimony of the fired employees, and by the fact that most of the employees involved had signed union authorization cards. Centeno contends that the discharges occurred for good cause, and that the company was practically unaware of any union activity by the employees involved. The Administrative Law Judge, on the whole, credited the testimony of the employees, and discredited the testimony of the company, and found that Centeno had-violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision was reviewed by a three-member panel of the Board, pursuant to Section 3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S. Code, Section 153(b). The panel affirmed the ALJ\u2019s rulings, findings, and conclusions, with some slight modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">As we have stated, <em>Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>354 F.2d 707, 709 (5th Cir. 1966), \u201c[w]e cannot disturb the Board\u2019s choice if there is a fair conflict between the employer\u2019s testimony and a reasonable inference of discrimination.\u201d In view of the scope of our review of Board orders, we find the Board\u2019s affirmance of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions that the company\u2019s discharging of the involved employees was discriminatorily motivated is supported by substantial evidence, and is therefore conclusive. See <em>N.L.R.B. v. Link-Belt Co., </em>311 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368 (1941). The ALJ and the Board made legitimate credibility choices between conflicting versions of events, and drew legitimate inferences from the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We further find that the proposed order of the Administrative Law Judge, as amended by the Board, is both proper and not overly broad, and decline to disturb it. \u201cThe particular means by which the effects of unfair labor practices are to be expunged are matters \u2018for the Board not the courts to determine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>319 U.S. 533, 539, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 1218, 87 L.Ed. 1568, 1574 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-28\">. Reported at 220 NLRB No. 178.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b503-11\">GEE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AfUW\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">From the outset I emphasize the limited character of my disagreement with the majority of the court. The record, which chronicles a long hearing with sharply conflicting testimony from many witnesses, contains ample support for the conclusion that the opposition of the Centeno family and some of their supervisory employees to unionization crystallized into the commission of several unfair labor practices during Local 455\u2019s attempt to organize Centeno employees. My concern focuses upon what appears from the record and the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) \u2014 affirmed by the Board in all respects \u2014 to have been an almost uniform discrediting of company witnesses and crediting of Board witnesses, in some circumstances when even the cold record militates for the opposite result. The ALJ\u2019s access to demeanor evidence <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> normally places his credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>choices out of the reach of the reviewing court, but preservation of the utility and fairness of the administrative hearing requires that we decline to follow him on the rare occasion when he lists too far to either side. This appears to me to be that rare case, and since the majority would enforce the Board\u2019s order in its entirety, I must respectfully dissent from the grant of enforcement of the orders for reinstatement of Dolores M\u00edreles and Anita Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We have the power to resolve questions' of credibility against the choices made by the ALJ \u201cin a proper case,\u201d <em>NLRB v. American Art Industries, Inc., </em>415 F.2d 1223, 1227 (5th Cir. 1969),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> although it is difficult to articulate standards for determining just what constitutes a \u201cproper case.\u201d We have, for example, denied enforcement when the Board\u2019s order depended on acceptance of the testimony of two crucial Board witnesses and the hearing examiner had \u201cexpressed a theory of credibility that was so far foreign to that which he should have applied that \u2018[s]ound reason . require[] us to decline to go with the Exam-</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">iner . . . in crediting and discrediting testimony. <em>NLRB v. Florida Citrus Canners Cooperative, </em>311 F.2d 541, 543 (5th Cir. 1963), on remand from <em>NLRB v. Walton Mfg. Co., </em>369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962). Additionally, although an ALJ\u2019s uniform resolution of credibility questions in favor of Board witnesses and against company witnesses cannot of itself support a finding of improper bias vitiating his choices, <em>NLRB v. Pittsburgh Steamship Co., </em>337 U.S. 656, 659-60, 69 S.Ct. 1283, 1285, 93 L.Ed. 1602, 1606 (1949); <em>NLRB v. Bush Hog, Inc., </em>405 F.2d 755, 756 (5th Cir. 1968),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we have found that such a pattern of consistent credibility decisions at least justifies a closer scrutiny of the record than might otherwise be undertaken. <em>NLRB v. Walton Mfg Co., </em>286 F.2d 16, 21 (5th Cir. 1961), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962). Here the ALJ\u2019s written decision contains only one instance of discrediting the testimony of employees,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against a background of consistent crediting of Board witnesses at the expense of the company. Thus, closer scrutiny becomes appropriate here, and upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>application I find at least two of the reinstatement orders lacking in evidentiary support and thus unworthy of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The first of these concerns Dolores Mi-reles, a telephone operator in the courtesy booth of one of Centeno\u2019s stores. On July 22, 1974, she signed a union authorization card in a union meeting on the store parking lot after closing hours. She was discharged, at the direction of store manager Lansdale, when she reported to work on July 24. Lansdale and grocery manager Karam testified to Mireles\u2019 history of excessive talking to other employees and use of the telephone for personal calls, both hers and those of other employees; both testified that Lansdale had wanted to fire Mi-reles about six weeks before her actual discharge but that Karam had intervened and received permission to give her one more chance after a stern warning about personal phone calls and talking. Lansdale testified that the final decision to discharge her came after he observed a playful pushing and shoving incident between Mireles and a sackboy as she issued him a clean apron on the evening of July 23. Mireles denied that the apron incident occurred and initially denied that she had ever been warned about excessive talking or personal phone calls, although the latter testimony was undermined on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The ALJ found that assistant manager Jaramillo observed the union meeting at which Mireles signed her union authorization card and that he asked Mireles the next day whether she signed a card. Jar-amillo denied any such interrogation, but the ALJ found that he was trying to conceal what actually occurred and credited Mireles\u2019 account over Jaramillo\u2019s denial. From other circumstances,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he also found that Jaramillo informed Lansdale of Mi-reles\u2019 signing of the card, that Lansdale was a \u201cmost untrustworthy witness,\u201d that the apron incident was a total fabrication, and that \u201cLansdale gave much conflicting testimony he thought would help the Company\u2019s cause.\u201d Disbelieving Lansdale, Jar-amillo and Karam necessarily meant believing Mireles, whom the ALJ found to be an \u201chonest, forthright witness,\u201d when the record creates strong doubts in my mind concerning her testimony. The ALJ lauded her, for example, for being \u201cwilling to admit any of her shortcomings,\u201d including allowing other employees to make outgoing nonessential telephone calls not permitted by the manager. Aside from the fact that consistently breaking rules speaks as eloquently for dishonesty as for honesty, Mi-reles had earlier testified that she did <em>not </em>allow nonemergency phone calls after she became aware of the rules; backtracking and modifying testimony under such circumstances hardly makes her an \u201chonest, forthright witness.\u201d Much more of an eyeopener, pertinent to the ALJ\u2019s misapprehension of his duty in judging her credibility, is the following passage from his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">When subjected to lengthy, vigorous cross-examination, she even agreed with the counsel\u2019s characterization of a mistake in her pretrial affidavit as a \u201clie,\u201d although her testimony is clear that it was an unintentional error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">The questioning which led up to her admission of lying under oath went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATG\">Q: Ms. Mireles, were you ever warned by anybody . . . about excessive talking or misuse of the telephone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Q: At no time . . . were you warned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">She was then confronted with the transcript of her testimony in a Texas Employment Commission hearing on her request for unemployment benefits, during which she was asked if she had ever been \u201ccounseled\u201d (the questioner\u2019s word) concerning excessive talking and personal telephone use; she had replied, \u201cI was up at Mr. Karam\u2019s office one time, and he did <em>warn </em>me. It was a <em>warning </em>that there was a little too much talking going on.\u201d Cross-examination continued, with Mireles insisting first that Karam\u2019s statement had not amounted to a warning and then that it was not specifically directed at her. Eventually, she was read the following passage from her affidavit to the General Counsel of the NLRB:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">At no time during my employment was I told or warned by any supervisor to stop any type of conduct that would lead to my discharge. I was never verbally reprimanded by any supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">At no time did he [Karam] or anyone else tell or warn me about my breaking any of the rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">In response to a direct question, Mireles finally admitted that the last sentence quoted above was a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">I am wholly unable to conclude that the ALJ properly exercised his power to resolve credibility questions when he rehabilitated Ms. Mireles as a witness by pointing to an admitted incident of lying under oath. I am baffled by his apparent finding that her statement in the pretrial affidavit was a \u201cmistake\u201d and that \u201cher testimony is clear that it was an unintentional error.\u201d I find no testimony in the record \u2014 whether \u201cclear\u201d or otherwise \u2014 to the effect that the statement was a mistake or an unintentional error, and thus no evidentiary support for the ALJ\u2019s unequivocal assertion to that effect. The finding that Ms. Mireles was unlawfully discharged for specious reasons rested on the finding that her testimony was believable. The record displays a pattern of evasions and several belated admissions that prior statements of hers were less than accurate. Because I consider that the ALJ in crediting a witness on the basis of her admission of prior perjury \u201cexpressed a theory of credibility that was . . . far foreign to that which he should have applied,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Florida Citrus Canners Cooperative, </em>311 F.2d 541, 543 (5th Cir. 1963), I would deny enforcement of the order to reinstate Ms. Mireles with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">I also believe the ALJ and the Board took leave of the record in considering the firing of grocery checker Anita Gonzalez. She signed and delivered to a union representative her authorization card on July 24,1974; she was terminated on July 26. She testified, and the ALJ found, that July 25 was her day off and that she was called to president Centeno\u2019s office on July 26 and fired for telling other workers of the need for union seniority, using herself (and her recent change to night hours despite her 16 years with the store) as an example. The company\u2019s version of the firing was, of course, quite different. Reginaldo Trevino, a bread salesman whose route included the Centeno store where Ms. Gonzalez worked, testified that she was working on the evening of July 25 when he and his wife came through her checkstand with their groceries. In response to a routine \u201chow are you doing\u201d type of question, the salesman testified, Ms. Gonzalez launched into a venomous, cursing description of what she would like to see happen to president Centeno; after leaving the store, the salesman and his wife discussed the incident and decided that Centeno should know of it. The next day while servicing the store Mr. Trevino went to Centeno\u2019s office and informed him of the previous evening\u2019s episode. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Gonzalez was called into president Centeno\u2019s office and asked about her attitude. The \u201ctirade\u201d into which she then launched resulted in her dismissal. Trevino\u2019s, wife, who was under the Rule and thus not in the courtroom when he testified, corroborated his account with her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">The ALJ\u2019s explanation of why he chose to believe Ms. Gonzalez\u2019 version of the firing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>and disbelieve the Trevinos and Centeno illustrates his selective highlighting of supportive sections of some mixed-bag testimony while conveniently ignoring the almost-inseparable, less supportive parts and his undue emphasis on factors which provide only flimsy support for his choice. He found, for example, that the Trevinos\u2019 testimony was not convincing because it sounded \u201ccontrived,\u201d partly because Ms. Gonzalez was alleged to have used a quite vulgar Spanish expression in describing her wishes for Centeno, and because she was alleged to have said it \u201cwith a lot of malice in her heart.\u201d Of course, people ofttimes use vulgar expressions, in which case factual reporting must contain those same vulgar words (or, as here, their translations), and they often do so because they are angry, or have \u201ca lot of malice\u201d in their hearts. He noted also that the incident was not reported to president Centeno until a day later, but the Trevinos testified that it was not until after they got away from the unpleasant scene and discussed it that they decided that Centeno should be informed of it, and it was certainly understandable for Trevino to wait until the next day when his bread route would take him to the store three or four times rather than turning back to the store in the evening when they presumably had other places to go and president Cen-teno might not be in the store. The ALJ further noted that \u201cGonzalez is not accused of ever using such language, or cursing Centeno or the store, at any time before.\u201d He thus conveniently limited the objects of her cursing so as to exclude store manager Benavides, who, according to employee En-riqueta Vasquez, Gonzalez several times called \u201cjotinche\u201d (effeminate man) or \u201cjoto\u201d (queer) with appropriate embellishments. The ALJ stated that he had considered the testimony of Vasquez, who testified that \u201cshe never heard Gonzalez make any derogatory remarks about [president] Eloy Cen-teno or any of the Centeno family.\u201d Again, it is the omission that deafens; Vasquez also testified that she <em>did </em>see Gonzalez make bad, mocking faces behind Centeno\u2019s back on several occasions. Finally, the ALJ noted that Gonzalez denied seeing the Tre-vinos in the store on the day in question, but he passed over Mr. Trevino\u2019s identification of the check with which he paid for the groceries \u2014 strong evidence that he was indeed in the store. In short, the ALJ appears to have shored up a questionable choice in favor of Gonzalez\u2019 testimony by editing testimony of some witnesses and by using factors which as strongly support the conflicting testimony of the Trevinos and president Centeno as the testimony of Gonzalez. Discounting what I consider to have been the erroneous reasoning in the credibility area, I am unable to conclude with him that the firing of Ms. Gonzalez was on a pretext designed to cover up unlawful motivation. Accordingly, I would deny enforcement of the order to the extent that it requires her reinstatement with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The deference which we accord an Administrative Law Judge in cases such as this reflects our understanding of the undoubted advantage he possesses in hearing the witnesses, seeing their mannerisms, experiencing their fits and starts and evasions. But when his choices veer toward incredibility, we must cease to defer to them as sheltered credibility choices. Only by calling attention to his departures and refusing to enforce the Board\u2019s order to the extent it is based on such departures can we ensure that the administrative hearing fairly and efficiently serves its intended function. To that end I direct this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-13\">. <em>See NLRB v. Walton Mfg.
