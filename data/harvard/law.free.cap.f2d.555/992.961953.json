ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">John R. James Jr., challenges several evi-dentiary rulings in the wake of which he was convicted of possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His effort to exclude heroin seized from his jacket strikes us as misplaced,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but we agree that the lurid circumstances of his arrest were improperly placed before the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since we cannot characterize this error as harmless, we reverse the conviction and remand the ease for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">Application of the law to this case must needs rest on the ramiform and occasionally conflicting evidence adduced at James\u2019 trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Testimony by District of Columbia police officers Green and McMasters was substantially as follows. Late on the evening of November 4, 1975, while they were on \u201cold clothes\u201d detail, a passing 1961 Plymouth bearing taxicab markings excited their interest.' In their unmarked cruiser, the officers followed the Plymouth until it came to a halt, whereupon they pulled alongside. The officers alighted, as did the Plymouth\u2019s two occupants, and one\u2014 James \u2014 was perceived as making what was described at trial as \u201ca throw-a-way gesture\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> towards a nearby hedgerow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-19\">James and his companion, Clennon Burke, were asked to and did identify themselves.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At this point, so the officers testified, James abruptly volunteered that he had no \u201cdope,\" and in an apparent effort to convince displayed to them the contents of the glove compartment, ash tray and trunk of the Plymouth. Not content with this exhibition, James opened his jacket, then doffed it, but as he did the officers heard it brush the car with the clang of metal on metal. Officer McMasters testified that he asked James whether that signified a gun in the jacket; James replied in the negative and requested the officer to satisfy himself on that score. McMasters stated that he searched the coat and found various tools for narcotics distribution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but, as these carried no trace of contraband, they were, after some discussion of James\u2019 intentions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> replaced in the jacket. James and Burke went their way on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-20\">The officers\u2019 suspicions thus alerted, they reboarded their cruiser and embarked, but with doused lights circled back to take up a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>covert position for surveillance. They said that they then saw James and Burke drop behind the hedgerow and retrieve two silver objects, which James put in his jacket. With this, the officers set off, but as the cruiser approached James removed his jacket, balled it up and, as the officers watched, tucked it under the arm of William Giles, James\u2019 elderly uncle, who had suddenly appeared on the scene. The officers immediately addressed Giles, who unhesitatingly surrendered the garment to them just as James and Burke entered the nearby house of James\u2019 aunt, Giles\u2019 sister. When the bundle unraveled, revealing two tinfoil packets, the officers gave chase, entering the aunt\u2019s house only to find that James and Burke had exited at the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Certain particulars of the officers\u2019 version were vigorously disputed by James and Burke, both of whom testified. They recalled no mention of narcotics in their meeting with the officers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> claimed that the car search was permitted only upon demand and contended that no paraphernalia of any kind came to light. J\u00e1mes denied any \u201cthrow-a-way\u201d motion and both explained that the objects retrieved from the hedge were cigarette packs which, while the police were doubling back, had been tossed by Burke and fumbled by James.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defense theory was, essentially, that the narcotics paraphernalia taken from James\u2019 jacket, as well as a brown powder containing heroin which was found in the tinfoil packets, were \u201cplanted\u201d in the jacket after James had given up possession.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">The appropriation of the jacket by the officers and their subsequent examination of its contents occasioned a motion to suppress,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> from the failure of which James appeals. He concedes<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that probable cause to search the jacket had matured by the time it was seized but contends that the search was invalid \u201cbecause the police acted without a warrant.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus our question is \u201cwhether the police action was reasonable under all the circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and we have no difficulty in finding it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">The warrantless search could have been sustained had James been apprehended while still wearing the jacket,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or had James flung it on the pavement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>That the jacket had instead been passed on to Giles, who could have been either a dupe or a confederate, did not alter the need for swift action. In either event the officers, who had observed the transfer of the jacket, had ample grounds for suspecting that it contained evidence \u201cpeculiarly vulnerable to speedy and easily accomplished destruction,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and it was at the very least their duty to forestall that possibility. Moreover, seizure of the jacket, easily accomplished as it was,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was far less intrusive than immobilizing Giles until a warrant could be secured. It was the more reasonable in light of James\u2019 retreat, since the officers could thereby ascertain readily whether the game was worth the candle<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, if so, give chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">We find no fault with the course of action resulting in the seizure, and its fruits were properly admitted at trial. Had there been no more to this case, the officers\u2019 testimony concerning their initial encounter with and observation of James, taken together with the evidence we hold to have been legally seized, would readily have required affirmance of the convictions. Yet the Government did not content itself with that evidentiary presentation, but spread before the jury the debilitating and potentially prejudicial circumstances of James\u2019 subsequent arrest. To the consequences of that course of action we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">James was arrested in a drug raid on November 20, 1975, sixteen days after the events on which the indictment here was based. A squadron of police officers, confidentially informed that a cadre of supposedly armed citizens were gathering for a narcotics transaction, converged on an apartment, identified themselves, rushed through the door, and recovered a cache of contraband and a brace of weapons. James and another man, described at trial as \u201cwanted by the FBI and U.S. Marshall\u2019s [sic] Office,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> jumped out a third floor window into the arms of police, followed\u2014 through the window \u2014 by \u201ca quantity of heroin and other drugs and a pistol.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Burke was also apprehended in the raid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-16\">In James' pocket when he was arrested was a slip of paper bearing cryptic notations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Government introduced the slip at trial, but did not immediately undertake to explain how, if at all, it was probative of the offense with which James was charged. On cross-examination of Officer McMasters, however, defense counsel adduced from him his interpretation of the notations,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which in his estimation detailed a narcotics transaction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When defense counsel asked McMasters whether the symbols \u201c[c]ouldn\u2019t mean anything else,\u201d he replied that \u201c[t]here were a lot of other cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>cumstances surrounding the receipt of this piece of paper.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This exchange was seen by the trial judge as \u201copening the door\u201d for the prosecution\u2019s elicitation on redirect examination of a detailed account of the November 20 raid, which appears in the margin,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cbecause of the fact that the officer was questioned as to the meaning of the slip of paper. . . . He is entitled to take into consideration in making his evaluation of what was on that paper the surrounding circumstances. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Parts of the officer\u2019s account were later repeated in rebuttal of James\u2019 version of the November 20 raid.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">James claims that admission of the extensive testimony regarding the circumstances of his arrest was error. This is disputed by the Government, which contends also that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the theoretical inadmissibility of Officer McMasters\u2019 narration, defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to it by his inquiry into the meaning of the note \u2014 the position to which the trial judge subscribed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Speaking first to that narrower issue, we disagree that McMasters\u2019 reportage was invited by defense counsel. Ordinarily, evidence inadmissible to prove the case-in-chief is rendered admissible only if \u201cthe defendant himself introduces the evidence or is in some manner estopped from objecting to its use.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A defendant may not, for instance, deny that he had ever possessed narcotics, or make similarly sweeping claims going \u201cbeyond a mere denial of complicity in the crimes of which he was charged\u201d,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> without running the risk that \u201cbad acts\u201d testimony<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or even illegally-obtained evidence<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> will be introduced in rebuttal. After all, \u201c[t]he price a defendant must pay for attempting to prove his good name is to throw open the entire subject which the law has kept closed for his benefit and to make himself vulnerable where the law otherwise shields him.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>There is, however, a fine line between trial conduct spreading new vistas before the inquiring eyes of the jury and that which seeks further to explore previously discovered terrain.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The defense in this case hewed closely to that line. The writing itself was already in evidence; had counsel solicited from McMasters no more than a recitation of the notations, no new issues would have been presented the trier of fact. As it was, such a declamation would have been incomprehensible, and so the officer was requested to extend the various abbreviations. James\u2019 attorney did inquire as to whether an alternative reading was possible, but a potential for ambiguity was no more than the sparseness of the note fairly suggested. Defense counsel expressed or implied nothing about the circumstances of James\u2019 arrest,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> which, though they may have provided some foundation for Officer McMasters\u2019 explication, were under the circumstances no more invited than testimony that his rendering was based on the defendant\u2019s criminal record or reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">If the story of James\u2019 arrest was properly before the jury, therefore, it must be by virtue of Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-11\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">As illuminated by its legislative history<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that rule countenances admission of \u201cbad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>acts\u201d evidence that is relevant to any material issue in the case<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> except to show the likelihood that, having once fallen into sin, a second slip is likely.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Only one other condition is imposed on the proponent of such evidence: \u201cits probative virtues must outweigh its prejudicial proclivities\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> in order to satisfy the strictures of Rule 403.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> To determine the admissibility of Officer McMasters\u2019 narrative regarding James\u2019 arrest, then, we must ascertain first the use to which it might logically have been put and next the balance that possibly could be struck between its probative value in that role and its inflammatory impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">The essential elements of the offense with which James\u2019 was charged<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> were the (a) knowing (b) possession of heroin with (c) intent to distribute it.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> These were the only <em>facta probanda</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 facts in issue \u2014 in the case, for James raised no affirmative defenses. The circumstances of his arrest suggest little about whether he had heroin in his jacket sixteen days earlier, unless the impermissible inference be drawn that he had been associated with the drug once \u2014 during passage through the third story window \u2014 so it probably was not his first encounter with that evil. Nor does it prove very much about his pharmacological expertise, for the drugs discovered on November 20 \u2014 the date of the raid \u2014 were, so far as the record reveals, never linked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>him. In any event, there was no dispute about whether he would know heroin if he saw it.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">The issue thus resolves itself into whether James\u2019 presence in an apartment in which were found substantial quantities of heroin is probative of an intent to distribute other heroin sixteen days earlier. Granting that a person found in that situation might be more likely so to contemplate,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> such an inference is so weak as to bring into serious question whether its contribution to the accuracy of the trial process outweighed the likelihood that its dramatic flavor would derange it.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">Evidence of a prior crime \u201cis always . . prejudicial to a defendant. It diverts the attention of the jury from the question of the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the crime charged to the improper issue of his bad character.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Particularly is that true here,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> where testimony of subsequent intimacy with narcotics is aggravated by the addition of the sordid incidentals of that relationship. Officer McMasters\u2019 account included damaging double hearsay relating to narcotics sales; it was freighted with guns, violent action and a wanted man. In the wake of, and predicated upon, this scenario the jury was exposed not only to James\u2019 attempt to explain his role, but also to a reprise of the officer\u2019s story \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>rebuttal\u201d; and was informed as well that Burke, the principal defense witness, had been arrested at the same time. Given the slight probative force of this evidence, and its obvious potential for prejudice, we perceive no balance on which it properly could have been admitted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>The large majority of persons of average intelligence are untrained in logical methods of thinking, and are therefore prone to draw illogical and incorrect inferences, and conclusions without adequate foundation. From such persons jurors are selected. They will very naturally believe that a person is guilty of the crime with which he is charged if it is proved to their satisfaction that he has committed a similar offense, or any offense of an equally heinous character. And it cannot be said with truth that this tendency is wholly without reason or justification, as every person can bear testimony from his or her experience that a man who will commit one crime is very liable subsequently to commit another of the same description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>We are cognizant that \u201cit is not the appellate court\u2019s function ... to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out\u201d;<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> such judgments diminish the jury\u2019s traditional role.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Appellate assessment of the harm devolving from errors at trial properly looks rather to the \u201cimpact of the thing done wrong on the minds of other men, not on one\u2019s own, in the total setting.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Our office extends only to determining whether we can say \u201cwith fair assurance . . . that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> for otherwise the conviction cannot stand. We harbor no such assurance here. The Government\u2019s success hinged in several respects upon its ability to convince the jury that James and the witness Burke were mendacious, so that contradictions between their testimony and that of the police might be resolved in favor of the latter. Admission of the testimony concerning James\u2019 arrest may crucially have affected the jury\u2019s estimate on that score,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and that possibility impels us to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">.

Several parties, including the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Justice and the American Bar Association, expressed concern that the 1971 draft implicitly bestowed on trial judges discretion to exclude \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence for reasons unspecified in any other rules.
