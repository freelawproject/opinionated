This case was heard before Trial Judge Thomas J. Lydon, who has submitted a recommended decision and conclusion of law, proposing a recovery for Missouri Baptist of $120,292, based on the Government\u2019s failure to make repairs to the building at the termination of the lease. Recovery was denied to the Government for its two asserted counterclaims. A belated claim by the plaintiff was also denied. Both parties excepted to the trial judge\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">After briefing and oral argument, it is determined that we cannot adopt the full decision recommended by the trial judge, as we find the damages to have been reached under an erroneous legal standard. We hold that where the cost of repair of leased premises exceeds the diminution of the leasehold\u2019s fair market value, it is error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to apply as the measure of damages owed the lessor, the \u201ccost of repair\u201d standard rather than the diminution in value standard. We further hold that plaintiff had the burden of proof in this case to show not only the cost of repairs, but also the diminution in fair market value, so as adequately to prove his true damages. Plaintiff failed in this regard, and cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">That portion of the trial judge\u2019s decision denying defendant\u2019s counterclaims and denying plaintiff\u2019s belated claim is adopted by the court and included with this opinion, <em>infra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In 1958, prior to the execution of the lease in question, plaintiff operated a hospital in the downtown area of the City of St. Louis. Because of the declining condition of the neighborhood, the age of the building, and the expense of renovation, plaintiff built a new hospital in the suburbs. In early 1965, plaintiff began to phase out the old hospital. By December 81,1965, the old hospital was vacated and remained vacant until July 1,1966. Plaintiff was unsuccessful in attempting to sell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In October 1965, the Job Corps, Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) began studies to determine the suitability of the old hospital as a site for a Job Corps Center for Women. Although the building had its shortcomings, in June 1966, OEO finally decided to utilize the old hospital. OEO entered into a cost-plus type of contract with Delta Corporation (Delta) to operate a Women\u2019s Job Corps Center. In June 1966, Delta leased the old hospital from plaintiff at an annual rental of $125,000 for a term of 38 months, ending August 31,1969. Delta spent over $600,000 in repairing and rehabilitating the building. During the period the Center was operating, the maintenance and repair costs were extremely high \u2014 between $75,000 and $80,000 per year because of the age of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The Job Corps Center for Women was closed in June 1969. Delta assigned the lease to the Department of Labor (Labor) which had absorbed this portion of OEO. Plaintiff and Labor amended the lease to provide for a month-to-month tenancy, commencing September 1, 1969, at a reduced rental. The building was used for temporary storage of Job Corps personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">In early January 1970, Labor decided to terminate the lease and vacate the building by January 31, 1970. Some areas of the building were not adequately maintained and repaired and, therefore, at the termination of the lease, <em>the building was not delivered to plaintiff in good condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, as required by the lease provisions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Plaintiff brought this action to <em>recover </em>damages arising from defendant\u2019s failure to deliver the premises in good condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, at the termination of the lease. Plaintiff alleged in the petition that defendant\u2019s breach of the lease damaged plaintiff\u2019s property \u201cas a result of which the <em>value </em>of such property <em>was diminished </em>by the sum of One Million Dollars * * * \u201d (Petition, p. 9) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">The trial judge, applying the <em>cost of repair as the measure </em>of damages, held that plaintiff was entitled to recover $120,292.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In reaching this award, the trial judge stated that plaintiff\u2019s witness did not take into consideration in his repair cost estimate any allowance for reasonable wear and tear arising from the use of the building as contemplated by the lease. Consequently, the repair estimate figure was reduced by fifty percent (50%) as an allowance for reasonable wear and tear. Plaintiff contends that the finding that plaintiff\u2019s witness failed to take wear and tear into consideration was contrary to the evidence in the record. Alternatively, plaintiff urges that even if the witness did <em>not </em>take wear and tear into consideration, the use of a 50% reduction factor was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">From our analysis of the record, it is conceivable that plaintiff\u2019s exceptions contain certain merit. However, since we hold for the Government on the issue of burden of proof, and that in this case, diminution of value is the proper measure of damages, we need not reach plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">This brings us to defendant\u2019s exceptions. The Government maintains that the proper measure of damages in this case is not the \u201ccost of repair,\u201d but diminution in the fair market value caused by the acts of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">The Government further argues that plaintiff has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the fair market value of the leasehold property was diminished by the Government\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of the lease. The Government introduced expert testimony that the property had no value on January 31, 1970.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the defendant also argues a total failure of proof by the plaintiff of value of the property on June 24, 1966, defendant alleges that plaintiff cannot show it actually suffered damage by virtue of defendant\u2019s breach of the lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">The nature of the Government\u2019s two counterclaims and the plaintiff\u2019s belated additional claim are adequately explained and dealt with by the trial judge, and that portion of his opinion dealing with these issues is printed after the Government\u2019s principle exceptions are reviewed in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Preliminarily, the Government has conceded that it breached, in part, various provisions of the lease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We need not spell out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>in detail each of these infractions \u2014 suffice it to say that the Government failed to return the property to the lessor in the manner and condition prescribed by the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The Government relies on cases such as <em>Bowes v. Saks &amp; Co., </em>397 F.2d 113 (7th Cir. 1968); <em>Dodge Street Building Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 F.2d 641, 169 Ct.Cl. 496 (1965); <em>Spitzel v. United States, </em>146 Ct.Cl. 399 (1959); <em>Realty Associates, Inc. v. United States, </em>138 F.Supp. 875, 134 Ct.Cl. 167, (1956); and <em>Eaddy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>139 F.Supp. 49, 134 Ct.Cl. 338 (1956) to support its contention that the measure of damages for breach of a covenant to return the leased premises to the lessor in its original condition, is not the cost of repair <em>where such cost exceeds the diminution in fair market value of the premises.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Plaintiff strenuously urges that these cases concern cost of restoration clauses and not cost of repair clauses; that costs to restore are not the same as costs to repair premises; and that a contrary rule should apply in repair cases. We disagree, and hold for defendant except with regard to its two counterclaims, which we deny pursuant to the trial judge\u2019s opinion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The overall purpose of the aforementioned measure of damages rule, as we see it, is to avoid windfall recoveries. This was well stated in <em>Associated Stations, Inc. v. Cedars Realty &amp; Development Corp., </em>454 F.2d 184, 188 (4th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">The object of damages in a contract case is to restore the plaintiff to the position he would have been in had the contract not been breached. (Footnote omitted.) The \u201ccost of restoration\u201d method is one convenient way of determining the amount of damages to be awarded the plaintiff where a breach had occurred. There are, however, certain situations where this method of computing damages does not restore the plaintiff to the position he would have been in had the contract not been breached, but rather places him in a better position, thus providing him with a windfall. In those cases, courts have resorted to alternative methods of computing damages in order to insure that, as far as possible, the plaintiff neither loses nor benefits from the breach. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The purpose of avoiding windfall recoveries is no less well served in a <em>cost of restoration </em>situation than in a <em>cost of repair </em>situation. A familiar example will illustrate. A broken $10 watch might take $30 worth of repair work to fix, whereas its diminution in value could at most be $10. A $30 recovery from an imaginary watch-lessee who caused the watch to break could inspire the plaintiff to discard the broken, watch, purchase a new one for $10, and realize a windfall of $20.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">We note that the authorities have in the past used <em>repair </em>and <em>restoration </em>interchangeably. In <em>Associated Stations, Inc. v. Cedars Realty &amp; Development Corp., supra </em>at 186, n.3, for example, the terms of the lease clearly provide that the lessee would be responsible for the costs of repair. Yet in his opinion, Judge Winter speaks of \u201ccost of restoration\u201d as being subject to a ceiling set by \u201cdiminution in market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">In <em>Bowes v. Saks &amp; Company, </em>397 F.2d 113, 116-17 (7th Cir. 1968), a restoration case, the court held that \u201ccost of repairs\u201d is a convenient way to quantify \u201ccosts of restoration\u201d within the facts of that case. As such, it held the cost of repairs subject to diminution in market value. We quote at length from that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">In the ordinary lessor\u2019s suit for breach of a covenant to restore, the lessor is entitled to damages he actually suffers. Two rules are commonly applied to measure these damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">\u2018A lessee who breaches a provision of the lease requiring him to make certain repairs or to deliver up the premises at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the termination of the lease in a certain condition is liable in damages for the reasonable cost of making such repairs or of putting the premises in the condition prescribed by the lease.\u2019 <em>Crystal Concrete Corp. v. Town of Braintree, </em>309 Mass. 463, 470, 35 N.E.2d 672, 675 (1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">This is the general rule. However, it is not an absolute rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u2018But the plaintiff is not to be put in a better position than it would have been if the defendant had performed the terms of the lease. The location and character of the demised premises must be considered; and the reasonable cost of repairs, in some instances, would furnish the proper measure of damages while, in other instances, the value of the premises may be such that the in-currence of expense for repairs would not be a reasonable, practical or economic method of dealing with the property. Such expense might greatly exceed any diminution of the fair market value of the land that was caused by the defendant\u2019s nonperformance of the provisions of the lease.\u2019 <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Cost of repairs is merely a convenient way to quantify the damage a lessor has suffered. Where the facts indicate that cost of repairs is unrelated to lessors\u2019 actual damage, the rule is not applied. <em>Pennsylvania Cement Co. v. Bradley Contracting Co., </em>11 F.2d 687, 688 (2d Cir. 1926) (L. Hand, J.).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u2018In an action for breach of contract, as opposed to a suit sounding in specific performance, the lessor is entitled only to the damages that were caused to the property by the failure to restore. Where the expense of restoration exceeds the diminution in the market value of the property caused by the lessee\u2019s nonperformance, the diminution in fair market value is the proper measure of damages.\u2019 <em>Dodge Street Building Corp. v. United States, </em>341 F.2d 641, 644, 169 Ct.Cl. 496 (1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">If the \u2018cost of repair\u2019 rule will give lessors a greater benefit than could be gained from full performance, a different measure of damages must be applied to avoid injustice. <em>Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co., </em>382 P.2d 109, 113 (Okla.1963). <em>Accord, Giordano v. Brandywine Mushroom Corp., 32 </em>Pa.Dist. &amp; Co. R.2d 522, 525-26 (1963). <em>And see Realty Associates v. United States, </em>138 F.Supp. 875, 134 Ct.Cl. 167 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Our purpose in showing the interrelationship between <em>cost of restoration </em>and the <em>cost of repair </em>is to show that plaintiff assuredly cannot be \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d by our holding that cost of repair recoveries are limited by the diminution in fair market value ceiling. The issue was squarely before plaintiff at all stages of the trial, as was the line of cases we have cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Therefore, in spite of plaintiff\u2019s arguments to the contrary, we find no persuasive reason that repair costs should not be, as restoration costs are, subjected to a ceiling of the diminution in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The importance of this rule is accentuated by the peculiar facts in the case at bar. The trial judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s difficulty in ultimately selling or re-leasing the property after the Government\u2019s tenancy was due in part to factors other than the damage which is the subject of this suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Missouri Baptist was in a deteriorating area of St. Louis, and was continually subjected to acts of vandalism. If for the moment we assume that the value of the property was greatly diminished by these and other outside factors, then perhaps the diminution in value, if any, <em>due to the Government\u2019s breach </em>was comparatively small, accentuating the windfall nature of a \u201ccost of repair\u201d recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">We hold that repair costs are subjected to a ceiling. That ceiling is the diminution in fair market value attributable to defendant\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The Government argues that at trial, plaintiff failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the fair market value of the premises was diminished by the Government\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of the lease. The Government notes that it provided an expert witness at trial who testified that the fair market value of the premises on the \u201cday in\u201d (June 24, 1966) was zero. This same expert witness testified that the fair market value of the premises on the \u201cday out\u201d (January 31,1970) was zero. Unrebutted, argues the Government, the zero evidence for both \u201cday in\u201d and \u201cday out\u201d leaves no room for any diminution in fair market value, so plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The Government cites <em>Dodge Street Building Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 F.2d 641, 645, 169 Ct.Cl. 496, 501, (1965) to demonstrate that plaintiff failed in its burden at trial and should thereby be denied recovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">. it was incumbent upon plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the fair market value of the building in the condition in which defendant had covenanted to restore it, was greater than its fair market value in an unrestored state at the termination of the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">This case stands for the clear proposition that when plaintiff comes to trial, he bears a dual burden. He <em>must </em>first of all show what the cost of restoration (in this case, cost of repair) is. Thereafter, in order to benefit by the full measure of cost of repair, plaintiff must show that the diminution in fair market value exceeds the cost of repair.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, recovery based on the cost of repairs is subject to an absolute ceiling of \u201cdiminution in fair market value.\u201d Here, plaintiff only carried half its burden. Cost of repairs were shown in considerable detail. Diminution in value was virtually ignored. Plaintiff simply failed to meet and carry its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">However, the Government did not ignore the two-fold burden. Defendant steadfastly maintained its \u201cdiminution in fair market value ceiling\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The trial judge wrongly decided that diminution in fair market value was not a determining factor in awarding damages. However, the plaintiff was well aware of the Government\u2019s theory of the case. Had the trial judge ruled properly in this regard, plaintiff could have lost the case on insufficiency of evidence. At the very least, plaintiff should have laid the basis for protecting its case on appeal. As will be discussed fully, <em>infra, </em>plaintiff did not introduce sufficient evidence to support a finding of fact on fair market value of the property for either the day in or the day out. Plaintiff further did not except to Finding 22(c)[sic][d] as required by Rule 143(d). Finding 22(c)[sic][d] stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">There is no convincing evidence in the record on which one could reasonably determine what the fair market value of the Hospital property was in June 1966 or in January 1970.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Further, at oral argument, the plaintiff never availed itself of the opportunity to request submission of supplemental briefing or affidavits (showing fair market value) even after it became apparent that the court was gravely concerned about the relative absence of plaintiff\u2019s evidentiary showing. Finally, plaintiff never even pressed the court to consider remanding the case to the trial judge for further evidentiary proceedings on the diminution in fair market value issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">In the case at bar, the Government introduced market value evidence which should have made it clear to plaintiff that its theo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ry was the diminution m value ceiling, and yet plaintiff \u2014 aware that were the Government correct, plaintiff would not have met its burden \u2014 did not provide appropriate evidence to protect its case. Plaintiff was on notice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since it plainly could have introduced evidence to \u201ccover\u201d itself in case the Government\u2019s theory proved to be correct, and chose not to do so, we do not feel constrained to remand the case for further findings, thus giving plaintiff a \u201csecond bite at the apple.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We now turn to an analysis of the evidence of diminution in fair market value received in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The evidence the Government introduced was opinion evidence of Arthur C. Schneider, a real estate appraiser. Mr. Schneider testified from a report he prepared November 19, 1974 that on the \u201cday in,\u201d the fair market value of the property was zero. Mr. Schneider further testified that on the \u201cday out,\u201d the fair market value of the property was, again, zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Mr. Schneider (hereafter Mr. Schneider, Jr.) had visited the site in July 1966 with his father (hereafter Mr. Schneider, Sr.). Mr. Schneider, Sr. had been hired to appraise the property pursuant to the Economy Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 278a (1970). The rental figure agreed to by the parties had to be less than <em>15% </em>of the appraised fair market value. Mr. Schneider, Jr. once again visited the site in August 1969, this time as an appraiser (as versus an observer, as was his position in July 1966) for a private concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">To eapsulize, Mr. Schneider, Jr.\u2019s opinion evidence of zero value at \u201cday in\u201d was based upon his eight-year-old recollections of conditions existing when he accompanied his father in 1966. His finding of zero value on \u201cday out\u201d was based on his own appraisal (five months prior to \u201cday out\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">The plaintiff relies on Mr. Schneider, Sr.\u2019s 1966 appraisal of $1.2 million, (Government\u2019s exhibit # 1) to evidence value on \u201cday in.\u201d It relies on a letter evidencing a possible $500,000 offer in 1969 for the property to show evidence of value on \u201cday out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">Considering first the conflicting \u201cday in\u201d evidence, it appears to us that the trial judge correctly determined that the evidence was inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">First, Mr. Schneider, Jr.\u2019s zero value evidence is, according to the trial judge\u2019s Finding 22b, \u201cbased on his July 1966 site visit and utilized] a lot of the data contained in his father\u2019s appraisal report.\u201d Mr. Schneider\u2019s 1974 report then is based on memory of events eight years past, and though using Mr. Schneider, Sr.\u2019s data, comes out with a glaring discrepancy in appraised value.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">Mr. Schneider, Sr. determined the fair market value to be $1.2 million. The trial judge found this $1.2 million figure unreliable. As Trial Judge Lydon points out, the Economy Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 278a (1970) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-16\">. .. any rental cost to be reimbursable to Delta could not exceed 15 percent of the fair market value of the rented premises. The qualified appraiser, deceased at the time of trial, was of the opinion the property had a fair market value of $1,200,000. This rounded-off figure consisted of $1,172,949 for the improvements and $48,800 for the land. The evidence of record fails to persuade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that this opinion represents a reasonable indication of the fair market value of the building and property in July 1966. The appraisal was made specifically for the purpose of supporting a rental figure which, to be reimbursable, must fall within a certain range. Further, the basis for the value opinion on the improvements was not comparable sales but depreciated reproduction costs, a most unsatisfactory fair market value approach. <em>See Schoef-fel v. United </em>States, 193 Ct.Cl. 923, 936 (1971). <em>See also, Westchester County Park Commission v. United States, </em>143 F.2d 688, 693 (2d Cir. 1944), <em>cert, denied, </em>323 U.S. 726 [65 S.Ct. 59, 89 L.Ed. 583]. Accordingly, there is no reliable evidence in the record as to the fair market value of the old building in June \u2014 July 1966. (Trial Judge Opinion at 17-18, n.4)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">This quote shows that despite the theoretical correlation between the 1966 opinion of the appraiser and the rental payments, the actual fair market value may well have been significantly less.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Based upon Mr. Schneider, Jr.\u2019s appraisal which we feel may be flawed due to the passage of time and the related potential lapse in memory, the glaring discrepancy in values grounded on much of the same raw data (as contained in Mr. Schneider, Sr.\u2019s report) and the problems with Mr. Schneider, Sr.\u2019s opinion itself, we agree that no reasonable determination of fair market value on the \u201cday in\u201d can be gleaned from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Turning now to evidence of fair market value at \u201cday out,\u201d we have Mr. Schneider, Jr.\u2019s appraisal of zero value presented by the Government, and the letter evidencing a possible offer of $500,000 in 1969 presented by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Mr. Schneider, Jr.\u2019s appraisal for \u201cday out\u201d is not subjected to the same infirmity which weakens his \u201cday in\u201d appraisal. Here, the appraisal was his <em>own, </em>performed at a date near the actual \u201cday out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The trial judge relied on a letter in the record to dispute Mr. Schneider\u2019s testimony concerning zero value on \u201cday out.\u201d Unfortunately, the letter was wrongfully received and wrongfully used. In Finding 12a, the trial judge finds that the Board of Trustees of the Hospital received a letter from Edward L. Presnell which essentially stated that Mr. Presnell had a client who <em>\u201cmay </em>still be interested in offering $500,000 all cash . . . \u201d for the property, (emphasis added) This evidence, in its present form, is inadmissible to establish value. In <em>Sharp v. United States, </em>191 U.S. 341, 349, 24 S.Ct. 114, 115, 48 L.Ed. 211 (1903), the Supreme Court concisely stated the reasons why offers (such as this one, and Presnell\u2019s letter does not even rise to the dignity of an offer) are not admissible to establish value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGq\">It is frequently very difficult to show precisely the situation under which these offers were made. In our judgment they do not tend to show value, and they are unsatisfactory, easy of fabrication and even dangerous in their character as evidence .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Since the letter was inadmissible to determine fair market value, it was both improperly admitted and improperly used as a countervalent to Mr. Schneider\u2019s testimony concerning zero fair market value at the \u201cday out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">We therefore find, based on the record in this case, that Mr. Schneider\u2019s evidence of zero value on \u201cday out\u201d is not contradicted. We are satisfied that the fair market value on day out was zero, and so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">We note at this point that \u201czero value at day out\u201d could have been found by the trial judge. In view of this possibility, we are further at a loss to see why plaintiff at least did not present evidence of his own for a fair market value at \u201cday in.\u201d Had there been any credible proof of \u201cday in\u201d fair market value, when compared with zero value \u201cday out\" finding, at least <em>some </em>recovery might be allowed. In fact, were the \u201cday in\u201d value (discounting vandalism and ordinary wear and tear) higher than the cost of repairs in this case, a full cost of repair recovery could have been allowed. It must be remembered, that if the \u201cdiminution in fair market value\u201d attributable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the breach exceeds the \u201ccost of repair\u201d measurement of damages, the entire \u201ccost of repair\u201d may be awarded. In any event, \u201ccost of repair\u201d damages are the maximum recovery one can receive, regardless of the diminution in value <em>(See, </em>\u201cwatch example,\u201d <em>supra </em>at p. 294).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">Plaintiff, at oral argument, said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">. [T]he reason why plaintiff did not attempt to produce an appraiser to say what this building was worth at the beginning of the lease and what it was worth at the end of the lease was that the beginning of the lease was some four years prior to the termination date in January 1970. And we felt that no appraiser could get on a witness stand and competently testify that this building had X value back in 1966. And we also cross-examined the Government\u2019s witness quite heavily on this same issue, particularly since the individual had not even attempted to appraise it but had been with his father on an inspection tour back in 1966. At the time that we talked to appraisers there was no building left to appraise. And for the same obvious reason you can\u2019t ask an appraiser to get on the witness stand and say this building was worth X dollars on such and such date if no building was there to appraise impossible burden</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">We are not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument. It is a common occurrence for appraisers to give opinions even where the appraised property no longer exists, using such indices as sales of other property in the neighborhood, etc. We find no persuasive excuse for plaintiff\u2019s failure to have carried his burden of proof. <em>Dodge Street Building Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We are thus left with the following situation: Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden of proof at trial. The trial judge properly found no conclusive evidence of value on \u201cday in; \u201d we find a zero fair market value on \u201cday out.\u201d Plaintiff, by failing to except to the trial judge\u2019s finding of no evidence of value (it could have excepted saying Mr. Schneider, Sr.\u2019s $1.2 million appraisal was conclusive) cannot contest the finding. Rule 143(d). <em>See, General Electric Co. v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 1320, 1322, 189 Ct.Cl. 116, 118 (1969). Plaintiff never pressed for a remand, never offered to file supplemental briefs or affidavits, or even attempted to except to the finding at as late a stage as oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The court also notes at this juncture that the case for denying plaintiff \u201cremand relief\u201d is very strong here. It has been held in <em>S.O.G. of Arkansas v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 4-75 (Order, March 4, 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A58\">Where a new subject is brought into the case by questions at oral argument [and in the case at bar, the \u201cdiminution in value\u201d theory was hardly new] a party which feels that the record or briefing as they stand, inadequately present its position on that matter shall so inform the court at the argument or promptly thereafter. <em>[Citing General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>416 F.2d 1320, 1321-22, 189 Ct.Cl. 116, 117-18 (1969).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">We therefore hold that plaintiff failed to carry its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">This concludes our discussion of the major issues raised by the parties. We now turn to issues raised in the various counterclaims of the parties. Since we hold that the trial judge properly decided them in Part III of his opinion, we adopt that portion. It follows hereafter:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">OPINION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</p>\n<author id=\"Aqn\">LYDON, Trial Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">Part III</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Defendant\u2019s first counterclaim is based on the following pertinent provisions of the <em>Repair and Maintenance </em>clause (Article XIII) of the lease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">* * * Repair costs for a single undertaking exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) shall be deemed a major repair and the costs thereof in excess of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) shall be born [sic] by the Lessor. In no event shall the Lessor be required to pay more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for any twelve (12) month period of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>lease. Any repairs costing in excess of said amounts (aggregating Six Thousand Dollars ($6,000.00)) within any twelve (12) month period of the lease, will be at the sole expense of the Lessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Defendant contends that in three separate 12-month periods, defendant (or Delta as assignor lessee) incurred major repair costs in excess of $6,000. During these three 12-month periods, defendant alleges plaintiff failed to meet the obligations placed on it by the above-quoted provision of the lease, <em>i. e., </em>paying for its share of major repair costs, such that it is now indebted to defendant in the sum of $13,-478.71 for breach of said lease requirement. The three 12-month periods in question were: (1) July 1, 1966-June 30, 1967; (2) July 1, 1968-June 30, 1969; and (3) July 1, 1969-January 31, 1970. It is significant to note that plaintiff paid Delta $5,000 under the above-quoted lease provision for repairs made by Delta during the period July 1, 1967-June 30,1968. It is important to keep in mind that the provision, <em>supra, </em>concerns \u201cRepair costs\u201d and does not embrace other nonrepair-type costs incurred by Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">During the period July 1, 1966-June 30, 1967, Delta incurred costs of some $22,-484.54. These costs involved painting the exterior of the building and performing work relating to heating, air conditioning, elevators and plumbing. Delta made no request of plaintiff for cost contribution under the provision of the lease under consideration. This failure of Delta to request cost contribution generates an inference that said costs were not considered \u201cRepair costs\u201d contemplated by the lease provision in issue. This inference has support in the fact that in the follow-on period, July 1, 1967-June 30,1968, Delta, when it incurred \u201cRepair costs\u201d considered to be within the purview of the lease provision, billed plaintiff for cost contribution under said lease provision and was paid by plaintiff. These costs in the total amount of $8,246 involved <em>repairs </em>(emphasis supplied) to walk-in refrigerators, heat exchange and exterior brick walls of the building. Further, in February, 1969, plaintiff advised Delta that under the lease provision in question \u201crepair costs * * * was intended to mean major repair and not operating maintenance.\u201d Neither Delta nor defendant disputed this interpretation at any time. Defendant has not disputed this interpretation in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">During the period July 1, 1968-June 30, 1969, Delta incurred repair costs of $9,258. Delta billed plaintiff in April 1969 for $5,000 representing its cost contribution relative to said repairs under the lease provision in question. The record is most unsatisfactory on the matter, but warrants an inference that plaintiff paid this sum as billed. This inference is supported by the fact that the financial activities of Delta were closely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, through its auditor Lee Newberry. He received a carbon copy of the invoice that Delta sent to plaintiff billing it for $5,000 as cost contribution. New-berry testified as a witness in this case and while he was not questioned specifically about whether or not payment had actually been received by Delta relative to the April 1969 billing, his responsibility to protect the government\u2019s interests, relative to all costs incurred by the Job Corps center suggests that had some costs, as invoiced, not been paid by plaintiff, Newberry would have surfaced such a fact as part of his audit responsibilities.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">During the period July 1, 1969-January 31, 1970, Labor incurred costs of $6,478.71 applicable to work performed on elevators, sprinkler system and plumbing. Labor made no request for contribution by plaintiff under the lease provision, <em>supra, </em>relative to these costs. It is noted these costs are somewhat similar to costs incurred dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ing the July 1, 1966-June 30, 1967, period for which Delta made no claim for contribution. The failure of Labor to bill plaintiff for these costs supports an inference that said costs were considered by it to be operating maintenance costs and not repair costs and thus beyond the pale of the lease provision in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The record will not support recovery by defendant of $13,478.71 under its first counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Defendant\u2019s second counterclaim, filed just before trial in this case in January 1975, although its answer had been filed on February 25, 1972, is grounded on the provisions of Article XXIII, <em>Additional Rent, </em>of the lease, as supplemented. This Article also serves as the basis for plaintiff\u2019s claim for additional rent payments. Article XXIII provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">In addition to the provisions contained in Section II. of the original lease, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an additional yearly rental in the sum of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00), to be paid in monthly payments of Twenty-Five Hundred Dollars ($2500.00) each, commencing at the same time as provided for rent payments in Section II. Such additional rent shall be for the purpose of reimbursing Lessor for real estate taxes, assessments and improvement liens paid upon the leased premises by Lessor. Should the total sum of all real estate taxes, assessments and improvements liens be less than Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) annually, the Lessor will pay back the difference between the total sum of such taxes, assessments and improvement liens and Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) to the Lessee, and an accounting for same and repayment shall be on or before the 15th day of January of each year. In no event shall the Lessee be required to pay or reimburse Lessor a sum greater than Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) annually, for any real estate taxes, assessments, and improvement liens levied or imposed upon the leased premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Real estate taxes for 1969 on the leased property amounted to $23,138.21. Delta and/or Labor paid $20,000 (8 x $2,500), as invoiced by plaintiff, covering rental payments under Article XXIII for the months of January through August 1969. It is to be remembered that the lease was to expire by its terms on August 31,1969. Effective September 1, 1969, plaintiff and Labor agreed to continue the lease on a month-to-month basis and also agreed to certain rental payment changes, which will be discussed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Defendant maintains that since it was required only to pay the real estate taxes for 8 of the 12 months of 1969, it should only be responsible for two-thirds of the total real estate taxes paid for the year ($23,138.21), or $15,425.47. Since it paid $20,000, it claims by way of its second counterclaim the difference ($20,000-$15,425.47) or $4,574.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Plaintiff, by way of a belated claim, asserted after the case had been tried, on the assumption of conforming the pleadings to the proof, seeks to recover an additional $3,138.21, representing the difference between the total real estate taxes paid for 1969 and the $20,000 it received from Delta and/or Labor during said year as additional rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">There was no meaningful testimony at trial as to the construction, scope and reach of paragraph XXIII of lease. Indeed there was absolutely no evidence at all as to how the real estate tax situation was handled by the parties for the years 1966, 1967, and 1968. Paragraph XXIII of the lease specifically provided that an accounting was to be had for all real estate taxes paid and a repayment, if such be deemed necessary, was to be had on or before the 15th day of January of each year. Since there was no accounting had by and between the parties on or before January 15, 1970, or at any time thereafter, and no repayment was sought by either party within that period, it is not unreasonable to conclude that both parties contemporaneously, and before the matter was subjected to litigation, interpreted paragraph XXIII as requiring the $2,500 additional monthly rental payments by defendant for the 8 months in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>This conduct on the part of the parties is more revealing than the dry language of Article XXIII by itself. <em>Macke Co. v. United States, </em>467 F.2d 1323, 1325, 199 Ct.Cl. 552, 556 (1972). It is also noted that the paragraph made no provision for prorating the real estate taxes paid for a tenancy of less than 12 months, said paragraph speaking in terms of a yearly rental obligation of $30,000, to be paid in monthly payments of $2,500, with the repayment of any sum to Delta and/or Labor to represent the difference between $30,000 and the total sum of the real estate taxes paid. The situation in question does not fit squarely within the language of paragraph XXIII and thus the lack of an accounting and any request for repayment within the time frame of the paragraph itself, weighs heavily in the conclusion reached herein since the record offers no other evidence which bears on the matter. Defendant has made no persuasive argument, either factually or legally, which would justify granting it recovery on its second counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">What has been said above also serves to require denial of plaintiff\u2019s claim for additional rental payments for 1969. Moreover, other facts of record support this conclusion. Effective September 1,1969, plaintiff and Labor renegotiated the rental payments to be thereafter made by Labor. It was agreed that the rental for September 1969 would be $10,416.66, and thereafter, commencing October 1, 1969, the monthly rental would be $5,208.33. There was no mention made in discussion or in correspondence between the parties at any time, relative to payment by Labor for September 1969 and succeeding months of an additional rental payment of $2,500, or any amount whatsoever, for real estate tax purposes. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses does not support any such claim. Further, plaintiff\u2019s conduct during the period September 1969-January 1970 clearly indicates that defendant was not obligated to pay additional rental for real estate tax purposes. Prior to September 1969, plaintiff in billing Delta and/or Labor specifically invoiced for additional rental for real estate tax purposes. In its billings to Labor for September 1969 and thereafter, plaintiff significantly did not include in the invoices any claim for additional rental for real estate tax purposes. This conduct convinces that the parties did not intend that real estate taxes would be paid, as additional rental, by Labor to plaintiff during the period September 1969 and thereafter. <em>See Max Drill, Inc. v. United States, </em>427 F.2d 1233, 1240, 192 Ct.Cl. 608, 620 (1970); <em>Universal Match Corp. v. United States, </em>161 Ct.Cl. 418, 422 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In view of the above discussion, neither party is entitled to any recovery premised on Article XXIII of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In summary, we hold the trial judge to have erred in determining damages based solely on a <em>cost of repair </em>analysis without regard to a <em>diminution of fair market value </em>ceiling. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on a possible distinction between <em>cost of repair </em>and <em>cost of restoration </em>is unfounded in view of the similarity in treatment of the two methods in the cases, and because the rationale of the rule as applied to <em>cost of restoration </em>cases (i. e., avoidance of windfall recovery) is equally applicable to <em>cost of repair </em>cases. We further hold that the burden of proof plaintiff is required to bear was not met. In addition to a showing of what the costs of repair would be, plaintiff also needed to demonstrate whether the <em>diminution in fair market value </em>measurement exceeded the <em>cost of repair </em>measurement. If plaintiff cannot show an excess of <em>diminution in fair market value </em>over <em>cost of repair, </em>his damages will be measured solely with regard to the diminution in value attributable to the Government\u2019s breach. In this case, we agree with the trial judge that there is no adequate and conclusive evidence indicative of a fair market value on \u201cday in.\u201d However, from an examination of the record, we find the fair market value of the property on \u201cday out\u201d to have been zero. The trial judge erred in discounting the \u201czero value\u201d appraisal by wrongfully receiving and wrongfully applying a letter ostensibly showing a \u201cpossible\u201d offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>$500,000 for the property. Evidence of an offer is inadmissible to prove fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Additionally, plaintiff failed to except to the trial judge\u2019s finding of \u201cno convincing evidence\u201d as to fair market value on \u201cday in\u201d and \u201cday out.\u201d This is inconsistent with Court of Claims Rule 143(d). Having also failed to file supplemental briefing and/or affidavits, or even to press for a remand of proceedings, plaintiff has not postured itself in such a manner as to merit recovery.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">. The court adopts the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact, as modified, which are necessary for our determination. They are set forth in his report filed March 8, 1976, and are not printed herein since all necessary facts are contained in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">. At this point, the components of the trial judge\u2019s recommended award should be clarified since the briefs and argument evidenced some confusion as to the actual figures. Part of the hospital was known as Wing A. As to Wing A, the trial judge found that there were no reliable damage estimates submitted by the parties. The plaintiff had sought to recover the fair market value of Wing A as damages. The trial judge determined that $17,868 was the proper measure of damages as attributed to Wing A, a figure falling far short of plaintiff\u2019s requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">The $17,868 figure, combined with $102,424 (50% of the finding of $204,848 cost of repair figure for the rest of the hospital) totals $120,-292, which is the amount of the <em>recommended </em>recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">Since we hold that in this case the entire award, if any, should be determined by a diminution in fair market value measurement, the detailed particulars of the trial judge\u2019s recommended award need not be further considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">. For the purposes of clarity, we shall henceforth call January 31, 1970 (the day the lease was terminated) \u201cday out.\u201d June 24, 1966 (the day the parties entered into the lease agreement) will be termed \u201cday in.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\">. As we agree with these exceptions, we need not explore the Government\u2019s alternative argument pressed at oral argument, that the plaintiff\u2019s award be cut by $37,500. The trial judge found that the poor condition of the building was due in part to vandalism and causes other than defendant\u2019s actions. This finding was not excepted to by the plaintiff. The Government urges that before the total award of $204,848 was reduced by 50% to reflect normal wear and tear, the trial judge should have reduced the figure by $75,000 to reflect such outside causes. Were this to be done, plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccost of repair\u201d recovery would be cut by $37,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">. Specifically, the following paragraphs of the lease agreement were relied on by Missouri Baptist.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\n<em>FURNISHINGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">* * * Lessee agrees to return all light fixtures, permanent installations of the building, or any fixtures or equipment permanently attached to the building and constituting a part of the realty thereof, or any air conditioning equipment, or air conditioners, at the termination of this lease, subject to wear and tear caused by normal usage of such furnishings and fixtures with no obligation to restore any furnishings or fixtures to their condition at the inception of this lease, except for such items as may have been damaged or broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">\n<em>ALTERATIONS, IMPROVEMENTS AND FIXTURES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">Lessee may attach any fixtures or equipment to the leased premises which it deems necessary or desirable, at Lessee\u2019s own expense. At the termination of the lease, Lessee may remove any such fixtures, * * * or equipment if the removal of same does not deface, or damage the leased premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-21\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b353-22\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-23\"><em>REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE </em>Lessee hereby accepts the premises in the condition they are in at the beginning of this lease and agrees to maintain both the exterior and interior of said premises in good, clean and sanitary condition and in good order and repair and at the termination of this lease, will deliver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the leased premises to the Lessor in good condition, * * *, excepting only reasonable wear and tear arising from the use thereof under this agreement. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">\n<em>WASTE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">Lessee agrees that it will not permit or suffer any waste to the premises; * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b355-14\">. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiff did not except to this finding. <em>See </em>Rule 143(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. Put simply, plaintiff must show that he was damaged. To require the defendant to expend great sums of money to repair the building, if the damage to the value of the building was de <em>minimis, </em>is to work an injustice. For example, a tiny scratch on a picture window might be repairable only by replacing it at great expense, yet the actual damage (the diminution in fair market value of the window) would be clearly be trivial. A measure of damages granting full replacement cost of a new picture window would be patently unfair and result in a windfall recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">. The Government, by arguing and offering evidence of zero fair market value, does not imply that there existed either no salvage value, or no value for the land on which Missouri Baptist was situated. Salvage and land value diminution, however, are not the subject of this suit. The subject matter of this suit is the diminution of fair market value of the Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">. At this point, it may be worth noting that plaintiff alleged in its initial petition that the leased premises were diminished in value by $1 million, and that the Government was liable therefor. Plaintiff states in its final brief that the trial judge \u201crejected plaintiff\u2019s damage claims based on diminution in value and chose to find damages based on repair cost, [and] plaintiff has now elected to accept damages measured by such repair cost.\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Reply Brief, p. 13). This can only provide further indication that plaintiff understood the nature of the conflict between its damage theory and the Government\u2019s. It originally, in its initial petition, <em>sought damages based on diminution in value, </em>and yet introduced no valid evidence in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> Plaintiff, in any event, questions defendant\u2019s right to claim costs incurred by Delta and allegedly due and owing Delta by plaintiff prior to assignment, effective July 1, 1969, of the lease by Delta to defendant. The case relied on by plaintiff in this regard, <em>i. e., Standard Live Stock Co. v. Pentz, </em>204 Cal. 618, 269 P. 645 (1928), can also be read to support defendant\u2019s right to make the disputed claim it advances herein. However, it is not necessary to resolve this question in view of the disposition of the claim on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b363-6\">NICHOLS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"akj-dedup-0\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">I join in the judgment and in Judge Kun-zig\u2019s persuasive opinion, though I was originally of another view. However, I do not believe, and do not understand the opinion to say, that covenants in leases to deliver the leased premises to the lessor in good condition at the end of the lease period, reasonable wear and tear excepted, are always and invariably nullities if the property had no fair market value at the beginning of the lease and at the end. If this were true, it would have consequences the court might not desire. There is, undoubtedly, at the present time, a great deal of \u201cimproved\u201d urban real estate, that would be found on an unbiased appraisal to lack any fair market value. Owners may have reasons for wishing to preserve their property, perhaps a hope for better times, perhaps other considerations. They may want to have the property in possession of a responsible tenant rather than vacant and more fully exposed to vandalism, which even occupancy, in our state of urban decadence, no longer entirely guards against. In view of the decision we are making, the question might arise, how are they to require the lessee actually to keep the premises in good physical repair, market value consideration aside? Obviously they could spell it out. Should they fail to do so, such covenants might be implied from the attendant circumstances. Words in leases, as in other contracts, cannot always be given the same unvarying meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">If it appeared, for example, that the property was historic and destined, eventually, to become part of a restored historic section, as in Alexandria, Virginia, the parties might have so plainly covenanted with that consideration in their minds, that the conventional restoration language would have a different meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">While it was virtually impossible to show here, that the property had any fair market value at the beginning of the lease, the parties originally contracted with reference to an appraisal that indicated it did. This may have been, as the trial judge intimates, little better than an agreed fiction, but still it rebuts the idea one might otherwise entertain, that they contracted with a purpose to disregard market value considerations in their relations as landlord and tenant. In such circumstances it would be absurd to mulct the Government for not effecting repairs that would have been useless so far as their effect on market value was concerned. The trial judge\u2019s decision would have presented the hospital trustees with a mere windfall, where it looks as if they were fortunate indeed to derive the income they did from such worthless property, before the instant claim arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">CONCLUSION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Upon the foregoing opinion, and the findings of fact of the trial judge as modified, which are hereby adopted but not printed, the court concludes that plaintiff is not entitled to recover any damages. The court also concludes that defendant\u2019s two counterclaims, and plaintiff\u2019s belated claim must fail. The petition and the counterclaims are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
