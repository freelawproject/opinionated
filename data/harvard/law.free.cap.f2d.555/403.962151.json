The testimony and exhibits range generally over the employment practices of the defendant bank during a period of almost ten years. The number of employee applications during such period was in the thousands; the number of applicants singled out by the Commission as evidence of discrimination was proportionally minimal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>In 1973 and 1974, alone, the defendant received approximately 4058 employment applications and employed 412 new employees. The charge of discrimination seems to have been based on the treatment of but 34 black employment applications during the entire period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">At the conclusion of all testimony, the District Court stated orally its findings of fact and conclusions of law. On these findings and conclusions, the Court granted judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The findings of fact, on which the judgment was granted, were phrased in broad conclusory terms and did not include any subsidiary findings which would give appropriate support to the Court\u2019s conclusory findings. Thus, in dismissing individual discrimination claims, the Court\u2019s finding was that \u201cthe Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has not borne the burden imposed on it in the <em>McDonnell </em>case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Previously in its opinion, the Court had stated the \u201crequirements * * * of the <em>McDonnell </em>case\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it did not indicate at any point in its opinion which requirement, as declared in <em>McDonnell, </em>was not proved by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">On the broader issue of an alleged pattern of discrimination in employment and assignment of blacks, when hired, to inferior positions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court found that \u201cthe statistics presented by stipulation or by testimony [by the plaintiff] were sufficient to create a prima facie case\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but later declared bluntly, as a finding of fact, that the defendant had \u201cborne the burden of rebutting by the greater weight of the evidence the statistical prima facie case presented by the plaintiff * * It seems to have based this ultimate factual finding on the bare subsidiary finding \u201cthat the evidence preponderates that the defendant has, during the time period involved in this action, affirmatively and aggressively sought out minority candidates for employment in all positions and that far from being neutral, the defendant- has taken a leadership position in the community in seeking blacks to fill vacancies at all levels,\u201d and \u201cthat once having recruited and having hired blacks, the defendant has exercised diligence in its training of those blacks to fill the positions for which they were hired.\u201d These subsidiary findings unquestionably were relevant to the \u201culti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>mate\u201d issue under consideration but they manifestly were insufficient in themselves, without more, to support a finding that the Commission\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case had been rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court made no analysis of the statistical information or of the weight to be accorded it under the facts advanced by the bank, if any.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It engaged in no inquiry, either into the racial pattern generally of the community population or in the relative proportion racially of those in that community qualified by education or training for employment in any part of defendant\u2019s business.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor did it engage in any review of the employment records of the defendant, such as how many blacks and how many whites applied for employment over a particular period of time, how many in each group were employed, the disproportion, if any, in the employment of applicants from the two groups, or an explication of any fact which could have thrown light on either the justification or the impropriety of the particular denials of employment cited by the Commission in.support of its contentions of discrimination. In essence, there is an absence of that critical review of the relevant facts, culminating in a coherent body of factual findings, which is particularly called for in a discrimination case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">When the trial court provides only conclusory findings, illuminated by no subsidiary findings or reasoning on all the relevant facts, as was the case here, there is not that \u201cdetail and exactness\u201d on the material issues of fact necessary for an understanding by an appellate court of the factual basis for the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions, and for a rational determination of whether the findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous. It was to assure that \u201cdetail and exactness\u201d in the trial court\u2019s findings as a predicate for intelligent appellate review that Rule 52(a) was adopted. The failure of the District Court to comply in this case with the basic requirement of the Rule for detailed findings of fact compels us to remand the cause for detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law by the trial court. <em>See, Patrician Towers Owners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fairchild </em>(4th Cir. 1975) 513 F.2d 216, 219; <em>O\u2019Neal v. Gresham </em>(4th Cir. 1975) 519 F.2d 803, 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">At the hearing before us, there was considerable argument about the limitation on witnesses imposed by the District Court. We do not think the District Court abused its discretion in limiting the testimony as it did. However, on remand, both parties should be allowed to offer any additional evidence they may wish, provided the identity of any proposed additional witnesses be provided the opposing party, with adequate advance notice to permit proper discovery, if desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\n<em>REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\">. For purposes of comparison of treatment of allegedly similarly qualified whites, the Commission did rely on the applications of 50 white applicants over the period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">It, also, made a later finding that the employment of Joan Covington, \u201cin preference to Sandra Holland was a reasonable exercise of business judgment and was nondiscriminatory.\u201d The difficulty with this finding, so far as this appeal is concerned, is that it relates to Sandra Holland\u2019s May, 1969, denial of employment at Suffolk, which the Commission admits was not discriminatory, and not to her April, 1969, application at Norfolk, which the Commission claims was improperly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">. As stated by the Court, these requirements were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\"One: \u2018that he belongs to a racial minority\u2019; \u201cTwo: \u2018that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants\u2019;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">\u201cThree: \u2018that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and,\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">\u201cFour: \u2018that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications\u2019 or equal qualifications.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-15\">. It is conceded that there is no complaint of discrimination in defendant\u2019s promotion policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-16\">. Even in making this finding, the Court did not indicate the nature of the statistics which gave rise to a \u201cprima facie case.\u201d Both parties have attempted to use these statistics to bolster their contentions both on the <em>prima facie </em>showing and on the merits, but their arguments cannot substitute for findings by the trial court itself under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">In this connection, the Commission, after trial, prepared various tables and charts dealing with the bank\u2019s employment records. These were included in the Appendix, identified as Exhibits. Such tables and charts were never introduced at trial or submitted to the trial court. They should not have been identified in the Appendix as Exhibits submitted at trial. The Commission would justify their inclusion in the record on appeal on the ground that the charts and tables were prepared from material in the record. This, however, does not justify their inclusion in the Appendix under an identification as Exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\">. While it is well settled that statistics, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence, may be sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201clopsided ratios [in statistical compilations] are not conclusive proof of past or present discriminatory hiring practices,\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes International Corporation </em>(5th Cir. 1972) 456 F.2d 112, 120; and the \u201cvalidity of and proper inferences to be drawn from any such statistics, of course, is a matter to be litigated at trial,\u201d <em>Briggs v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Inc. </em>(E.D.Va.1976) 414 F.Supp. 371, 375, n. 2, and should, if trial is . to the court, be covered by the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Unfortunately, though, the finding of the trial court on the plaintiff\u2019s statistical evidence is not analytical but is summed up in the purely conclusory findings that \u201cthe defendant does operate an affirmative action plan that is in compliance with the spirit and the letter of the law\u201d and \u201ctherefore * * * that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought on the basis of its statistical showing of imbalance between whites and blacks * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\">. Where the work requires special qualifications, it is proper to consider the ratio of qualified blacks and whites in the appropriate work force rather than the ratio of the gross percentage of blacks and women in the whole workforce, including unskilled labor. After all, in any discrimination case, \u201cone element which remains essential is that the minority applicant be qualified for the position for which he applies.\u201d <em>Morita v. Southern Cal. Permanente Medical Group </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 541 F.2d 217, 219. <em>See, also, Logan v. General Fireproofing Company </em>(4th Cir. 1971) 521 F.2d 881, 883, and <em>Harper v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore </em>(D.Md.1973) 359 F.Supp. 1187, 1205, <em>modified on other grounds </em>and <em>aff'd. </em>486 F.2d 1134.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
