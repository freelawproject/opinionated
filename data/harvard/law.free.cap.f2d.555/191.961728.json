His sole ground of error relates to the trial court\u2019s admission of \u201cprior inconsistent statements\u201d offered by the government as substantive evidence of Mosley\u2019s participation in the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-18\">On September 17, 1976, one Harvey Fields made a tape-recorded statement before a state prosecuting attorney which implicated Mosley in the September 15 robbery of the Union National Bank. Prior to making his statement Fields was placed under oath and advised of his <em>\u201cMiranda\u201d </em>rights. Fields was later called to testify before the federal grand jury and repeated substantially his prior statement. At the trial, however, Fields\u2019 testimony controverted his prior statements. The government then introduced portions of Fields\u2019 grand jury testimony and recorded statement as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">The defendant challenges the admission of these prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserts that the grand jury testimony was inadmissible as substantive evidence, because a grand jury is not \u201ca trial, hearing, or other proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the rule. He also challenges the admission of the recorded statement before the state prosecuting attorney as substantive evidence, because (1) under Arkansas law a false statement made under oath to a prosecutor is subject to the penal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ty of false swearing, not perjury, and (2) that the giving of a sworn statement to a prosecutor is not \u201ca trial, hearing, or other proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The legislative history<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Rule 801 clearly establishes that statements made before a grand jury are within the scope of the rule. The original version of Rule 801(d)(1)(A), as passed by the Senate, placed no restrictions on the conditions under which the prior statement was made. The House version, however, required that the prior statement be subject to cross-examination and be given in a \u201ctrial, hearing, or in a deposition.\u201d In conference a compromise was reached to include grand jury testimony. The cross-examination requirement was deleted and the phrase \u201cother proceeding\u201d was added. As stated in <em>United States v. Castro-Ayon, </em>537 F.2d 1055, 1057 (9th Cir. 1976), these changes represented a conscious choice \u201cto include grand-jury proceedings within the ambit of \u2018other proceedings.\u2019 \u201d This conclusion is supported by the Conference Committee Report which expressly states, \u201cThe rule as adopted covers statements before a grand jury.\u201d H.Rep.No.93-1597, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), reprinted in [1974] 4 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News pp. 7098, 7104.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Since we find that Fields\u2019 grand jury testimony was properly admitted as substantive evidence, we decline the invitation to decide whether his recorded statement to the state prosecuting attorney is within the scope of the rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fields\u2019 testimony before the grand jury was substantially the same as his prior recorded statement. Thus his recorded statement was cumulative and not so prejudicial as to require a new trial. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>551 F.2d 233 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">.
