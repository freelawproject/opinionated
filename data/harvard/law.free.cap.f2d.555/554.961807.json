Rubin, Judge, United States District court for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b614-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b614-24\">Plaintiffs appeal a judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. We agree with the district court that plaintiffs\u2019 action is barred by Kentucky\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>one-year statute of limitations governing actions for malicious prosecution, conspiracy and arrest, as set forth in K.R.S. \u00a7 413.-140(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The gist of plaintiffs\u2019 lengthy complaint is that neighbors of plaintiffs in Liberty, Kentucky, had conspired with certain local officials to falsely charge plaintiffs with maintaining a nuisance in the neighborhood by countenancing the destructive conduct of their children. This essentially backyard dispute culminated in the issuance of an injunction by the Casey County Circuit Court against plaintiffs and allegedly forced the evacuation of plaintiffs\u2019 home under threat of further prosecution. Plaintiffs also contend that they were arrested without probable cause and that the Circuit Court was in any event without jurisdiction over the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Most of the acts complained of occurred in 1972 and 1973. The last act alleged in the complaint, the dismissal of the nuisance charge, occurred on June 10, 1974. Suit in federal district court was not filed until July 28, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Because neither \u00a7 1983 nor \u00a7 1985 contains a statute of limitations a \u201cfederal district court must apply the statute of limitations of the state where it sits which would be applicable in the most closely analogous state action to determine the time within which the cause of action must be commenced.\u201d <em>Mason v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 520, 521 (6th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the applicable Kentucky statute of limitations is that provided in K.R.S. \u00a7 413.120(2) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS8\">The following actions shall be commenced within five years after the cause of action accrued: .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">(2) An action upon a liability created by statute, when no other time is fixed by the statute creating the liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">This court in <em>Garner v. Stephens, </em>460 F.2d 1144 (6th Cir. 1972), held the above statute to be the correct period of limitation for an action pursuant to \u00a7 1983 of the Civil Rights Act where the plaintiff had claimed that the County Board of Education in Russell County, Kentucky had deprived her of her civil rights by requiring her to take a full year\u2019s leave of absence on account of her pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">In <em>Mulligan v. Schlachter, </em>389 F.2d 231 (6th Cir. 1968), we held that an action pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 of the Civil Rights Act that claimed a deprivation of constitutional rights because petitioner was arrested allegedly without probable cause was governed by Michigan\u2019s two-year statute of limitations for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment. Similarly, here we find the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to be most analogous to the Kentucky actions of malicious prosecution and false arrest. The applicable statute of limitations then is K.R.S. \u00a7 413.140(1)(c). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">The following actions shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued: . . .(c) An action for malicious prosecution, conspiracy, arrest,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">Because all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose more than one year before this action was filed, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"A4A\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
