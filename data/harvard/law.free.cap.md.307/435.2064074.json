The petition charged violation of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(1), (5), and (6); 2-110(B)(3); and 6-101(A)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also alleged that Draper \u201cwas incompetent as defined by\u201d Rule BV1 h.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We referred the matter to Judge William R. Buchanan. Draper did not respond to the petition, nor did she attend the hearing Judge Buchanan held after an order of default had been entered against her. Judge Buchanan found that Draper had undertaken to represent Eleanor N. Hunt in a divorce case, but that Draper \u201csuspended preparation of the case and ceased all contact with Mrs. Hunt\u201d after a preliminary settlement had been worked out. As a consequence, \u201cMrs. Hunt [was] forced to proceed pro se on all subsequent matters, including the hearing on the merits of her divorce.\u201d He further found that Draper had undertaken to represent Silvia Moody in a wrongful discharge case. Once again, after \u201cnegotiating a settlement between Ms. ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Moody and her former employer,\u201d Draper \u201cfailed to follow up on the terms of the settlement____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Judge Buchanan concluded that Draper had violated DRs 1- 102(A)(1), (5), and (6); and 6-101(A)(3). He recognized that an Attorney Grievance Commission inquiry panel, after a 1985 hearing, had found that Draper suffered from \u201ca serious mental disorder.\u201d Nevertheless, he could not \u201cdetermine with any degree of certainty ... whether ... Ms. Draper was experiencing such disorders during the Hunt and Moody cases in 1983, so as to have warranted her mandatory withdrawal from those two cases.\u201d Therefore, he found no violation of DR 2-110(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Draper does not except to any part of Judge Buchanan\u2019s report. The Commission notes three exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">First, the Commission excepts to Judge Buchanan\u2019s failure to set forth as findings of fact certain matters deemed admitted because of Draper\u2019s failure to respond to requests for admissions of fact and genuineness of documents filed by the Commission. It appears that Judge Buchanan treated all of those matters as established. He said he \u201cmust deem all allegations made by [the Commission] in its Request for Admissions of Facts and Genuiness <em>[sic </em>] of Documents as admitted pursuant to Maryland Rule 2- 424.\u201d He did not, however, recite those facts in his report, nor did he incorporate them in it by reference. We believe the better practice requires him to do one or the other, and we sustain this first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Next, the Commission excepts to Judge Buchanan\u2019s failure to find Draper in violation of DR 2-110(B)(3). A finding of violation of DR 2-110(B)(3) would require evidence that when Draper was handling the Hunt and Moody matters she was suffering from a \u201cmental ... condition\u201d that rendered it \u201cunreasonably difficult for [her] to carry out the employment effectively.\u201d The only evidence on that point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>was testimony of A. Dwight Pettit, Esq., before the inquiry panel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Pettit, with whom Draper was associated at the critical times, opined that Draper had been \u201cill\u201d and \u201cdepressed.\u201d There was little evidence of the precise nature of the illness or its symptomology. Nor was there persuasive testimony tending to establish a causal link between Draper\u2019s illness (whatever it may have been) and her handling of the Hunt and Moody cases. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Aler, </em>301 Md. 389, 483 A.2d 56 (1984), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Truette, </em>299 Md. 435, 474 A.2d 211 (1984) (causal connection between mental condition and particular conduct established). Factual findings in an attorney disciplinary hearing held pursuant to Rule BV10 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. Rule BV10 d. The factual findings of the hearing judge are prima facie correct and will not be disturbed on review unless clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Myers, </em>302 Md. 571, 490 A.2d 231 (1985). On this state of the record, we cannot say that Judge Buchanan was clearly erroneous in concluding, in effect, that there was no clear and convincing evidence of a violation of DR 2-110(B)(3). The Commission\u2019s second exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Finally, the Commission excepts because Judge Buchanan failed to find Draper was \u201cincompetent\u201d because she was \u201cunable to render adequate legal service by reason of mental ... illness or infirmity____\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The focus of inquiry here is not on whether a lawyer should withdraw from representation because a particular condition \u201crenders it unreasonably difficult for [her] to carry out\u201d a particular employment effectively. Rather, it is on whether the lawyer\u2019s condition is such as to preclude in a general sense the rendition of adequate legal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>While the information before Judge Buchanan did not compel a finding of an incapacitating mental condition in 1983, it did contain substantial evidence of the existence of that sort of problem in 1985, when Draper appeared before the inquiry panel. She told the panel, among other things, that she was 21 years old (at other times she thought she was 40); that she had graduated from law school at Cambridge University, England, at age 14; that she had graduated from college at age 14; that she had never attended Howard University Law School (although she had); and that she had worked for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for three months or perhaps three years. At another point she explained that she did not know when she graduated from law school in England because \u201cOur records were burned up in Washington.\u201d She said there were no records of her entering the United States because she was kidnapped from overseas, drugged, assaulted and battered. When asked how long she had been in Maryland, she responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">\u201cI have been in the State of Maryland approximately less than two years____ Yes, there is someone else who uses my name. She was at the school called Howard. I have her fingerprints. It\u2019s a big joke, but, uh, I\u2019m not interested in your college students or the medical system. Now, I did acquire it. If you want my license, you can have it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Her testimony in many other respects was marked by confusion and by bizarre statements indicating a lack of contact with reality. Taken as a whole, we believe that the record contains clear and convincing evidence that Draper at the time of the hearing was \u201cunable to render adequate legal service by reason of mental ... illness or infirmity\u201d and thus \u201cincompetent\u201d within the meaning of Rule BV1 h. The inquiry panel so found and Draper failed to produce any evidence before Judge Buchanan to refute this finding. The Commission\u2019s third exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Since we have concluded that Draper is incompetent, as that term is defined in Rule BV1 h, we must now decide how to dispose of this matter in order to protect the public. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The purpose of a disciplinary proceeding is to protect the public, rather than to punish the errant attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 431 A.2d 1336 (1981). The Commission recommends that Draper be placed on inactive status. We agree. When an attorney is incapacitated to the extent she is unable to engage in the practice of law, it is appropriate to place her on inactive status. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Demyan, </em>299 Md. 652, 474 A.2d 1342 (1984); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Harrison, </em>292 Md. 81, 437 A.2d 228 (1981). This action will remove Draper from the practice of law until such time as she can demonstrate her fitness to return to her profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV 15 c.
