Rule 323 extended the time for filing a motion to vacate a default judgment. We hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Reduced to their bare essentials, the facts may be simply stated. On 23 . August 1982 appellee, Derrick Moten, sued appellant, Jeffrey O\u2019Connor, and Brandywine Riding Stable, Inc., in tort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After several non ests as to O\u2019Connor, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County authorized substituted service on him, pursuant to former Md. Rule 104. An affidavit of service was filed. O\u2019Connor failed to plead and on 6 December 1983 judgment by default was entered against him. On 4 January 1984 O\u2019Connor filed a motion raising preliminary objection pursuant to former Rule 323. The motion asserted lack of personal jurisdiction because of ineffective service of process. On 21 March 1984 the circuit court (Melbourne, J.) denied the motion, but granted O\u2019Con-nor \u201c15 days leave to file Motion to Vacate Default Judgment.\u201d This he did on 4 April. A month later Judge Melbourne struck the default judgment, finding that O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s motion presented a meritorious defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Moten promptly appealed to an in banc court. Md. Const. Art. 4, \u00a7 22. That court reasoned that (1) the motion raising preliminary objection did not toll the 30-day period at the expiration of which a default judgment becomes enrolled; (2) the default judgment against O\u2019Connor had become enrolled 30 days after its entry on 6 December 1983; (3) an enrolled judgment may be stricken only on a showing of fraud, mistake, or irregularity; and (4) there was no such showing here. It held that Judge Melbourne had erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>vacating the default judgment and set aside her order of 4 May 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">O\u2019Connor appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. It agreed with the in banc court that the default judgment had become enrolled 30 days after its entry, despite the filing of O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion raising preliminary objection within that period. It dismissed the appeal. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Moten, </em>No. 767, Sept. Term, 1985 (filed February 20, 1986). We granted <em>certiorari. </em>306 Md. 369, 509 A.2d 133 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">As we proceed to address the issue in this case, we point out that all the significant actions of the trial court occurred before 1 July 1984\u2014the effective date of a comprehensive revision of the Maryland Rules. Consequently, the rules that were in effect prior to that date govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Moten\u2019s position is straightforward. At least since <em>Himes v. Day, </em>254 Md. 197, 254 A.2d 181 (1969), a default judgment as to liability, such as the one entered in this case, had been appealable from date of entry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cFor a period of 30 days after\u201d that entry, \u201cor thereafter, pursuant to motion filed within such period, the court\u201d could revise (strike) the default judgment, but after the expiration of that period, if no motion had been filed within it, the judgment became \u201cenrolled\u201d and then could be revised only on a showing of fraud, mistake, or irregularity. Former Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Rule 625a. Since, continues Moten, no motion to revise or strike the default judgment was filed within 30 days from 6 December 1983, and no appeal was taken from the default judgment entered on that date, it became unreviewable except for fraud, mistake, or irregularity\u2014circumstances not asserted here. O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion to strike the default judgment, which motion was not filed until 4 April 1984, did not raise those issues. As a consequence, Moten concludes, the default judgment is unreviewable. In view of the unusual facts of this case, we see the matter otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Former Md. Rule 323b. mandated that a motion raising lack of personal jurisdiction, which is what O\u2019Connor initially filed, \u201cshall be filed before any other pleading is filed, and unless so filed, the defense shall be deemed to have been waived.\u201d O\u2019Connor complied with this rule. Had he done otherwise, for example, by joining with his preliminary objection a motion to strike the default judgment because of the existence of meritorious defenses, he would have waived his objection to personal jurisdiction. <em>Eastham v. Young, </em>250 Md. 516, 243 A.2d 559 (1968). <em>See also Harvey v. Slacum, </em>181 Md. 206, 29 A.2d 276 (1942) (when general issue plea filed after objection to personal jurisdiction made, the objection is waived). Moreover, O\u2019Connor\u2019s preliminary objection on the ground of personal jurisdiction was, in effect, a motion to strike the default judgment. A default judgment cannot properly be entered absent personal jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>Fick v. Towers, </em>152 Md. 335, 136 A. 648 (1927); <em>Kraft v. Sussex Constr. Corp., </em>35 Md.App. 309, 370 A.2d 570 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">O\u2019Connor, then,otimely filed what amounted to a motion to strike the default judgment, and he asserted his personal jurisdiction objection before any other basis for attacking the judgment, as Rule 323 required him to do. Rule 323c. instructed (subject to an exception not here pertinent) that \u201cthe filing of a motion under this Rule shall extend the time for pleading pursuant to section a of Rule 309____\u201d The latter rule allowed a 15 day pleading extension after disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tion of \u201ca pleading requiring a ruling by the court____\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion raising preliminary objection clearly was \u201ca pleading requiring a ruling by the court\u201d and a 15-day extension is precisely what Judge Melbourne gave him when she denied the motion on 21 March 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Moten argues that O\u2019Connor\u2019s subsequent motion to vacate was not a \u201cpleading\u201d within the contemplation of former Rules 309 and 323. He is wrong. Former Rule 5 v. defined \u201cPleading\u201d as, among other things, \u201cany paper filed in an action ... filed with the object of ... obtaining any decision or act by the court....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Beyond peradventure of a doubt, O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion to strike is encompassed by that definition. Its whole purpose was to obtain a \u201cdecision or act by the court\u201d\u2014to wit, striking the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Under these circumstances, we hold that when O\u2019Connor\u2019s timely Rule 323 motion was denied, he had an additional 15 days to file a motion to vacate the default judgment. Under the unusual facts of this case, the Rule 625 a. 30-day period for filing a motion to revise (strike) the judgment was extended to allow him to file the second motion within the period allowed by both former Rule 309 and Judge Melbourne\u2019s order. Since he did file that second motion timely, that is, within the time prescribed by former Rule 625 a., as extended by our reading of former Rules 309 and 323, the trial court retained power to act on it even absent any demonstration of fraud, mistake, or irregularity. <em>See Cramer, Trustees v. Wildwood Development Co., 221 </em>Md. 102, 175 A.2d 750 (1961). To hold otherwise would be to require O\u2019Connor to waive either his jurisdictional objection or his defense on the merits. That would be an absurd construction of the former rules, and would fly in the face of their express provisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>29, 41, 333 A.2d 37, 43 (1975); <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 19-20, 174 A.2d 768, 774 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We further hold, therefore, that the Court of Special Appeals erred in dismissing O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal. For the reasons stated, the in banc court\u2019s reversal of Judge Melbourne\u2019s order vacating the default judgment must, in turn, be reversed.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">JUDGMENT OF COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE IN BANC COURT WHICH SHALL, IN TURN, REMAND THIS CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">. Brandywine is not a party to this appeal. The claim against it was disposed of in the trial court. No appeal was noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">. <em>Himes </em>created a substantial piecemeal appeal problem. An appeal on the issue of liability had to be taken after the initial entry of default judgment; a second appeal could be taken on the issue of damages after a later judgment had been entered as to them. Under the present rules, that problem no longer exists, at least when a default judgment is entered following a defendant\u2019s failure to plead. Rule 2-613(a) calls for the entry of an order of default as the initial step towards entry of default judgment. This order is a determination of liability but is not a judgment. The next step, assuming there is no timely motion to vacate the order under Rule 2-613(c), or that such a motion is denied, is the entry of judgment following the establishment of damages. Rule 2-613(e). It is at this point, and not until this point, that the default judgment becomes appealable. <em>See Breuer v. Flynn, </em>64 Md.App. 409, 420, 496 A.2d 695, 700-701 (1985), and P. Niemeyer and L. Richards, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>p. 361 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">. This definition of \u201cpleading\u201d was far broader than the present one. <em>See </em>Rule 1-202 (q).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. We note that the dilemma faced by O\u2019Connor in this case would not exist under the present rules. Had those rules been in effect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>December, 1983, and had the court entered an order of default against O\u2019Connor on 6 December (Rule 2-614(a)), O\u2019Connor could have filed, on 4 January 1984, a motion both questioning personal jurisdiction and seeking to strike the order of default because of the existence of meritorious defenses. By doing so, he would not have waived the personal jurisdiction issue. Rule 2-322(a)(l), requires lack of jurisdiction over the person to be raised by a motion filed before answer. The defense is waived if \"not so made and the answer is filed____\u201d But Rule 2-322(f) allows a party \"who makes a motion under this Rule [to] join it with any other motions then available to the party.\u201d If that is done, \u201d[n]o defense or objection raised pursuant to this Rule is waived by being joined with one or more such other defenses or objections in a motion under this Rule.\" Since a motion to vacate pursuant to Rule 2-613(c) would have been available to O\u2019Connor on 4 January 1984 (had the present rules then been in effect) he could have joined such a motion with the objection to personal jurisdiction without waiving that objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\">. O'Connor\u2019s objection to personal jurisdiction is not before us; it was not included in our grant of <em>certiorari. McCray v. State, </em>305 Md. 126, 501 A.2d 856 (1985). In any event, O\u2019Connor is subject to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. <em>See Keen v. Keen, </em>191 Md. 31, 60 A.2d 200 (1948); <em>Guen v. Guen, </em>38 Md.App. 578, 381 A.2d 721 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
