The Commission seeks Gilbert\u2019s disbarment for a claimed violation of DR 1-101(A) and DR 1-102(A)(1) and (4) due to his alleged intentional failure to disclose a material fact in his 1980 application for registration as a candidate for admission to the Maryland Bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the nondisclosure was of a civil suit filed by Gilbert in which he unsuccessfully sought, as beneficiary, to recover the proceeds of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>life insurance policies procured by him on his deceased wife\u2019s life three months prior to her murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Prior to his admission to the Maryland Bar, Gilbert was involved in a series of criminal' incidents, all of which occurred over a six-month period in 1967. As a result, he was charged with conspiracy to commit forgery, forgery and uttering, murder and accessory to commit murder, homicide and assault. He pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to the charge of conspiracy to commit forgery for which in 1968 he received a suspended sentence. He was found guilty of six counts of forgery and uttering arising out of the use of a misappropriated credit card and received a sentence of twenty months to five years incarceration. Shortly after his enrollment in law school, he was arrested on murder and aggravated assault charges arising out of a Halloween night stabbing of a gas station attendant by one of his companions. Gilbert was found not guilty of these offenses; subsequently, he pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to simple assault for which he received a suspended sentence. During this same period in 1967, Gilbert was arrested for murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the murder of his wife on June 4, 1967. He was indicted for these offenses, along with his sister, on March 13, 1969. The charges against Gilbert were nol prossed on June 24, 1974, following his sister\u2019s acquittal on March 13, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Gilbert was initially incarcerated without bond until December 1967 and was later imprisoned for twenty-one months from November 1970 to August 1972 upon his convictions for forgery and uttering. As a result, he was unable to continue law school. He resumed his law school studies after his release from incarceration and graduated in 1980. He completed his application for admission to the Bar of Maryland on May 20, 1980. On May 29, 1980, Gilbert filed a petition for the expungement of all records associated with the nol prossed indictment for his wife\u2019s murder. The petition was granted on June 23, 1980. Gil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>bert successfully passed the July 1980 Bar Examination. Thereafter, the character investigation process was initiated to determine Gilbert\u2019s present moral character fitness for admission to the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The Character Committee of the Third Judicial Circuit held a hearing on October 21, 1980 to determine whether Gilbert currently possessed the requisite moral character to justify his admission to the Bar. <em>See </em>Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar. The Committee unanimously recommended to the State Board of Law Examiners that Gilbert be denied admission. As authorized by Rule 4 c, the Board conducted its own evidentiary hearing on November 2, 1981; by a 3-2 vote, it concluded that Gilbert had demonstrated his present moral character fitness and recommended that he be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We considered the matter at a hearing \u201cupon the records made by the Character Committee and the Board.\u201d Rule 4c. A divided Court ordered Gilbert\u2019s admission after concluding that the evidence was clear and convincing that he was completely rehabilitated and presently possessed good moral character. <em>See In re Application of James G., </em>296 Md. 310, 462 A.2d 1198 (1983). In so concluding, we were conscious of Gilbert\u2019s difficult life experiences, including the continuous conflict between his parents that culminated in their separation; the birth of a Downs Syndrone child during his first marriage in 1964; and the fact that his first wife had been the victim of a murder in 1967. In arriving at our evaluation of Gilbert\u2019s present moral character, we took into consideration the nature of the offenses for which he was convicted; that all his criminal offenses occurred within a six-month period; that the murder charge involving his wife\u2019s death was nol prossed; that sixteen years had since passed; that Gilbert had been admitted to the Bar of the District of Columbia in 1981 and had performed as a lawyer without any negative incidents; and that although Gilbert\u2019s crimes were serious and involved moral turpitude, he candidly and \u201creadily admitted his responsibility for and his participation in the crimes in which he was involved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>his remorse is fully evident and genuine.\u201d 296 Md. at 316, 462 A.2d 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Shortly after his admission to the Maryland Bar, Gilbert\u2019s involvement as a plaintiff in a civil suit, not disclosed on his admission application, came to the attention of the Attorney Grievance Commission. That suit was filed by Gilbert on June 4, 1970 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to recover $110,000, representing the proceeds from two insurance policies which Gilbert had obtained insuring his wife\u2019s life. The insurer had declined to pay the proceeds to Gilbert as beneficiary, contending that he was not entitled to them because he had intentionally caused the death of his wife. At the conclusion of an evidentiary non-jury trial on November 10, 1970, Judge Kenneth C. Proctor denied Gilbert\u2019s claim to the proceeds, finding that \u201cthe evidence is overwhelming that [Gilbert] intentionally caused the death of his wife in order to reap the harvest, namely, the proceeds of these two life insurance policies, so that he could live, according to his light, happily ever after.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In so concluding, Judge Proctor related in an oral opinion that the evidence showed that three months before his wife\u2019s murder, Gilbert obtained the two policies insuring his wife\u2019s life. The murder took place at a tourist home operated by Gilbert and his wife. According to Gilbert\u2019s sister, Janet, the door buzzer sounded that night and she answered. At the door was a man with a knife. He followed Janet upstairs to where Gilbert\u2019s wife was watching television. Gilbert was not then present. The intruder forced Gilbert\u2019s wife into another room, demanded money from her and then, almost immediately, shot her with a gun which Gilbert and his wife had purchased the day prior to the crime. According to Janet, she picked up the gun and shot at the assailant, who escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Judge Proctor deemed it suspicious that Janet\u2019s fingerprints were not found on the murder gun. He expressed concern that there was no explanation as to how the murderer obtained possession of the gun; that while the mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>derer demanded money, he immediately shot the victim without any further attempt to complete a robbery; that Janet waited a substantial time before calling the police; and that Gilbert inexplicably called home at 2:00 A.M.\u2014 about an hour after the police arrived on the scene\u2014from his employer\u2019s home where he had spent the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Judge Proctor noted that there was testimony from Gilbert\u2019s employer that Gilbert told him he paid $5,000 to have his wife killed. There was evidence tending to corroborate this testimony from police witnesses who overheard an incriminating conversation between Gilbert and his employer while on a stakeout at the employer\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In completing his application to the Maryland Bar, Gilbert did not mention this civil suit despite the fact that Question 10 of the admission application required the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201ca complete list of all suits in equity, actions at law, suits in bankruptcy or other statutory proceedings, matters in probate, lunacy, guardianship, and every other judicial or administrative proceedings of every nature and kind, except criminal proceedings, to which I am or have ever been a party: (If \u2018None\u2019 so state).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Gilbert answered \u201cNone\u201d to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Following an evidentiary hearing before an Inquiry Panel, and upon the recommendation of the Review Board, the Attorney Grievance Commission filed its petition for disciplinary action on April 9, 1985, averring that Gilbert had intentionally failed to disclose a material fact, by his negative answer to Question 10 of the admission application, and that he thereby violated the previously quoted disciplinary rules. We referred the matter pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9 b to Judge Raymond G. Thieme, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. After two evidentiary hearings, Judge Thieme filed extensive factual findings, concluding that Gilbert had intentionally failed to disclose the civil suit; that the information thereby withheld was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>material fact; that the Character Committee, the State Board of Law Examiners, and this Court were deliberately deprived of material information; and that Gilbert had thereby violated DR 1-101(A) and DR 1-102(A)(1) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Gilbert has taken exception to Judge Thieme\u2019s finding that he intentionally failed to disclose the <em>Bankers Life </em>litigation. Specifically, he objects to Judge Thieme\u2019s finding that he largely completed his application on May 17, 1980, and held it for three days before submitting it on May 20, 1980. He also contends that Judge Thieme could not properly find that he gave varying explanations for his failure to disclose <em>Bankers Life </em>on his application and that the language of Question 10 was clear. While Gilbert now concedes that Question 10 requires the inclusion of all civil suits, he argues that applicants might think that Question 9(c) and (d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required disclosure of all lawsuits where money is sought and that Question 10 concerns only civil suits other than where money is sought. Furthermore, as evidence that he misread Question 10, Gilbert notes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>there were five other civil suits that he did not list in response to that question. He insists the failure to list these suits could not have been purposeful because their disclosure would not have prejudiced his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">At the first hearing before Judge Thieme, Gilbert said that he did not remember why he answered \u201cnone\u201d to the application\u2019s question about involvement in civil litigation. He suggested that he misread the question, and that the haste with which he completed the application contributed to this misreading. He claimed that he would have answered Question 10 correctly if he had not misread it. Furthermore, he maintained that he had disclosed the existence of judgments against him in answer to Question 9 of the application, and that he also revealed his involvement in \u201clawsuits\u201d in the character interview. He suggested that the Character Committee had focused on his criminal record and thus precluded him from making a more detailed disclosure of his involvement in \u201clawsuits,\u201d specifically the <em>Bankers Life </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In his factual findings, Judge Thieme characterized the language of Question 10 as very clear. He did not believe that Gilbert completed the application in any particular hurry. He noted that Gilbert admitted that he had the application for some time and had procrastinated in filling it out. From the dates of Gilbert\u2019s signatures on the application and its addendum, Judge Thieme concluded that he completed Question 10 at least three days before submitting the application, and that this fact undermined his claim of hurried preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Judge Thieme also found significant Gilbert\u2019s failure to disclose the <em>Bankers Life </em>suit at any time during his protracted admission process. While recognizing that Gilbert had mentioned \u201csome civil suits,\u201d Judge Thieme observed that he provided no details beyond those concerning an $88 judgment contained in his answer to Question 9. Moreover, he noted that when Gilbert was asked about the reasons for the police suspecting his involvement in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>wife\u2019s murder, he responded only that his in-laws had been pursuing a vendetta, failing to mention that Judge Proctor had found \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that he had caused his wife\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Although Judge Thieme acknowledged the concentration on Gilbert\u2019s criminal record during the admission process, he observed that Gilbert controlled the flow of information during the hearings. Furthermore, he said that the informality of the process provided ample opportunity for Gilbert to volunteer information omitted from his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Judge Thieme\u2019s factual findings are, of course, prima facie correct and Gilbert\u2019s exception to the intent finding will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 674, 496 A.2d 672 (1985). Based on our review of the record, we are unable to say that Judge Thieme\u2019s finding that Gilbert intentionally failed to disclose the <em>Bankers Life </em>suit was clearly erroneous. Judge Thieme clearly did not believe Gilbert\u2019s explanation for his failure to disclose <em>Bankers Life. </em>Ordinarily, the factfinder may believe or disbelieve a witness\u2019 testimony. <em>Gray v. Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>230 Md. 508, 511-12, 187 A.2d 860 (1963). Question 10 plainly asks applicants to list their involvement in civil - litigation. That a law school graduate would not understand this question strains our imagination, as it did of Judge Thieme. The dates on the application do indicate, as Judge Thieme found, that Gilbert completed the application over a three-day period, not in haste as Gilbert claimed. <em>See In re Application of G.L.S., </em>292 Md. 378, 389, 439 A.2d 1107 (1982) (application on its face contradicted applicant\u2019s claim of hurried preparation). Furthermore, Judge Thieme did not conclude that Gilbert gave varying explanations for his failure to disclose <em>Bankers Life. </em>Rather, he characterized Gilbert\u2019s explanation as \u201cseveral species of the claim that he misread question 10.\u201d And although by a footnote he took cognizance of Gilbert\u2019s testimony before the Inquiry Panel, Judge Thieme did not rely on such testimony, but rather on Gilbert\u2019s testimony at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the hearing before the court. We thus find no merit in Gilbert\u2019s exceptions relating to Judge Thieme\u2019s finding of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Gilbert has also excepted to Judge Thieme\u2019s conclusion that the non-disclosure was material. He argues that the information requested by Question 10 had no bearing on the principal issue of his present moral character. He suggests that the Character Committee evinced no interest in his involvement in civil litigation and thus would not have investigated the <em>Bankers Life </em>suit had it been disclosed. Further, he contends that his comment that he had been involved in \u201clawsuits\u201d sufficiently alerted the Committee to the need for further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Gilbert also argues that the <em>Bankers Life </em>suit involved the same issues as were involved in the criminal case and that by disclosing and discussing at length the indictment for the murder of his wife, he disclosed all the information that would have been available in the <em>Bankers Life </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In rejecting these arguments, Judge Thieme said that the Character Committee had no reason to question Gilbert about his involvement in civil litigation since he answered \u201cnone\u201d to Question 10, and only revealed the $88 judgment against him listed in Questions 9(c) and 9(d). Given the committee\u2019s close questioning of Gilbert concerning the murder charges, Judge Thieme found that his failure to disclose Judge Proctor\u2019s finding of involvement in his wife\u2019s death was of benefit to him in the character assessment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Nor did Judge Thieme find merit in Gilbert\u2019s contention that disclosure of the criminal indictment was tantamount to disclosure of the civil action. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cThis is not true. The criminal charges against Gilbert were never tried and no evidence of his involvement in Mrs. Gilbert\u2019s death was adduced. Gilbert was free to characterize the charges against him, which he did in a very self-serving manner. The civil action, on the other hand, including an affirmative defense alleging that Gil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>bert caused his wife\u2019s death, was tried to a conclusion. <em>Bankers Life </em>presented evidence of Gilbert\u2019s involvement in that murder. A detailed summary of this evidence was included in Judge Proctor\u2019s opinion which concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9a\">\u2018[T]he evidence is overwhelming that Gilbert intentionally caused the death of his wife in order to reap the harvest, namely, the proceeds of these two life insurance policies____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">This contrasts sharply with Gilbert\u2019s evaluation of the criminal charges as the groundless products of a family vendetta or inept prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cJudge Proctor\u2019s findings destroy the credence of Respondent\u2019s assertion that he had nothing to gain by not disclosing <em>Bankers Life </em>and his further assertion that the facts not disclosed were not material to his application. In view of the three narrow votes which preceded Respondent\u2019s admission to the Bar, this Court finds that Respondent certainly benefited from the freedom he enjoyed to characterize the charges against him without contradiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We have not previously construed the word \u201cmaterial\u201d in the context of its usage in DR 1-101(A). In <em>Matter of Howe, </em>257 N.W.2d 420, 422 (N.D.1977), however, the North Dakota Supreme Court defined a material omission within the contemplation of the same disciplinary rule as one that \u201chas the effect of inhibiting the efforts of the bar to determine an applicant\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">This definition accords with judicial determinations of materiality in other contexts. For example, in ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court must determine whether the resolution of any material matter of fact may affect the outcome of the case. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Products, Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 8, 327 A.2d 502 (1974). Similarly, a misrepresentation or omission in an application for insurance is material if it would affect the insurer\u2019s decision about providing insurance or evaluating the risk. <em>Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>land Indemnity v. Steers, </em>221 Md. 380, 385, 157 A.2d 803 (1960). In the law of evidence, materiality \u201cis a broad concept that is generally understood to include any evidence which is reasonably capable of influencing a tribunal\u2019s decision, but it does not require that the evidence will <em>necessarily </em>do so.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Breedon v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>45 Md.App. 73, 84, 411 A.2d 1073 (1980). <em>See also Restatement of Torts </em>(Second) \u00a7 538(2)(a) (1976) (materiality of representation determined by the importance a reasonable person would attach to fact in determining course of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">These standards focus on the effect of the particular fact or representation on the decision-making process. They are consistent with the <em>Howe </em>standard, which we adopt, for determining the materiality under DR 1-101(A) of an omission or false statement on a bar admission application.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We agree with Judge Thieme that the omitted information was clearly material. As he found, Gilbert\u2019s failure to disclose the <em>Bankers Life </em>suit kept highly relevant information concerning his wife\u2019s murder from the Character Committee, the Board and from us. It also enabled Gilbert to characterize the criminal charges against him in a self-serving and plausible fashion. Since the criminal charges were dismissed and expunged before the character evaluation process was initiated, the investigation\u2019s central focus was upon Gilbert\u2019s criminal convictions and the evidence that he had since been rehabilitated. That the nondisclosure of the civil suit plainly inhibited efforts to assess Gilbert\u2019s present moral character fitness to practice law is, we think, entirely plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Such a conclusion, Gilbert suggests, is inconsistent with <em>In re Application of G.L.S., </em>292 Md. 378, 439 A.2d 1107 (1982). There, the applicant for admission failed to disclose the details of his criminal conviction on his bar application. As he did list the date of the conviction, however, we found that he \u201cprovided sufficient information to alert the Committee to the need for further investigation and inquiry.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 397, 439 A.2d 1107. Furthermore, the applicant acknowledged that the information was incomplete and he provided the details during the admission process. Unlike <em>G.L.S., </em>Gilbert never provided the information about <em>Bankers Life </em>during the admission process. Manifestly, his comment about \u201clawsuits,\u201d when discussing the existence of a minor, unsatisfied judgment, did not provide any information on which to base further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Gilbert\u2019s reliance on the statement in <em>Howe, supra, </em>257 N.W.2d at 422, that the court would not second-guess the bar admission committee is misplaced. What the court said was that in determining materiality, it would not speculate about the course that the admission process would have actually taken had the applicant provided complete information. Thus, Gilbert\u2019s suggestion that the Character Committee would in no event have inquired into the details of <em>Bankers Life </em>had he disclosed the existence of that litigation, in effect, second-guesses the effect of complete disclosure on. the Committee and contradicts the direction in <em>Howe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Gilbert also takes exception to several evidentiary rulings made by Judge Thieme. He first asserts that Judge Thieme erroneously admitted the <em>Bankers Life </em>file in evidence, contending that that litigation had no relevance to the disciplinary proceedings because Question 10 did not require the actual disclosure of the information contained in the civil case. He also claims that there was no evidence to show that his disclosure of <em>Bankers Life </em>would have caused a Character Committee or Board member to locate and read the file. The civil case file, however, demonstrates what information would have been available had Gilbert disclosed the existence of the lawsuit, as required in Question 10. Such information is obviously relevant to the determination of whether Gilbert deliberately failed to disclose a material fact during the admission process and thus bears directly on his present moral character fitness to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Gilbert next objects to Judge Thieme\u2019s hearsay exclusion of much of Milton Parker\u2019s testimony at the hearing. He urges that Parker\u2019s testimony should have been admissible to impeach testimony given in the <em>Bankers Life </em>trial. Gilbert mistakes the nature of these disciplinary proceedings. The veracity of a witness in a trial occurring sixteen years earlier was not at issue; the judgment in that case became final when Gilbert failed to appeal. Parker\u2019s proffered testimony, allegedly tending to impeach the witness, had no bearing on whether Gilbert failed to disclose material information on his bar application.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Gilbert also contends that Judge Thieme erroneously excluded testimony by Gilbert\u2019s parents that would have tended to show his lack of intent to conceal <em>Bankers Life. </em>Judge Thieme did, however, allow Gilbert\u2019s mother and father to testify about his state of mind as he worked on his application. He excluded testimony from Gilbert\u2019s mother about her conversations with Gilbert, but permitted her to testify that Gilbert was worried about his criminal record and not his involvement in civil litigation. Judge Thieme also excluded similar testimony from Gilbert\u2019s father about Gilbert\u2019s state of mind when he was planning to return to law school in 1978. Of course, Gilbert\u2019s state of mind when he returned to law school had no relationship to his state of mind when he answered \u201cnone\u201d to Question 10. Thus, Judge Thieme properly excluded that testimony by Respondent\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Gilbert also argues that his father should have been allowed to testify to his evaluation of the evidence in <em>Bankers Life. </em>As discussed above, the merits of <em>Bankers Life </em>are not at issue in these disciplinary proceedings, and the father\u2019s testimony was accordingly properly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Also lacking in merit is Gilbert\u2019s contention that the finding of materiality in the disciplinary proceedings effectively convicts him of his wife\u2019s murder and thus denies him due process of law. Our determination that the non-disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sure was material relates only to Gilbert\u2019s fitness to practice law, not to his guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Gilbert\u2019s assertion that laches precludes these disciplinary proceedings is equally without merit. In <em>Anne Arundel Co. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Collins, </em>272 Md. 578, 584, 325 A.2d 724 (1974), we quoted with approval from <em>In Re Weinstein, </em>254 Or. 392, 459 P.2d 548, 549 (1969) as to the defense of laches in a disciplinary proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201c <em>\u2018[T]he primary purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings is to protect the </em>public____ <em>[I]t would not be in the public interest to dismiss the disciplinary proceedings for no reason other than the Bar\u2019s failure to prosecute them with the proper dispatch.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added in <em>Anne Arundel Co. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Collins.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A58\">In addition, we noted that the party asserting laches must demonstrate prejudice because of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Gilbert claims prejudice because he can no longer remember why he answered \u201cnone\u201d to Question 10. He concedes, however, that the Commission did not delay unduly in instituting grievance proceedings against him. Of course, laches operates to bar a claim only when a party delays in asserting a right. <em>See Credit Corp. v. Williams, </em>246 Md. 575, 587, 229 A.2d 712 (1967). Thus, by Gilbert\u2019s own admission, the defense of laches has no application to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Having determined that Gilbert violated DR 1-101(A) and DR 1-102(A)(1) and (4), we must determine the appropriate sanction. That no moral character qualification to practice law is more important than truthfulness and candor is well settled. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Levitt, </em>286 Md. 231, 238, 406 A.2d 1296 (1979); <em>In re Application of Allan S., </em>282 Md. 683, 689, 387 A.2d 271 (1978). Gilbert\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose <em>Bankers Life </em>plainly reflects on his truthfulness and candor during the application process and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>hence upon his present moral character fitness to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We previously determined that the reckless making of a material false statement on a bar application warranted strong disciplinary action. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Rosen, </em>303 Md. 60, 492 A.2d 289 (1985). Other states have considered intentional omissions or false statements on bar applications as grounds for disbarment. <em>See, e.g., State Bar v. Langert, </em>43 Cal.2d 636, 276 P.2d 596 (1954) (disbarment for concealment of charges of misconduct in another state on bar application); <em>People v. Culpepper, </em>645 P.2d 5 (Colo.1982) (disbarment for use of false school transcripts in connection with an application); <em>Florida Board of Law Examiners v. Lerner, </em>250 So.2d 852 (Fla.1971) (disbarment for concealment on application of charges of misconduct in another state); <em>Matter of Farrar, </em>242 Ga. 312, 249 S.E.2d 12 (1978) (disbarment for failure to disclose a prior disbarment on bar application to another state); <em>In re Jordan, </em>106 Ill.2d 162, 88 Ill.Dec. 1, 478 N.E.2d 316 (1985) (disbarment for failure to disclose 297 parking tickets, among other omissions, on bar application); <em>State v. Hartman, </em>216 Ind. 89, 23 N.E.2d 477 (1939) (disbarment for failure to disclose on application numerous civil and criminal proceedings); <em>Matter of Elliot, </em>268 S.C. 522, 235 S.E.2d 111 (1977) (disbarment for failure to disclose criminal record on bar application).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Similarly, a number of states have refused admission to applicants who have omitted pertinent information from their applications. <em>See, e.g., Application of Greenberg, </em>126 Ariz. 290, 614 P.2d 832 (1980) (belated disclosure of information reflecting adversely on moral character); <em>Application of Walker, </em>112 Ariz. 134, 539 P.2d 891 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 956, 96 S.Ct. 1433, 47 L.Ed.2d 363 (1976) (failure to disclose belated draft registration); <em>In re Green, </em>464 A.2d 881 (Del.1983) (failure to disclose charges of misconduct in another state); <em>In re Beasley, </em>243 Ga. 134, 252 S.E.2d 615 (1979) (omission of information about involvement in legal proceedings); <em>In re Ascher, </em>81 Ill.2d 485, 44 Ill.Dec. 95, 411 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>N.E.2d 1 (1980) (failure to disclose pending lawsuit); <em>In re Mitan, 75 </em>Ill.2d 118, 25 Ill.Dec. 622, 387 N.E.2d 278, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 916, 100 S.Ct. 231, 62 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979) (numerous errors and omissions on application); <em>In re Willis, </em>288 N.C. 1, 215 S.E.2d 771 (1975) (incomplete, inaccurate and inconsistent responses to questions about criminal activity); <em>Application of Jenkins, </em>94 N.J. 458, 467 A.2d 1084 (1983) (failure to disclose involvement in both criminal and civil proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Gilbert relies upon <em>Hallinan v. Committee of Bar Examiners, </em>65 Cal.2d 447, 421 P.2d 76, 55 Cal.Rptr. 228 (1966) as supporting a lesser sanction than disbarment. There, the court determined that the applicant\u2019s omissions were not material. Hallinan had listed numerous arrests, but failed to include a minor conviction in England, and to list his status as an intervenor in a will contest. In light of Hallinan\u2019s actual disclosures and the court\u2019s characterization of his offenses, it concluded that the non-disclosures had no effect on the determination of Hallinan\u2019s fitness to practice law. 421 P.2d at 94-95, 55 Cal.Rptr. 256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Gilbert also relies on <em>In re Hadzi-Antich, </em>497 A.2d 1062 (D.C.1985), a case in which the court ordered a public reprimand for an attorney who had misrepresented his credentials on an employment application. Unlike either Hallinan\u2019s or Hadzi-Antich\u2019s misconduct, Gilbert deliberately failed to disclose vitally significant material information on his bar application that he knew raised very serious questions about his fitness to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Not every purposefully dishonest misrepresentation on a bar application may warrant the extreme sanction of disbarment. In this case, however, considering the gravity of Gilbert\u2019s misconduct, and the absence of any compelling extenuating circumstances, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15 c FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST JAMES HENRY GILBERT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\">.

The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, on December 6, 1984, refused to admit Gilbert to practice in that court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Gilbert had applied to that court for admission on August 13, 1984. Shortly before a scheduled hearing before the District Court on Gilbert\u2019s application, the court was informed of the non-disclosure of the <em>Bankers Life </em>litigation and of Judge Proctor\u2019s findings. At the ensuing hearing, Gilbert contended that the omission was unintended that he had no reason to conceal the existence of the civil suit; that knowledge of the civil suit would not have changed the outcome of the character investigation and that the unintended omission had no bearing on his character.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In denying Gilbert\u2019s admission, the court noted that the application clearly asked for \"all suits\u201d to which Gilbert had been a party and that, while the criminal case against him had been dismissed without findings being made, Judge Proctor in the civil case had made extensive findings as to Gilbert\u2019s role in his wife\u2019s death. The court recognized that neither the State Board of Law Examiners nor this Court knew of Judge Proctor\u2019s findings. It opined that had such information been disclosed, it may have affected the outcome of the investigation. The District Court concluded that Gilbert\u2019s omission of the civil suit was \"not unintentional\u201d and that \u201cthe omission evidences incomplete rehabilitation and lack of good private and public character.\u201d The court further noted its concern over Judge Proctor\u2019s findings since \"[p]articipation in the murder of one\u2019s wife to collect insurance is clearly one of the most reprehensible acts imaginable, one far more serious than the crimes for which James G. has actually been convicted.\u201d <em>See </em>In the Matter of James G., Misc.
