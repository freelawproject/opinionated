This case involves a claim for benefits under the Act, sought by an individual who was criminally assaulted and as a result was blinded in one eye. The question presented is whether, under the Act\u2019s provisions, the victim is entitled to a monetary award for permanent partial disability for loss of an eye, even though he returned to work without diminution in earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The \u201cDeclaration of policy and legislative intent\u201d underlying the 1968 passage of the Act, as set forth in \u00a7 1, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2a\">\u201cThe legislature recognizes that many innocent persons suffer personal physical injury or death as a result of criminal acts or in their efforts to prevent crime or apprehend persons committing or attempting to commit crimes. Such persons or their dependents may thereby suffer disability, incur financial hardships or become dependent upon public assistance. The legislature finds and determines that there is a need for government financial assistance for such victims of crime.

Following a hearing, the Board, on June 30, 1984, awarded Williams $2,139.23 for unreimbursed medical expenses and $398.97 for 2 weeks and 3 days\u2019 temporary total disability, representing lost time from work. The Board declined to make an award for permanent partial disability for the loss of Williams\u2019 eye, concluding that because he \u201creturned to work with no diminution in earnings, ... [he] does not have a serious financial hardship as is required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Section 12(f) of the Statute for an award for his alleged permanent partial disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Williams maintained that \u00a7 12(b) required a monetary award for permanent partial disability in accordance with the schedule of benefits set forth in \u00a7 36(3) of Article 101\u2014for the loss of an eye, 250 weeks of compensation based on Williams\u2019 average weekly wage computed under the payment formula contained in \u00a7 36(3)(c). While conceding that \u00a7 12(f)(1) requires a showing of serious financial hardship as a prerequisite to an award, Williams argued that he made such a showing, as indicated by his award for medical expenses and lost earnings. Having once been made, Williams maintained that serious financial hardship need not again be separately demonstrated as to his permanent impairment and claim for permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s order and on further appeal the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Williams v. Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>65 Md.App. 486, 501 A.2d 105 (1985). In concluding that Williams was not entitled to an award for permanent partial disability in the absence of present economic loss, the intermediate appellate court read \u00a7 1 of the Act, setting forth the legislative declaration of policy and intent, in conjunction with \u00a7 12(f)(1), deeming it apparent therefrom \u201cthat the legislature\u2019s intent was not to make the victim whole, but to ameliorate serious financial losses sustained as a result of the victim\u2019s injuries.\u201d 65 Md.App. at 491, 501 A.2d 105. Writing for the court, Chief Judge Gilbert held that \u00a7 12(f)(1) mandates a denial of an award where the victim does not suffer serious financial hardship as a result of the criminal activity. Nothing in the Act, the court said, \u201cwas intended as a panacea for damages or injuries arising from crime,\u201d but rather the Act\u2019s purpose was \u201cto provide recompense to crime victims who otherwise will suffer serious financial hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 501 A.2d 105. Upon Williams\u2019 petition, we granted certiorari to consider the important issue raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">We first reviewed the history of the Act and its various provisions in <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 331 A.2d 55 (1975). At that time, we observed that Maryland was but the fifth state \u201cto establish a program permitting the unreimbursed victims of crime to be compensated by funds appropriated by the state for their personal injuries and loss of earnings, if the victim would otherwise suffer serious financial hardship.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 273 Md. at 495-96, 331</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>A.2d 55. Prerequisite to any award, we said, was \u201cthe incurring of \u2018serious financial hardship/ \u201d the payment of benefits under the Act being \u201cpredicated upon the schedule of benefits and degree of disability reflected in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 331 A.2d 55. In commenting upon the Act\u2019s passage, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\u201cThe General Assembly, conceding an inability to ameliorate to any degree the threat of violent crime, and undertaking to assume the consequences of such crime as a public burden, on the ground of \u2018moral responsibility/ in enacting Art. 26A was embarking on uncharted waters in a noble social experiment without any real background data of experience. The recent nature of this type of legislation, the uncertain estimate of the volume of claims to be made under the Act, and the incalculable amount of the funds required to be appropriated for its administration confronted our lawmakers when they adopted this \u2018welfare-theory\u2019 of compensation. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Criminal Victim Compensation in Maryland, </em>[30 Md.L.Rev. 266]. The statutory scheme for eligibility, the prerequisites for awards and the computation of benefits were all novel. Since the funds to be disbursed were public there can be sensed a legislative hesitancy on disbursement without some restraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 331 A.2d 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In <em>Holmes v. Crim. Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>278 Md. 60, 359 A.2d 84 (1976), we again emphasized that \u00a7 12(f)(1) \u201crequires a mandatory denial of an award to claimants who do not suffer serious financial hardship as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>criminal activity.\u201d 278 Md. at 65, 359 A.2d 84. We noted that \u00a7 12(f)(1) \u201cspecifies that serious financial hardship must result from the loss of earnings, support or out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute requires a denial of an award, we said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\u201cif, and only if, the Board determines that the claimant will not suffer serious financial hardship as a result of the loss of earnings or support <em>and </em>that he will not suffer such hardship as a result of out-of-pocket expenditures. If either finding cannot be made, or, in other words, if serious financial hardship does result from either the loss of earnings or support or from out-of-pocket expenses, then \u00a7 12(f)(1) does not require that the Board deny benefits. Only where no hardship results from the loss of earnings or support, or from expenditures, does \u00a7 12(f)(1) mandate the denial of an award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201cThis conclusion is also supported by other language contained in \u00a7 12(f)(1) which provides that an award shall be denied where no serious financial hardship would result if the claimant is \u2018not granted financial assistance pursuant to this article to meet the loss of earnings, support, <em>or </em>out-of-pocket expenses.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.) As is indicated by this provision, the types of losses necessary to sustain a finding of serious financial hardship, namely \u2018the loss of earnings, support, or out-of-pocket expenses,\u2019 are set forth in the disjunctive, and any one such type of loss may alone support a determination that the requisite hardship exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 359 A.2d 84. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201cThe plain language of \u00a7 12(f)(1), therefore, as well as the need to harmonize that section with the various other provisions of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act, compels the conclusion that serious financial hardship under \u00a7 12(f)(1) need not result solely from out-of-pocket expenditures, but may also occur as a result of the loss of earnings or the loss of support alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66-67, 359 A.2d 84.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In <em>Holmes, </em>we were concerned with the loss of normal domestic services for a family due to the murder of the mother, and whether the economic value of such a loss constituted a loss of \u201csupport\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 12(f)(1). We concluded that such a loss was properly considered in determining whether \u201cserious financial hardship\u201d was incurred as a result of the victim\u2019s death. To establish such hardship, we explained, does not necessarily require a showing of out-of-pocket expenditures but may be demonstrated by a showing of loss of \u201csupport\u201d alone, notwithstanding the absence of out-of-pocket expenses or loss of earnings. Thus, we indicated that the Board must consider loss of earnings, or support, and losses due to out-of-pocket expenses as separate items in assessing the existence of financial hardship under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 359 A.2d 84. <em>See also Gossard v. Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd., </em>279 Md. 309, 368 A.2d 443 (1977); <em>McGee v. Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd., </em>57 Md.App. 143, 469 A.2d 470 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Our cases thus make clear that it is the plain and unambiguous language of Art. 26A which must be applied in determining eligibility for an award. For example, \u00a7 7 flatly precludes any award unless the innocent crime victim has incurred minimum out-of-pocket expenditures of $100, or suffered a loss of two continuous weeks\u2019 earnings or support. Therefore, a crime victim who sustains a permanent partial disability, no matter how grievous, but who does not satisfy the minimum eligibility requirements would in no event be eligible for benefits under the Act. Moreover, under the Act\u2019s provisions, \u00a7 12(f)(1), a crime victim is not entitled to any award unless, by reason of serious financial hardship, \u201c \u2018financial assistance [is required] to meet the loss of earnings, support, <em>or </em>out-of-pocket expenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holmes, supra, </em>278 Md. at 65, 469 A.2d 470 (emphasis in original). These pecuniary loss criteria clearly limit the extent to which the Board may make an award where financial need is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The Act makes no provision for a compensatory award for a permanent partial disability independent of the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>pecuniary losses expressly enumerated in \u00a7 12(f)(1). Nor is there anything in \u00a7 12(b) of the Act, implicating the payment schedules of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which authorizes the Board to make any additional award to a claimant for permanent partial disability; indeed, that subsection merely establishes a framework within which the Board is to measure the maximum amount of benefits to be paid to an eligible claimant where a \u00a7 12(f)(1) award has been made. To adopt Williams\u2019 construction of the statute would be to sanction an award for a purpose and in an amount greater than that authorized by \u00a7 12(f)(1) without regard to serious financial hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Of course, as the Board readily acknowledges in its brief, a permanent impairment that prevents the victim from continuing to work full time, or that necessitates a change in duties entailing a reduction in earnings, may properly be compensated under \u00a7 12(f)(1) where financial hardship is established. On the other hand, where the victim\u2019s physical impairment causes no present loss of earnings, and there is no reasonably foreseeable prospect that the permanent injury will cause any loss in the future, it is the Board\u2019s position\u2014with which we agree\u2014that it may not award compensation for the mere impairment itself. Should it subsequently appear that the claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability will have a greater economic impact than originally determined, the Board may, under \u00a7 4(d) of the Act, \u201creinvestigate or reopen\u201d the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We thus conclude that the Board\u2019s function within the formulation of \u00a7 12(f)(1) is to determine the extent of the claimant\u2019s financial hardship as a result of the criminal activity. Therefore, a crime victim who demonstrates serious financial hardship by showing the requisite level of out-of-pocket expenses, and/or lost earnings, and/or loss of support, and who is compensated for those losses, is not entitled to further pecuniary recompense solely because he sustained a permanent injury, such as the loss of an eye. On the record in this case, there is no showing that Williams\u2019 permanent disability will in the future cause him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>additional expenditures or loss of income for which he will have the requisite degree of financial need under \u00a7 12(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The result we reach is consistent with the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute and with its plain and unambiguous terms. While a well-entrenched administrative construction of a statute is entitled to no weight where the statute is without ambiguity, <em>Macke Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 18, 22, 485 A.2d 254 (1984), we nevertheless note numerous synopses of claim dispositions made by the Board and reported in its annual reports in cases involving permanent partial disability. In the Board\u2019s <em>Second Annual Report </em>(1971), for example, the Board noted at 23, in adjudicating Claim No. 64-P-70, that it \u201chas repeatedly held that an anatomical disability without the showing of serious financial hardship, such as a loss of or diminution in earnings or an actual out-of-pocket loss, is not compensable under the statute.\u201d A number of the synopsized cases involved injuries to or loss of eyes. While the synopses are sketchy at best, in some of these cases the Board expressly stated that a disability award would not be made where the claimant had returned to work with no diminution in earnings (Claims 120-P-70, 85-P-71, 18-P-72, 208-P-74, 156-P-75, 184-P-75, 236-P-75, 259-P-78, 208-P-79, 29-P-82). In other cases the Board noted that there had been no diminution of earnings but did not expressly premise a denial of a disability award on the return to work (Claims 20-P-69, 62-P-69, 91-P-70, 286-P-70, 125-P-71, 18-P-72, 323-P-72, 551-P-83).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Consistent with these dispositions, General Assembly Delegate Dennis McCoy, a former Board member, made these observations in <em>Compensation for Victims of Crime, </em>8 Md.Bar J. 28, 30 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201c[M]any claims have been presented to the Board which do not result in a meaningful award. For example, many individuals who receive benefits under comprehensive health and accident insurance policies which pay the cost of medical treatment rendered for injuries received as the direct result of a criminal act and who are covered under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>salary continuation agreements or insurance contracts which pay loss of earnings while they are unable to work, do not suffer the required \u2018financial hardship\u2019 and do not receive compensation. Indeed, many claims have been filed by individuals who have suffered the loss of eyes, ears, hearing or sustained stab and gun shot wounds but who fall in the aforementioned categories and who, upon recovery, return to their previous employment at no diminution in earnings and are, therefore, excluded from meaningful recovery under this act. In these instances, the only recovery may be a minimal award for mutilation and disfigurement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The criminal victim compensation statutes in other jurisdictions, <em>see </em>n. 3, <em>supra, </em>have widely varying coverage and eligibility provisions and are, therefore, of little utility in interpreting the Maryland Act. We note, however, that six states have adopted the Uniform Crime Victims Reparations Act, formulated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws; that Act does not compensate \u201c \u2018pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, and other nonpecuniary loss.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>P.F. Rothstein, \u201cHow the Uniform Crime Victims Reparations Act Works,\u201d 60 American Bar Association Journal 1531, 1532 (1974). On the other hand, unlike Maryland, the statutes of other states, apparently on a tort theory of liability, permit recovery for the pain and suffering of the crime victim. <em>See, e.g., Application of Edmundson, </em>63 Hawaii 254, 625 P.2d 372, 375 (1981); <em>Ayers-Schaffner v. Solomon, </em>\u2014 R.I. \u2014, 461 A.2d 396 (1983). The New York statute, upon which the Maryland statute was patterned, <em>see Gould, supra, </em>273 Md. at 797, 331 A.2d 55, limits awards to actual economic losses based on serious financial hardship. <em>See Regan v. Crime Victims Compensation Bd., </em>57 N.Y.2d 190, 455 N.Y.S.2d 552, 441 N.E.2d 1070 (1982); <em>Rigaud v. Crime Victims </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>Compensation Bd., </em>461 N.Y.S.2d 840, 94 A.D.2d 602 (1983); <em>Gryziec v. Zweibel, </em>426 N.Y.S.2d 616, 74 A.D.2d 9 (1980). The Virginia statute, which contains significantly more liberal provisions than our own, recently was construed to permit a full 100-week award for loss of an eye even though the claimant's financial hardship was limited to nine weeks' actual loss of time from work. <em>See Marchand v. Div. of Crime Victims Comp., </em>230 Va. 460, 339 S.E.2d 175 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In view of the provisions of the Maryland Act, and considering the circumstances of this case as disclosed by the record, we hold that the Board properly limited its award to Williams to amounts which did not exceed his out-of-pocket expenses and lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">.
