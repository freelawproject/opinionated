On January 5, 1983, appellant, Frank A. Turner, pleaded guilty to one count of robbery with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to five years supervised probation. As one of the conditions of Turner\u2019s probation, he was required to pay court costs of $135.00 by May 4, 1983. Between March 4, and August 16, 1983, Turner made payments totalling $75.00. Thereafter, he made no payments. He was charged with violating the terms of his probation and was tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The judge found Turner guilty, revoked his probation and reimposed the original sentence. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in <em>Turner v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 1, 484 A.2d 641 (1984). We granted Turner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Turner argues that Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 38, \u00a7 4(c) clearly provides that no person shall suffer imprisonment for failing to pay court costs and that the trial judge erred in revoking his probation. He also contends that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Turner had the ability to pay the court costs was unsupported by the record and that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the judge\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous in this respect was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The State, on the other hand, argues that Art. 38, \u00a7 4 does not preclude the reimposition of a conditionally suspended sentence when a probationer fails to comply with that condition. Rather, the State asserts, the section prevents only the imposition of a term in addition to the original term for failure to pay costs. The State also argues that the record shows that Turner was financially able to pay the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Article 38, \u00a7 1 authorizes the court upon finding a person guilty of a crime to sentence that person to the fine or penalty prescribed and further provides that the person \u201cshall be liable for the costs of his prosecution; and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>default of payment of the <em>fine or penalty </em>he may be committed to jail in accordance with \u00a7 4 of this article until thence discharged by due course of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Section 4(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">Unless discharged by payment or service of imprisonment in default of a fine, a fine may be collected in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. Costs may be collected in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action, but shall not be deemed part of the penalty, and <em>no person shall be imprisoned under this section in default of payment of costs. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Court of Special Appeals analyzed these provisions, in responding to Turner\u2019s claim that revoking his probation for failure to pay costs violated the last sentence of \u00a7 4(c) of Article 38. We quote generously from the well-reasoned analysis stated for the intermediate appellate court by Judge Adkins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">Because we think there is a distinction between imposition of a suspended sentence of imprisonment upon violation of a condition of probation and imprisonment for non-payment of costs as a penalty for a crime, we reject [Turner\u2019s] argument. We explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">Article 27, \u00a7 639(a) permits a court to \u201csuspend sentence generally or for a definite time, and [to] make such orders and impose such terms as to costs, recognizance for appearance, or matters relating to the residence or conduct of the convicts as may be deemed proper____\u201d It has contained similar language as to costs ever since its initial enactment as Article 27 \u00a7 304A, by Ch. 402, Laws of 1894. <em>See Kelly v. State, </em>151 Md. 87, 99, 133 A. 899 (1926).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">Trial courts have invoked this authority and based suspension of sentence on the payment of costs, and have made payment of costs a condition of probation, <em>see, e.g., Shade v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 407, 306 A.2d 560 (1973) and <em>Rites v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 346, 290 A.2d 554 (1972). But we have found no reported Maryland appellate decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that squarely addresses the question whether revocation of probation for violation of this condition violates the provisions of Article 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">The portions of Article 38, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4(c) (particularly the latter) that now concern us were first enacted by Ch. 147, Laws of 1970. That Act embodied numerous statutory changes adopted (as its title instructs us) for the purpose, <em>inter alia, </em>of \u201celiminating imprisonment for the non-payment of costs of criminal prosecutions[,] ... eliminating such costs as part of any penalty, [and] amending the law generally with regard to the payment of fines and commitment for non-payment thereof.\u201d As to fines, the Act (to some degree readoptirig prior law) set limits on the period of incarceration permitted for non-payment of a fine. More importantly, it required a court to inquire into a defendant's \u201cfinancial and family situation and the reasons for nonpayment of the fine\u201d before imprisoning him for non-payment. Articles 38, \u00a7 4(b). It was an apparent response to the decisions in <em>Kelly v. Schoonfield, </em>285 F.Supp. 732 (D.Md.1968) and <em>Morris v. Schoonfield, </em>301 F.Supp. 158 (D.Md.1969). The judgment in <em>Morris </em>was vacated for reconsideration in light of Ch. 147 and <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970); <em>Morris v. Schoonfield, </em>399 U.S. 508, 90 S.Ct. 2232, 26 L.Ed.2d 773 (1970); <em>Arthur v. Schoonfield, </em>315 F.Supp. 548, 551 (D.Md.1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\"><em>Kelly </em>and <em>Morris </em>both dealt with the constitutionality of pre-1970 provisions of Article 38 with respect to imprisonment for non-payment of fines and costs. <em>Morris </em>squarely held that where indigents are involved, \u201cthe State cannot constitutionally include costs in the time to be served under Art. 38, section 4.\u201d 301 F.Supp. at 161.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">In <em>Arthur, </em>the United States District Court addressed the new Article 38 provisions adopted by Ch. 147. It concluded that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">the new statute places certain clear limitations on sentencing courts in Maryland, in order to avoid serious constitutional problems and to meet present-day stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>dards. One such limitation prevents imprisonment for non-payment of costs, [footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">315 F.Supp. at 552. What the <em>Arthur </em>court condemned, as violative both of new Art. 38, \u00a7 4 and of constitutional protections, was a practice of the former Municipal Court of Baltimore City. Under that practice, defendants sentenced to imprisonment were not assessed with court costs. Defendants sentenced only to fines were. The sentences were suspended upon condition of immediate payment of fines and costs, but those defendants who were unable to make contemporaneous payment were then committed for failure to pay, without any inquiry as to financial ability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">So far as court costs are concerned, the 1970 provisions of \u00a7 4(c) eliminated that problem. Costs are no longer a part of the penalty and no one may be sentenced to prison for failure to pay them. But the language of \u00a7 4(c) does not necessarily manifest a legislative intention to prohibit revocation of probation when costs are made a condition of probation and are not paid. In construing the statute in that context, we must seek out the true legislative intent, reading the law \u201cwithout forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation.\u201d <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702, 710, 481 A.2d 192 (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">Given the circumstances under which present \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4(c) were enacted, as well as the plain language of the new provisions, it is clear that they contain no limitation on requiring payment of court costs as a condition of probation. The statutory wording contains no explicit proscription to that effect. To imply such a proscription, moreover, would be inconsistent with the rule that statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed harmoniously if that is possible, giving effect to the provisions of each. <em>Board of Education of Howard County v. Howard County, Maryland, </em>45 Md.App. 358, 370, 413 A.2d 568 (1980). Article 27, \u00a7 639, as we have seen, expressly permits payment of costs as a condition of probation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>When the Article 38 provisions were modified in 1970, a number of other laws were also amended, but not Article 27, \u00a7 639. Both the Article 38 sections and \u00a7 639 were amended in the same Act in 1972\u2014Ch. 181 of the Laws of that year\u2014but the \u201ccosts\u201d provision of \u00a7 639 was untouched. Furthermore, that provision has been reenacted without change on numerous occasions, most recently by Ch. 98, Laws of 1982. All of this, it seems to us, manifests a legislative intention that the use of payment of costs as a condition of probation is not inconsistent with the Article 38 prohibition against imprisonment for nonpayment of costs that are not part of the penalty for a crime. <em>See Applestein v. Osborne, </em>156 Md. 40, 143 A. 666 (1928) and <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Laurel, </em>51 Md. 457 (1879).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">It is one thing for the legislature to say that costs are not part of the criminal penalty and that one may not be imprisoned because of their non-payment. It is quite another to say that when payment of costs are made a condition of probation, probation may not be revoked and the original punishment reimposed. Probation is an act of grace. <em>Kaylor v. State, </em>285 Md. 66, 75, 400 A.2d 419 (1979). It permits a court, in its discretion, to suspend what would be the normal penalty for violation of the criminal law in favor of conditions which, if performed, tend to promote the rehabilitation of the criminal as well as the welfare of society. <em>Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 275, 208 A.2d 575 (1965). In other words, in an appropriate case, the criminal defendant is given a second chance\u2014an opportunity to show that by performing the conditions of probation he can function as a law-abiding and useful member of society. If he faithfully performs those conditions, he is spared the more drastic punishment that generally follows a violation of the criminal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">If, however, the defendant fails to perform the conditions of probation he may forfeit the benefits of probation. In such a case, when the original sentence or some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>portion of it is reimposed, the \u201coriginal sentence is the only true punishment; the probation revocation is merely the withdrawal of favorable treatment previously afforded the defendant.\u201d <em>Clipper v. State, </em>295 Md. 303, 313, 455 A.2d 973 (1983). Thus, he is not imprisoned because court costs have been imposed as part of the criminal penalty; he is imprisoned because of reimposition of the original sentence, a result he has brought upon himself by failure to obey the conditions of probation. He is not imprisoned \u201cunder this section [Article 38, \u00a7 4] in default of payment of costs;\u201d he is imprisoned for violation of a condition of probation established under the authority of Article 27, \u00a7 639. Nor does the collection of costs via a probation condition violate the Article 38 provisions that \u201cunpaid costs ... <em>may </em>be levied and executed as for a judgment in a civil case\u201d (\u00a7 1) or that \u201c[cjosts <em>may </em>be collected in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action\u201d (\u00a7 4(c)) [emphasis supplied]. As use of the word \u201cmay\u201d demonstrates these provisions are neither exclusive nor mandatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">Courts costs, therefore, may be imposed as a condition of probation. We hold that Article 38, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4(c) are not involved when, because of breach of that condition, an original sentence of imprisonment is reimposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">61 Md.App. at 5-10, 484 A.2d at 643-45 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We agree with the intermediate appellate court up to this point; however, we think the Court of Special Appeals was wrong when it held that the trial judge\u2019s finding that Turner had the ability to pay the costs was not clearly erroneous. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">In <em>Humphrey v. State, </em>290 Md. 164, 428 A.2d 440 (1981), Judge Davidson noted for the Court the principles which a trial judge must follow in determining whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation for his failure to abide by a condition thereof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>A probationer is entitled to retain his liberty as long as he substantially abides by the conditions of his probation. Probation may not be revoked unless the probationer has in fact acted in violation of one or more conditions of his probation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">Generally, before probation may be revoked the State must prove that the probationer has not complied with one or more lawful conditions of probation. <em>Even then, ordinarily probation may not be revoked if the probationer proves that his failure to comply was not willful but rather resulted from factors beyond his control and through no fault of his </em>own____ Of course, if the probationer fails to carry this burden, the question whether to revoke probation is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.... The trial court\u2019s determination to revoke probation is reviewable by an appellate court \u201cfor the purpose of determining whether that discretion has been abused in any way or whether an erroneous construction has been placed by the trial judge on the conditions of the [probation].\u201d <em>Swan [v. State, </em>200 Md. 420, 425, 90 A.2d 690, 692 (1952).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">290 Md. at 167-68, 428 A.2d at 443 (emphasis supplied, citations omitted). In <em>Humphrey, </em>the defendant\u2019s probation was revoked and his original sentence reimposed because he failed to receive drug treatment. We held that the trial judge was in error in reinstating the defendant\u2019s sentence because the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8O\">repeatedly tried to comply with the special condition [that he receive drug treatment], engaged in no act of misconduct affecting others during the probationary period, and was prevented from complying with the special condition because of factors beyond his control[. Thus,] the record does not support a finding that the probationer acted in violation of the special condition of his probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">As in <em>Humphrey, </em>we believe that Turner has met his burden to show that the circumstances causing his inability to satisfy the condition of probation were beyond his control. In this instance, it was Turner\u2019s indigency which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the cause of his inability to pay. The Supreme Court has set forth numerous times that a defendant may not be imprisoned solely for failure to pay a fine where his failure to pay arose from his indigency. <em>Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983); <em>Tate v. Short, </em>401 U.S. 395, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971); <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">The Court in <em>Bearden </em>specifically held that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQX\">in revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay. If the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to pay, the court may revoke probation and sentence the defendant to imprisonment within the authorized range of its sentencing authority. If the probationer could not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to do so, the court must consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment. Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the State\u2019s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay. To do otherwise would deprive the probationer of his conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay the fine. Such a deprivation would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Id. </em>461 U.S. at 672-73, 103 S.Ct. at 2073, 76 L.Ed.2d at 233 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State showed only that Turner paid $75.00 of the $135.00 he was required to pay. Debra Williams, Turner\u2019s probation officer and the State\u2019s sole witness at the probation hearing, was asked on cross-examination by defense counsel whether Turner had been working during the period when he was placed on probation. Her response and the resulting colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>[Williams]: One time. A very short period. He worked with an uncle. The aunt told me. During the initial interview, I went out to the home and the grandmother told me he was working. However, when he came into the office he said he was unemployed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">[Mr. Raglin, Counsel for Turner]: Have you made any referrals to Man-Power for Mr. Turner or any of the other agencies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">A. One of my strongest points, sir, is resource finding and my clients can always come to me, you know, for different resources. In fact, Man-Power is right across the office in which I work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">Q. Are you familiar with Mr. Turner\u2019s financial situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">A. No, I am not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">Q. You don\u2019t know whether he has the ability to pay the money or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">A.

Sir, no, I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t truthfully honestly say that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFx\">On the other hand, Turner testified that he was an 18-year old man with a seventh grade education, and in response to counsel\u2019s question as to whether he had been working, he replied that he had not, but that he had \u201cbeen off and doing odd jobs with [his] father.\u201d The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">[Counsel for Turner]: You do odd jobs with your father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ2\">[Turner]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-13\">Q.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We believe that this evidence was sufficient to show that Turner failed to pay the costs because of his indigency and that he made bona fide efforts to find a job. The State offered absolutely no evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the State\u2019s own witness said that she knew nothing of Turner\u2019s financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On this record, then, we find that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous in finding that Turner had the ability to pay, and he abused his discretion when he revoked Turner\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">ELDRIDGE and COUCH, Judges, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">We concur in the result and in Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
