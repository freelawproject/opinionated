The trial judge subsequently determined that he should be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The case reaches us pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 414 stating that whenever the death penalty is imposed, we shall review the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">We shall reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial because we find a violation of Bloodsworth\u2019s rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>I SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Bloodsworth challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to convict. We first address that issue because if there were insufficient evidence to convict there could be no new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The applicable standard is whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The standard is derived from <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). <em>See Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 182-83, 502 A.2d 496, 498 (1986); <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 240, 424 A.2d 720, 725 (1981); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980). We summarize the evidence connecting Bloodsworth with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">A bloody rock was found at the scene where the body was discovered. There was testimony that no mention of the rock was made in the press releases. It was established that there was human blood on the rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Bloodsworth was identified by individuals other than young Christian Shipley and his companion, Jackie Poling, as being in the area before, during, and after the occurrence. Shipley said he and Jackie went fishing at a local pond. While they were there a man came down the path and stopped by to look at the turtle Jackie had caught. Shortly thereafter Dawn Hamilton, the victim, came by and said she was looking for her cousin, Lisa. The boys refused to help her find Lisa. However, the man agreed to help and walked off with Dawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Young Shipley provided a description for a composite picture of the man in question. He later picked out a person in a photoarray said by him to be the man at the pond. Later testimony confirmed this photo to be one of Bloodsworth. At a police line-up Shipley identified the man in the number six position as the person he saw go off with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Dawn. The man in the number six position was identified in court as Bloodsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Jackie Poling said he saw a man coming down the path but could not remember what he was wearing or what he looked like. He did testify that Dawn came to the pond looking for her cousin and left the pond with the man. He then testified that he went to the police station where he attended a line-up at which he picked out the wrong person because he was scared. When he left the line-up room he stated to his mother that he had picked out the wrong man because he was scared. He told his mother who the correct person was. That person was the individual in the number six position at the line-up. Because of Jackie\u2019s inability to remember what had occurred, the State introduced his statement taken the day of the murder and the statement he made after the line-up identification. The first statement corroborated his testimony and gave a description of the man. The second statement identified the person in the number six position as the individual he saw at the pond. Jackie\u2019s mother corroborated her son\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Donna Ferguson, a resident of the area, testified that she saw Dawn at approximately 10:30 a.m. talking to a man by a fence leading into the woods. She gave a description. She attended a police line-up where she picked out the person in the number six position as the man she had seen talking to Dawn. She made an in-court identification of Bloodsworth as the individual she had picked out of the line-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Detective Capel testified that he responded to a missing person\u2019s call placed by Bloodsworth\u2019s wife which led him eventually to his initial meeting with Bloodsworth in Cambridge. At that time he took a Polaroid photograph of Bloodsworth which he later inserted in the number four position in an array of six photographs shown to Jackie Poling and Chris Shipley. Capel testified that Poling did not identify Bloodsworth but that Shipley did identify him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the photoarray as the man he had seen with Dawn at the pond. The photoarray was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Detective Capel testified that he returned to Cambridge with a warrant for Bloodsworth\u2019s arrest and placed him under arrest. During an initial interview Capel took out a pair of white panties and placed them in front of Bloods-worth. He said Bloodsworth reacted to this by claiming that he did not hurt the girl and Bloodsworth also mentioned a bloody rock. The detective testified that only a few officers and the murderer knew about the rock and Bloodsworth was unable to explain his knowledge. Capel corroborated the line-up identifications of Bloodsworth by Poling, Shipley, Donna Ferguson, and two other individuals who said they had seen Bloodsworth in the neighborhood. He also identified the line-up photograph showing Bloods-worth in the number six position and the photoarray with him in the number four position.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Tina Christopher testified as to a conversation she had with Bloodsworth at Cambridge in which he talked about a little girl and clothing. She indicated that he said something happened to this little girl and the police had accused him of killing her. She recalled his discussing a bloody rock, light blue shorts and white top, and some other man who was with him who took the little girl off into the woods. Later in her testimony she again described a conversation with Bloodsworth immediately after he returned from the police station. At that time he discussed the girl, her clothes, the bloody rock, and a man who was with him who he claimed was supposed to have done the crime. Because of her inability to clearly remember the details of the situation, her statement to the police made at the time was also introduced into evidence and is discussed in Part 6 of this opinion (Past Recollection Recorded). The statement said in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201cQ. When Kirk came in and started talking, what did he say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201cA. He was talking about ... it was bits and pieces. I thought he was talking about his daughter. He starting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>talking about this little girl and her clothes and a beach. Something about a rock ... I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to him. Finally he started putting it all together. He said that him and someone else were down there talking with this little girl and boy, and the guy was with him said something to the little girl. The guy did something and the little girl ask him to help her find somebody. Then he said this guy went with the girl and then he stopped talking. I asked him who the guy was and he would not tell me. Then he come up with this little girl and talking about her again. It was like he was talking in a daze. He described her clothes and a rock that was suppose to be bloody. He said she was wearing a pair of light blue shorts and a white top and he said something again about a rock that was suppose to be bloody. Then he left and me and Tina and Bobby left. It was awhile and then he came back. Me and Tina were sitting in the living room and he was telling us that some officer took him down the police station and took pictures of them and he saw what was suppose to be the girls clothes and the rock laying beside them and he asked the officer was that the little girls clothes. When he got done telling us bits and pieces of that story, he kept asking me and Tina were we scared of him. I told him I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s about it____ He said if you are scared of me you don\u2019t have any reason to be, cause I did not do it. I don\u2019t know what he meant by that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The State\u2019s final witness was Rose Carson of Cambridge at whose home Bloodsworth stayed while he was in Cambridge. She said that he told her he had done something bad, that he was afraid his wife was not going to take him back, and that he hoped to get admitted to the State hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also told her he was suspected of killing and raping a little girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The evidence, as Bloodsworth points out, is almost entirely circumstantial, but, as Judge Henderson said for the Court in <em>Breeding v. State, </em>220 Md. 193, 198, 151 A.2d 743, 746 (1959), \u201cthat is not a fatal objection.\u201d See also <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 182, 201, 246 A.2d 568, 579 (1968). We think a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Bloodsworth committed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">II THE BRADY VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"AjD\">Bloodsworth filed a discovery motion which, in addition to a general request for all exculpatory material, requested \u201cthe names, addresses, and physical descriptions of any persons other than the defendant who were arrested or otherwise taken into custody by police or prosecution officials as a possible suspect in this case in which the defendant is charged.\u201d Later he requested production by the State of \u201cany and all information of which it is aware including but not limited to line-ups, photospreads, or reports to law enforcement authorities, identifying or suggesting that someone other than the Defendant ... was the perpetrator of this crime.\u201d He also requested the production of the notes of all police officers with respect to the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">As Bloodsworth puts it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cLimited information was produced by the prosecution concerning a Richard Gray. Based on the limited information supplied, the defense was able to elicit some testimony at trial casting suspicion on Gray. Gray, a newspaper deliverer, was discovered wandering in the woods in the vicinity of the crime shortly before the victim\u2019s body was found. He was wearing green camouflage fatigues and carrying a policeman\u2019s billy club. Gray directed the father of the victim to the victim\u2019s underwear which was hanging in the woods from a tree branch. Another pair of lady\u2019s underwear was found in the back seat of Gray\u2019s car during a consensual search. The police eliminated Gray as a suspect in the case based on interviews.\u201d (References to transcript pages omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>On the basis of <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Bloodsworth takes issue with the State\u2019s failure to provide the defense with a copy of a confidential report by Detective Mark Bacon. This report concluded with Bacon\u2019s \u201copinion that Mr. Gray has a great deal more information than he [is] releasing to us at this time, and as a result of this I feel that he should not be overlooked as a possible suspect in the above offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The report in question in some manner reached the hands of Bloodsworth\u2019s counsel between the guilt-innocence phase of the trial and the sentencing phase. Where it was in the interim we do not know. It and testimony from Detective Bacon were the subject of a motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. At that time the State informed the court that the prosecution had never had a copy of the confidential report. The assistant State\u2019s attorney said that he had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201copened up all of the police notebooks, of which there were some 4 huge notebook binders containing all the tips and information received, I think some 513 in number____ These files contain information regarding all the phone calls received, all the suspects developed. There were photographs included. There were rap sheets. [Defense counsel] had to spend a whole day going through all of these things in our office in this building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The prosecutors also noted that the indictment listed Gray as a State\u2019s witness and provided his address. Of course, the fact that the prosecutors were not in physical possession of the report is immaterial. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400-01, 49 L.Ed.2d 342, 353 (1976); <em>State v. Giles, </em>239 Md. 458, 470, 212 A.2d 101, 108 (1985), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>386 U.S. 66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">At the hearing on the motion for new trial Detective Bacon was produced as a witness. By that time he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>retired from the Baltimore County Police Department. He said his last duty was as a child abuse investigator. He related a call in regard to a search for a missing 9 year old white female. He testified that he was one of the officers who discovered the body of the victim in this case. He had occasion to come upon a person by the name of Richard Gray. Bloodsworth presents in his brief a fair summary of the Bacon testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201cWhen Bacon discovered Gray in the woods, Gray was very dirty except for his hands which were meticulously clean. A red spot that looked like blood was on Gray\u2019s shirt. Gray appeared quite nervous and vomited during or immediately after the search of his car. The underwear found in Gray\u2019s car was that of a small girl. Gray\u2019s explanation of the presence of the underwear was that he had found them in the woods a couple days earlier and was intending to take them home for his wife or daughter. Even before the victim was found, Gray referred to her pocketbook and gestured around his left shoulder to indicate that it was a shoulder bag. When the victim\u2019s body was found, there was a shoulder bag with the strap over her left shoulder as indicated by Gray. Before Gray could even know that the body was found, he told Detective Bacon that he hoped \u2018they get him\u2019 and \u2018bring him to justice,\u2019 and that he hated to see people \u2018abuse\u2019 little children. Bacon ran a check on Gray and found that he had a criminal conviction for indecent exposure and had been arrested for burglary. Bacon discovered some time later that Gray failed a police-administered polygraph examination in connection with this case.\u201d (References to transcript pages omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Bacon testified that he took a statement from Gray. That statement, apparently not disclosed to defense counsel prior to trial, was read by Bacon at the hearing on the motion for new trial. Bacon said he was dissuaded by his superiors from further investigation of Gray. On the subject of the cleanliness of Gray\u2019s hands, Bacon stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u201c[TJhere was approximately 30 to 40 newspapers that were rolled on the front seat of the car, which once again is inconsistent with Mr. Gray\u2019s hands being cleaned. Someone who had rolled 30 or 40 newspapers is going to have some black from the newspapers on his hands, and they are not going to be as clean as his were.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cWe now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d at 218.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Brady and a companion, Boblit, were found guilty of murder in the first degree and were sentenced to death. The Supreme Court summarized the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201cTheir trials were separate, petitioner being tried first. At his trial Brady took the stand and admitted his participation in the crime, but he claimed that Boblit did the actual killing. And, in his summation to the jury, Brady\u2019s counsel conceded that Brady was guilty of murder in the first degree, asking only that the jury return that verdict \u2018without capital punishment.\u2019 Prior to the trial petitioner\u2019s counsel had requested the prosecution to allow him to examine Boblit\u2019s extrajudicial statements. Several of those statements were shown to him; but one dated July 9, 1958, in which Boblit admitted the actual homicide, was withheld by the prosecution and did not come to petitioner\u2019s notice until after he had been tried, convicted, and sentenced, and after his conviction had been affirmed.\u201d 373 U.S. at 84, 83 S.Ct. at 1195, 10 L.Ed.2d at 217.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABL\">On appeal from a denial of post-conviction relief, this Court said in <em>Brady v. State, </em>226 Md. 422, 174 A.2d 167 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">\u201cWe think that there was a duty on the State to produce the confession of Boblit that he did the actual strangling or at least to inform counsel for the accused of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>its existence. The suppression or withholding by the State of material evidence exculpatory to an accused is a violation of due process.\u201d 226 Md. at 427, 174 A.2d at 169.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e concluded for the Court \u201cthat the withholding of this particular confession of Boblit\u2019s was prejudicial to the defendant Brady ... and that he was deprived of a constitutional right____\u201d 226 Md. at 430, 174 A.2d at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Last year in <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), the Supreme Court set forth the test to be applied to an evaluation of <em>Brady </em>material. In the opinion of Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice O\u2019Connor, the test is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cThe evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d 473 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 3384, 87 L.Ed.2d at 495.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Justice White, in a concurring opinion joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Rehnquist, said he agreed with this statement. 473 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 3385, 87 L.Ed.2d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">In <em>Brady, </em>226 Md. at 430, 174 A.2d at 171, Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e said for the Court, \u201cNot without some doubts, we conclude that the withholding of this particular confession of Boblit\u2019s was prejudicial to the defendant Brady.\u201d We have some doubts in this case. Had defense counsel had this report before trial and not followed up upon it we undoubtedly would be met with a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to investigate. <em>See, e.g., State v. Calhoun, </em>306 Md. 692, 511 A.2d 461 (1986); <em>State v. Tichnell, </em>306 Md. 428, 509 A.2d 1179 (1986); and <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 496 A.2d 1074 (1985). All factors considered we conclude that the undisclosed report is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>cient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. Hence, there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Bloodsworth raises several contentions which, in the light of the fact that we are remanding the case for a new trial, we are not obliged to decide. However, in the interest of judicial economy we shall address certain of them for the guidance of the trial judge upon the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">A. THE FOOTWEAR</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The Medical Examiner\u2019s report said, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAc\">\u201cIn the lower part of the neck in the front there was a patterned mark, an abrasion that went across the front of the lower neck. It had a somewhat herringbone appearance. A similar pattern was also seen in the back of the neck at the lower part where the muscles of the shoulders come together at the lower part of the neck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">This served to create an area of contention in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AFu\">Bloodsworth says: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201cOver repeated objections by defense counsel, the prosecution introduced evidence comparing shoeprints from a pair of tennis shoes which the prosecution claimed belonged to Appellant with photographs purporting to show marks inflicted upon the victim\u2019s body. The evidence should not have been admitted because the prosecution witness was not qualified as an expert, a proper foundation for the use and admission of the photographs was not laid, the method of comparison used was not shown to be reliable or generally accepted in the field, the tennis shoes were not shown to belong to or have been worn by Appellant, and the shoe prints were not sufficiently distinct to permit a valid comparison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Bloodsworth introduced evidence from an expert to the effect that the seized shoes in question were five half sizes too small for Bloodsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The evidence was such that the State was forced in closing argument to concede that the shoeprint evidence \u201cdoes not point to the Defendant, and we candidly admit that to you all, but neither does it eliminate him, nor does it point to anyone else. It is just neutral evidence.\u201d In this circumstance we doubt that this evidence will be introduced on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">B. EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AFc\">Bloodsworth takes exception to the refusal of the trial court to permit testimony on the issue of eyewitness identification from Dr. Robert Buckhout, a professor of psychology in the City University of New York at Brooklyn College.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Nowhere in Bloodsworth\u2019s statement of facts, his brief, or the actual testimony of Dr. Buckhout are we provided with a summary of just what he intended to prove by this expert testimony. The nearest one can come to it is the answer given to the trial judge at the conclusion of direct and cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m trying to find out what basically you would say. Would you be conveying to the jury the unreliableness of eye-witness testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: We would only, I would only be estimating what the research shows. I don\u2019t have a particularly overall general condemnation of eye witnesses at issue. That has never been a factor at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cMy belief and sort of underlying theory is that eye witnesses are really confronted with a difficult situation, and when the circumstances add up to a very difficult challenge to the memory system, these are the things that can happen to various parts of their testimony and various parts of their identification, and testing methods, of course, is one of the areas that I have done most of my work on, and the testing method again I see as simply a tool, and the checklist is simply to provide to the jury, or elements of the checklist are provided to the jury so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>they can essentially assess what, at least, the filter of the scientist would say about a given test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cIn some states I have been asked, in fact, I was pushed in one case fairly recently to give an opinion on the line-up or the photo spreads in evidence. Your Honor, forgive me if I must be very honest to say that I don\u2019t know how far Maryland law, as opposed to other law, would permit that type of testimony to go, but I think still that that would be merely advisory. I would only look on the test simply as a tool and nothing more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">In excluding this testimony the trial judge said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cI am concerned that the possibility of admitting the evidence would tend to confuse or mislead the jury. This is not just a matter of usurping the province of the jury, although it is in my judgment most certainly that, it is also that such testimony is of little value in aiding the jury in this case. I\u2019m not persuaded that the testimony will be helpful to the jury in understanding the evidence in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The trial judge regarded the standard for admissibility to be, as we held in <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 381, 391 A.2d 364, 368 (1978), as set forth in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 Fed. 1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923), that is whether it is generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field. As indicated, however, he did not confine himself to that in his rejection. He further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">\u201cIt seems to me that the reliability of the witnesses and the identification witnesses is better tested by the cathartic effect of cross-examination than by the opinion of an expert. The expert has not heard the testimony as it came from the witnesses on the witness stand under oath, nor has he had the opportunity to view them, to observe their demeanor and the manner of testifying. The jury has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">\u201cAs you all know, when the court instructs the jury, included in those instructions is a number of suggestions of what the jury ought to be looking for and how the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>should test the credibility of the witness, whether or not the testimony is reliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">\u201cFor two reasons: One the failure of the defense to persuade this Court that the technique has general acceptance in the relevant scientific community. It utterly fails in that respect, and this Court is bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Reed v. State </em>and subsequent cases that say that the threshold question shall be determined by the application of the <em>Frye </em>standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cBeyond that, even if it were a technique generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, the proffer is not sufficient to persuade me first, exactly what is even being offered to the jury other than some generalized explanation of the studies that have been made. Nothing that has been proffered suggests that it will be helpful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cIt will be helpful but causes me to be concerned that it may usurp the jury\u2019s province in determining the reliability of the identification in this case, so on both counts, the Defendant has failed to make a case for the use of Doctor Buckhout\u2019s testimony in this case. The motion in limine is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">There is a split of authority around the country relative to admissibility of evidence such as that of Dr. Buckhout here. Much of this proffered evidence consists of testimony from Dr. Buckhout or his associate in experimentations, Elizabeth Loftus.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Bloodsworth relies heavily on <em>United States v. Downing, </em>753 F.2d 1224 (3d Cir. 1985). That court rejected the <em>Frye </em>test, saying it \u201csuffers from serious flaws\u201d and \u201chas proved to be too malleable to provide the method for orderly and uniform decision-making envisioned by some of its proponents.\u201d It observed that \u201cin its pristine form the general acceptance standard reflects a conservative approach to the admissibility of scientific evidence that is at odds with the spirit, if not the precise language, of the Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237. The court referred to Fed.R.Evid. 702:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Third Circuit then proceeded to lay down its own rules for testing such evidence, which it summarized at the outset of its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMl\">\u201cFirst, the evidence must survive preliminary scrutiny in the course of an in limine proceeding conducted by the district judge. This threshold inquiry, which we derive from the helpfulness standard of Rule 702, is essentially a balancing test, centering on two factors: (1) the reliability of the scientific principles upon which the expert testimony rests, hence the potential of the testimony to aid the jury in reaching an accurate resolution of a disputed issue; and (2) the likelihood that introduction of the testimony may in some way overwhelm or mislead the jury. Second, admission depends upon the \u2018fit/ i.e., upon a specific proffer showing that scientific research has established that particular features of the eyewitness identifications involved may have impaired the accuracy of those identifications. The district court\u2019s assessment of these factors will guide its discretion in deciding whether to admit the evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 702, which contemplates a liberal view toward the admissibility of expert testimony generally. The district court\u2019s ruling under Fed. R. Evid. 702 will be reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard. Finally, the district court retains discretionary authority under Fed. R. Evid. 403 to exclude any relevant evidence that would unduly waste time or confuse the issues at trial.\u201d 753 F.2d at 1226.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">It remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing in the trial court concerning the admissibility of the proffered expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>testimony. What Bloodsworth does not tell us is that on the remand, <em>United States v. Downing, </em>609 F.Supp. 784 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff'd mem., </em>780 F.2d 1017 (3d Cir.1985), the trial court refused to permit the evidence of Dr. Buckhout, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cIt is perhaps in establishing the \u2018fit\u2019 between the scientific research presented by Dr. Buckhout and the disputed factual issues of this case that defendant\u2019s argument for the admission of expert testimony is weakest.\u201d 609 F.Supp. at 792.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">It reinstated the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Cases in which expert testimony on eyewitness identification has been approved include <em>United States v. Smith, </em>736 F.2d 1103 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 868, 105 S.Ct. 213, 83 L.Ed.2d 143 (1984); <em>State v. Chapple, </em>135 Ariz. 281, 660 P.2d 1208 (1983); <em>People v.

De Sisto[, </em>329 F.2d 929], 934 [ (2d Cir.1964)]. In <em>De Sisto, </em>a truck driver, victim of a hijacking, testified as to the identity of the hijacker and gave conflicting testimony regarding the presence or absence of tattoo marks on the accused\u2019s arms. Judge Friendly wrote that the jury was \u2018superbly equipped\u2019 to evaluate the impact of the stress during the hijacking on the perception of the identification witness. <em>De Sisto, supra, </em>at 934. It is the responsibility of counsel during cross-examination to inquire into the witness\u2019 opportunity for observation, his capacity for observation, his attention and interest and his distraction or division of attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cIndeed, the research of Dr. Robert Buckout [sic], whose expertise in the area of perception was acknowledged by the Government (although he was not to testify at the trial) indicates that the effects of stress on perception can be effectively communicated to the jury by probing questioning of the witnesses. In his study, Dr. Buckout [sic] reports that eye-witnesses do reply \u2018I can\u2019t recall, it happened so fast\u2019 [Record at 140]. Certainly effective cross-examination is adequate to reveal any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>inconsistencies or deficiencies in the eye-witness testimony. Here defense counsel uncovered no confusion or uncertainty as to identity in any of the various witnesses. Furthermore, not all witnesses were under similar conditions of stress: one saw the accused as he sat in his car blocking the accused\u2019s exit from the bank parking lot, another saw the accused from the safety of her house as he returned to his truck after having robbed the bank, yet another saw him as he entered the bank and approached the teller to whom he delivered the threatening note.\u201d 488 F.2d at 1153.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In <em>Porraro, 121 </em>R.I. 882, 404 A.2d 465, the trial court excluded testimony of a psychology professor \u201cproffered as an expert witness on the factors that affect the reliability of eyewitness identifications\u201d on the grounds that \u201cit would effectively invade the province of the jury\u201d and \u201cthat admitting this testimony would open a floodgate whereby experts would testify on every conceivable aspect of a witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d The Supreme Court of Rhode Island said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7g\">\u201cWe are persuaded that the subject matter of the proffered testimony in this case, the trustworthiness in general of eyewitness observations, was not beyond the ken of the jurors and therefore the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in excluding this evidence. Through cross-examination, defense counsel was able to probe into the witness\u2019 capacity and opportunity for observation, her attention, interest and distraction. The jury was perfectly capable of assessing the witness\u2019 credibility by weighing the inconsistencies and deficiencies elicited in cross-examination. We also note that this precise issue has arisen on innumerable occasions in other jurisdictions. The reported decisions have uniformly sustained a trial justice\u2019s discretionary decision to exclude exactly the same type of expert testimony that defendant has sought to place before the jury in this case. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

EXCLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE PROFFERED BY BLOODSWORTH</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The State called Detective Robert Capel as a witness. On direct examination he testified as to the composite sketch and photographic identification made by Christian Shipley. He also testified as to line-up identifications of Bloodsworth by five witnesses. On cross-examination the defense sought to question Capel regarding a line-up conducted at the same time as the other line-ups in which someone other than Bloodsworth was identified. He was asked whether he talked to Debra McNamara in the case. He replied in the affirmative. An objection was sustained to a question as to whether she attended the line-up. He was asked whether she gave a description. A bench conference followed the objection of the State at which time the defense said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to call her as a witness. I can\u2019t vouch for her. I think she\u2019s way off, she is the one that, to refresh your recollection, is the one that said that Kirk Bloods-worth was nude in the woods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Defense counsel indicated that his \u201cpurpose [was] to bring out the fact that there were statements made by witnesses who identified Mr. Bloodsworth that the police obviously did not believe, even though they went to a line-up and they identified him.\u201d He said he thought \u201cthe jury has a right to know that people who they brought in were not able to identify Kirk Bloodsworth. That\u2019s exculpatory evidence, and I think Miss McNamara\u2019s testimony is exculpatory.\u201d The trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">\u201cIt\u2019s available for you, if you want to call the witnesses, but it is hearsay otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defense also sought to question Capel regarding a second composite sketch. At the bench as a reason for the State\u2019s objection it was stated that defense counsel was \u201cabout to get into the making of a composite with a witness who has not testified and is not going to be called by the State and is certainly available to the Defendant.\u201d The defense agreed that Fay McCullough was the witness in question. The trial court found such evidence to be hearsay and excluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defense called Detective Hessie as a witness. He was asked to tell the jury what description he had of the suspect. The trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you ask him what the description is, when it is clear from this report, that description up here is very probably not a description given down here or given by Chris or Jackie Poling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">\u201cThis up here is a description that was put together by others from various sources, and I think it would be highly improper to let that come in in this fashion. If you want to ask him what the source of his information is and then go to the source, it\u2019s up to you, but I\u2019m not going to let you ask him what the description is in this fashion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The defense called Officer Pacquin as a witness. He testified as to investigation in the neighborhood two days after the murder. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cWe knocked on the door, and we asked them if they had seen anything in the area and if they had seen anything on the date of that offense, if they have seen any suspicious people or anything, vehicles in the area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\">He was then asked whether he gave the people a description of the suspect for whom they were looking. He replied that he \u201ctold them basically what [the police] were looking for and asked them if they had seen it.\u201d The next question was as to what description he gave these people. In response to the objection the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cThe danger of that, Mr. Scheinin, as you well know is to confuse the jury. It has no probative value in this case based on the evidence that has been submitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asb\">Bloodsworth sees himself as having been denied due process rights, citing <em>Foster v. State, </em>297 Md. 191, 464 A.2d 986 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1073, 104 S.Ct. 985, 79 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); <em>Austin v. State, </em>253 Md. 313, 252 A.2d 797 (1969), and <em>DeLilly v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 676, 276 A.2d 417 (1971). We deem those cases inapposite. He also says the exclusion violated Maryland rules of evidence, citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 206 A.2d 138 (1965), and <em>Judy v. State, </em>218 Md. 168, 146 A.2d 29 (1958). We had occasion to refer to <em>Johnson </em>in <em>Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 176-77, 443 A.2d 78, 80 (1982), where we discussed circumstances pertaining to an extrajudicial identification. The circumstances here do not fit our prior Maryland cases. The trial judge was correct in his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">E. PAST RECOLLECTION RECORDED</p>\n<p id=\"AMx\">The State called as a witness Tina Christopher who had had conversations with Bloodsworth in Cambridge shortly after his initial contact with Baltimore County police in Cambridge. After some questioning of her the State asked to have a statement Miss Christopher had given to the police marked for identification. She was then asked if she remembered talking to the police about the conversation she had with Bloodsworth. She replied in the affirmative. In response to a question she said that it was maybe a month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>or a couple of months after the conversation that she talked with the police. The record then is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cQ How well did you remember the conversation you had had with Mr. Bloodsworth when you were talking to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cQ How well do you remember it today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201cA Not too good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">She was then shown the typewritten statement and identified her signature on each page thereof. She said she reviewed the statement before she signed it and the statements appearing in it were true. The State then sought to introduce the statement into evidence. Bloodsworth\u2019s objection was sustained and the witness was permitted to r\u00e9view the statement to refresh her recollection. She was questioned further. Defense counsel asked that she not read from the statement. After further questioning the record is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201cQ Now, do you remember anything more without looking at your statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The statement was then admitted into evidence as past recollection recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Bloodsworth contends that there was error in admitting the statement because \u201c[t]here was no showing that Christopher\u2019s present recollection was impaired,\u201d referring to <em>Mouzone v. State, </em>294 Md. 692, 701, 452 A.2d 661, 666 (1982). There the Court said, \u201cAt a minimum, in order to qualify as past recollection recorded, the party who seeks to move the statement into evidence must show some impairment of present recollection.\u201d Further objection is made on the basis that Miss Christopher said the statement was made a month or two after she talked to Bloodsworth. Bloodsworth notes that the statement is dated August 10, 1984, two days after the conversation occurred. It is asserted, \u201cEven if the date on the statement takes precedence over Christopher\u2019s testimony, two days is too long to satisfy the contemporaneous requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>E. Cleary, <em>McCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence, </em>\u00a7 299 (3d ed. 1984) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201cAs the rule permitting the introduction of past recollection recorded developed, it required that four elements be met: (1) the witness must have had firsthand knowledge of the event, (2) the written statement must be an original memorandum made at or near the time of the event and while the witness had a clear and accurate memory of it, (3) the witness must lack a present recollection of the event, and (4) the witness must vouch for the accuracy of the written memorandum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">At \u00a7 301 McCormick states, \u201c[T]he tendency seems to be towards acceptance of the formulation favored by Wigmore which would require only that the writing be made or recognized at a time when the events were fairly fresh in the mind of the witness.\u201d This is the formulation adopted in Fed R. Evid. 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In <em>United States v. Williams, 571 </em>F.2d 344 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 841, 99 S.Ct. 131, 58 L.Ed.2d 139 (1978), the court approved admission of a statement given by a witness to a Secret Service agent approximately six months after the events recited in the statement. In <em>United States v. Senak, </em>527 F.2d 129, 136-42 (7th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 1500, 47 L.Ed.2d 758 (1976), the court approved admission of a statement given by a witness for the prosecution to the Federal Bureau of Investigation three years after the events described therein. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201c[T]he fact that there is no rule, other than the credibility scrutiny of the trier of fact, which curtails the lapse of time applicable to the live witness on the stand, would suggest that we should not arbitrarily say any given length of time is too long for the statement-giver to have an accurate memory and for a proper application of the past recollection recorded procedure.\u201d 527 F.2d at 141.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The impairment of the witness\u2019 memory was demonstrated by the record. Any lapse of time between the date of the occurrence and the date of the statement, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>we presume here to have been two days, would <em>go </em>to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility. There was no error in admitting the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">F. THE VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Bloodsworth takes issue with the admission of the victim impact statement. He contends that Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol., 1985 Cum. Supp.) Art. 41, \u00a7 124 (which calls for the admission of victim impact statements in capital proceedings) is unconstitutional, although he recognizes, as he must, that in <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>302 Md. 691, 735-49, 490 A.2d 1228, 1251-58 (1985), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1452, 89 L.Ed.2d 711 (1986), we held to the contrary. We have reaffirmed that holding in <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 172, 222-23, 507 A.2d 1098, 1123-24 (1986), and in <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 752-54, 506 A.2d 580, 614 (1986). We deem the matter closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL; BALTIMORE COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">COLE, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">.
