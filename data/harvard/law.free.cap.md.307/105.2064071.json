She wrapped the body in plastic garbage bags and deposited it in the backyard of her home. She now seeks to obtain the property left her under her mother\u2019s will. George Benjamin Ford, Jr., her son, asserts that Pearl forfeited her entitlement to the property by the matricide and claims the property as the alternative beneficiary named in the will. The Orphans\u2019 Court for Anne Arundel County, in which the will was admitted to probate, ruled that George \u201cbe declared the heir\u201d of the estate. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, on appeal by Pearl to it, decided that Pearl was entitled to the property. We ordered that a writ of certiorari be issued to the Court of Special Appeals, to which George appealed, before decision by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The Maryland Legislature has not enacted a \u201cslayer\u2019s\u201d statute establishing what principles govern when a person kills another and would be tangibly enriched by the death. This Court, however, has addressed the matter in three of its decisions: <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 165 A. 470 (1933); <em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. 564, 150 A.2d 251 (1959); and <em>Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 315 A.2d 513 (1974). Through these cases the Court has created in the common law of this State, the equivalent of a \u201cslayer\u2019s\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>statute, which we shall refer to herein as the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><em>Price </em>concerned an appeal from an Orphans\u2019 Court order passed in the administration of the estate of an intestate. The order excluded from participation in the distribution of the estate the heirs or personal representatives of the husband of the deceased, who, it was admitted and proved, shot and killed his wife and almost immediately thereafter committed suicide. The question before this Court was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3D\">Can a murderer, or his heirs and representatives through him, be enriched by taking any portion of the estate of the one murdered? 164 Md. at 506, 165 A. 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The Court dealt with the question as one of first impression in Maryland and noted the conflicting decisions of other courts of last resort in this country. The decisions at that time represented two views.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">One line of decisions apply the common-law principle of equity that no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, to take advantage of his own wrong, to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime, and hold that provisions of a will and the statutes of descent and distribution should be interpreted in the light of those universally recognized principles of justice and morality; that such interpretation is justified and compelled by the public policy embraced in those principles or maxims, which must control the interpretation of law, statutes, and contracts. The other and opposite view, as expressed in those decisions which reach a different conclusion, is that, while they recognize the public policy of the common law as declared in the principles and equitable maxims above set forth, such public policy founded upon the common law has been abrogated and denied, and a new and different public policy declared by the Legislature in the enactment of statutes to direct descents and distribution, or governing the execution and effect of testamentary disposition. Some of the courts in the last mentioned group also rely upon constitutional or statutory declarations to the effect that conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>crime shall not work a corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate. <em>Id. </em>at 506-507, 165 A. 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The Court fully discussed the two views and forcefully rejected any view which would \u201cresult in sanctioning the enrichment of the perpetrator of the most heinous murder from the estate of his victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516-517, 165 A. 470.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATR\">Suffice it to say that we decline to follow the reasoning supporting any interpretation fraught with consequences so pernicious and so abhorrent to the sense of justice, equity, and morality entertained by what we are pleased to believe is the overwhelming majority of thoughtful and moral people, but prefer to give expression and adherence to the principles and reasoning so forcibly presented by those courts who have in the past adopted the views ... expressed [in the common law]. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 165 A. 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">We observed in <em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. at 567, 150 A.2d 251, that the decision in <em>Price, </em>which \u201cwas rested upon the maxim that one cannot profit by his own wrong, and on a broad ground of public policy of the common law,\u201d was perhaps not then supported by a majority of the courts dealing with the question. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d we declared, \u201cwe regard the decision of the Maryland Court [in <em>Price </em>] as settled law.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>219 Md. at 567, 150 A.2d 251. Thus, it is the basic rule of this State that a murderer, or his heirs or representatives through him, ordinarily may not profit by taking any portion of the estate of the one murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The Court in <em>Price </em>indicated that \u201cthe equitable maxims of the common law\u201d which it followed in answering the question before it, would apply not only in the case of intestacy but equally to benefits by way of wills and life insurance policies. 164 Md. at 516, 165 A. 470. <em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. 564, 150 A.2d 251, involved the proceeds of a life insurance policy. The question was whether a wife, named as the beneficiary under the policy upon the life of her husband, \u201cwas disqualified from recovering the proceeds by reason of the fact that she killed her husband, was tried on a charge of murder,\u201d and was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. 219 Md. at 565, 150 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>A.2d 251.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The criminal court judge had found the beneficiary not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, without designating, of course, whether it was voluntary or involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was contended in the civil proceeding that \u201can unintentional killing, even though unlawful and felonious,\u201d is not a bar to recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 150 A.2d 251. We did not reach that point, however, because the facts clearly supported a finding by the criminal court judge that the killing was intentional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was \u201cno room for a contention that the [killing] was merely negligent and unintended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 150 A.2d 251. We held that where the killing is both felonious and intentional, the beneficiary cannot prevail. <em>Id. </em>In that context, we refused to distinguish between murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In <em>Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 315 A.2d 513, we were presented with virtually the same question we did not reach in Chase\u2014whether the named beneficiary under a life insurance policy is precluded from collecting the proceeds by reason of the fact that he <em>unintentionally </em>killed his wife, the insured; the homicide was the result of gross negligence.. We found that \u201cthe overwhelming weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>authority allows recovery where the beneficiary causes the death of the insured unintentionally or not feloniously.\u201d 271 Md. at 188, 315 A.2d 513 (citations omitted). We observed, on the authority of cases cited, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As4\">[t]he rule which prevents a beneficiary who has intentionally killed the insured from recovering on an insurance policy is grounded on the public policy against permitting a wilful and felonious killer to profit by his felony. Thus, it has no application where even though the acts of the beneficiary cause death, they are without the intent to do so, <em>Tippens v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>[99 F.2d 671 (5th Cir.1938)] <em>supra; </em>where the death is the result of accident, or even when caused by such gross negligence on the part of the beneficiary that he is guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the beneficiary may still recover, <em>Commercial Travelers Mutual Acc. Ass \u2019n v. Witte, </em>[406 S.W.2d 145 (Ky.1966) ] <em>supra; </em>the basic rule is that while a beneficiary cannot recover where the death of the insured has been intentionally caused by his act, if it is the result of carelessness and is not intentional, the beneficiary\u2019s rights under the policy are not barred____ <em>Id. </em>[271 Md.] at 188-189, 315 A.2d 513 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOR\">We held that the husband (the beneficiary) was not barred from recovering the policy proceeds merely because the death of his wife (the insured) \u201cwas the result of his gross negligence where that determination was accompanied by an express finding that the death was caused unintentionally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 315 A.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">As established by <em>Price, Chase </em>and <em>Schifanelli, </em>the present status of the law of Maryland is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">1) A person who kills another</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">a) <em>may not </em>share in the distribution of the decedent\u2019s estate as an heir by way of statutes of descent and distribution, or as a devisee or legatee under the decedent\u2019s will, nor may he collect the proceeds as a beneficiary under a policy of insurance on the decedent\u2019s life when the homicide is felonious and intentional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>b) <em>may </em>share in the distribution of the decedent\u2019s estate as an heir by way of statutes of descent and distribution, or as a devisee or legatee under the decedent\u2019s will and <em>may </em>collect the proceeds as a beneficiary under a policy of insurance on the decedent\u2019s life when the homicide is unintentional even though it is the result of such gross negligence as would render the killer criminally guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">2) These principles apply not only to the killer but to those claiming through or under him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">3) The disposition of a criminal cause is not conclusive of the character of the homicide or of the criminal agency of the putative killer in a civil proceeding concerning entitlement to assets of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">a) It is not dispositive that no criminal prosecution was brought against the alleged killer, or that charges against him were dismissed on constitutional, statutory or procedural grounds or otherwise, or that, upon a criminal trial, he was found not guilty for whatever reason, or was convicted of murder in the first or second degree or of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">b) In the determination of who is entitled to the assets of the decedent, whether the alleged killer was the criminal agent and whether the homicide was intentional and felonious or unintentional is a function within the ambit of the civil proceeding. In short, the lack of or result of a criminal proceeding is not res judicata in a subsequent civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">It is not disputed that Pearl killed her mother and that under the criminal law she was guilty of first degree murder in that the homicide was \u201cwilful, deliberate and premeditated.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 407. Were this the posture of the case, it is clear that under the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule\u201d adopted by the <em>Price-Chase-Schifanelli </em>trilogy, Pearl would be precluded from sharing in the estate of her victim; her conduct would be both feloni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ous and intentional. But in addition to the fact that Pearl was the criminal agent of a first degree murder, it is also undisputed that at the time the crime was committed, she was not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, she stands as guilty of murder in the first degree but insane. <em>See generally Pouncey v. State, </em>297 Md. 264, 465 A.2d 475 (1983) (Criminal defendant can be found both guilty of the crime and insane at the time of its commission). The question is, therefore, what impact does the fact that Pearl was \u201cinsane\u201d at the time she committed the crime have on the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule\u201d established by <em>Price-Chase-Schifanelli ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Maryland Legislature has substantially changed the definition and consequences of \u201ccriminal insanity\u201d from the concept of the common law evidenced by the M\u2019Naghten-Spencer rule. <em>See </em>Acts 1967, ch. 709; Acts 1970, ch. 407; Acts 1982, ch. 21; Acts 1984, ch. 501; <em>see also, Pouncey v. State, supra; Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 399 A.2d 578 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 960, 101 S.Ct. 1419, 67 L.Ed.2d 384 (1981); <em>Spencer v. State, </em>69 Md. 28, 13 A. 809 (1888); <em>Young v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 538, 288 A.2d 198 (1972). The M\u2019Naghten-Spencer test of responsibility for criminal conduct came to be expressed as whether the accused had the capacity and reason to distinguish between right and wrong and understand the nature and consequences of his acts as applied to himself. <em>Bradford v. State, </em>234 Md. 505, 510, 200 A.2d 150 (1964). Under this test, <em>mens rea </em>cannot exist without sanity. In other words, insanity as defined under M\u2019Naghten-Spencer \u201cinvolves the <em>mens rea </em>or intent which is an essential element of the offense which the State must prove.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 200 A.2d 150. It follows that if an accused is found to be insane under that test, he must be acquitted for he did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the requisite intent so as to make his conduct criminal, and thus could not be said to have committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The statutory definition of \u201ccriminal insanity\u201d which supplanted the M\u2019Naghten-Spencer test, is, as in effect today and at the time Pearl murdered her mother, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">[a] defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation, lacks substantial capacity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">(1) To appreciate the criminality of that conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(2) To conform that conduct to the requirements of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Md.Code (1982, 1985 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 12-108 (a) of the Health-General Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">We have declared that, unlike a finding of insanity under the M\u2019Naghten-Spencer test, under the statutory test</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFH\">the clear legislative intent regarding the successful interposition of a plea of insanity is not that an accused is to be found not guilty of the criminal act it was proved he committed, but that he shall not be punished therefor. <em>Langworthy, </em>284 Md. at 598, 399 A.2d 578.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">We noted in <em>Langworthy </em>that a finding that a defendant was insane at the time of the commission of the crime under the statutory test did not mean that there was no crime thereby establishing a lack of <em>mens rea. </em>We thought that neither prong of the test \u201cis necessarily at variance with a general intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599 n.12, 399 A.2d 578 (citation omitted). We applied these views in <em>Pouncey v. State, </em>297 Md. 264, 465 A.2d 475. In that case a mother drowned her child and was convicted of first degree murder and found to be insane at the time of the commission of the crime. We declared that a criminal defendant may be found guilty but insane. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 465 A.2d 475. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>a finding of insanity is not tantamount to an absence of <em>mens rea, </em>or inconsistent with a general intent to commit a crime. In drowning her child, the [mother] specifically intended to kill him,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and while her successful insanity defense means that she is not criminally responsible for her conduct, that determination merely relieves her of liability for punishment under the criminal law. No criminal sentence may ever be entered on the guilty verdict in this case and the appellant, therefore, does not stand \u2018convicted\u2019 of the murder offense in the traditional sense of the criminal law. <em>Id. </em>at 269-270, 465 A.2d 475.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The comments of the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Review the Defense of Insanity, which proposed the legislation enacted by Acts 1984, ch. 501, support this view. With respect to the test for insanity set out in \u00a7 12-108(a) of the Health Article, the Task Force commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">The traditional theory that an insanity defense if proved means that the defendant was mentally incapable of forming criminal intent is not an established fact under the definition of criminal responsibility in \u00a7 12-108 of [the Health-General Article]. \u2018... as presently defined, neither prong of the insanity defense\u2014either lack of capacity \u201c[t]o appreciate the criminality of one\u2019s conduct\u201d [\u00a7 12-108(a)(l) of this title] or the lack of capacity \u201c[t]o conform that conduct to the requirements of law\u201d [\u00a7 12-108(a)(2) of this title]\u2014is necessarily inconsistent with <em>general </em>criminal intent. Second, the volitional prong\u2014the lack of capacity \u201c[t]o conform one\u2019s conduct to the requirements of law\u201d [\u00a7 12-108(a)(2) of this title]\u2014 does not necessarily affect the person\u2019s ability to form a particular specific <em>criminal </em>intent.\u2019 Code (1982, 1985 Cum.Supp.) Task Force Comment following \u00a7 12-109 of the Health-General Art. at p. 110 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>In light of this, the reason for the procedure to be followed upon receipt of a plea of not guilty and an additional plea of \u201cnot criminally responsible by reason of insanity\u201d\u2014Health-General Art., \u00a7 12-109(a)(2); Md.Rule 4-242(a)\u2014is readily apparent. Section 12-109(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">If the trier of fact finds that the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the criminal act charged, then, if the defendant has pleaded not criminally responsible, the trier of fact separately shall find, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the defendant was at the time criminally responsible or not criminally responsible by reason of insanity under the test for criminal responsibility____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">This provision, according to the Task Force, merely clarifies the current state law. \u201c[T]he trier of fact first determines whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime. The determination is made before considering the plea of not criminally responsible.\u201d Code (1982, 1985 Cum.Supp.) Task Force Comment to \u00a7 12-109(c) of the Health-General Art. at p. 110. The Task Force adds: \u201cIf the [trier of fact] finds the defendant not guilty, there is no determination made of the plea of not criminally responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We discussed in <em>Pouncey </em>the effect of a determination that a defendant was not criminally responsible. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">The legislature, however, has not seen fit to remove all consequences of committing a criminal act while insane, <em>e.g., </em>the defendant may be held in a mental institution until it is determined that a release would not constitute a danger to the individual or to the person or property of others____ There is thus no support for the view that noncriminal collateral consequences are in all circumstances inconsistent with guilty but insane verdicts. 297 Md. at 270, 465 A.2d 475 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">This view is also supported by the Task Force. Its Comment to \u00a7 12-108(a) setting out the test for \u201cinsanity\u201d is that the test is phrased to make clear</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to the defendant, the jury, and to society that the defendant remains morally and personally responsible for committing criminal acts, but the State does not hold a defendant subject to criminal punishment, if this test is met. Code (1982, 1985 Cum.Supp.) Task Force Comment to \u00a7 12-108 of the Health-General Art. at p. 108.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Pearl Rose Ford went to trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County on pleas of not guilty and \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d While the jury was deliberating its verdicts (four days were consumed before the case went to the jury) she \u201cmoved to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d The court accepted the plea and took the case from the jury. A docket entry reads that Pearl \u201cwaived right to jury in open Court\u201d and reflects the verdicts rendered by the judge in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATb\">Finding: That there was sufficient evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt if sane. That the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The court committed her to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for examination and evaluation and subsequently ordered that she be treated on an in-patient basis at Crownsville Hospital Center until further order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the verdicts as rendered could have been better expressed in light of the existing law, we are satisfied that to all intent and purpose, they were in accord with the required procedure as the equivalent of \u201cGuilty of murder in the first degree\u201d and \u201cNot criminally responsible by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>insanity under the test for criminal responsibility.\u201d In other words, the verdicts were, in effect, albeit not literally, \u201cguilty\u201d and \u201cinsane.\u201d A judge is assumed to know the law. <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 550-551, 267 A.2d 190 (1970); <em>Lapides v. Lapides, </em>50 Md.App. 248, 252, 437 A.2d 251 (1981). Here, the appropriate verdicts consistent with the judge\u2019s findings were \u201cguilty\u201d and \u201cinsane,\u201d and we so consider them. The subsequent disposition of Pearl by the judge is in accord with this view.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The orderly way for the civil proceeding in the circuit court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to be conducted in circumstances comparable to those here would be for the claimant to establish <em>prima facie </em>his entitlement to the property by proving the validity of the will and his designation as legatee. Then the burden would shift to the person protesting his claim. The protester would attempt to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant had killed the testator and that the homicide was felonious and intentional, so that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the slayer\u2019s rule the claimant would be excluded from the distribution of the estate. The claimant would defend against this by evidence refuting his guilt of felonious and intentional homicide or by establishing that, if he did commit it, at the time of its commission, he lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law because of a mental disorder or mental retardation. The judge would then make the necessary findings of fact, apply the applicable law, and render a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>the validity of the will was established by its admission in probate, and the entitlement of Pearl was <em>prima facie </em>shown by her designation in the will as a beneficiary. It was undisputed that Pearl was the criminal agent in the first degree murder of her mother and that at the time of the matricide she was criminally insane. The judge presiding at the civil proceeding accepted those facts as undisputed. He recognized that he was not bound by the verdicts of the criminal court. Then he went astray however. He believed that because Pearl was criminally \u201cinsane\u201d at the time of the killing, no crime was committed. He correctly observed that Pearl had been indicted for murder in the first degree. That the charge entailed willfulness, deliberation and premeditation, and that in order to prove those elements \u201cthe State must prove that the Defendant had \u2018the actual intent, the fully formed purpose to kill\u2019----\u201d But then he said that \u201c[ijnsanity involves the <em>mens rea </em>or intent, which is an essential element of a crime.\u201d He concluded: \u201cMrs. Ford, who was insane at the time of the killing, was incapable of forming the requisite intent for first degree murder.\u201d It is clear that this conclusion was based solely on the fact that Pearl lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of her conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law. In other words, the judge believed that the fact that a person was criminally insane, as now defined, at the time of the commission of an offense was necessarily inconsistent with criminal intent. This concept led inescapably to the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that, <em>as a matter of law, </em>no crime was committed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While this view may have been sound when criminal responsibility was tested under the M\u2019Naghten-Spencer standard, it is not correct under the present standard. As we have seen, now it is encumbent upon the judge to find as a fact by a preponderance of the evidence whether the killer intended to kill. Of course, the lack of or result of criminal proceedings, although not necessarily dispositive of a subsequent civil proceeding, has probative value as a factor to be considered. In any event, the judge, on the incorrect premise that Pearl was <em>legally </em>incapable of the requisite intent by reason of her mental condition, deemed that her conduct was unintentional, and looking to <em>Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 315 A.2d 513, decided that her conduct did not preclude her from receiving a share under her mother\u2019s will.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">As we have seen, for the slayer\u2019s rule to be invoked the killing must have been both felonious and intentional. We have found that it is a function of the trier of fact in a civil proceeding regarding the entitlement of the assets of a decedent alleged to have been killed by a claimant to make an independent determination of the corpus delicti of the crime. The trier of fact must decide on a preponderance of the evidence whether the manner of the decedent\u2019s death was homicide, whether the homicide was murder or manslaughter and whether the claimant was the criminal agent. Unlike a criminal prosecution, the civil proceeding does not call for a determination of the degree of murder. Both first and second degree murder are per se felonious and intentional. The civil inquiry, however, must go a step further than is necessary in a criminal prosecution if the finding is that the homicide is manslaughter. <em>See Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 558-559, 171 A.2d 699, <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 906, 82 S.Ct. 186, 7 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961). Then the trier of fact in the civil proceeding must ascertain whether the manslaughter was voluntary or involuntary. Manslaughter generally, be it voluntary or involuntary, is a felony. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 387. <em>See supra </em>note 2. <em>But see </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 388. Voluntary manslaughter is intentional; involuntary manslaughter is, by definition, unintentional. <em>Rolfes v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 204, 207, 268 A.2d 795 (1970). <em>Schifanelli, </em>271 Md. 177, 315 A.2d 513, teaches that if the killing is unintentional it is without the ambit of the slayer\u2019s rule even though it is felonious. If the civil inquiry were to stop here, a determination that the killing was homicide, that the homicide was murder or voluntary manslaughter and that the claimant was the criminal agent would raise the bar of the slayer\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">All the above determinations are to be made on the assumption that the claimant was responsible for his crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>nal conduct, that he was \u201csane\u201d at the time of the commission of the killing. The inquiry continues, however, upon the suggestion that the killer was \u201cinsane\u201d within the meaning of our criminal responsibility law at the time he committed the offense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trier of fact must determine whether, at the time the claimant killed the decedent, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of that conduct, or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation. If the claimant were in that category, he would not be criminally responsible for the killing. It is at this point, upon a finding that the claimant was not criminally responsible for his criminal conduct, that the question we noted <em>supra, </em>arises, namely what impact does the fact that the claimant was \u201cinsane\u201d at the time of the commission of the crime have on the slayer\u2019s rule. The answer is that the slayer\u2019s rule is simply not applicable when the killer was not criminally responsible at the time he committed the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Our decision in <em>Schifanelli </em>supports the propriety of this view. In that case we held that the slayer\u2019s rule did not apply to bar a killer when the homicide was involuntary manslaughter and therefore unintentional, even though the felon was sane, fully responsible for his criminal conduct and convicted and punished therefore. Certainly a killer who is not responsible for his criminal conduct and as a matter of public policy cannot be punished, is no more culpable than a killer under the circumstances of <em>Schifanelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Our view is not in conflict with the maxims which support the slayer\u2019s rule which we have judicially adopted. The rule is based upon principles of equity, justice and morality and on a broad ground of the public policy of the common law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. at 567, 150 A.2d 251; <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. at 511, 516-518, 165 A. 470. Equally a matter of equity, justice and morality and a reflection of public policy is the present enlighted definition of criminal insanity under which punishment for the commission of a crime is prohibited. The terms of that definition simply make the maxims prompting the rule\u2014no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, to take advantage of his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime\u2014 inappropriate when a person is criminally insane. A person who suffers a mental disorder or is mentally retarded and falls under the cognitive and volitive components of the criminal responsibility statute does not, by the very terms of those components, act with an unfettered will. His conduct is controlled and his will is dominated by his mental impairment. Fundamentally, a killing is \u201cfelonious\u201d when the homicide is a felony. In the frame of reference of the slayer\u2019s rule, however, the legislative policy regarding criminal responsibility leads to a qualification of this meaning. We believe that for a homicide to be \u201cfelonious\u201d in the context of the slayer\u2019s rule, it must be a felony for which the killer is criminally responsible under Maryland\u2019s criminal insanity test. Therefore, if a killer is \u201cinsane\u201d at the time he killed, the killing is not felonious in the contemplation of the slayer\u2019s rule. If the killing is not felonious, even though it may be intentional, the rule does not apply. Our view does not do violence to the broad public policies inherent in both the rule and the criminal insanity statutes. On the contrary, it furthers the principles of equity, justice and morality recognized by both the rule and the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The result that we reach is in complete accord with the decisions of our sister states which have addressed the problem. Forty-three other states have adopted by legislative enactment a slayer\u2019s rule comparable in effect to our rule, and several have embraced such a rule through its case law. <em>See </em>Appendix A. We find that the courts in only 16 of those states, however, have construed the rule, in rendering a decision or by way of <em>obiter dictum, </em>in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the killer\u2019s insanity. <em>See </em>Appendix B. But each and every one of those courts have reached the same result\u2014the slayer\u2019s rule does not operate to bar a killer who, at the time of the commission of the homicide, was insane. It appears that there is unanimity in the result, even though there is no uniformity in the manner of reaching it. For example, some of the courts, especially in those jurisdictions which apply the M\u2019Naghten definition of insanity, reason that under that test a person found to be insane is, in fact, acquitted of the criminal charge. Since he was not guilty of committing the homicide, the rule is not invoked. A popular reason given is that under the definition of insanity applicable, be it M\u2019Naghten\u2019s or one predicated upon a mental disease, defect or disorder, a killer within that definition could not entertain the requisite intent to make his act criminal so that the homicide was not intentional or unlawful or felonious. In some of the states in which the slayer\u2019s rule , speaks in terms of a \u201cconviction\u201d and the insanity statute permits a'verdict of guilty but precludes the imposition of punishment, as does ours, the courts have concluded that since no criminal sentence may be entered on the guilty verdict, there is no judgment in the criminal cause and the killer does not stand \u201cconvicted.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, the killer is not within the ambit of the rule. One court simply looked to the \u201chumane rule that an insane killer is not a murderer\u201d as overriding the maxim against a wrongdoer profiting from an intentional wrong. <em>See </em>Appendix B under \u201cIllinois.\u201d The short of it is that the courts in other states which we find have addressed the matter have unanimously held for a variety of reasons and upon various tests for criminal insanity that a person who is not responsible for his criminal act at the time of its commission is without the purview of a slayer\u2019s statute or rule, which, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the way it is phrased, in its effect precludes a killer from being enriched by reason of his criminal conduct. The common thread running through all the cases is that permitting the insane killer to share in the distribution of his victim\u2019s assets is consistent with the common law principle of equity which prompted the adoption of a slayer\u2019s rule in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We reach the same conclusion as did the circuit court but by a different route. Even though the court below did not march to the beat of the same drummer as do we in arriving at a decision, it is the judgment of the court that we review, not the reasons set out in its opinion, even though they may be incorrect. We hold that the slayer\u2019s rule does not operate to preclude Pearl Rose Ford from inheriting under the will of her victim, Muriel L. Holland. The judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY GEORGE BENJAMIN FORD, JR.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>Slayer\u2019s Statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Ala.Code \u00a7 43-8-253 (1982 Repl.Vol.);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Alaska Stat. \u00a7 13.11.305 (1979);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 61-230 (1971 Repl.Vol.);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 14-2803 (1975, Cum.Supp.1985);</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">Cal.Probate Code \u00a7 250 (West 1956, Cum.Supp.1986);</p>\n<p id=\"Aru\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 15-11-803 (1973);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 45-279 (1985);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 732.802(1) (1976, Cum.Supp.1986);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 53-4-6 (1982);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">Hawaii Rev.Stat. \u00a7 560:2-803 (1976 Repl.Vol.);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">Idaho Code \u00a7 15-2-803 (1979);</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">Ill.Ann.Stat.

The <em>Weaver </em>case was one of first impression in Alabama, hence, various foreign precedents were examined, including <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 165 A. 470 (1933). The <em>Alabama </em>court held that a husband, convicted of second degree murder, could not take an intestate share of his deceased wife\u2019s estate. The Alabama legislature later passed a slayer\u2019s statute precluding from taking one who \u201cfeloniously and intentionally kills the decedent.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 43-8-253 (1982 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">California\u2014The California Court of Appeal specifically addressed the effect of a slayer\u2019s insanity in <em>Estate of Ladd, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 219, 153 Cal.Rptr. 888 (1979). The slayer-mother was found guilty of the murder in the first degree of her two sons <em>and </em>insane at the time of the crimes\u2019 commissions. The mother was committed to a state institution for treatment. The issue on appeal was whether the mother was precluded from inheriting from her deceased sons\u2019 estates premised upon the California slayer\u2019s statute. The applicable statute precluded inheritance by one who \u201cunlawfully and intentionally caused the death of the decedent----\u201d (Note\u2014the statutory language has since been changed to one \u201cwho feloniously and intentionally kills the decedent----\u201d Cal.Probate Code \u00a7 250(a) (West 1956, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Cum.Supp.1986).) \u201cSpecifically, the court must determine what effect the Legislature intended a finding of insanity under Penal Code section 1026[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] to have on the issue of whether a person \u2018unlawfully and intentionally\u2019 caused the death of a decedent\u201d under the slayer\u2019s statute. 91 Cal.

After reviewing the legislative history of their slayer\u2019s statute, the court observed that \u201c[ijnferably, the Legislature based these classifications [of slayers] on the mental state or culpability of the person who caused the death of a decedent, or on the punitive value of [the slayer\u2019s statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Court then examined the procedure at the criminal trial and concluded that despite the finding of guilt, there was no \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of the slayer\u2019s statute.

The court further reasoned that such a conclusion was consistent with the purpose of the insanity test; that is, determining who should not be held criminally responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 226.

The wife was allowed to take specifically because she was not convicted, as required by the statute. \u201cThe effect of the judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity was to establish conclusively that petitioner was not guilty of the public offense with which she was charged, because <em>as a matter of criminal law </em>she lacked the capacity to commit the crime.

The court examined the trend of decisions permitting an insane slayer to inherit. \u201cIn finding Allen was insane, the jury in his criminal trial determined, in essence, that Allen lacked any wrongful intent when he killed his parents. Indeed, to quote from the applicable statute, Allen was found to lack the \u2018substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of the conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law\u2019 Ind.Code \u00a7 35-41-3-6(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The court limited itself to the verdict of not responsible by reason of insanity\u2014noting that such plea had been stricken by the legislature and supplanted by \u201cguilty but mentally ill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249 n. 5.

The court noted that insanity is recognized as a defense against criminal punishment \u201cbecause, if the perpetrator is so mentally diseased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that he does not have the intent or animus in the commission of the crime, the act lacks the elements which constitute the crime the law seeks to punish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Furthermore, these principles apply equally in a civil case determining survivorship rights \u201cfor if his mind was so diseased that it was the disease and not his own will which caused the act to be committed, it cannot fairly be said that he has committed a wrong for which the law should upset the customary legal rights of property ownership.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">At the time of this case, Minnesota applied the M\u2019Naghten test for sanity. <em>Id. </em>at 457. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 611.-026 (West 1964, Cum.Supp.1986). The court did not apply M\u2019Naghten under these circumstances noting that it \u201cwould not be appropriate in this case where the defendant apparently knew that what he did was wrong, and yet it was his mental disease and not his own conscious act that caused the death of his wife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460. The judicial rule enunciated in such civil proceedings was \u201cthe slayer will not be barred from taking the property where his unlawful act was the product of mental disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. In such an instance, the equitable doctrine precluding one from profiting from his own wrong does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Missouri\u2014In <em>Eisenhardt v. Siegel, </em>343 Mo. 22, 119 S.W.2d 810 (1938), the Supreme Court of Missouri addressed the issue of sanity in a title dispute. One brother, who was conceded to be insane at the time of the homicide, shot and killed his brother, thus triggering a reversion of title in certain property. The fact of the \u201cmurder\u201d did not preclude the reversion for the reason that the slayer was insane. The defense of insanity, per M\u2019Naghten, eradicated the murder, <em>i.e., </em>since the slayer was insane there was no murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\"><em>New </em>Hampshire\u2014In <em>Kelley v.

The court reasoned that the \u201cconstructive trust\u201d is intended to prevent unjust enrichment and hence would not apply in such circumstance. It also would not apply if the slayer was <em>insane, </em>(citing <em>Anderson v.

In answering this issue in the affirmative, the court noted that a constructive trust, applied to carry out the equitable doctrine that a person should not profit by his own wrong, is imposed to prevent unconscionability and unjust enrichment. 245 A.2d at 765.

(Note \u2014the current statute requires that the killing be criminal and intentional, <em>see </em>3B NJ.Stat.Ann. 7-1 (1983).)

In light of our state\u2019s recognition that insane criminals are guilty of the crimes they commit and are personally and morally responsible for those crimes, I find the majority\u2019s position to be untenable. I thus respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">This Court adopted \u201cthe slayer\u2019s rule\u201d in <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 165 A. 470 (1933), on the basis that allowing a murderer to inherit from the estate of his victim is repugnant to public policy. The Court applied the equitable rule that \u201cno one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, to take advantage of his own wrong, to found any claim upon his own iniquity or to acquire property by his own crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 506 and 511, 165 A.2d 470, and held that a killer, by virtue of his murderous act, acquires no beneficial interest in the estate of his victim. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 165 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">As the majority recognizes in Part III of its opinion, an insane murderer who has been found to have acted with the requisite intent or <em>mens rea </em>has committed the crime of murder. <em>See Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 399 A.2d 578 (1978); <em>see also Pouncey v. State, </em>297 Md. 264, 465 A.2d 475 (1983). He is guilty, and his insanity neither justifies nor excuses his act. His misdeed is equally abhorrent as a murder committed by one sane, and although the criminal consequence\u2014imprisonment\u2014will be dispensed with, the murderer has not been forgiven.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Our legislature has clearly shown that the purpose of adjudging the killer\u2019s sanity is not to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>crime will be annulled, but to determine whether the killer should be criminally punished. Code (1982, 1985 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 12-108 of the Health General Article, sets forth the test for insanity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">(a) <em>Test\u2014In </em>general.\u2014a defendant is not <em>criminally responsible </em>for <em>criminal conduct </em>if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation, lacks substantial capacity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">(1) To appreciate the criminality of that conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">(2) To conform that conduct to the requirements of the law. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In its comment to \u00a7 \u00cd2-108(a), the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Review the Defense of Insanity states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2l\">the phrase \u201cnot criminally responsible\u201d is substituted for the phrase \u201cnot responsible\u201d [which appeared in the former test under \u00a7 12-107] as being a more accurate statement of the defendant\u2019s status under criminal law. The Task Force recommends the adoption of this term to make clear to the defendant, the jury, and to society <em>that the defendant remains morally and personally responsible for committing criminal acts, </em>but the State does not hold the defendant subject to criminal punishment, if this test is met. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The reason that the insane murderer will not be criminally punished is that \u201cthe State has determined that it cannot morally punish the defendant.\u201d Governor\u2019s Task Force to Review Defense of Insanity Report 30 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">A dichotomy exists, then, between the moral responsibility of the State\u2014which dictates that it should not imprison the insane murderer, and the moral responsibility which society expects from its citizens\u2014which dictates that an insane murderer is responsible for his crime. We recognized this dichotomy in <em>Pouncey v. State, supra. </em>In <em>Pouncey, </em>the appellant, who had drowned her son because she believed him to be pursued by the devil, was found by the trial court to be both guilty of first degree murder and insane at the time of the offense. She appealed, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>that the verdicts of guilty and the finding of insanity were inconsistent. This Court rejected her claim and cited <em>Langworthy v. State, supra, </em>for the proposition that a defendant may be found both guilty and insane. The appellant nonetheless sought \u201cto avoid the effect of <em>Langworthy </em>[and] argue[d] that because \u2018she was ultimately found insane, the finding of guilt was divested of legal significance for purposes of her future status as a criminal or non-criminal.\u2019 \u201d 297 Md. at 268-69, 465 A.2d at 478. The appellant further argued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">that if she is burdened by a record of conviction of first degree murder, she will in a practical sense have been found responsible for her conduct; that the stigma of such a \u201cconviction\u201d punishes her for her conduct in that, among other things, it prohibits her from voting, from serving on a jury, from acquiring licenses or contracts, and also inhibits future employment opportunities since prospective employers will ascertain that she was found guilty of first degree murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In this Court\u2019s view, however, such results were not incongruous with a finding of insanity. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">[A] finding of insanity is <em>not tantamount to an absence of </em>mens rea, <em>or inconsistent with an intent to commit a crime. </em>In drowning her child, the appellant specifically intended to kill him, and while her successful insanity defense means that she is not criminally responsible for her conduct, that determination <em>merely relieves her of liability for punishment under the criminal law. </em>No criminal <em>sentence </em>may ever be entered on the guilty verdict in this case and the appellant, therefore, does not stand \u201cconvicted\u201d of the murder offense in the <em>traditional sense of the criminal law. The legislature, however, has not seen fit to remove all consequences of committing a criminal act while insane, e.g., </em>the defendant may be held in a mental institution until it has determined that a release would not constitute a danger to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>individual or to the person or property of others. \u00a7 12-114(b)(1)(h). <em>There is thus no support for the view that non-criminal collateral consequences are in all circumstances inconsistent with guilty but insane verdicts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 270, 465 A.2d at 478 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the Court recognized that the civil consequences of an insane criminal\u2019s act are not controlled by the fact that the' person has\u201d received dispensation from criminal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Turning to the instant case, it is clear to me that the fact that the State cannot criminally punish an insane defendant is irrelevant to a determination of whether it is equitable for the killer to inherit from her victim. It is one thing to say that the State should not imprison one who was insane when she committed the murder. It is quite another to say that the insane murderer can profit from her crime. The only relevant focus here must be upon the killer\u2019s moral and personal responsibility for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">As developed in <em>Price v. Hitaffer, supra, Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. 564, 150 A.2d 251 (1958) and <em>Schifanneli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 315 A.2d 513 (1974), the operation of the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule\u201d requires two findings: that the killing was intentional and that it was committed \u201cfeloniously.\u201d With respect to the first finding, our decisions in <em>Pouncey </em>and <em>Langworthy, </em>as well as the statute defining insanity, make clear that an insane person may have the intent requisite for the commission of the crime. As to the second finding, these cases and the statute also demonstrate that an insane killer can commit a felonious act. The majority acknowledges that a killing is felonious when the homicide committed is a felony. As indicated by <em>Pouncey </em>and <em>Lang-worthy, </em>an insane person can be found to possess the requisite mens rea, and thus can be found guilty of committing a felony. Indeed, as evidenced by our criminal responsibility statute, the existence of the crime itself is independent of a finding of insanity. The statute requires that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime <em>before </em>the issue of insanity is addressed. Thus, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>purposes of the application of the slayer\u2019s rule, a trial judge may find that a killer did in fact commit a felony and that the homicide committed was intentional without addressing the insanity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I believe that our prior readings of the criminal responsibility statute reaffirm this conclusion. In <em>Pouncey </em>and <em>Langworthy, </em>we stated that the legislative intent of the statute was not to negate the existence of the crime but to relieve the insane person of liability for punishment under the criminal law. Thus, a finding of insanity under the statute in no way diminishes the wrongfulness of the actor\u2019s conduct. Rather, it merely removes the possibility of criminal sanction. Because the actor\u2019s conduct remains wrongful notwithstanding the finding of insanity, the slayer\u2019s rule, in barring an individual from profiting from his own wrong, remains applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">I realize that the insane killer committed the crime either because she could not appreciate the criminality of her conduct or because she could not conform her conduct to the requirements of the law. But this reason for the killer\u2019s volition has no bearing upon the equitable principle embodied in the slayer\u2019s rule. If the insane killer has intentionally killed her victim, if she has acted with the required <em>mens rea </em>for the crime, she is personally and morally responsible for her wrong, and equity demands that she shall not benefit from the deed. It is repugnant to decency to say that an insane murderer can finance her rehabilitation with new found wealth from her victim\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Finally, I note that each of the cases from other jurisdictions cited by the majority is distinguishable in that no case addresses the question under an insanity law similar to Maryland law. Most of the cases cited apply either the M\u2019Naughten standard or a similar test and hold that the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule\u201d does not apply either because a finding of insanity is tantamount to an acquittal, <em>Estate of Ladd, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 219, 153 Cal.Rptr. 888 (1979); <em>Hill v. Morris, </em>85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>So.2d 847 (Fla.Sup.Ct.1956); <em>In re Eckhardt\u2019s Estate, </em>184 Misc. 748, 54 N.Y.S.2d 484 (1945), or because an insane person cannot have the requisite intent for the murder, <em>Estate of Ladd, supra, Turner v. Estate of Turner, </em>454 N.E.2d 1247 (Ind.App.1983); <em>Anderson v. Grasberg, </em>247 Minn. 538, 78 N.W.2d 450 (1956); <em>Kelley v. State, </em>105 N.H. 240, 196 A.2d 68 (1983); <em>Campbell v. Ray, </em>102 N.J.Super 235, 245 A.2d 761 (1968), <em>aff'd mem. </em>107 N.J. Super 509, 259 A.2d 473 (1969), <em>aff'd mem., </em>56 N.J. 52, 264 A.2d 441 (1970); <em>Quick v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co., </em>287 N.C. 47, 213 S.E.2d 563 (1973); <em>Simon v. Dibble, </em>380 S.W.2d 898 (Tex. Civ.App.1964)). Other cases simply note that an insane killer is not a murderer, and thus the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule\u201d should not apply. <em>See Blair v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>30 Ill.App.2d 191, 174 N.E.2d 209 (1961); <em>Eisenhardt v. Siegel, </em>343 Mo. 22, 119 S.W.2d 810 (1938); <em>Hoffman\u2019s Estate, </em>39 D &amp; C 208 (1940). In contrast, under Maryland law, a killer deemed to be insane is <em>not acquitted </em>of the crime, <em>Langworthy, supra, </em>the insane killer <em>can </em>be found to have the requisite <em>intent </em>for the crime, and the killer is in essence found to be <em>guilty </em>of committing that crime. We should not blindly follow those jurisdictions which base their holdings upon standards of insanity to which our legislature has shown its express intent not to adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In conclusion, I note that because Pearl Ford should be disqualified as devisee under her mother\u2019s will, her son is the appropriate substitute legatee. Although the general rule is that a murderer\u2019s heirs cannot through the murderer take from the victim\u2019s estate, <em>see Price v. Hitaffer, supra, </em>164 Md. at 506, 518, 165 A. 470 where the heir is also an heir of the victim and the natural beneficiary of victim\u2019s bounty, he is the proper substitute beneficiary. <em>See </em>Am. Jur.2d, <em>Descent and Distribution </em>\u00a7 109 (1983). Here George Benjamin Ford, Jr., the son of the murderess, is the grandson of the victim and is the victim\u2019s only lineal descendant. Therefore, I would hold that George is the proper beneficiary of his grandmother\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">I am authorized to state that Judge McAULIFFE concurs in the views here stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
