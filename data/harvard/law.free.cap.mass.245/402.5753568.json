M. L. Gilbert, Pres.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>Pistorino &amp; Yunes by M. L. Yunes,\u201d \u201c Elias Berlow,\u201d \u201c M. L. Gilbert,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>Kreger Navigation Co. M. L. Gilbert, Pres.\u201d Writ dated September 16, 1921.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">In the Superior Court, the action was heard by <em>McLaughlin, </em>J., without a jury. The judge found that the note was indorsed by Yunes, a member of the firm of Pistorino and Yunes, a trading partnership, without authority from his partner and for the accommodation of the Elias Berlow Corporation, and that the plaintiff was a holder in due course and had no notice nor knowledge that the indorsement made by Yunes was without the assent of Pistorino.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqW\">The defendant Pistorino asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-11\"><em>\u201c </em>1. Upon all the evidence, the defendant Pistorino is entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-12\">\u201c 2. E the court find that the note was indorsed merely as an accommodation to the maker and that the defendant Pistorino was ignorant of the fact of the indorsement and neither authorized his partner Yunes to indorse the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>with the firm name, nor ratified such action by the defendant Yunes, the court should find for the defendant Pistorino.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">\u201c3. One partner has no implied right to indorse the firm name upon negotiable instruments, which are not connected with the transactions of the partnership. The partnership agreement between the defendants Pistorino and Yunes does not confer upon either partner the power to bind the other by the indorsement of accommodation paper with the firm name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\"><em>\u201c </em>4. There is no evidence that the defendant Yunes was authorized to bind the defendant Pistorino by the indorsement of accommodation paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\"><em>\u201c </em>5.

The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $7,868.75; and the defendant Pistorino alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-9\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-10\"><em>J.

The plaintiff having given value and acquired title before maturity without knowledge of the circumstances under which the indorsement was made ordinarily would be a holder in due course. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 75. <em>Merchants National Bank </em>v. <em>Marden, Orth &amp; Hastings Co. </em>234 Mass. 161, 168. But the defendant contends that under the order of the indorsements appearing on the note it is manifest that the note did not pass from the possession of the payee until negotiated by the payee to the plaintiff, and therefore the indorsement was for the accommodation of the payee, of which the plaintiff had notice. The judge however has found that the indorsement was for the accommodation of the maker, and this finding is conclusive. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Gaull, </em>244 Mass. 528. The cases of <em>National Bank of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Law, </em>127 Mass. 72, <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>173 Mass. 488, 490, <em>J. G. Brill Co. </em>v. <em>Norton &amp; Taunton Street Railway, </em>189 Mass. 431, relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>on by the defendant, are clearly distinguishable. It also is plain that this contention is groundless when the indorsements are read in the order in which they appear on the note. As pointed out by the trial judge, <em>\u201c </em>The mere fact that a note, before its maturity, comes in the usual course of business into the hands of the payee after having been once negotiated by him, does not destroy its negotiability, nor defeat the right of a <em>bona fide </em>holder to recover against all who are parties to the note at the time it is negotiated to him.\u201d <em>West Boston Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>124 Mass. 506, 515. The plaintiff moreover could strike out every indorsement not necessary to its title and allege that it was the holder under the blank indorsement of the firm. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>243 Mass. 174. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 71. The defendant\u2019s requests having been denied rightly the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
