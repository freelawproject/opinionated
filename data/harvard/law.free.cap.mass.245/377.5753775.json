It appeared that the money sought to be recovered was paid to the defendant upon a check of Great Western Hide Company payable to the defendant\u2019s order and delivered to the defendant by one Crohan at the request of one Wolff as the purchase price of goods sold by the defendant to Wolff. Other material evidence is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-14\">At the request of the plaintiff, the judge gave the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>\u201c </em>33.

The fact that the defendant Paine Furniture Company was a seller of furniture, and that the Great Western Hide Corporation was a dealer in hides, and would have no occasion to incur a debt for the purchase of furniture for Mrs. Wolff, required the defendant Paine Furniture Company to make investigation whether said check was authorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-8\">\u201c 30.

Where a check of a corporation is made payable to the creditor of an individual, the transaction which on the face of the check is represented to have taken place is an appropriation of the corporation\u2019s money to the payment of the individual\u2019s debts, and is bad unless shown to be good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">\u201c 36.

A. Wolff;'the salesbook entry reads, \u201c Charge to Mr. E. A. Wolff, 202 Lincoln Street, to be delivered July 25th.\u201d Before the sale the salesman had never seen Mrs. Wolff and he did not know Mr. Wolff. Prior to July 25, the salesman had a telephone conversation with Mrs. Wolff wherein she told him to send down to B. Crohan, 71 South Street, Boston, Massachusetts, to get the money so the defendant could deliver the goods. The salesman accordingly dictated a letter which he sent by messenger to Crohan, which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201c July 25, 1919.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">Mr. B. Crohan,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">71 South St.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Boston, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">Kindly deliver to bearer check for $1149.75 as per the enclosed bills. Please return these bills with the check as I have orders from Mrs. Wolff to mail receipted bills to Essex Hotel, Room 110.

Marland Sewall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">W. Marland Sewall \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">The messenger sent by the defendant brought back to the defendant a check in form as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Great Western Hide Co. No. 2872.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">Boston, Mass., July 25, 1919.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">Pay to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">order of Paine Furniture Co. $1149.75 Eleven Hundred Forty Nine Dollars Seventy Five Cents Dollars</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-19\">To the Great Western Hide Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFmO\">Metropolitan Trust Company [Signed]\" Phil M. Paris</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-21\">President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-22\">Treasurer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-23\">5-122 Boston, Mass.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-24\">The defendant deposited the check to its account in The First National Bank of Boston, through which it was cleared to the defendant\u2019s credit. When Mrs. Wolff telephoned she did not state to the salesman who Crohan was or mention Great Western Hide Corporation; nor did the defendant or its salesman at this time know anything about the Great Western Hide Corporation or the relation to it of Paris, the signer of the check, except in so far as the check disclosed that Paris was the treasurer of the plaintiff corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>On the foregoing facts the defendant payee named in the check was a holder under R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 207, now G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 18, and is deemed <em>prima facie </em>to be a holder in due course. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 76. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 82. The evidence is clear that the defendant received the check for value, without actual knowledge of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it; R. L. c. 73,, \u00a7 73, G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 79; and there is no evidence that the defendant in receiving the check had such knowledge of facts that its action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith. G. L. c.-107, \u00a7 79. The evidence does not warrant a finding that the defendant knew or should have known that the check was an unauthorized use of the funds of the corporation to pay the debt of an officer of the corporation; and is entirely consistent with an exchange of the check for money, which money was given to Crohan by Wolff to purchase the check which Crohan was to deliver and did deliver to the defendant in payment of the debt of Wolff to the defendant. We find nothing in the evidence which required an investigation by the defendant to ascertain whether the issuance of the check was authorized. We think the case is governed by <em>National Investment &amp; Security Co. </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>222 Mass. 453, and the <em>Colonial Fur Ranching Co. </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Boston, </em>227 Mass. 12; and that the case of <em>Johnson &amp; Kettell Co. </em>v. <em>Longley Luncheon Co. </em>207 Mass. 52, upon which the plaintiff relies, is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\">What has been said covers all the exceptions argued by the plaintiff. These exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
