Denison and one McGinney, to recover possession of the premises demanded in this suit, and also an execution, issued on said judgment, for possession of the same premises. The said writ of entry was dated August 19th 1844, and described George G. Denison as of Springfield, otherwise called of Hartford, in the State of Connecticut. The officer\u2019s return upon that writ was as follows: \u201c Hampden, ss. August 19th 1844. 1 attached a chip, the property of said defendants, and left a summons at the last and usual place of abode of said McGinney, for his appearance at court; and I also left at the same place a summons for said Denison to appear at court; said McGinney being the tenant or agent of said Denison. Upon each of said summonses a notice for trial at the first term was given.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">It appeared that George G.

This objection was overruled, and a verdict was thereupon returned for the tenants, subject to the opinion of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-7\">J. <em>Wells, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amo\">The judgment was invalid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and the demandant may avoid it by showing its invalidity. <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>2 Met. 135. He can avoid it in no other way. As his title is by deed before the judgment, he is not party nor privy to the judgment, so as to enable him to bring a writ of error to reverse it. 5 Dane Ab. 67, 69. 1 Rol. Ab. 747. Com. Dig.

Denison; and the tenants set up a judgment in their favor against the said George G. Denison and one McGinney, recovered before the deed from the said George G. to the demandant was recorded. To this judgment the tenants objected, because the same was rendered contrary to the provisions of the Rev. Sts. c. 90, \u00a7 48. This objection was overruled, on the ground that the judgment was only voidable by a writ of error, and that the demandant might maintain a writ of error, as a privy in estate, or because the judgment was prejudicial to him by intercepting his title. But we are all of opinion, after a careful examination of the authorities, that this ruling cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">It is true that a party, privy in estate with the party against whom a judgment has been rendered, may have a writ of error to reverse it. As where an erroneous judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>rendered against a tenant for life or years, the owner of the remainder or the reversion may maintain a writ of error after the term is expired. So by him in reversion, after an estate tail is determined. Com. Dig. Pleader, 3 B. 9. But if the tenant alien, <em>pendente lite, </em>the alienee shall not have error. 1 Rol. Ab. 748. It is true that it is laid down in Bac. Ab. Error, B., that \u201c no person can bring a writ of error to reverse a judgment, who was not a party or privy to the record, or who was not injured by the judgment, and therefore is to receive advantage by the reversal thereof.\u201d So it is laid down in 9 Vin. Ab. Error, K. 1, that \u201c the writ of error shall be brought by him who should have the thing for which the judgment is erroneously given, if the judgment had not been given.\u201d But these rules are laid down too broadly, and must be understood in a restricted sense ; for it is immediately after laid down in Viner, that \u201c none shall have a writ of error, unless he be party or privy to the judgment.\u201d This latter proposition appears to be too much restricted; for a privy in estate may, as before laid down, maintain a writ of error in certain cases. But we are all of opinion that there is no such privity of estate between the demandant and Denison and McGinney, against-whom the tenants recovered judgment, as would authorize him to maintain a writ of error to reverse the judgment. There is no more privity of estate between the demandant and the Denisons, than there is between a tenant who aliens in fee, <em>pendente lite, </em>and his alienee. According to the authorities, therefore, although they are somewhat conflicting, we are of opinion, that the demandant, not having a right to maintain a writ of error to reverse the judgment in question, has a right to avoid it by plea and proof, according to the decision in <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>2 Met. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It was afterwards decided, that the service of the writ of entry on George G. Denison was insufficient; and the demand-ant recovered judgment. 2 Cush. 32.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
