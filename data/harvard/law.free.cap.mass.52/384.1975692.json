At the March term of that court, in 1844, upon a suggestion that the tenant had taken advantage of the insolvent law, it was ordered that his assignee should come in, at the next term, and defend this action. At the March term 1846, the tenant was defaulted, and said court, by consent <em>o\u00ed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>parties, appointed an auditor \u201c to assess damages for a conditional judgment.\u201d The auditor made the following report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">\u201c The demandant claims that the conditional judgment shall be entered for various alleged breaches of a bond given, July 1st 1839, by the tenant to the demandant. The conditions of the bond may be stated briefly, as follows: 1st. The tenant is 1 to pay all the just debts of the said Enos, that he now owes.\u2019 The demandant claims damages for two breaches of this condition, namely, <em>first, </em>for the non-payment of three notes given by the said Enos to Cornelius Putnam, and by him assigned (together with a mortgage for security) to Joseph Barber. The notes are dated September 20th 1838, for 0100 each, with yearly interest, which interest has been paid to September 20th 1845. Two of the notes fell due before the commencement of this suit, and one since. There will be due on each note, on the 10th of August 1846, 0105-334; on all, 0316. And judgment is to be entered for that sum, unless the court are of opinion that the following objections, reserved at the request of the tenant, are wholly or partially fatal; in which case the judgment is to be conformed to the views of the court. 1st objection. The tenant proved that neither the payee nor his assignee ever demanded the principal due on the notes, and that the assignee now only wishes for his yearly interest. 2d. That the demandant has no right to damages, until he has paid, or is sued for the same. 3d. That he is not entitled, in any event, to a judgment upon the note not due at the date of the writ. The demandant claims damages for a <em>second </em>breach, by the non payment of a debt due from him to Jesse Nelson and Amos Stewart, of 081-72, with interest from November 1st 1841, upon the following grounds: The parties above named, with some others, on the 29th of December 1836, entered into a bond (given to the towns of Colerain and Leyden) to construct a public highway. Afterwards, they appointed Amos Stewart and Jesse Nelson their agents to receive the funds and pay out the same, and make all necessary contracts for the building of the road. When the road was completed, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>account was rendered of the receipts and expenditures to November 1841, and a loss shown, which, divided by the seven bondsmen liable, left a loss upon each of $81-72. The auditor awards damages for this sum, with interest to August 10th 1846, amounting, in all, to $105-12, subject to the opinion of the court upon the following objections made by the tenant: 1st. The tenant is insolvent, and has obtained his discharge, and is therefore not liable. 2d. There is no covenant in the bond for a mutual contribution, and therefore the demandant, is not liable. 3d. The paper, certifying that Amos Stewart and Jesse Nelson had been appointed agents, is dated September 20th 1841, and the tenant\u2019s liability is created by that paper, if liable at all; therefore it was not a debt owing at the time the tenant\u2019s bond was given to the demandant, to wit, July 1st 1839. This debt of $81-72 is proved mainly by the testimony of Amos Stewart and Jesse Nelson. They were admitted to testify, on the ground that they were not interested in the event of the suit, although interested in the question. It was suggested in argument, that the decree for conditional judgment must order the tenant to pay the sum of $81-72 to Amos Stewart and Jesse Nelson. If so, are they not incompetent to testify ? If they are, then there is no evidence of the demandant\u2019s indebtedness. This difficulty in the auditor\u2019s mind he presents for the consideration of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-4\"><em>\u201c </em>The <em>second </em>obligation for the payment of money, included . in the condition of the aforesaid bond, is, that the tenant is to pay the demandant ten dollars annually, for expense money. The auditor reports five instalments due, and interest, amounting to $58-30, subject to the tenant\u2019s objection, that breaches of the bond, subsequent to the date of the writ, are not recoverable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The <em>third </em>obligation (not for the payment of money) included in the condition of said bond, is, <em>first, </em>to keep a horse for the demandant, during his life. The auditor allows, for breach of this obligation, $20.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">\u201c The <em>fourth </em>obligation is, to support the demandant, 1 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the place where he now lives, with all necessary victuals, drinks, lodging, clothing, nursing and doctoring, and all which is to be done in good season and good order.\u2019 The auditor allows $40, for breaches of this obligation \u2014 subject to the objection, that such breaches were since the date of the demandant\u2019s writ. The whole sum allowed is $537-42.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">The court of common pleas, at August term 1846, ordered conditional judgment to be entered for the demandant for the said sum of $537-42. From this decision the tenant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-6\"><em>H. G. Newcomb, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEP\">There is no breach of the condition of the bond, by reason of the non-payment of the notes which the holder does not wish to have paid. The sum claimed as due to A. Stewart and J. Nelson was not legally proved by their testimony; they being directly interested. Besides; the tenant is discharged by the insolvent law, and the debt is not due from the demandant himself. The bond, which he and others executed to the towns o\u00ed Colerain and Leyden, contained no contract for contribution between the obligors. At any rate, this sum of $81-72 was not a debt of the demandant when the tenant\u2019s bond to him was given. The sums allowed by the auditor, on the demandant\u2019s third note, and for breach of obligation concerning the horse, and the demandant\u2019s support, should not be included in the conditional judgment, because there was no legal claim therefor until after this suit was commenced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-7\">Davis, for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuF\">The demandant is to have conditional judgment for such sum as <em>\u201c is due </em>\u201d to him, when the judgment is entered, and not for the sum that <em>was due </em>at the commencement of the suit.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOE\">The demandant is entitled to a special conditional judgment, so framed as to secure his rights as mortgagee, according to the principles settled by the report of the auditor. By the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, the court are not confined to the entry of a conditional judgment in those cases only in which the payment of money is the condition. By &lt;\u00a7&gt; 6, if the doing of a collateral thing, other than the payment of money, is the condition, \u201c the court shall vary the terms of the judgment, as the case may require.\u201d And by &lt;\u00a7&gt; 29, it is provided, that \u201c in all suits, brought under the provisions of this chapter\u201d (c. 107,) \u201c either for the redemption of mortgaged premises, or for the purpose of foreclosing the right of redemption, the court shall have power, as to all things not provided for \u201d in said chapter, \u201c to make such order, judgment, or decree, as justice and equity may require, and to issue such process as may be necessary or proper, according to the course of proceedings in chancery.\u201d This, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>in terms, extends not only to a bill in equity to redeem, but to the special action, in the form of a common law action, by writ of entry, given to a mortgagee, and. assignee of a mortgage, to foreclose. And these special provisions as to the judgment give to this special writ of entry nearly all the attributes of a suit in equity. The most common case of a mortgage is that when it is given to secure the payment of a sum of money; and then a simple conditional judgment, in the usual form, is all that is necessary. But when, as in this case, a mortgage is given to secure the payment of money, and the performance of various duties from time to time, extending perhaps to the mortgagee\u2019s whole life, the provision in question will authorize the court to enter any decree, from time to time, <em>toties quoties, </em>which might be made in an equity suit, in order to accomplish the purposes of the mortgage, and to issue any process to carry such a decree into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The following decree was made by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201c It is now ordered and decreed, that the conditional juctg ment provided by statute be entered up in manner following: That unless the said defendant pay to the said plaintiff, with interest and costs, within two months, two hundred and twenty one dollars and forty two cents, and also pay to Joseph Barber, or any other person being the lawful indorsee and holder of the three notes hereinafter mentioned, the sum of three hundred and sixteen dollars, and interest, being the amount of three promissory notes, as follows; \u201d (particularly describing the three notes mentioned in the auditor\u2019s report, payable to Cornelius Putnam, or order;) \u201cand file, in the office of the clerk of our court for the county of Franklin, evidence of the cancelling of said notes, then our writ of execution to issue, &amp;c. according to law, &amp;c. And it is further ordered and decreed, that in case the aforesaid condition be complied with, and the sums therein mentioned paid, within two months from the time of rendering this judgment, the said mortgage, so far as it stands for security for any debt to be paid, or duty to be done, by the said Lewis Clark, up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>time of the rendition of this judgment, shall be wholly discharged ; but so far as it stands as a security for any debt to be paid, or duty to be done, after the rendition of this judgment, the same shall remain in full force.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
