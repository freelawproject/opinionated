The trial was before <em>Hubbard, </em>J. The jury retired a short time before the court adjourned at evening, agreed upon a verdict, sealed it, and returned it, in court, the next morning, in the form following: \u201c The jury find that Anderson Cook did commit an assault on Leonard C. Fuller, on the 2d day of June 1845, as alleged against him in the first count in the declaration ; and the other defendants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>not guilty as set forth. We assess the damage upon Anderson Cook, to the amount of six dollars. $6-00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\"><em>\u201c </em>On the second count alleged against the defendants, the jury find them not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">\u201c On the third allegation set forth against the defendants, the jury find that the plaintiff has sustained his allegation.

This was done, and the verdict, so drawn up, was affirmed by the jury, and was recorded. The said defendants thereupon moved in arrest of judgment, because \u201c the verdict on the third count should be for the sum of seven dollars and eighty three cents, and no more.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-8\"><em>C. </em>Allen, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeC\">cited <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>9 Pick. <em>555. </em>2 Greenl. on Ev. \u00a7 277. <em>Kempton </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>4 Pick. 307. <em>Proprietors of Kennebeck Purchase </em>v. <em>Boulton, </em>4 Mass. 419.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-9\"><em>Bridges, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-10\">Shaw. C. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATN\">Certainly this motion in arrest of judgment cannot be maintained. All is right on the record; and what the defendants complain of is an irregularity in taking the verdict; which, if well founded, would afford no cause for arresting the judgment. If any injustice had been done thereby, it should be corrected by setting the verdict aside and ordering a new trial. The paper sealed up by the jury was not technically a verdict. Such a paper is not a verdict, till it is affirmed and recorded. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Rockbottom Co. </em>7 Met. 49. Co. Lit. 227 <em>b.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">In <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>9 Pick. <em>555, </em>and that class of cases, where there was a joint charge of trespass against several, a verdict of guilty, and several damages, the plaintiffs were permitted 1o enter one joint judgment against all, assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the largest sum assessed against any one as the damages against all, <em>de melioribus damnis. </em>Those were cases where such a verdict as that in question had been offered and amended, and stood as the basis of the judgment. But here, when the sealed paper was opened, it was rightly explained to the jury, by the judge, that the law required joint damages. They had already found that the plaintiff ought to receive, for his indemnity, twenty three dollars and forty nine cents, the aggregate of the three several sums. They adopted the amendment, (not having been discharged,) unanimously affirmed it as their verdict, and authorized it to be so recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>Motion overruled, and judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
