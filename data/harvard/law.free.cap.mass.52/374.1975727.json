The case was submitted to the court on the following facts agreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">The defendants were organized as a fire district in the town of Springfield, according to the provisions of <em>St. </em>1844, c. 152. The plaintiff owns a dwelling-house and resides within the limits of said fire district. The inhabitants of the district, at a meeting called for that purpose, passed a vote to raise a certain sum of money for the purchase of engines, &lt;fcc. ; the clerk of the district, certified to the assessors of the town the sum so voted to be raised, and said sum was by them assessed upon said inhabitants, including the plaintiff; the collector of. the town\u2019s taxes demanded of the plaintiff the amount thus assessed upon him, and he paid the same, under protest. A part of the said tax was .assessed upon the plaintiff\u2019s personal estate, \u201cconsisting of bank and other stocks and shares in various corporations located and doing business without the limits of said fire district, and a greater part of them without the limits of the State.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-7\"><em>W. G. Bates, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT0\">By <em>St. </em>1844, <em>c. </em>152, \u00a7 13, the sums voted to be raised by fire districts, for the purposes mentioned in \u00a7 12, \u201c shall be assessed and collected in the same manner that the town\u2019s taxes are assessed and collected ; provided, nevertheless, that the sums so voted shall be assessed upon the property within such district, both real and personal.\u201d The Rev. Sts. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, show what are the duties of assessors as to town taxes; and unless the plaintiff\u2019s stocks, which were taxed in this case, are exempted, the above proviso in <em>St. </em>1844 can have no practical operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The spirit of the statute is, that the property which is to be protected from fire, and that only, shall be taxed by fire districts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-5\"><em>H. Morris, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_l\">The stocks, which were taxed in this case, have no locality but that of the owner; and by Rev. Sts. <em>c. 7, </em>\u00a7 9, they are to be assessed to the owner, in making town taxes, in the town where he resides. Vacant land in the district would have been exempted from taxation, if the purpose of the legislature had been to tax only such property as was to be protected from fire.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-6\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYZ\">This case turns upon the construction of <em>St. </em>1844, c. 152, \u00a7 13. The defendants were duly established and organized as a fire district, according to the provisions ot that statute; and the defendant was afterwards assessed, in a tax duly raised by a vote of said district, upon his personal property, including stocks in banks and other corporations, located and doing business without the limits of the said district. His counsel contends that, those stocks were not liable to taxation, not being property within the district. But it is agreed that the plaintiff had a dwelling-house and resided within the limits of the said fire district; and by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. 7, </em>\u00a7 9, \u201call personal estate, whether within or without this State,\u201d (except in certain cases enumerated in \u00a7 10,) \u201cshall be assessed to the owner in the town where he shall be an inhabitant on the first day of May; \u201d and by the said <em>St. </em>of 1844, c. 152, \u00a7 13, it is enacted that all sums of money that shall be voted by the inhabitants of such fire district \u201c shall be assessed and collected in the same manner that the town\u2019s taxes are assessed and collected.\u201d The stocks in question are not included in any of the enumerated cases contained in the Rev. Sts. c. 7, \u00a7 10; so that it is clear that the plaintiff was liable to be taxed for these stocks in any town tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">But it has been argued, that by the proviso the plaintiff was not liable to taxation for property not actually within the fire district; and that if such is not the construction of the section, the proviso would be of no effect. But we think this is an erroneous inference. The proviso was intended, i\u00ab. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>our opinion, to prevent real estate and tangible property, such as goods and chattels, from being taxed, which might be within the town and without the fire district. In all other respects, this tax was to be assessed like town taxes.' These stocks have no locality, except where the owner lives and has his domicil, and in no sense can they be considered as property not within the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
