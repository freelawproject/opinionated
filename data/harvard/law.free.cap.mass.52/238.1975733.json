J. whose report thereof was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">The plaintiff gave in evidence the following paper: \u201c Received of Jeremiah Colegrove one hundred and one dollars and fifty cents on a note I hold against the estate of Jeremiah Colegrove, late of Adams, deceased. Received above of J. Colegrove, executor of the will of the late J. C. deceased. April 1840. Th. Robinson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\">It also appeared in evidence, that due notice of the plaintiff\u2019s appointment as executor was given in April 1838, and a copy thereof returned, sworn to, and filed in the probate office, in July 1838 ; that the plaintiff, under the impression that his testator\u2019s estate was solvent, paid the sum for which the above receipt was given, on a note for a larger sum, held by the defendant against the testator; that the testator\u2019s estate was afterwards represented and proved to be insolvent; that the defendant appeared before the commissioners appointed to examine claims against said estate, and proved an account which he had against it, but did not prove said note ; that the commission of insolvency was closed, hut was opened again, on the petition of the plaintiff, and the sum of $101-50 paid to the defendant, as above stated, and other demands paid by the plaintiff under the same circumstances, were allowed by the commissioners to the persons to whom they had been thus paid; that a dividend was decreed upon the demands proved before the commissioners, including the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>proved by the defendant himself, and the $101-50 proved as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">This action was brought to recover the difference between said dividend, so allowed to the defendant, and $101-50, so paid as above. The plaintiff claimed of the defendant a right to recover back said difference, previously to the bringing of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">The defendant contended that by the provisions of the Rev. Sts. c. 66, \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 13, this action could not be maintained ; and the court being of that opinion, a verdict was directed for the defendant, which was returned by the jury. To this direction the plaintiff filed exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>Dawes, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXK\">Before the passing of <em>St. </em>1823, <em>c. </em>144, an executor, who had paid a demand against his testator, whose estate afterwards proved to be insolvent, might recover back the difference between the sum paid by him and the amount of the dividend decreed on the report of the commissioners of insolvency. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>17 Mass. 380. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>3 Pick. 261. <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>17 Pick. 83. By that statute, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 3, the law was so far altered, that creditors, who were <em>\u201cpaid in full </em>by the executor or administrator,\u201d under a belief that the estate was solvent, should \u201cnot be liable-to refund or contribute any part of the debts received by them.\u201d The Rev. Sts. c. 66, \u00a7 13, provide that \u201cthe creditors of the deceased, who shall have been previously <em>paid </em>by the executor or administrator, shall not be liable to refund any part of the amount so received by them.\u201d This and three other sections of the same chapter, the commissioners say, \u201c comprise the substance of <em>St. </em>1823, c. 144, with some <em>verbal </em>alterations.\u201d No change of the law was intended. The present case, therefore, is not within the revised statutes; for the defendant was not paid in full.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-9\"><em>Robinson, Jr. </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At3\">The Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>66, \u00a7\u00a7 11-13, have removed the grounds on which the cases cited for the plaintiff were decided, and also the ground of his claim under the letter of <em>St. </em>1823, c. 144, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-10\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aol\">This case depends on the construction and true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>meaning of the Rev. Sts. c. 66, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12, 13; and the question is, whether the defendant is liable to refund any part of the sum received by him of the plaintiff, in part payment o\u00ed his demand against the plaintiff\u2019s testator, before his estate was represented, or known to the executor, to be insolvent. By \u00a7 11, it is provided that if an executor or administrator shall not, within one year after notice given of his appointment, \u201c have notice of demands against the estate of the deceased, which will authorize him to represent it insolvent, he may, after the expiration of the said one year, proceed to pay the debts due from the estate; and he shall not become personally liable to any other creditor, in consequence of any such payments, made before notice of his demand, although the remaining estate should be insufficient to satisfy such last mentioned creditor.\u201d By &lt;\u00a7&gt; 12, \u201cif any executor or administrator shall have paid away, in manner aforesaid, the whole of the estate and effects of the deceased, before notice of the demand of any other creditor, he shall not be required, in consequence of such new demand, to represent the estate as insolvent, but may plead <em>plene administravit; </em>and upon proving such payments, he shall be discharged.\u201d By \u00a7 13, it is provided that if the executor or administrator shall not have so paid away the whole of the estate and effects of the deceased, the estate may be represented insolvent, and the remaining estate and effects may be distributed among the creditors; \u201c but the creditors of the deceased, who shall have been previously paid by the executor or administrator, as aforesaid, shall not be liable to refund any part of the amount so received by them.\u201d These provisions are very clearly expressed, and will admit of but one construction. The language of the last clause of &lt;\u00a7&gt; 13 is applicable to the present case, and is decisive against the defendant\u2019s liability. There can be no distinction, in this respect, between the payment of the whole or a part only of a creditor\u2019s debt. The cases of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>17 Mass. 380, and <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>17 Pick. 83, are not applicable to this case. The former was decided before the revised statutes, and before <em>St. </em>1823, c. 144; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>in the latter case the payment was made before the probate of the will, and therefore was not a case within the provisions of either of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
