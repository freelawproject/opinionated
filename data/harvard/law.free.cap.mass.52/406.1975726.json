The indictment then all ged, \u201c that the said Gilbert Warden, the defendant in said bill of complaint, afterwards, to wit, on the twenty eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty three, at Petersham, in the county of Worcester, did come, in his own proper person, before Aaron Brooks, jr. Esquire, he the said Aaron Brooks, jr. being then and there one of the justices assigned to keep the peace within and for the county of Worcester aforesaid, and then and there did make, produce and exhibit to the said Aaron Brooks, jr. Esquire, so being such justice as aforesaid, the answer in writing of him the said Gilbert Warden to the said bill of complaint of the said Alpheus Harding, then pending in the said supreme judicial court, entitled 1 the answer of Gilbert Warden, the defendant, to a bill of complaint of Alpheus Harding;\u2019 and the said Gilbert Warden was then and them sworn, in due form of law, and took his corporal oath touching and concerning the matters contained in his said answer, by and before said Aaron Brooks, jr. Esquire, so being such justice of the peace as aforesaid, and then and there having sufficient and competent power and authority to administer an oath to the said Gilbert Warden, in that behalf; and that said Gilbert Warden, being so sworn as aforesaid, and being then and there lawfully required to declare and depose the truth, m a proceeding in a course of justice, did, upon his oath aforesaid, concerning the matters contained in his said answer, before the said Aaron Brooks, jr., Esquire, so being such justice as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>aforesaid, then and there swear, make oath, depose and say, that said answer of him the said Gilbert Warden was true, according to his best recollection and belief; and that the said Gilbert Warden, being so sworn as aforesaid, and intending unjustly to aggrieve the said Alpheus Harding, the aforesaid complainant, did, in his answer aforesaid, before said Aaron Brooks, jr. Esquire, being such justice as aforesaid, falsely, knowingly, wilfully and corruptly, by his own act and consent, upon his oath aforesaid, among other things, then and there answer, swear, depose and say, in substance and to the effect following, tp wit.\u201d (Here were set forth the matters in the defendant\u2019s answer aforesaid, and an allegation of their falsity.) The conclusion of the indictment was, \u201c that the said Gilbert Warden, in manner and form aforesaid, and of his own corrupt mind, did falsely, wickedly, wilfully and corruptly commit wilful and corrupt perjury, to the manifest perversion of public justice,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Merrick, </em>J. the district attorney, to prove the administration of the oath to the defendant, offered in evidence a certificate of that fact, attached to the defendant\u2019s answer, purporting to be signed by Aaron Brooks, jr. the magistrate befc.-e whom the answer was alleged to be sworn to, with evidence of the hand writing of said magistrate. The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence, on the ground that it was not competent evidence of the administration of the oath. It was agreed that the magistrate had deceased before the trial. The judge ruled that the evidence was competent, and suffered it to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">The defendant contended that it was not competent foi the government, under this indictment, to prove that any order had been made by the supreme judicial court, or was served upon the defendant, requiring him to make answer to said bill of discovery. But the judge admitted the record ol said court of the proceedings upon said bill, as evidence of the issuing of such order, and of its service upon the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">There being no allegation, in the indictment, that any suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>was pending in any court, in relation to which the said bill of discovery could be used, the defendant contended that there was no issue to which the statements made in his answer could be material. But the judge ruled that it was sufficient to sustain the indictment, if the answers of the defendant were material to the points in question, upon the matters proposed and set forth in said bill of discovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">The defendant was found guilty by the jury, and alleged exceptions to the judge\u2019s rulings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-6\"><em>B. F. Thomas &amp; F. H.

Evidence of these facts was therefore inadmissible. 1 Hawk. <em>c. </em>69, \u00a7 1. 4 Bl. Com. 137. 2 Russell on Crimes, (1st ed.) 1752, 1756. Roscoe Crim. Ev.

A direct averment of these facts was not necessary in order to render the evidence of them admissible.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-12\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">The certificate of the magistrate before whom the oath was taken, his signature thereto being proved, was competent and sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the talc\u2018mg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of the oath by the defendant. 1 Greenl. on Ev. \u00a7 512. Roscoe Crim. Ev. (2d ed.) 759. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>1 Leach, (3d ed.) 60, and 2 Bur. 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The objection that has required more consideration is the want of any particular and precise averment that the court took judicial cognizance of the bill for a discovery, and by any judicial order required the defendant to answer thereto. The indictment does however allege, with time and place, the filing of the bill, and an exhibit thereof to the court, and a prayer that the court would order the defendant to reply under oath to the interrogatories therein propounded to him, and then further alleges that the defendant did, at a certain time and place stated, appear <em>before </em>Aaron Brooks, jr. a justice of the peace, and make answer thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Taking the whole indictment, we think it sufficiently appears that the answer, in which the perjury is alleged to have been committed, was an answer made by the defendant, as a' party to the bill which had been filed against him. A party may appear without a subpoena, and take upon himself the defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">There are various allegations in this indictment which aid in establishing the fact that this answer was made in a proceeding in a course of justice. 1st. The indictment alleges that the document, to which the defendant made oath, was entitled \u201cthe answer of Gilbert Warden, the defendant, to a bill of complaint of Alpheus Harding.\u201d 2d. It is alleged that \u201c said Aaron Brooks had competent and sufficient power and authority to administer an oath to said Gilbert Warden in that behalf; \u201d which could be truly affirmed only upon the supposition that the defendant had become a party to the bill, .and had appeared to answer thereto. 3d. It is alleged \u201c that said Gilbert Warden, being then and there lawfully required to declare and depose the truth in a proceeding in a course ot justice, did,\u201d &amp;c. 4th. It is averred \u201cthat, by the said answer of said Gilbert Warden still remaining in the supreme judicial court aforesaid,\u201d these facts appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">These allegations, taken in connexion with the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>matters charged, sufficiently allege the fact that the defendant legally became a party to a proceeding in a course of justice, and that this proceeding was a bill in chancery to which the defendant was legally bound to make an answer under oath; that he undertook to make such answer under <em>oath; </em>and that in so doing he made the various statements, alleged in the indictment to be false, and well known to be such by the defendant, at the time of the administration of the said oath to him. We are therefore of opinion that the false oath, imputed to the defendant in this indictment, is charged as one taken by the defendant when lawfully required to depose the truth in a proceeding in a course of justice, and that the indictment is in that respect sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
