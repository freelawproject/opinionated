Upon plenary trials in different divisions of the District Court of Utah County, the respective trial judges rejected his petitions and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-20\">The petitioner makes two contentions: (1) That his plea of guilty was coerced by a threat that an habitual criminal charge would be filed against him; and (2) that no crime was committed because he in fact had credit with the drawee bank to cover the check in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-21\">The effort to upset this conviction in this manner must be considered in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>nection with our rules of procedure, When an accused is convicted of a crime, our law requires that any claimed error or defect he corrected by a regular appeal within the time allowed by law, and if this is not done the judgment becomes final. It can then be subjected to collateral attack by an extraordinary writ only when the interests of justice so demand because of some extraordinary circumstance or exigency: e. g., lack of jurisdiction, mistaken identity, where the requirements of law have been so ignored or distorted that the accused has been deprived of \u201cdue process of law,\u201d or there is shown to exist some other such circumstance that it would be unconscionable not to review the conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-2\">From our review of this record, we are not persuaded that the petitioner met the requirements just discussed with respect to either of his contentions. We first direct attention to petitioner\u2019s claim that he was coerced into making a plea of guilty. He was represented by competent'counsel, Mr. Dean W. Payne, who appeared to manifest a serious interest in his behalf. A plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was entered. The court appointed two psychiatrists, both of whom reported that petitioner was competent. Thereafter he appeared in court with his attorney and stated his desire to withdraw his plea of not guilty Judge Sorensen expressed his special concern for an accused where doubt had been raised as to his competency. He proceeded with what impresses us as particular care to question petitioner\u2019s counsel, Mr. Payne, the petitioner, and the district attorney, Mr.\u2019 Ivins, to be sure that petitioner understood what he was doing; that his change of plea was voluntary; and was not induced or coerced by any promise or threat. This colloquy included the following : and plead guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">The Court: Has <em>anybody </em>made any threats or promises to get that change of mind from you ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The Defendant: None at all, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The foregoing is inconsistent with petitioner\u2019s present contention that he understood that he was saying only that the <em>district attorney </em>had made no threat or promise, and that it did not include the <em>sheriff, </em>who he now claims had made a threat which coerced him into pleading guilty. Nevertheless, we also examine the testimony of the sheriff upon which the petitioner places his reliance. He admitted mentioning to the petitioner that because he had been previously convicted of other felonies, there was a possibility that an habitual criminal charge would be filed, but in response to the petitioner\u2019s question as to what he could do, the sheriff stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>* * * I says, \u2018That is entirely up to .you, Harold, whatever you do.\u2019 .And he says, \u2018Well, I wrote the check.\u2019 And I says, 'Well, then, that is up to you, the way you plead or whatever you do, because I am in no position to make any promises whatsoever. <em>The county attorney files the complaints and the judge makes the decision,\u2019 </em>and I say, \u2018that is as far as I can go.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Answering other questions the sheriff forthrightly denied making any threat or promise to petitioner to persuade him to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In whatever light the foregoing testimony is viewed, it could hardly be distorted into what the petitioner would have to have to aid him here: evidence which would compel a finding by the trial court that petitioner\u2019s plea resulted from coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The principles above stated likewise apply to the petitioner\u2019s efforts to obtain his release under the writ coram nobis on the ground that no crime had been committed because he had credit with the bank. In that regard, we acknowledge that this court has recognized the availability of that writ in a proper case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But its use is even more rare and restricted than that of habeas corpus. It can properly be invoked only where there has been some mistake of <em>fact </em>which, if the truth, had been known, would have prevented the conviction; and the failure to make known such fact must have been without fault or neglect on the part of the accused, in that it must be something which he could not by the exercise of reasonable diligence have discovered and presented before the conviction, unless it is shown that he was prevented from presenting the evidence in some manner which would excuse him from having done so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There can be no question but that the facts concerning petitioner\u2019s credit with the bank were known to the petitioner and his counsel at the time he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">In support of his petition, the testimony of Wilma Wooton, payee of another worthless check upon which petitioner was charged, was offered to the effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">* \u25a0* * Harold [Sullivan] came to me and asked me to hold the checks and I took them with- the understanding, knowing that I was loaning him this money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">There are two points of interest about this testimony: Assuming this witness, who had signed a complaint charging that petitioner passed the check with intent to defraud her, was telling the truth in her later statement : It does not relate to the check- upon which the conviction from which petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>seeks release is based. Further pertinent is the \u2018 fact that her proffered evidence and that of\u2019 the petitioner himself are mutually inconsistent. It was his contention that he had credit, nor with the <em>payees </em>of the \u2022checks, but with the bank, as\u2019 indicated by the following statement to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">The Court: You had no funds .in..the account in the bank on May 7th ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Mr. Sullivan: No I didn\u2019t, but I had a <em>credit </em>with the bank, as far as I was concerned, and as far as I knew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It is also shown that the check upon which the instant conviction is based was \u2022one of many worthless checks, amounting to -many thousands of dollars, which had 'been issued by the petitioner and which ;were then outstanding. It seems quite obvious that the plea of guilty on the one \u2022check was entered as the best way out of a 'bad situation; and that after commitment \u2022and lapse of time the instant proceedings \u2022were instituted in an effort to focus upon \u2022the single check and upset the conviction. Perhaps the petitioner should not be-blam\u2022ed for this effort. Nevertheless, as will be seen from what has been said above, he has not succeeded in providing a basis for nullifying the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> It should also be pointed out'that there is a basic fall\u00e1cy in the propositions urged by the petitioner: He assumes that the trial court was obliged to believe his evidence and draw conclusions favorable to him therefrom. The law is to the contrary. Petitions in habeas corpus and cor-am nobis are generally regarded as being analogous procedurally to civil proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petitioner has the burden of persuading the trial court by a preponderance of evidence facts which will entitle him to 'relief. When the trial judge has made findings of fact and entered judgment thereon, they are entitled to the presumption of correctness; on' appeal' the evidence is surveyed in the light favorable to them; and if there is any reasonable basis in the evidence to support them they will not be overturned.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVk\">' For the reasons set forth herein the judgments of the trial courts in denying the petitions are affirmed. No costs awarded. \u2022(All emphasis added.)</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-10\">CALLISTER, TUCKETT, HENRI.OD and ELLETT, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-22\">.
