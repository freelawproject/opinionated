Hoilett, appeals from his convictions of murder in the first degree based on felony-murder and armed robbery while masked. On appeal, the defendant claims error (1) in the denial of his motion for a mistrial after the Commonwealth\u2019s opening; (2) in the erroneous admission of photographs; (3) in the denial of his motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s conduct during trial; (4) in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument; (5) in the instructions on the presumption of innocence, on the third prong of malice, and in the failure to give a missing witness instruction. He asks that his conviction of armed robbery while masked be vacated because it is duplicative of the conviction of felony-murder in the first degree. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of felony-murder in the first degree. We agree with the defendant that the conviction of armed robbery while masked is duplicative and order that that conviction be vacated. We decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to order entry of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985). On the morning of February 28, 1994, the defendant, wearing a mask and carrying a shotgun, entered the AMC Market in the Dorchester section of Boston, said, \u201cThis is a hold up,\u201d and ordered everyone to the floor. One of the store\u2019s owners, the sixty-eight year old victim, was behind the counter getting cigarettes for a customer. The victim\u2019s son-in-law and three year old granddaughter were standing by a freezer in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The defendant told the victim to give him the money from the cash register. At the same time, the victim\u2019s son-in-law managed to leave the market with his daughter. The victim\u2019s son-in-law then began to lower the security grate at the front of the store. The customer also left the store and, as soon \u00e1s he was outside, he heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">After shooting the victim, the defendant fled from the store through the entrance that was partially blocked by the security grate. The defendant placed his leg below the security grate as the victim\u2019s son-in-law attempted to lower it. At least twice, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>son-in-law brought the grate down on the defendant\u2019s leg, and the defendant cried out in pain. Ultimately, however, the defendant escaped and fled the scene by walking slowly up Westville Street to Dakota Street. When the police entered the market, they found the victim. He had been shot at close range with a shotgun. He died in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant went to the apartment of some acquaintances, Anngolia Cartwright, Vimbai Bush, and Cheryl Jefferson on Dakota Street. As he entered the apartment, the defendant removed his mask. The defendant asked for Bush, a female acquaintance of the defendant. Cartwright heard him say, \u201cf-g spick,\u201d and \u201cOh, man, oh, man I was f \u2014 d up. I hope he die. I hope he die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The defendant appeared nervous. He was \u201cpac[ing] the floor back and forth.\u201d His finger was bleeding. Bush asked the defendant what was wrong, and he replied, \u201cDamn, I shouldn\u2019t did that, I don\u2019t know, I shouldn\u2019t did that. ... He should have just given me the money.\u201d The defendant also said that \u201c[tjhey tried to shut the grate on me\u201d and \u201cI shot him.\u201d Bush bandaged the defendant\u2019s finger and asked him to leave. When Bush left, the defendant was still in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The next day, following a lead, the police came to the door of the Dakota Street residence. Bush initially told the police that she did not know anything. Subsequently, she gave a statement to the police. She also identified the defendant from a group of photographs the police showed her. The defendant was arrested and indicted for armed robbery while masked, murder, and possession of a sawed-off shotgun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The defense did not present any witnesses, choosing instead to focus on impeaching the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s key witnesses. Through cross-examination and closing argument, defense counsel suggested that the defendant was not the armed, masked robber and that the women in the Dakota Street apartment were lying to protect the guilty party.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">2. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s opening. </em>During his opening, the prosecutor stated that the police went to the apartment on Dakota Street and Jefferson answered the door. The prosecutor stated that Jefferson told the police that she was not home when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the defendant arrived the day the murder was committed, but said that Bush and Cartwright were there. Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial because the prosecutor\u2019s statement was inconsistent with Jefferson\u2019s grand jury testimony. Defense counsel also objected because Jefferson was not listed on the prosecution\u2019s witness list. The judge denied the motion, but instructed the jury that the opening statement was not evidence. The defendant does not claim that this curative instruction was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cThe proper function of an opening is to outline in a general way the nature of the case which the counsel expects to be able to prove or support by evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 451, 454 (1978), quoting <em>Posell </em>v. <em>Herscovitz, </em>237 Mass. 513, 514 (1921). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>346 Mass. 482, 486 (1963). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>381 Mass. 13, 15-16 (1980). A mistrial may be appropriate \u201cwhere the force of the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks was overwhelmingly prejudicial and likely to leave an indelible imprint on the jurors\u2019 minds.\u201d <em>Fazio, supra </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. At sidebar, the prosecutor told the judge that he was as yet uncertain as to whether he would call Jefferson as a witness. The reference to the fact that Jefferson claimed not to have been at home when the police first asked her about the defendant\u2019s actions was not \u201coverwhelmingly prejudicial,\u201d <em>id., </em>or even critical, to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Further, the Commonwealth never mentioned Jefferson\u2019s statements again. The single mention of her name during the Commonwealth\u2019s opening would not have left \u201can indelible imprint on the jurors\u2019 minds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge delivered a strong curative instruction which we assume the jury heard and followed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 158 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>381 Mass. 13, 16 (1980). There was no error in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">3. <em>Photographs. </em>When the police questioned Bush about who had come to her apartment on the day of the murder, she picked out the defendant\u2019s photograph from a group of police photographs. During her direct examination, the prosecutor offered a sanitized copy of the photograph. Defense counsel objected, having argued in a motion in limine that the jurors would assume the defendant had a criminal record if they knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that the police had his photograph on file. The judge overruled the objection, and the photograph was admitted. The judge also instructed the jury that they should not draw any inference from the fact that the police possessed a photograph of the defendant. The judge told the jury that the police had access to photographs of private citizens through the Registry of Motor Vehicles and through the licensing of various professions such as taxicab drivers and common victualers.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The defendant concedes that the Commonwealth removed any markings identifying the photograph as a mugshot. Bush knew the defendant. Therefore, her identification of the photograph was marginally relevant to the issue of identification of the armed, masked robber. We conclude there was no reversible error in the admission of this photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The judge also admitted in evidence two photographs taken during the autopsy of the victim. The first photograph showed the close-range shotgun wound and the victim\u2019s avulsed intestines. The second photograph showed the shape of the wound highlighted in white. These photographs were only relevant to show the close range of the shot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Generally, photographs are admissible in the discretion of the judge. We reiterate that \u201c[t]he rule in this area is, as has been stated, one of trial judge discretion. Whether photographic evidence is unnecessary or inflammatory must be considered on a case-by-case basis against the issues that have been raised at trial. We caution, however, that trial judges must take care to avoid exposing the jury unnecessarily to material that might inflame the jurors\u2019 emotions and possibly deprive the defendant of an impartial jury. In addition to considering whether the judge has abused his [or her] discretion, we also consider under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in a case in which the defendant has been convicted of first degree murder, the over-all fairness of the trial. In a situation in which the use of photographs may cause prejudice or is especially unfair, or where this admonition has not been followed, the existing standards of review provide a sufficient basis to grant relief to a defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426, 432 (1995). The admission of the three contested photographs did not undermine the over-all fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>4. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s conduct during the trial. </em>During the direct examination of the victim\u2019s son-in-law, the prosecutor twice referred to the armed, masked robber as \u201cthe defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point in the trial, no evidence had been presented as to the armed, masked robber\u2019s identity. Defense counsel objected immediately after both references, and the judge sustained the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Subsequently, during the questioning of a witness who saw a masked man walking away from the AMC Market, defense counsel again objected, claiming that the prosecutor was gesturing toward the defendant when he referred to the masked man. The judge noticed that the prosecutor was \u201ckind of raising his hand \u2014 both hands in gestures,\u201d but was not certain that these gestures qualified as \u201cpointing.\u201d Nevertheless, the judge told the prosecutor to stop gesturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The judge also instructed the jurors that any gesturing toward the defendant they might have noticed was not evidence. He added that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cdefendant\u201d was not evidence. The judge told the jury that, \u201c[a]s of this point in the case no one has been identified as the person who purportedly was in the store in question or carrying the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cdefendant\u201d in questioning a witness who could not identify the armed, masked robber as the \u201cdefendant\u201d prior to the introduction of any identification evidence was improper. However, neither of the questions in which the prosecutor used the word \u201cdefendant\u201d to describe the armed, masked robber was answered by the witness. It was clear from the witness\u2019s testimony that he was unable to identify the defendant as the armed, masked robber. We are persuaded that the judge\u2019s specific curative instruction on this point was adequate to address any possible prejudice to the defendant. On the matter of the prosecutor\u2019s gestures, we defer to the trial judge who observed the gestures.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>5. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>During closing arguments, the prosecutor told the jury that defense counsel was \u201carguing two propositions to you. ... He can\u2019t have it both ways, okay . . . believe this part of it, but don\u2019t believe that part of it. Whatever suits his client, that\u2019s how he\u2019s focusing the evidence. And I\u2019d ask you to focus the evidence in a different way.\u201d Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, asserting that it was not appropriate for the Commonwealth \u201cto make any comment upon my role.\u201d The judge denied the motion. We conclude that there was no error in the prosecutor\u2019s summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not introduce new evidence or opinion into the trial. The prosecutor addressed the nature of \u201cthe trial tactics of the defence and . . . evidence developed ... by the defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grimshaw, </em>412 Mass. 505, 507 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunker, </em>363 Mass. 792, 800 (1973). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>415 Mass. 422, 429 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 272 (1982). The prosecutor did nothing more than \u201cexpress[] his view of the strength of the [defendant\u2019s argument].\u201d <em>Grimshaw, supra </em>at 508, and cases cited. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not present an ad hominem attack on defense counsel, as asserted on appeal. Nor did the prosecutor misstate defense counsel\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">6. <em>Error in the instructions, </em>a. <em>Presumption of innocence. </em>The judge instructed the jury that, if the Commonwealth proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, then the presumption of innocence \u201cwill disappear, it never existed.\u201d There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that the presumption remains as an \u201cobstacle.\u201d The instruction here was substantially similar to the instruction we approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. 259, 266-267 (1998). There was no error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">b. <em>Missing witness instruction. </em>The defendant argues that he is entitled to a missing witness instruction because the Commonwealth mentioned Jefferson in his opening to the jury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u201cThe trial judge is vested with the discretion to refuse to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the instruction, and the defendant is not entitled to the instruction as a matter of right.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>429 Mass. 182, 184 (1999). Jefferson was homeless. Both the prosecution and the defense had the same telephone number for Jefferson. There is no evidence that the prosecution possessed any advantage over the defense in reaching Jefferson by telephone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where \u201ca witness is equally available to parties on both sides of a dispute, no inference should be drawn against either side for failing to call the witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>397 Mass. 105, 108 (1986), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 151 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">7. <em>The concurrent sentences for felony-murder and armed robbery while masked. </em>The Commonwealth concedes that the concurrent sentences imposed on the defendant for both first degree felony-murder and the underlying felony are duplicative. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 398 (1995) (\u201cEven where the sentence imposed runs concurrently, the conviction of the underlying felony is duplicative and must be set aside\u201d), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 395 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>420 Mass. 95, 114 (1995). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On the issue of duplicative convictions, \u201c[t]he appropriate remedy is to vacate both the conviction and sentence on the lesser included offense, and to affirm the conviction on the more serious offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, supra. </em>Because the armed robbery while masked is the sole basis of the felony-murder conviction, we vacate the conviction of armed, masked robbery. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, ante </em>182, 196-197 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">8. <em>G.L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, review. </em>Pursuant to our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have reviewed the transcript and conclude that the interest of justice does not require a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>or entry of a lesser degree of guilt. The conviction of felony-murder is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the indictment charging possession of a sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The defendant also was tried on a theory of deliberate premeditation. The photographs taken during the autopsy are marginally relevant on that issue. The jurors rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of deliberately premeditated malice aforethought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The prosecutor: \u201c[Y]ou went around the corner and observed the defendant, is that correct?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">The judge: \u201cSustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cHow far . . . did you see the defendant walk down Iowa Street?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">The judge: \u201cCome on over here for a minute.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The defendant complains that the judge\u2019s use of the instruction on third prong malice was error. We need not reach that issue because the conviction of murder in the first degree was based on felony murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>427 Mass. 434, 440 n.5 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chip-man, </em>418 Mass. 262, 270 n.5 (1994). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>408 Mass. 811, 821 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Jefferson did appear at the courthouse once during the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of its case-in-chief. She apparently made herself known to a court official who notified the prosecutor during her examination of a forensic witness. As far as can be determined the prosecutor \u201ctold the sergeant that, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to use her.\u2019 \u201d Jefferson then left the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In these circumstances, where the prosecutor had no advance knowledge that Jefferson was going to appear and was notified of her presence in the middle of questioning a witness, we cannot say, as defense counsel suggests, that the prosecutor should have made certain that Jefferson remained in the courthouse in case the defendant wanted to question her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
