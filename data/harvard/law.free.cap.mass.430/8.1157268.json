L. c. 265, \u00a7 43, a statute which proscribes two distinct types of stalking, stalking by harassment and stalking by following. On appeal, the defendant claims error in (1) the denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss; (2) certain jury instructions; (3) the exclusion of certain evidence; (4) the prosecutor\u2019s conduct of cross-examination; and (5) remarks made by the prosecutor during his closing argument. The defendant also contends his trial counsel was ineffective. We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We affirm both the denial of the motion to dismiss and the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The jury were warranted in finding the following facts. The defendant and the victim were married in April, 1988, and were separated in May, 1991. They had one child at the time of their divorce in May, 1992. The final divorce decree became absolute on August 10, 1992. In the judgment, the parties agreed the defendant would \u201cnot follow [the victim] or harass her at her home or her place of employment,\u201d and the judgment prohibited nonemergency verbal communication, specifically forbidding harassing telephone calls.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The defendant\u2019s violent and threatening behavior began even before the final divorce judgment was entered. Throughout 1992, he harassed the victim, expressing his displeasure with her involvement with her fianc\u00e9, and verbally abused her by referring to her by sexually explicit slurs. In June, 1992, the defendant arrived at her house to visit their child on a nonvisi-tation day. Sometime later, he scared the victim by following her home from work. In September, she saw the defendant with his girlfriend at a shopping mall, and they both followed her between stores. The next day, the victim observed the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>driving back and forth in front of her home. In December, 1992, the defendant inexplicably appeared at two of their child\u2019s doctor\u2019s appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The defendant\u2019s harassing behavior continued in 1993. In the spring, the victim and a coworker observed the defendant looking at her through her office window from across the street with binoculars. He did this at least four times. On another night, he followed her and a friend to two bars and then to her house, where he threatened to kill her. Another time he scared her by saying, \u201cA single mother alone like this, with kids, strange things could happen.\u201d One day, after picking up their daughter, the defendant, while verbally harassing the victim, backed his vehicle onto her lawn, leaving tire tracks. He carried a gun with him to the visitation pickups, and told their child at least a dozen times in the victim\u2019s presence, \u201cSomebody could get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The defendant\u2019s conduct became more threatening in 1994. In January, he again appeared unexpectedly at their child\u2019s doctor\u2019s office. The next day, he was abusive toward her on the telephone. In May, he verbally abused her once again, calling her a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201chome wrecker.\u201d In June, the defendant twice warned her to \u201cbe careful\u201d because \u201c[y]ou never know what could happen to a single mother alone with two girls in the house.\u201d In early August, while the victim and her fianc\u00e9 were shopping for engagement rings, she observed the defendant watching them through the store window. He then followed them after they left the store for approximately three miles. Twice in October he threatened her, once saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours you bitch,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yours and I\u2019ve had it with this shit.\u201d In November, the defendant again followed the victim and her family as they drove on the highway for several miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The defendant again followed and harassed the victim on several occasions in 1995. Five times between March and June, the defendant verbally abused the victim by telephoning her or confronting her at home or in the community. In three of these encounters, he threatened to kill her, stating once: \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re going to see. I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In May, the defendant was at their child\u2019s school when the victim picked up their child. He then followed her to a shopping mall. On Mother\u2019s Day, he followed the victim\u2019s family to church, entered the church during the service and stared at her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>then, when the family left in an attempt to get away from him, he followed them to a restaurant. In late June, the defendant followed the victim and her family on the highway for at least twenty miles, driving behind and beside their car. They feared he was going to use his gun because he kept one hand hidden as he drove alongside them.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant used a scanner to listen to her telephone calls and bragged about this to a friend. Beginning in June, 1995, the defendant also videotaped his encounters with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss two counts, those for stalking by harassment in violation of a court order and for following in violation of a court order, because there was no order in effect against him when he was alleged to have committed the acts. He claimed that he could not be guilty under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>(b), </em>without violating one of the orders listed in the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion because he concluded that the stay-away order in the divorce judgment was the equivalent of a G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, order, and violation of it satisfied \u00a7 43 <em>(b). </em>We largely agree with the judge, and conclude that it was not error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The defendant was in violation of an order that was part of the divorce judgment. As discussed in a recent case, see <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 326 (1999), this order was entered pursuant to the Probate and Family Court\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, which provides, in part, that \u201cthe [Probate and Family Court] may make such further order as it deems necessary to protect either party or their children, to preserve the peace or to carry out the purposes of this section relative to restraint on personal liberty.\u201d By doing what he agreed not to do, the defendant violated \u00a7 18, one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>enumerated orders that supports a conviction of stalking in violation of a court order under \u00a7 43 <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions on stalking. </em>Under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>(a), </em>inserted by St. 1992, c. 31, one who \u201cwillfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or harasses another person and who makes a threat with the intent to place that person in imminent fear of death or serious bodily injury shall be guilty of the crime of stalking.\u201d The statute addresses both stalking by harassment and stalking by following.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543 (1994), we concluded that the portion of the stalking statute that addressed harassing conduct was unconstitutionally vague because it did not \u201cgive a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. 822, 826 (1979). The specific problem was ambiguity in the word \u201crepeatedly\u201d within the definition of harassment, which confused whether \u00e1 violation required one series of acts alone or multiple patterns of conduct. See <em>id. </em>at 546. We interpreted the statute in a manner that resolved any ambiguity, and concluded that the new definition was to be applied after the date the opinion was released, August 3, 1994.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the statute contemplates two different types of stalking, we noted that the prospective definition we announced in <em>Kwi-atkowski </em>applied only to stalking by harassment, not to stalking by following. See <em>id. </em>at 546 (\u201cTo be guilty under the \u2018harassment\u2019 aspect, as opposed to the \u2018following\u2019 aspect . . .\u201d) and <em>id. </em>at 547 (addressing only \u201cthe portion of the stalking statute concerning harassing conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">(a) <em>Stalking by harassment. </em>The defendant claims the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>erred by not instructing the jury that he could not be convicted of stalking by harassment or of stalking by harassment in violation of a court order, for acts committed prior to August 4, 1994. We agree with the defendant that the judge should so have instructed the jury, and that his convictions for stalking by harassment and for stalking by harassment in violation of a court order could only be based on offenses committed after August 3, 1994. See <em>id. </em>at 547. Because the defendant did not object to the jury instructions, we must determine whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We take this opportunity to address the standard of review applicable to unpreserved trial errors in cases other than capital cases on direct appeal, the so-called <em>Freeman </em>standard, which recently has been the subject of comment in our courts. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 114 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 595 (1998). An error creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice unless we are persuaded that it did not \u201cmaterially influence!]\u201d the guilty verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 564. In making that determination, we consider the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant (without consideration of any evidence erroneously admitted<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>), the nature of the error, whether the error is \u201csufficiently significant in the context of the trial to make plausible an inference that the [jury\u2019s] result might have been otherwise but for the error,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986), and whether it can be inferred \u201cfrom the record that counsel\u2019s failure to object was not simply a reasonable tactical decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Applying this standard to this case, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>conclude that the erroneous instructions do not warrant reversal of the convictions on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Failure to instruct the jury to consider only acts committed after August 3, 1994, in their deliberations on the counts of stalking by harassment and stalking by harassment in violation of a court order was error. Acts prior to August 4, 1994, cannot form the basis of his conviction of either of these two counts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, supra </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Here, the case against the defendant was virtually irrefutable. Facts in the record support the convictions based solely on acts committed after the <em>Kwiatkowski </em>case. Specifically, the jury were warranted in finding the defendant harassed the victim at least eight times after August 3, 1994. This \u201ccampaign of harassment,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matsos, </em>421 Mass. 391, 399 (1995), included two threats in October, 1994; five instances of harassment in 1995; and the harassment of the victim and her family on Mother\u2019s Day, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">As to the nature of the error, the erroneous instructions were problematic because the jury never should have considered the evidence of pre-August 4 behavior. That evidence, however, was cumulative of correctly admitted evidence that was clearly sufficient to convict the defendant. Given the amount and strength of the evidence of post-August 3 behavior, we cannot conclude the error raises an inference that the jury verdict might have been otherwise. We also are unable to infer from the record that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the jury instructions was a reasonable tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">In sum, given the formidable evidence of harassment perpetrated by the defendant after August 3, 1994, the judge\u2019s failure to prohibit the jury from considering acts occurring prior to the <em>Kwiatkowski </em>decision did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">(b) <em>Stalking by following. </em>The defendant argues the judge erred when instructing the jury concerning the charge of stalking by following and by following in violation of a court order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Because the defendant did not object to the instruction, we also review this claim to determine if it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, supra </em>at 595-596; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Specifically, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s instructions concerning the definition of \u201crepeatedly.\u201d In order to convict the defendant under the following prong of the stalking statute, the jury had to find that he \u201cwillfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow[ed]\u201d the victim. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>{a), </em>inserted by St. 1992, c. 31. The judge told the jury that \u201c[t]he term repeatedly means, at least twice. Therefore, the Defendant must have followed [the victim] more than two times.\u201d These instructions were confusing and contradictory because it is not clear if the jury were told to decide whether the defendant followed the victim two times or whether he followed her three or more times.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The judge should have instructed the jury that the Commonwealth had to prove there were more than two incidents of following. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 408, 411 (1997), the Appeals Court, interpreting stalking by following under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43, concluded that \u201crepeatedly\u201d \u201crequire[s] more than two incidents of following.\u201d We agree with the defendant that the jury should have been instructed to determine whether the defendant followed the victim more than two times because the defendant is entitled to the benefit of any ambiguity in the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 742 (1996) (concerning proper definition of \u201crepeatedly\u201d in the statute prohibiting harassing telephone calls).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Despite the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury properly, any error in jury instructions could not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because the defendant\u2019s convictions were based on more than two incidents of following. Here, evidence of following was overwhelming. The jury were warranted in finding the defendant followed the victim at least eight times.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The convictions of the defendants in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>by contrast, were based on only two incidents so the confusion in the instruction in those cases warranted reversal of the convictions. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>4. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object, first, to the jury instructions that did not address the August 3, 1994, distinction based on the <em>Kwiatkowski </em>case, and second, to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which, the defendant alleges, he stated both that the defendant could be convicted of acts occurring as long ago as 1992 and that the jury were warranted in considering the cumulative effect of all the defendant\u2019s conduct, including what he did prior to August 4, 1994. He seeks reversal of his convictions based on trial counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We review these claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to determine whether defense counsel\u2019s conduct fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). As to the defendant\u2019s first point, defense counsel was not deficient for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. The prosecutor did not stress events prior to August 4, 1994, in relation to the harassment counts, and behavior prior to that date was admissible on the following counts. As to his second claim, an ordinary lawyer representing this client would have understood <em>Kwiatkowski </em>and would have objected to the lack of an instruction, in regard to the harassment counts, concerning acts prior to August 4, 1994. Any potential prejudice resulting from defense counsel\u2019s performance, however, is immaterial because of our conclusion that the defendant would have been convicted even if the jury had considered only evidence of acts occurring after August 3, 1994. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>426 Mass. 48, 52 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977) (\u201cthere ought to be some showing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">5. <em>Evidence of prior applications for protective orders. </em>The defendant alleges the judge erred by precluding him from questioning the victim on cross-examination about her prior applications for protective orders. He asserts that evidence of prior applications was admissible to demonstrate his state of mind, and that it would have tended to show that he did not know his conduct was improper because his previous acts had not convinced other courts to issue protective orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Trial judges have wide discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant or unreasonably prejudicial. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>427 Mass. 90, 96 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>407 Mass. 798, 807 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>427 Mass. 65, 67-68 (1998), and cases cited. The judge did not abuse her discretion here because evidence that another court did not grant a protective order is irrelevant to determine whether the defendant is guilty of stalking in this case. The only order relevant to the charges here was the order contained in the divorce judgment. The victim\u2019s attempts to secure a protective order were irrelevant to the issue whether the defendant was aware that he was violating the order in the divorce judgment. In addition, the judge was warranted in excluding the evidence because it would have diverted the jury\u2019s attention to a collateral matter, circumstances surrounding applications for protective orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">6. <em>Cross-examination of the defendant. </em>The Commonwealth admits the prosecutor should not have asked the defendant on cross-examination to assess the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, we review the alleged error to determine whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 26 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The prosecutor violated the \u201cfundamental principle that \u2018a witness cannot be asked to assess the credibility of his testimony or that of other witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 567 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 706 (1985). In <em>Triplett, </em>a new trial was ordered, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, because the defendant was questioned about the credibility of his mother, the only witness to the murder. We emphasized the additional impropriety of the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201c[pjitting mother against son,\u201d by forcing the defendant to comment on his own mother\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 567. We concluded that the questioning created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, <em>id. </em>at 564, because the critical issue before the jury was \u201cwhether to accept the version [of events] given by the mother or that given by her son.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The record reveals that the defendant was questioned inappropriately thirteen times. The questioning can be categorized into three different groups. First, on seven occasions the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>prosecutor asked the defendant whether an event had happened.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These are similar to questions we concluded were not prejudicial in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 687 (1992). In that case, the prosecutor read a witness\u2019s statements made during a telephone call, and asked the defendant about the truth of each statement. We concluded that \u201c[no harm] came from what the prosecutor did. He could have asked the defendant, point by point, about the truth of each fact asserted in the statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">Four questions comprise a second group of instances where the prosecutor asked the defendant if what another witness had stated was correct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These are similar to questions from other cases that did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because they \u201cdid not create an issue of credibility between the defendant and other witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richenburg, </em>401 Mass. 663, 674 (1988). See <em>id. </em>at 673 n.4 (listing examples of questions posed). It is not improper \u201cfor the prosecutor to point out, through this line of questioning, that there were inconsistencies between the defendant\u2019s testimony and that of [a witness], so long as the defendant was not asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to assess the credibility of the [witness\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>412 Mass. 318, 327-328 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-24\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>Q.: </em>\u201cSo when [the victim and her husband] indicate that they saw you have a gun in your belt or show them the gun, they were wrong?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-26\">A.: \u201cYes they were wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In a third group, the prosecutor twice asked the defendant whether another witness lied in their prior testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The questioning was less severe than in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 707 (1984), where the Appeals Court ordered a new trial because, in part, the prosecutor asked \u201cat least a hundred improper questions on a cross-examination which covered over one hundred pages of the transcript.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. The present case is more similar to others in which a new trial was not ordered because the prosecutor asked the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>only one impermissible question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elam, </em>412 Mass. 583, 586 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 400, 401 n.2 (1983). Any potential harm to the defendant was lessened because he was able to respond without characterizing the other witness\u2019s testimony as truthful or false. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 515 (1992) (no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice where defendant had option not to allege witness was lying); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elam, supra </em>(no prejudicial error where defendant, when asked if witness was lying, explained his own actions and did not speculate).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In sum, we are convinced from our review of the record that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning was more likely \u201cdesigned to serve the proper purpose of \u2018eliciting] an explanation of differences from prior testimony,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 707 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 83, 88 (1983), than it was intended to \u201ctransform!] the interrogation stage of the trial into the phase traditionally reserved for argument and summation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra </em>at 709-710. The prosecutor\u2019s questioning in this case troubles us, but we cannot say that, when faced with overwhelming evidence against the defendant, the questions create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">7. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. </em>Nothing in the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement provides a sufficient reason to order a new trial or a reversal of his convictions. Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we have reviewed the prosecutor\u2019s statement to determine if it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 646 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loguidice, </em>420 Mass. 453, 455-456 (1995). We conclude that it did not.

I agree with the court\u2019s statement of the tests for determining the existence of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and prejudicial error. <em>Ante </em>at 13 &amp; n.7. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>write separately to explain my understanding of some of the differences between the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Appellate courts do not sit as triers of fact. Any test concerning reversible error that requires an appellate court to determine whether a defendant is actually innocent is conceptually flawed because such a test converts the appellate function into the jury function in violation of their different purposes. I do not accept recent pronouncements of Federal law that may suggest the contrary. The correct formulation of basic principles in this area is the one stated by Justice Rutledge in <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 763-764 (1946), in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cSome aids to right judgment may be stated more safely in negative than in affirmative form. Thus, it is not the appellate court\u2019s function to determine guilt or innocence. . . . Nor is it to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out. Appellate judges cannot escape such impressions. But they may not make them sole criteria for reversal or af-firmance. Those judgments are exclusively for the jury .... But this does not mean that the appellate court can escape altogether taking account of the outcome. To weigh the error\u2019s effect against the entire setting of the record without relation to the verdict or judgment would be almost to work in a vacuum. ... In criminal causes that outcome is conviction. This is different, or may be, from guilt in fact. It is guilt in law, established by the judgment of laymen. And the question is, not were they right in their judgment, regardless of the error or its effect upon the verdict. It is rather what effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision. The crucial thing is the impact of the thing done wrong on the minds of other men, not on one\u2019s own, in the total setting.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The tests expressed by the Court are underpinned by these fundamental principles that distinguish appellate from trial work.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice test is based on the settled rule that errors not raised or preserved by a defendant at trial will not be considered on appeal. The reasons for this rule were well stated by the Oregon Court of Appeals in <em>State </em>v. <em>Applegate, </em>39 Or. App. 17, 21 (1979), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201cThere are many rationales for the raise-or-waive rule [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]: that it is a necessary corollary of our adversary system in which issues are framed by the litigants and presented to a court; that fairness to all parties requires a litigant to advance his contentions at a time when there is an opportunity to respond to them factually, if his opponent chooses to; that the rule promotes efficient trial proceedings; that reversing for error not preserved permits the losing side to second-guess its tactical decisions after they do not produce the desired result; and that there is something unseemly about telling a lower court it was wrong when it never was presented with the opportunity to be right. The principal rationale, however, is judicial economy. There are two components to judicial economy: (1) if the losing side can obtain an appellate reversal because of error not objected to, the parties and public are put to the expense of retrial that could have been avoided had an objection been made; and (2) if an issue had been raised in the trial court, it could have been resolved there, and the parties and public would be spared the expense of an appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice test constitutes our exception to this aspect of the finality rule. The test requires a comparative analysis of the considerations set forth in the court\u2019s opinion to decide whether the jury might have reached a different result had the error not occurred. Each case on appeal will have its own peculiar characteristics, and no all-encompassing checklist can be developed. But, as an authority on criminal procedure has observed with respect to the counterpart Federal \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine, \u201c[tjhere are . . . certain factors which clearly have a positive influence on the application of the doctrine. The more closely balanced the evidence, for example, the greater the likelihood that an error otherwise not viewed as sufficiently patent or fundamental will meet the standard. Courts also acknowledge that errors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>constitutional magnitude will be noticed more freely under the plain error doctrine than violations of most statutes or common law standards. Various rulings also suggest that the doctrine is more likely to be applied where there might be a good reason for the lack of objection below,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] or where the error could not have been remedied by the trial judge even if called to his attention. On the other side, the doctrine is less likely to be applied where the error could have been readily corrected by an objection at trial, or where such an objection may have led the government to introduce additional evidence on the issue.\u201d 3 W.R. LaFave &amp; J.H. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 26.5, at 256-257 (1984). As a general proposition, to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the error must be serious when considered in terms of its injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict. The defendant bears the burden of showing that the error could have had such an impact, and the appellate court will not apply the test to grant the defendant relief in the absence of substantial agreement by the appellate panel that a new trial is necessary to correct a conviction that leaves the feeling that an injustice has occurred and to assure that trials are fundamentally fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The prejudicial (or harmless) error test stated by the court is that drawn from the <em>Kotteakos </em>case. The test has been applied in many of our decisions. As with the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice test, the prejudicial error test calls for a comparative analysis of the circumstances in a particular case. The appellate court, attentive to the fact that the defendant\u2019s rights at trial have been preserved, inquires whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict. The burden of showing the absence of error is on the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>377 Mass. 503, 510 (1979), and cases cited, and the Commonwealth also bears the risk of doubt when any exists as to the error being nonprejudicial. This test is quantitatively more favorable to a defendant than the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice test. There are, of course, considerable permutations of both tests that need not be discussed here. It is enough to state that the tests differ in their substance, and each serves a discrete function in the criminal justice process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The use of the word \u201cwaiver\u201d in this shorthand expression is not correct. Waiver involves the intentional relinquishment of a known right. A defense lawyer who does not object to an error at trial does not do so intentionally and knowingly (except in rare instances where a tactical judgment is made). The lack of an objection to, or a failure to preserve the right of appeal on, a trial error is usually the product of defense counsel\u2019s inadvertence or ignorance. The \u201craise or waive\u201d rule is more properly characterized as a \u201craise or lose\u201d rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The authors here cite as an example <em>United States </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>627 F.2d 193, 199 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1113 (1981), where an objection was not made because it might have exaggerated the prejudice caused by the initial error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Fried, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">(concurring, with whom Lynch, J., joins). On the ground that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct in accordance with the law did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the court spares the victim the further terror of a retrial. I disagree only with the court\u2019s description of what the standard of substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice means and with the instructions it issues as to the application of that standard in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The defendant has had a trial in which his guilt was determined according to rules of law in which he himself acquiesced. In the terminology of our law, he has waived his objections to any errors in the charge. When there has been such a waiver, a miscarriage of justice has only one meaning: that there is a substantial risk that an innocent person has been convicted. There is no such risk here.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">It literally makes no sense to proclaim a doctrine of waiver \u2014 to insist, as our rules of criminal procedure clearly do, that a defendant make his objections and propose his rulings of law at trial \u2014 and then to consider whether there should be a new trial on the basis of an error in instructions that the defendant could have raised but did not. The rule the court proclaims today (but perhaps does not in reality apply) threatens finality and the orderly procedure that the rule of waiver is intended to enforce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reason that claims not timely made at trial are deemed waived is not to make of the trial some kind of arbitrary obstacle course, but to assure that the judge has the opportunity to manage the first and, it is to be hoped, the only trial in a correct and lawful way. Claims not brought to the judge\u2019s attention cannot be ruled on at trial, and the errors they identify cannot be cured. The court\u2019s proposal threatens to undermine the goal of finality by inviting such untimely claims. The stringent-sounding threshold of substantial risk gives uncertain assurance against that danger. The court\u2019s formulation makes the difference between the miscarriage of justice standard and the harmless error standard, which applies to fully preserved claims, one of such imperceptible degree as to provide no discipline at all. A rational system relies not on such uncommunicable and therefore arbitrary distinctions of degree \u2014 distinctions that effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>leave trial judges and the courts that review them at sea on an ocean of discretion \u2014 but on distinctions of kind, distinctions capable of statement, review, and consistency. In the case of the harmless error standard, we ask if we can be quite sure that the outcome of the trial would have been the same had'the error not been committed. In the case of the miscarriage of justice standard, properly understood, we ask whether there is a substantial risk that an innocent person has been convicted. Both standards require an appellate court to second-guess the original trial determination, and neither is mechanical; in these respects they do not differ. But they differ in respect to the questions they ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The formulation of miscarriage of justice the court today promulgates not only threatens the concept of waiver, and with it the finality of error-free trial court proceedings (error-free in the sense that, no objections were improperly denied), it makes no sense when fitted into the rest of our body of criminal jurisprudence. The court\u2019s formulation, in effect, makes G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, review available in every criminal case. Section 33E provides that, in capital cases, the Supreme Judicial Court must review the whole record and consider even matters not raised below. Under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, \u201ca new trial is called for unless we are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ruddock, 428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998). It is quite clear that we consider such unpreserved errors for the effect they may have had on the outcome of the trial and not just in terms of guilt and innocence. If there is a difference between the standard the court sets out today and the \u00a7 33E standard, it is, as I have said, only an ineffable difference of degree, which provides no discipline, assures no regularity, invites arbitrary distinctions, and grants uncertain discretion. With respect to both stalking charges in this case, the judge erred in instructing the jury. Likewise, as to both charges, there was so much evidence against the defendant that a reviewing court need have no doubt that the defendant was guilty. Although the court says that, in affirming these convictions, it is asking what effect the error had on an actual jury, this is an after-the-fact speculation about the effect on a hypothetical jury. It is mere wordplay to suggest that such an inquiry respects the role of an actual jury while the guilt or innocence standard usurps that role. Except for ineffable distinctions of degree, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>reviewing court\u2019s process of judgment is the same \u2014 but the guilt or innocence standard describes that process more candidly. The court\u2019s reference to the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case confirms my view.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">To be sure, the damage is worse if the court\u2019s conception of a miscarriage of justice is applied to new trial motions as well as to direct appeals, because the lapse of time and corresponding prejudice to the Commonwealth are likely to be greater in the case of new trial motions. But in both cases, there must be a retrial to correct an error the defendant\u2019s timely objection might have avoided initially. That is why our cases do not distinguish clearly and consistently between the application of the doctrine of waiver in the two situations. Because the doctrine of waiver is the same in both circumstances, the formulation the court sets out today is at least in tension with the statutory requirement that a court considering a new trial motion in a capital case may consider only new and substantial questions. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Claims that might have been raised previously are waived and may not be considered by the court reviewing the motion. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>428 Mass. 469, 473-474 (1998). The all-purpose definition of miscarriage of justice the court promulgates today recognizes no such force for waiver. Moreover, in deciding whether a question raised in a new trial motion is new, we have been at great pains to ask whether the issue the defendant seeks to raise is really new \u2014 that is, whether it was sufficiently foreshadowed at an earlier stage in the proceedings that it would not have required clairvoyance to anticipate a later definitive ruling. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 238, 241 (1998). Only if it is new in this rather demanding sense will we conclude that it has not been waived. But why would we go through this often painstaking dissection of the course of prior law if the rule of (non) waiver the court promulgates today really were the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The court puts neon lights around how harmful and disruptive the standard it promulgates today really is by referring to its potential application to cases, unlike this one, in which the nonpreserved error related not to a jury instruction but to evidence that might, on proper objection, be inadmissible. Those cases are much more frequent, and the mischief the court does today far more virulent in them. The court states that if evidence was introduced which, had a proper objection been made, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>not have been introduced, the miscarriage of justice standard must be applied as if that evidence were not in the case. Endorsing a recent decision of the Appeals Court, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 114 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 595 (1998), the court appears to suggest that, for instance, where a person convicted almost exclusively on the basis of evidence seized pursuant to a technically defective warrant fails to raise the defect before or during trial, there is a miscarriage of justice and the defendant may have his conviction overturned at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">On the correct view that I have stated, there has been a miscarriage of justice after a trial in which the defendant has had a chance to make his objections, but did not, only if there is a substantial risk that an innocent person has been convicted. That is what I thought we meant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 646-647 (1997), when we said that \u201cthere is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice if the evidence and the case as a whole . . . [leaves] us with a serious doubt that the defendants] guilt had been fairly adjudicated.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is why we said that, \u201cwhen the elements of a crime are incorrectly stated, there is a substantial risk that a person has been convicted for a course of conduct that is not criminal at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647 n.21. (As I have said, in this case and in this instance, there is no such risk.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">This conception of what constitutes a miscarriage of justice \u2014 the conviction of an innocent person \u2014 is just what the ordinary meaning of that ringing term portends. It is not a miscarriage of justice that a person reliably judged to be guilty failed to avail himself of a technicality and so allowed admission of the proof that clinches the case against him. See <em>Eason, supra </em>at 134 (Armstrong, J., dissenting). Few laymen would call that a miscarriage of justice. Indeed, if the term justice includes justice to the interests of society and justice to the victims of crime, the release (for in many cases that is what we would decree) of the convicted person on such a basis would itself be a grave miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">And if common sense is not enough, then I note that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Supreme Court of the United States, where the stakes often are literally life or death, also defines \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in the commonsense way that I urge here: \u201c[T]he miscarriage of justice exception is concerned with actual as compared to legal innocence.\u201d <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 339 (1992). Accordingly, the Court has held \u201cthat the \u2018narrow exception\u2019 for miscarriage of justice was of no avail to the petitioner because the constitutional violation if it occurred, \u2018resulted in the admission at trial of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect the reliability of the guilt determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, quoting <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>499 U.S. 467, 502 (1991). Accord <em>Calderon </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 557-558 (1998) (reaffirming the \u201cactual innocence\u201d understanding of miscarriage of justice); <em>Schlup </em>v. <em>Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 316 (1995) (\u201c[wjithout any new evidence of innocence, even the existence of a concededly meritorious constitutional violation is not in itself sufficient to establish a miscarriage of justice . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The confrontation clause violation in <em>Amirault </em>raised difficult questions as to the application of the standard I believe is the correct one, because the error went to the adjudication of guilt or innocence, and so does the error the court identifies today, although in both <em>Amirault </em>and this case, no doubt as to guilt or innocence rises to the level where we should say the standard has been met. But the broad standard the court announces today comprehends many situations in which no such question of guilt or innocence is even presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In <em>Eason, supra, </em>on which the court relies, the Appeals Court considered the justice of the conviction not in terms of the risk that an innocent person had been convicted \u2014 there was little or no risk of that \u2014 but whether, <em>without the evidence of the intercepted conversations, </em>the outcome would have been the same. The dissenting Justices understood that the Appeals Court was repudiating our decision in <em>Amirault, </em>see <em>Eason, supra </em>at 130 (Jacobs, J., dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 131-135 (Armstrong, J., dissenting). Today we side with the Appeals Court against ourselves. I will grant that, up until <em>Amirault, </em>the law in this regard, far from being settled, had been a nest of confusion. That is why we were at such pains to clarify it in that decision. The court today reinstates that confusion and moves in a wholly incorrect direction. The court states that it would not be appropriate to consider erroneously admitted testimony in deciding whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of justice. In <em>Amirault, </em>we set out and adopted language from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10 (1986), that contradicts today\u2019s proposal. <em>Miranda </em>states that a claim of substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice \u201cwould generally not be available to a defendant prejudiced by the unobjected-to admission of highly incriminating evidence obtained in violation of Fourth Amendment protections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21 n.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The distinction between the commonsense view of miscarriage of justice and the one the court promulgates today is of particular importance in cases involving art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rarely, if ever, does a Fourth Amendment violation create the risk that an innocent person has been convicted. It is commonplace that the exclusion of evidence in these cases was instituted in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 (1961), to deter police violations of privacy rights and for no other purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is a purpose quite avowedly extrinsic to the reliable determination of guilt or innocence, and, therefore, a defendant\u2019s failure to press it at trial does not in any way subtract from the reliability of a guilty verdict. On the contrary, in many instances it will confirm it. That is why the Supreme Court in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465 (1976), reached the more drastic conclusion that Federal postconviction relief is never to be available for Fourth Amendment violations, even in cases where the issue had been fully preserved but simply ruled on erroneously in the State courts. See Amsterdam, Search, Seizure, and Section 2255: A Comment, 112 U. Penn. L. Rev. 378 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Finally, I should say a word about ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which are the usual second string to the bow of a defendant seeking to resurrect an unpreserved claim. That standard has two prongs: First, \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, [second] if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Both conditions must be met. If we focus only on the second prong and ignore the first, then there is a substantial risk that we shall end up once again erasing entirely the bulwark against the resurrection of unpreserved errors that was erected in <em>Amirault </em>and that the court seeks to dismantle by its unfortunate ruling about the meaning of a miscarriage of justice. It is only if we take seriously as well the first prong of the standard that this disorderly result can be avoided. \u201cOrdinary fallible lawyers\u201d make mistakes (that is what makes them fallible), and those mistakes will include failures to preserve claims that affect the outcome of a trial. But that must not be enough to justify a new trial. If it is, there is simply nothing left to the doctrines of waiver and finality, for every waived claim would automatically raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Justice Fried participated in the deliberation on this case and authored a concurring opinion, but resigned before the opinions were issued.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The classic statements are Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant?

It is important to note that there is no. such stringent doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
