L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that it is, and that an interlocutory order to that effect entered by a judge in the Superior Court is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">On August 4, 1998, Mayor Thomas M. Menino signed an executive order extending group health insurance benefits to registered domestic partners<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of city employees and their dependents. The executive order went into effect on November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>1, 1998. On November 10, 1998, the plaintiffs, Boston residents, commenced this action pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53, challenging the validity of the executive order. They alleged, in broad terms, and without reference to any particular statute or constitutional provision, that the executive order is inconsistent with the authority granted to the city by the Legislature to provide health insurance to city employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin tire implementation of the executive order, on which a hearing was held on December 2, 1998. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD), Kay Schmidt, a city employee, and Diane Pullen, Schmidt\u2019s registered domestic partner, filed a motion to intervene as defendants. On December 11, 1998, the judge allowed GLAD, Schmidt, and Pullen to intervene,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but limited GLAD\u2019s participation to the representation of Schmidt and Pullen\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">On December 11, 1998, the judge ruled that the executive order is inconsistent with provisions of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 2 <em>(b) </em>and 15 <em>(b),</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and granted the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>injunction. Concluding that \u201cthe issue raised in this case presents a current and important question of law not previously decided by a Massachusetts appellate court,\u201d the judge, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), reported the following question to the Appeals Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201can employee\u2019s spouse, an employee\u2019s unmarried children under nineteen years of age, and any child nineteen years of age or over who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his own living . . . Said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>definition shall also include an unmarried child nineteen years of age or over who is a full-time student in an educational or vocational institution and whose program of education has not been substantially interrupted by full-time gainful employment excluding service in the armed forces.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">Section 15 <em>(b) </em>provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">\u201cNo governmental unit may appropriate or expend public funds for the payment of premiums for [the various insurance plans, including health insurance,] for its active or retired employees, or their dependents, unless such insurance is procured pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or unless such payments are authorized by section five of chapter forty, or unless such payments are made, pursuant to an agreement of an employer and an employee organization, to a health and welfare trust fund agreement. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201cWhether the Executive Order signed by Mayor Thomas M. Menino on August 4, 1998, extending health benefits coverage to domestic partners of Boston city employees, and their dependents, is inconsistent with G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 2(b) and 15(b), and, therefore, in violation of \u00a7 6 of the Home Amendment Rule and G. L. c. 43B, .\u00a7 13.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The judge stayed his order granting the preliminary injunction until his report was docketed in the Appeals Court. A single justice of the Appeals Court continued the stay pending appeal because \u201cthe question reported . . . presents a meritorious issue on appeal\u201d and \u201cthe equities weigh heavily in favor of a stay pending appeal.\u201d We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">We consider whether the judge was correct to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the executive order is inconsistent with certain provisions of G. L. c. 32B. Article 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, the Home Rule Amendment, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201cAny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court in conformity with powers reserved to the general court by section eight, and which is not denied, either expressly or by clear implication, to the city or town by its charter. This section shall apply to every city and town, whether or not it has adopted a charter pursuant to section three.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Home Rule Procedures Act, G. L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13, contains virtually, identical language. Thus, under the home rule provisions, the city may undertake any action that is not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with State laws or the Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Massachusetts has the \u201cstrongest type of home rule,\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 143 n.4 (1973), citing 1965 Senate Doc. No. 950 at 65-66, and municipal action is presumed to be valid. <em>Take Five Vending, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>415 Mass. 741, 744 (1993). Cf. <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985). The analysis whether local action is inconsistent with a State statute is analogous to the analysis whether Federal law preempts State action, <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 151; the touchstone of the analysis is whether the State Legislature intended to preempt the city\u2019s authority to act. <em>Id. </em>at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Recently, in <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>420 Mass. 702, 704 (1995), we summarized the appropriate analysis for resolving this question: We look \u201cto see whether there was either an express legislative intent to forbid local activity on the same subject or whether the local regulation would somehow frustrate the purpose of the statute so as to warrant an inference that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Legislature intended to preempt the subject. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, [supra </em>at] 155-156. Moreover, in some circumstances we can infer that the Legislature intended to preempt the field because legislation on the subject is so comprehensive that any local enactment would frustrate the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., [supra </em>at 527-528].\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra. </em>We have also indicated that the invalidation of a local regulation requires a \u201csharp conflict\u201d between it and the State legislation, which \u201cappears when either the legislative intent to preclude local action is clear, or, absent plain expression of such intent, the purpose of the statute cannot be achieved in the face of the local by-law.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>383 Mass. 693, 701 (1981), quoting <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 54 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The crux of this dispute is accordingly the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the provisions of G. L. c. 32B. The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 15 <em>(b), </em>the substance of which was first enacted in 1967, was intended to preclude a city from providing group health insurance benefits to persons other than those specifically designated by definition in \u00a7 2 <em>(b): </em>city employees and their dependents, defined as spouses, children under nineteen years of age, and children over nineteen years who are unable to provide for themselves. The defendants and amici respond that the Legislature did not intend to address domestic \u00a1partners at all within the ambit of G. L. c. 32B, and that a governmental unit is free to appropriate and expend public funds to pay for group health insurance premiums for them. They do not suggest that \u00a7 2 (b)\u2019s provision for \u201cspouses\u201d includes domestic partners,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or that domestic partners are otherwise \u201cdependents.\u201d Rather, they argue, the statute simply does not pertain at all to the extension of group health insurance benefits to domestic partners.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We look first to see whether there was an \u201cexpress legislative intent to forbid local activity on the same subject.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>425 Mass. 697, 699 (1997), citing <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra </em>at 703. Our examination of G. L. c. 32B, as well as the relevant legislative history, leads us to conclude that the Legislature clearly evinced its intent that G. L. c. 32B provide the exclusive manner in which the city may appropriate and expend funds for group health insurance for its employees (those individuals \u201cin the service\u201d of the city, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 2 M), and all persons whose claim to group benefits (paid for by the city) arises because of their relationship with a city employee, i.e., \u201cdependents.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Legislature has defined precisely those who may be included in the category of \u201cdependents.\u201d Cities and other governmental units are not free to expand the category.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">General Laws c. 32B is \u201ca comprehensive statute empowering municipalities to provide group insurance (medical and certain other coverages) to their employees and their employees\u2019 dependents.\u201d <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, 316 </em>Mass. 706, 710 (1978). See <em>Kusy </em>v. <em>Millbury, </em>417 Mass. 765, 768 (1994), citing <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>404 Mass. 365, 367 (1989). General Laws c. 32B is a \u201clocal option\u201d statute: it does not take effect until a governmental unit accepts it. See <em>Kusy </em>v. <em>Millbury, supra </em>at 768 n.4. Once accepted, however, it provides the exclusive mechanisms by which and to whom the city-may provide group health insurance. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 15 <em>(b); Wa-tertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, supra </em>at 712. Section 15 <em>(b) </em>provides explicitly that the city may not \u201cappropriate or expend public funds\u201d for the payment of group health insurance premiums for its active or retired employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>or their dependents, \u201cunless such insurance is procured pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The defendants argue that the limitation imposed by \u00a7 15 <em>(b) </em>applies only to those defined in the statute \u2014 employees and their spouses, children under nineteen years and certain children over nineteen years \u2014 leaving the city <em>free </em>to expend public funds to pay for group health insurance for other persons not mentioned in the statute. They view the requirements of G. L. c. 32B as a \u201cfloor,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cceiling.\u201d But the insurance plan at issue provides health coverage for named insureds (employees) and those who, because they are \u201cdependent\u201d on them, have an insurable interest through them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Domestic partners and their dependents fall outside the statutory definition of those who may claim an insurable interest through the employee, and are therefore precluded from obtaining coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The defendants\u2019 construction of \u00a7 15 is further belied by its legislative history. The Third Report of the Special Commission on Implementation of the Municipal Home Rule Amendment to the State Constitution (Home Rule Report), filed with the legislation introducing \u00a7 15, 1967 Senate Doc. 1174, begins by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\u201cIn the interest of further containing the cost of insurance programs, municipalities may not provide a level of benefits greater than that afforded by their county and the county may not exceed the State\u2019s level of benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>361 Mass. 24, 31 (1972) (\u201cpurpose and policy\u201d of \u00a7 15 [6] is to contain cost of insurance programs so that \u201cmunicipalities may not provide a level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of benefits greater than that afforded by their county and the county may not exceed the State\u2019s level of benefits\u201d). We read the term \u201clevel of benefits\u201d to include the definition of household members eligible for group health coverage through the employee. Health insurance benefits are an important component of an employee\u2019s compensation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Eng\u2019rs &amp; Scientists, </em>423 Mass. 667, 670 (1996). Whether a group health insurance plan covers a particular category of household members as \u201cdependents\u201d may be, and often is, as important to an employee as the risks that are covered.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Home Rule Report goes on to state that the legislation was \u201cdesigned to clarify\u201d that \u201cChapter 32B remains in effect as a <em>uniform </em>state-wide system for the purchase of group life and health insurance\u201d and that \u201clocal governments not presently providing these benefits for their employees may only be allowed to do so in the future by acceptance of Chapter 32B\u201d (emphasis added). 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1174 at 2. The report also states that the \u201cpurpose of this Chapter is to provide local governments with a volume of purchasing power sufficient to assure that their employees will receive the highest possible level of benefits at the lowest possible net cost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. To this end, says the report, the statute \u201cprovides for the <em>exclusive, purchase </em>of group term insurance, the style of insurance affording this feature\u201d (emphasis added). The report recognizes that municipalities are not required to provide life and health insurance for their employees, but, \u201cif they desire to do so the intention is it be done only under the provisions of this Chapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To that end, St. 1967, c. 373, which inserted \u00a7 15 in G. L. c. 32B, is entitled \u201cAn Act providing that political subdivisions of the commonwealth shall not establish any system of group insurance for their employees except that provided by general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Where the Legislature has used such explicit language prohibiting the city from providing group health insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>except as prescribed by the statute, and where the legislative history makes clear that it intended to do so, we conclude that there was an \u201cexpress legislative intent to forbid local activity on the same subject,\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>425 Mass. 697, 699 (1997), quoting <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>420 Mass. 702, 704 (1995), rendering the ordinance in \u201csharp conflict\u201d with State legislation. <em>School Comm, of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The city nevertheless urges us to conclude that the Boston ordinance is not inconsistent with State law because the purpose of G. L. c. 32B can be well served in the face of the ordinance, and that State and local law can \u201ccoexist.\u201d It argues that, by extending health care insurance benefits to a greater number of household members, the city will increase the volume of its purchasing power and assure that its employees \u201cwill receive the highest possible level of benefits at the lowest possible cost.\u201d See 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1174 at 4. This is, indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>among the purposes of the statute. Equally important to the Legislature, however, was its objective that the plans of group life and health insurance adopted by each governmental unit be uniform. An overriding concern was to effectuate cost containment by preventing one governmental unit from providing different (and potentially more costly) levels of benefits than another. See Home Rule Third Report, 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1174. <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The legislation accordingly provides that municipalities must achieve cost containment by adhering exclusively to the provisions of G. L. c. 32B, including \u00a7 2 <em>(b)\u2019s </em>limitation on covered dependents.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Uniformity of coverage (persons and risks) was one mechanism selected by the Legislature to control escalating cost disparities among governmental units. That purpose would not be served if each could expand the definition of covered dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">When the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 32B in 1955, St. 1955, c. 760, it defined the term \u201c [dependents\u201d in a manner consistent with the then-prevalent view of persons for whom the benefi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>clary (the employee) likely had an obligation to provide support, and who reasonably could be viewed as relying on the beneficiary for support. See, e.g., Report of the Special Commission on Insurance, 1954 Senate Doc. No. 640 at 13 (term \u201cdependents\u201d and \u201cwives and children\u201d used interchangeably). The Legislature\u2019s definition of dependent in this context has changed but once, in 1960, to include certain children over the age of nineteen years. St. 1960, c. 214, \u00a7 1. We recognize that the category of covered dependents of city employees, as defined by the Legislature in 1955 and 1960, no longer fully reflects all household members for whom city employees are likely to have continuing obligations to provide support. A \u201cfamily\u201d may no longer be constituted simply of a wage-earning father, his dependent wife, and the couple\u2019s children.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We also recognize that the categories of household members who may rely on a wage earner for support have broadened over time. An increasing number of parents, for example, rely on their children for support, see generally Neal, Chapman, Ingersoll-Dayton, &amp; Emlen, Balancing Work and Caregiving for Children, Adults, and Elders 144 (1993); Geriatric Cases: The Aging of America Is Making \u2018Elder Care\u2019 A Big Workplace Issue, Wall St. J., Feb. 16, 1994, at Al, while many more grandchildren five with and rely on their grandparents. More Grandparents Return to Parenting, Boston Sunday Globe, Sept. 13, 1998, at 17.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Adjustments in the legislation to reflect these new social and economic reafi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ties must come from the Legislature, whether it does so by expanding the statutory definition of \u201cdependent\u201d or by authorizing governmental units to define for themselves the term \u201cdependent.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Our decision is mandated only because, in the context of group health insurance provided by governmental units for their employees, the Legislature has defined precisely the scope of the term dependent to exclude all but spouses, unmarried children under nineteen years of age, and older children in limited circumstances. G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>Had the mayor sought to extend group health insurance benefits to other categories of household member beyond those defined by the Legislature, our conclusion would be the same. We recognize that some household members of some of Boston\u2019s employees may be without a critical social necessity, health insurance. That is a reality that must be addressed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The mayor\u2019s executive order extending health insurance benefits to Boston employees\u2019 domestic partners and their dependents is inconsistent with G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 2 <em>(b) </em>and 15 <em>(b), </em>thereby violating the Home Rule Amendment, art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, and the Home Rule Procedures Act, G.

In <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 29, we held that weekly accident and sickness benefits did not come within the phrase \u201c \u2018hospital, surgical, medical, dental, and other health insurance\u2019 as used in c. 32B,\u201d and that contributions thereto were not prohibited by \u00a7 15. The defendants argue that, analogously, domestic partners and their dependents are not included within the statutory definition of dependents and that therefore \u00a7 15 does not prohibit providing them with health insurance benefits. Here, however, the type of benefits the city seeks to provide \u2014 group health insurance benefits \u2014 triggers the operation of the statute. Once the city seeks to provide those benefits, it must do so according to the provisions of G. L. c. 32B. Should the city choose to provide some other benefit not specified in G. L. c. 32B, as was the case in <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, supra, </em>the provisions of G. L. c. 32B would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">In <em>Kusy </em>v. <em>Millbury, supra </em>at <em>161, </em>770, we upheld a local bylaw authorizing the town to pay for nongroup health insurance coverage for any employee or retiree not eligible for a health maintenance organization. The bylaw became necessary when it became impossible for the town to continue providing group insurance to a retiree because he had moved out of the group coverage area. We noted in that case that the bylaw did not violate \u00a7 15 \u201cbecause the by-law does not concern <em>group </em>insurance\u201d (emphasis in original).' <em>Id. </em>at 770 n.8. For the same reason that we indicated in <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, supra, </em>the statute was not triggered. We express no view on whether the mayor could authorize the city to pay for nongroup health insurance benefits for registered domestic partners of city employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Thirty years later, cities and towns remain concerned about the escalating costs of providing group health insurance to their employees. See, e.g., <em>Ludlow Educ. Ass'n </em>v. <em>Ludlow, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 113 (1991). Expanding group health coverage to include a wide category of household dependents (parents, adult children, or domestic- partners) may increase the total cost of coverage to an employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">GLAD argues that any original goal of uniformity has been eroded by subsequent amendments to \u00a7 15. Section 15, as originally enacted, provided that no appropriations for premiums could be made \u201cunless such insurance is procured pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d St. 1967, c. 373, \u00a7 2. In 1988, the Legislature rewrote \u00a7 15 to add \u201cor unless such payments are made, pursuant to an agreement of an employer and an employee organization, to a health and welfare trust fund agreement for the purposes of (i) providing health benefits not otherwise provided to such employees by said governmental unit under the provisions of this chapter or (ii) paying contributions by said governmental unit toward premium costs or rates in excess of the level of such premium cost or rate contributions otherwise provided for under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d St. 1988, c. 82. In 1993, the Legislature added to the preceding sentence \u201cor (iii) providing health benefits required under the provision of this chapter.\u201d St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 102. In 1996, the Legislature also provided that appropriations for health benefits could be made where \u201cauthorized by section five of chapter forty.\" St. 1996, c. 288, \u00a7 1. The Legislature\u2019s allowance for appropriations pursuant to mechanisms other than the provisions of G. L. c. 32B does not change the fact that these appropriations still must remain consistent with G. L. c. 32B. Such appropriations are consistent because they are authorized by \u00a7 15 (b). Any \u201cexceptions,\u201d i.e., any change regarding the provision of insurance to employees of governmental units, must be made by the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b68-5\"> According to the United States Bureau of the Census, the number of \u201cunmarried-couple households\u201d (opposite sex couples only) nationwide has grown from 439,000 in 1960 to 4,236,000 in 1998.
