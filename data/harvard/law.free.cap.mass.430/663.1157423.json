The Appellate Division held that National Lumber Company (National Lumber) had perfected and could enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien on the Schwartzes\u2019 property in accordance with G. L. c. 254, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute. We granted the Schwartzes\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The material facts are not in dispute. In January, 1995, Le-Francois Construction Company (LeFrancois) purchased a lot in Northborough (property) with the intention of developing it for resale as a residential property. On September 21, 1995, National Lumber and LeFrancois entered into a contract for National Lumber to supply lumber and materials to LeFrancois for the construction of a house on the property. On October 25, 1995, National Lumber recorded a notice of the contract in the registry of deeds for Worcester County (registry), identifying LeFrancois as the owner of the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4. The recorded notice specified that the contract was to be completed on or before December 1, 1995. Pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8, National Lumber had thirty days (until December 31, 1995) within which to file any statement of account without which its hen would dissolve.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 18, 1995, it met the statutory deadline by recording in the registry a sworn statement of claim that $26,103.98 had not been paid for labor and materials supplied by it to LeFrancois under the contract. It once again identified LeFrancois as the owner of the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Four days earlier, on December 14, 1995, LeFrancois had conveyed the property to the Schwartzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">On February 5, 1996, National Lumber commenced this action \u201cin accordance with G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5,\u201d to enforce its hen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It named LeFrancois, as corporation and as trustee, as the defendant. It did not name the Schwartzes. On February 12, 1996, National Lumber recorded an attested copy of the complaint in the registry. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 5, 1996, six months after the complaint had been filed, service was made on LeFrancois. On August 28, 1996, before any responsive pleading had been filed, National Lumber filed an amended complaint, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), adding the Schwartzes as defendants, seeking to enforce its mechanic\u2019s hen against both LeFrancois and the Schwartzes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Schwartzes were served on September 9, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On December 3, 1996, after answering the amended complaint, the Schwartzes filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting that, by operation of law, National Lumber\u2019s mechanic\u2019s hen had dissolved before they were added as parties. On March 2, 1997, a judge in the District Court denied their motion. On August 4, 1997, National Lumber and the Schwartzes filed an agreement for judgment in the District Court. The Schwartzes did so \u201csolely\u201d to permit the legal issues raised in their motion for judgment on the pleadings to be reviewed by an appellate court. Judgment entered on August 15, 1997. The Schwartzes then took an appeal in the Appellate Division, which affirmed the motion judge\u2019s ruling. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">At issue in this case is the reliability of the recording system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for providing notice of a mechanic\u2019s lien secured under G. L. c. 254 with respect to a particular piece of land. Specifically, we must decide whether the statute requires that an owner who acquires title after the recording of the notice of contract be named as a defendant in an action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien within the statutory period required by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We hold that G. L. c. 254, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, has no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">A mechanic\u2019s lien must be perfected and can be enforced only as provided by statute. See <em>East Coast Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ciolfi, </em>417 Mass. 602, 605 (1994) (lien is \u201csolely a statutory creation\u201d enforceable only \u201cby strict compliance with the statutory specifications\u201d). See also <em>Blount Bros. </em>v. <em>Lafayette Place Assocs., </em>399 Mass. 632 (1987) (invalidating mechanic\u2019s lien in which completion date in filed notice of contract was different from completion date in contract); <em>Baltimore Contrs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>352 Mass. 83, 86 (1967) (notice of contract stating \u201ccontract not yet completed due to Owner changes\u201d insufficient to establish statutory lien).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The statutory section at issue, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, requires that \u201ca civil action to enforce [a mechanic\u2019s lien be] commenced within sixty days of the filing of the statement [of account].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Schwartzes contend that the mechanic\u2019s lien statute contemplates that an enforcement action must be commenced against the then-current owner of the property subject to the lien, and that unless \u201ccommenced within sixty days\u201d against that owner the lien dissolves. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11. In effect they argue that the burden is on the lienholder to ascertain the identity of the record owner of the property at the time it commences an enforcement action under \u00a7 11. Because National Lumber failed to name the Schwartzes as defendants within sixty days after National Lumber filed its statement of account on December 18, 1995, they contend, the lien against their property dissolved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> National Lumber responds that, because it commenced an action within the sixty-day period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>against LeFrancois, the party named in the notice of contract and in the statement of account, and later amended its complaint to add the Schwartzes in a timely manner under the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, it complied fully with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">General Laws c. 254 does not specify whether, in order to preserve a hen, a lienholder must name the owner of record as a defendant when it files a complaint to enforce its lien. Section 23 of the statute describes the circumstances in which a subsequent owner of the property may be sued. At the relevant time, \u00a7 23 provided in part: \u201cIf the person for whom the labor has been performed or furnished or the material has been furnished . . . conveys away his estate or interest before the commencement of a civil action to enforce a lien, it <em>may </em>be commenced and prosecuted against. . . the persons holding the estate or interest which he had in the land at the time when the labor or material was performed or furnished\u201d (emphasis added). By its express terms, therefore, \u00a7 23 permits, but does not require, a lienholder to enforce a lien against any new owner of the property, if the property was conveyed prior to the commencement of an action pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">National Lumber argues that it would be inconsistent with the wording of the statute to require that a lienholder \u201cmust\u201d name the record owner as a defendant at the time the \u00a7 11 action is commenced. The Schwartzes respond that the language is framed in permissive terms because the precursor to \u00a7 23, first enacted in 1836 (\u00a7 27 of R.S. [1836], c. 117), was designed to address an uncertainty in the mechanic\u2019s lien statute adopted in 1819, namely whether a lienholder <em>could </em>bring an enforcement action against the original owner\u2019s successor in interest in any circumstances. The 1836 amendment to the original 1819 statute corrected that uncertainty, making clear that a change in title was no bar to enforcement of the lien against the new owner\u2019s interest in the property. Because the statute is not explicit as to any time limitation on when a successor in title must be joined \u2014 the statute is simply silent on the question \u2014 we consider that section in the context of the over-all objective the Legislature sought to accomplish. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 851 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>A primary purpose of G. L. c. 254 is \u201cto provide security to contractors, subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers for the value of their services and goods provided for improving the owner\u2019s real estate.\u201d <em>Hammill-McCormick Assocs. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>399 Mass. 541, 542-543 (1987). Because a perfected lien is an encumbrance on the property, the statute is also designed to ensure that a person searching the land records in a registry of deeds can determine with certainty whether or not title to a particular parcel of land is encumbered by a mechanic\u2019s lien. See <em>Pratt &amp; Forrest Co. </em>v. <em>Strand Realty Co., </em>233 Mass. 314, 317-318 (1919) (\u201cOne plain object of the present statute was to require the placing upon record in the registry of deeds of certain information, for the benefit of prospective purchasers of land and other interested persons, touching the incumbrances [jfc] created or likely to be created by liens .... Accuracy in this respect may be thought to be essential for the protection of laborers and subcontractors as well as others who may have occasion to depend upon the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">General Laws c. 254 sets out in careful detail the steps required to create, maintain, and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien on real estate, from the recording of a notice of contract in the registry of deeds, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2 (\u201cgeneral contractor\u201d); G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (\u201csub-contractor\u201d), to the commencement of a civil action to enforce the lien, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and recording an attested copy of the complaint in the registry of deeds. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">A new owner of the property, whose deed is recorded after the recording of the notice of contract, takes the property subject to the mechanic\u2019s lien. Cf. <em>Mister Donut of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>368 Mass. 220, 224 (1975). The encumbrance survives a change in ownership of the property even if all of the statutory steps required to perfect a lien have not been completed because the time for doing so has not expired.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750 (1989) (statute establishes latest time at which lien could be enforced and does not preclude earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>enforcement). If the lienholder complies with all of the statutory requirements, the lien prevails against all who hold title to the encumbered property after the notice of contract is recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">National Lumber recorded its notice of contract with LeFran-cois, specifying a completion date of December 1, 1995. Pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8, National Lumber had until December 31, 1995, to file its statement of account. On December 14, 1995, the Schwartzes took title to the property. They therefore had constructive notice of the lien on their property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Schwartzes would nevertheless require that a lienholder conduct title searches throughout the duration of the lien-maintaining procedures,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> imposing on a lienholder the burden of identifying any new owner prior to commencement of the enforcement action, or risk dissolution of the lien. We cannot conclude that, when the Legislature first amended the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to make possible an enforcement action against an owner who acquired title after the filing of the notice of contract, see \u00a7 27 of R.S. (1836), c. 117, it also intended either to shift to a lien claimant the burden of constantly updating a title search or risk a guillotine-like dissolution of its hen. No subsequent amendment to what is now \u00a7 23 evidences any such intention either.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We have already noted that one important purpose of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute was to provide an accurate system for recording and identifying encumbrances secured under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute. Naming the then-current owner of record at the time an enforcement action is commenced is not necessary to achieve this purpose. The statute provides an efficient mechanism of ensuring that an enforcement action may readily be identified through routine title searching procedures. The hen statute mandates that an attested copy of any complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>brought under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, be recorded, as was done here. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5. The statutory deadline for National Lumber to file its complaint in court was February 16, 1996. National Lumber in fact filed its complaint on February 5, 1996, and recorded it in the registry on February 12, 1996. A title search by any prospective purchaser conducted at any time after February 16, 1996, to determine whether National Lumber had sought to enforce its lien readily could have accomplished that objective, even though the Schwartzes were not named in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The statutory scheme also suggests that the record owner at the time the notice of contract is recorded may be a proper party in a subsequent enforcement action. The statute requires that the name of the property owner in the statement of account be the same as the name of the owner in the notice of contract, even if the property has been conveyed in the interim. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8. The reason is clear: \u201cThe statute . . . regard[s] it as important that the name of the [original] owner should be given in the [statement of account] . . . because, otherwise, subsequent purchasers who buy upon the faith of the registry title are hable to be misled.\u201d <em>William S. Howe Co. </em>v. <em>Theyson, </em>263 Mass. 27, 29 (1928), quoting <em>McPhee </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>145 Mass. 565, 566 (1888). If the name of the owner as it appears on the notice of contract (LeFrancois) is included in the enforcement action, whether or not a subsequent owner is included, subsequent purchasers, such as the Schwartzes, who rely on the registry title will not be misled.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We recognize that an action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien challenges the title of the record owner of the property. Although we are not required to resolve the issue here, the record owner at the time the hen is enforced, such as the Schwartzes, may qualify as a \u201cnecessary party\u201d under Mass. R. Civ. R 19 (a), 365 Mass. 765 (1974). The timing of the naming of the record owner as a party appropriately would be governed by the rule of civil procedure; it is not mandated in G. L. c. 254.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We deal briefly with National Lumber\u2019s argument that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>amended complaint naming the Schwartzes as parties relates back to the commencement date of the complaint. See Mass. R. Civ. R 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). The Schwartzes claim that the relation back provision of rule 15 (c) does not apply to G. L. c. 254 because \u00a7 11 is a statute of repose, which bars any future action once the statutory deadline has passed. Because we conclude that G. L. c. 254 did not impose on National Lumber the obligation to add the Schwartzes within the statutory period mandated by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, it follows that \u00a7 11 is not a statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Schwartzes point to jurisprudence in several other States to support their position that, even if not a statute of repose, National Lumber\u2019s complaint adding them as parties must be dismissed. See, e.g., <em>Mendenhall </em>v. <em>Douglas L. Cooper, Inc., </em>239 Va. 71, 75 (1990) (suit, time barred as to necessary party, must be dismissed because necessary party is not subject to trial court\u2019s jurisdiction). Massachusetts practice is more liberal than other jurisdictions in allowing amendments adding or substituting defendants after expiration of a period of limitations. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 426 (Lexis 1999), citing <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>352 Mass. 86, 88 (1967) (\u201cIn general, the law in this Commonwealth with respect to amendments is more liberal than elsewhere, and cases from other jurisdictions are not in point\u201d). In Massachusetts, \u201cwhere an action has been commenced before the statute of limitations has run, a plaintiff may be allowed to substitute one defendant for another after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>statute of limitations has run against the proposed substitute defendant.\u201d <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., supra </em>at 88-89. The out-of-State cases on which the Schwartzes rely do not persuade us that National Lumber cannot maintain this action because it named them as defendants after the \u00a7 11 statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">LeFrancois owned the property as trustee for Mark Peter Realty Trust. Le-Francois, acting in its own capacity and not as trustee, contracted with National Lumber for the labor and materials. The notice of contract was filed by National Lumber under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (contracts between subcontractor and contractor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Because the thirty-day statutory limit, December 31, 1995, fell on Sunday of a holiday weekend, National Lumber in fact had until January 2, 1996, to file its statement of account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-11\">In 1996, the Legislature revised G. L. c. 254. See St. 1996, c. 364. The present case arose under and is governed by the provisions of c. 254 in effect before 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Prior to 1996, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, provided no specific time limit within which to record the complaint. The statute now requires that a copy of the complaint be filed within thirty days of commencement of the action. St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b691-13\">The amended complaint also alleged claims against LeFrancois for breach of contract and on account annexed. Those two counts are not at issue: Le-Francois never appeared in this action and on May 19, 1997, National Lumber voluntarily dismissed it. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 41 (a) (1) (i), 365 Mass. 803 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">At the time, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, required that an action he commenced within sixty days of the recording of the statement of account. Amended in 1996, the statute now requires that the action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien be commenced within ninety days after the statement of account is recorded. St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\">See note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The Schwartzes also claim that National Lumber failed to serve LeFrancois within the time provided by Mass.

Any later attempt to \u201camend\u201d the complaint was therefore barred, they conclude. The Schwartzes did not raise below the issue of untimely service on LeFrancois, and we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">See note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AeVZ\">See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">If perfected, the priority of a mechanic\u2019s lien is determined as of the date of the recording of the notice of contract.

L. c. 254, \u00a7 13 (\u201crights of an attaching creditor shall not prevail as against a lien . . . where notice or notices of contract have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>filed or recorded in the registry of deeds . . . prior to the recording of the attachment\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The Schwartzes concede that \u201ca reasonably diligent title examiner\u201d would have identified the notice of contract and would have informed them of the encumbrance on the property. They complain that they did not learn of the enforcement action until more than six months after it was filed. But the issue, surely, is whether prospective purchasers, such as the Schwartzes, have notice of a valid encumbrance <em>prior </em>to purchase, for enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien such as National Lumber\u2019s divests the title of the fee owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">As a matter of logic, this would also apply to the filing of a statement of account under \u00a7 8. Although \u00a7 8, unlike \u00a7 11, explicitly requires that the name of the owner on the notice of contract be the same as the name of the owner on the statement of account, were we to accept the Schwartzes\u2019 argument, the new owner should also be included on the statement of account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">It is \u201csolidly established\u201d for a title examiner to run the grantor (LeFrancois) index forward for at least three years. See J.A. Stein, Mechanics of Title Examination in Massachusetts, Appendix A, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms, \u00a7 A7, at 850-851 (8th ed. 1995 &amp; Supp. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">From 1915 to 1973, an action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien was commenced by filing a bill of equity in Superior Court. A principle of equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>requires that any person who may be affected by determination be made a party to a proceeding prior to final judgment. See <em>Bayer &amp; Mingolla Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>318 Mass. 311, 312 (1945) (court of equity will not proceed to final determination unless all necessary parties are brought in and have their day in court so that rights of all can be adjudicated). Under equity practice, therefore, an action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien could not proceed to judgment without the participation of the then-current record owner. In 1973 the mechanic\u2019s lien statute was amended to no longer require an action in equity. St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 318. The same year marked the adoption of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, which included the procedure for the joinder of necessary persons. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 19, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 256 (Lexis 1999) (\u201cRules 19[a] and 19[b] are quite similar to prior equity practice. . . . Under that practice a court could of its own motion order a cause to stand over in order that an indispensable party might be joined\u201d). Rule 19 may provide the necessary protection to a current owner that a mechanic\u2019s lien will not proceed without the participation of the current record owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
