Aggravated rape was the underlying offense for felony-murder. On appeal he argues that the judge should have excluded testimony of the victim\u2019s roommate relating to a telephone conversation she had with the victim close to the time of the murder. He also challenges statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument. We affirm the convictions. We conclude that there is no basis for granting the defendant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>1. We recite the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with the issues raised. The victim was killed in the early hours of Saturday, September 23, 1995. She spent the preceding evening with one of her roommates, Susan O\u2019Regan, and a group of approximately thirty friends. The victim and O\u2019Regan left their apartment at approximately 6:30 p.m. on September 22, dined with some friends, and then joined other friends as the group took a trolley tour around Boston to celebrate an upcoming wedding. At approximately 1 a.m., both the victim and O\u2019Regan disembarked from the trolley near their apartment in the Allston section of Boston. The friends remaining on the trolley attempted to convince them to return with them to the South Boston section of Boston. O\u2019Regan agreed and reboarded the trolley, but the victim decided to return to their apartment. The victim began the walk home at approximately 1 a.m. She never arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">At approximately 9 a.m. on September 23, 1995, Officer John McGee of the Boston police department went to the West End House, a boys and girls club in Allston, adjacent to the victim\u2019s apartment. When he arrived, he was shown the body of the victim, located outside the West End House. The victim\u2019s body had sustained slash wounds on the neck and stab wounds to the chest, and there was blood coming from her head. Later that evening, Sergeant Detective Thomas J. O\u2019Leary of the Boston police homicide unit met with the victim\u2019s roommates. At that meeting Shirley Harman told the detective about a telephone call she had received from the victim shortly after 1 a.m. on September 23. Based on that information, the police conducted a search and identified the defendant as a suspect. He was questioned several times by the police. Initially, he offered several alibis to the police claiming that he had spent the preceding night with his former girl friend, and denied meeting the victim. Later when his former girl friend recanted and when the police sought samples of his body fluids and hair, the defendant admitted to a sexual encounter with the victim on the night of the murder. The Commonwealth presented substantial evidence linking the defendant to the crimes. Other compelling evidence established that the defendant\u2019s sexual encounter with the victim could not have occurred as he described.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">2. The judge admitted, over defense objection, Harman\u2019s detailed description of a conversation she had with the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>before the murder. She told the jury that she went to sleep around 12:30 a.m. on September 23 and was awakened by a telephone call from the victim at approximately 1:15 a.m. The victim told Harman that she had had a good evening and that she was next door at the West End House with someone named \u201cTony.\u201d The victim invited Harman to join them for a drink, Harman declined, and the victim said she would come home in a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Later in the trial, Sergeant O\u2019Leary testified about the meeting he had with Harman: he acknowledged that he took steps to find someone named Tony after learning from Harman about her conversation with the victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial the defendant objected to this testimony as well. On appeal he challenges only the admission of Harman\u2019s testimony, and does not challenge O\u2019Leary\u2019s testimony. He argues that Harman\u2019s testimony is inadmissible hearsay and its admission violated his rights under the confrontation clauses of both the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consider first whether it was error for the judge to permit Har-man to testify about her conversation with the victim and, if so, whether the error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 297 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u201cThe confrontation right is designed to make prosecution witnesses available for full cross-examination by the defendant and to ensure that the testimony of a witness is given under oath before the jury who will have an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness as he testifies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 29 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Canon, </em>373 Mass. 494, 509 (1977) (Liacos, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 933 (1978). See <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 242-243 (1895). Nevertheless, in a criminal trial extrajudicial statements may be admitted in some circumstances even where the witness who made the statements is not available to testify. The Commonwealth contends that in this case it was permissible for Harman to testify about the content of her telephone conversation with the victim because that evidence was to show the \u201cstate of police knowledge.\u201d As such, the Commonwealth argues, Harman\u2019s testimony was not offered for the truth of its content, and for that reason the confrontation rights of the defendant are not implicated. We disagree. Harman\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We have permitted the use of carefully circumscribed extrajudicial statements in criminal trials to explain the state of police knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 155-156 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 393-394 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 658-659 (1972). We have explained that \u201can arresting or investigating officer should not be put in the false position of seeming just to have happened upon the scene; he should be allowed some explanation of his presence and conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, supra </em>at 393, quoting McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 249, at 734 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984). It goes without saying that the testimony may not be used for the truth of the statements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>served as the basis for the officer\u2019s knowledge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, supra </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Testimony of this kind carries a high probability of misuse, because a witness may relate \u201chistorical aspects of the case, replete with hearsay statements in the form of complaints and reports\u201d even when not necessary to show state of police knowledge. McCormick, Evidence, <em>supra. </em>We have therefore permitted this evidence only through the testimony of a police officer who must testify only on the basis of his own knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra </em>at 155-156 (detective testified to state of police knowledge that led to reliance on informant\u2019s tip to seek out defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, supra </em>(officers testified that father\u2019s tip led to arrest of defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 658-659 (officer testified to information that impelled his approach to defendant). See also McCormick, Evidence, <em>supra </em>(discussing officer\u2019s testifying that he acted \u201cupon information received\u201d or acquired).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Second, the testimony must be limited to the facts required to establish the officer\u2019s state of knowledge. Disclosure of the substance of the conversation ordinarily is not required, and should be curtailed because of its prejudicial potential. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 658-659 n.3 (recognizing potential prejudice of introducing testimony regarding police knowledge in entrapment case). The contours of this limitation were cogently explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 554-555 (1989), quoting McCormick, Evidence, supra: \u201cThe specific description of the defendant given to the investigator is . . . seldom needed and the likelihood of prejudice is great. For this reason a statement that an officer acted \u2018upon information received,\u2019 or \u2018as a consequence of a conversation,\u2019 or words to that effect \u2014 without further detail \u2014 satisfy the purpose of explaining police conduct.\u201d See McCormick, Evidence, <em>supra </em>(\u201ctestimony that [officer] acted \u2018upon information received,\u2019 or words to that effect should be sufficient\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>133 F.3d 1048, 1052 (7th Cir. 1998) (\u201cthe officer\u2019s testimony must be limited to the fact that he spoke to an informant without disclosing the substance of that conversation\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bankston, </em>63 N.J. 263, 268 (1973) (\u201cwhen the officer becomes more specific by repeating what some other person told him ... the testimony violates the hearsay rule\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>531 Pa. 373, 375 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paisa, </em>521 Pa. 113, 119 (1989) (\u201cIt is the prosecutor\u2019s duty to avoid the introduction of out-of-court statements that go beyond what is reasonably necessary to explain police conduct\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxter, </em>568 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 1990) (\u201cTo avoid prejudicial impact of this type of hearsay testimony, it is necessary to limit police testimony to the fact that they \u2018received information\u2019 that led them to be where they were at a particular time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Third, the police action or state of police knowledge must be relevant to an issue in the case. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.2.2, at 439 (6th ed. 1994) (\u201ca party\u2019s knowledge of the contents of [out-of-court] statement must be material for them to be admissible\u201d). See, e.g., <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>916 S.W.2d 176, 179 (Ky. 1995) (limiting officer testimony \u201cto circumstances where the taking of action by the police is an issue in the case and where it tends to explain the action that was taken\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>197 W. Va. 713, 722 (1996), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>183 W. Va. 1, 5 (1990) (\u201csince the issue was not relevant to the prosecution, nor the defense, it was error to allow [the police officers] to testify about the anonymous phone call which implicated the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The testimony of Harman regarding the statements made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>her by the victim satisfies none of these criteria. She had no basis on which to explain police conduct and her testimony could not have been relevant for that purpose. Her testimony extended well beyond any permissible scope of information required to explain the conduct of the police. The circumstances of the police focus on the defendant were not at issue in this case. Harman\u2019s testimony about her telephone conversation with the victim was inadmissible hearsay, and not consistent with the confrontation guarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We turn to consider whether the judge\u2019s error in admitting the testimony over the defendant\u2019s objection requires reversal of his convictions. The error is one of constitutional dimension. \u201cThe admission of testimony obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights will not amount to reversible error \u2018if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 73 (1995), quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986). To make that determination, we examine a number of factors, including the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case, the frequency of reference to the evidence, whether it was cumulative of other evidence and whether the other evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 509 n.ll (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 872 n.8 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Excluding Harman\u2019s testimony entirely from our consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ation, the case against the defendant was overwhelming. Harman\u2019s testimony tended to show that the defendant was with the victim around the time of the murder near the site where the body was discovered. There was other compelling evidence that put the defendant with the victim in the early hours of September 23 near the West End House. The defendant admitted to the police that he had sexual relations with the victim on the night of the murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This was evidence of the most damaging kind, evidence that was strengthened by the defendant\u2019s patently dubious explanation of the circumstances of that encounter. He said that on that night he and a friend went to a local liquor store at around 8 p.m., and that he went into the store to purchase beer while his friend waited outside. When he emerged from the store, his friend was waiting outside with a \u201cgirl.\u201d The three then walked back toward his apartment building; during the walk, the defendant noticed the girl\u2019s Irish decent. The three of them went to the alley behind the apartment building, where they talked. The defendant claims that the discussion turned to sex, and shortly thereafter he had sexual relations with the \u201cgirl.\u201d He said that this encounter occurred at approximately 9 p.m.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cSure she\u2019s had a few drinks. Her defenses are down. But she tries to call out for help; and she calls her girlfriend . . . something in the back of her mind. \u2018I\u2019m at the West End House with Tony. Come on over. If you can\u2019t come over, I\u2019m coming home.\u2019 She\u2019s sending a message that is not received because the person is half asleep. But she was sending a message, and I think that message, from the evidence, would be suggestive of what she was trying to do. She was trying to give somebody a tip; Tony, West End House.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>There was compelling evidence that a sexual encounter with the victim could not have occurred as the defendant described. O\u2019Regan, one of the victim\u2019s roommates, testified that she met the victim at 5 p.m. and they went shopping.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Multiple witnesses then testified about the victim\u2019s whereabouts until 1 a.m. the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>next morning. Marie Kelly, a friend, testified that she picked up O\u2019Regan and the victim at the Broadway subway station at 8 p.m. before returning with them to Kelly\u2019s apartment in South Boston for dinner. Ann Sullivan, another friend of the victim, testified that she met the victim at Kelly\u2019s apartment and that at 9 p.m. they all left for The Abbey, a local bar, where they met the rest of the group prior to the trolley tour. All three friends testified that the victim was with them continuously until approximately 1 a.m. The Commonwealth introduced a photograph of the victim taken on the trolley showing her watch reading 12:30 a.m.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The driver of the trolley testified that she dropped the victim off at around 1 a.m. on Brighton Avenue in Allston. Kelly and Sullivan each testified that they did not see the victim with the defendant that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">While the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the timing and circumstances of his meeting with the victim are entirely inconsistent with powerful evidence to the contrary, overwhelming scientific evidence presented by the Commonwealth confirmed that the defendant did have sexual intercourse with the victim. DNA testing confirmed that semen samples taken from the victim and her clothing belonged to the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An expert also testified that the defendant\u2019s teeth caused a bite mark found on the victim\u2019s breast, and there was expert testimony that it was highly probable that the saliva found on the victim\u2019s breast came from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The testimony of the victim\u2019s friends and the trolley driver, as well as the defendant\u2019s admission and the scientific evidence, compel a conclusion the sexual encounter must have occurred after 1 a.m. Other evidence shows that the defendant and the victim were in the same vicinity when the victim left the trolley. The point where the victim departed the trolley, the location of the victim\u2019s residence, the defendant\u2019s apartment building, and the West End House are all within close walking distance of one another.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant was in his apartment until 12:30 a.m. His girl friend testified that at approximately 12:30 a.m., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the defendant left the apartment to smoke a cigarette. No witness could account for his whereabouts between 12:30 a.m. and 7 A.M.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">During the course of the police investigation, the defendant\u2019s behavior exhibited consciousness of guilt. On the day of the murder, before he was contacted by the police, he attempted to secure a false alibi: he contacted a former girl friend and asked her to say, if asked, that on the night of the murder she had picked him up at 12:30 a.m. and he had stayed overnight at her apartment. As facts of the crimes came to light in response to the police investigation, the defendant repeatedly altered the stories he gave to police. On the first three occasions, he claimed that he spent the night of the murder at his former girl friend\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Between the third and fourth meeting with the police, his former girl friend recanted and told the police that the defendant was not at her apartment on that night, and that he had asked her to lie. During a fourth meeting, the police informed the defendant that they had a court order to obtain hair, saliva, and blood samples. At that point, the defendant abandoned his earlier alibis and admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We are mindful of the potential impact on the jury of permitting the victim to speak through the words of her roommate. We are also mindful that \u201cwe should apply the principle of harmless error with restraint, particularly in the face of constitutional error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>367 Mass. 474, 498 (1975). Nevertheless, in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, including his own admission that he had a sexual encounter with the victim but in circumstances that could not have occurred, we conclude that in this case the judge\u2019s error in admitting the conversation between Harman and the victim \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>382 Mass. 166, 178 (1980), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marini, </em>375 Mass. 510, 520 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">3. The defendant next contends that the prosecutor made certain inappropriate statements during his closing argument. Specifically, the prosecutor referred to the victim\u2019s telephone call to Harman as a \u201ccall out for help,\u201d called the defendant a \u201cmonster\u201d and threw a photograph and teeth impressions on the table in front of the defendant. These were wholly inappropriate and should not have occurred. The judge immediately and forcefully instructed the jury to \u201ccompletely disregard\u201d the references to the defendant as a \u201cmonster\u201d and the \u201cdemonstration of throwing the photograph and the teeth impressions.\u201d The following day, during his instructions to the jury, the judge again stated clearly that statements made by the lawyers during the trial are not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">When a defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statements made during a closing argument, the standard for determining whether a conviction must be reversed because of inappropriate statements is whether the improper statements made by the prosecutor \u201cconstituted prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993). \u201cThe cumulative effect of all the errors in the context of the entire argument and the case as a whole is considered in making this determination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997), <em>S.C., 421 </em>Mass. 298 (1998). The following factors guide our determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cwhether defense counsel seasonably objected to the arguments at trial . . . whether the judge\u2019s instructions mitigated the error . . . whether the errors in the arguments went to the heart of the issues at trial or concerned collateral matters . . . whether the jury would be able to sort out the excessive claims made by the prosecutor . . . and whether the Commonwealth\u2019s case was so overwhelming that the errors did not prejudice the defendant\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 351 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">We have examined the record as a whole and conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, while unprofessional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>improper,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was not prejudicial to the defendant. The judge\u2019s prompt and forceful instructions would certainly have mitigated any error. The prosecutor did not attempt to mislead the jury regarding any factual issues in dispute, but rather used hyperbole to cast a negative light on the defendant. We have recognized, particularly in cases such as this, that \u201c[t]he jury are presumed to have a certain measure of sophistication in sorting out excessive claims on both sides.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 350. Recognizing that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was overwhelming, we conclude that these errors do not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">4. The defendant has made no argument that we should set aside or modify the verdict under our extraordinary power of review in a capital case, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We have reviewed the entire record and perceive no reason to alter the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">On direct examination, the prosecutor asked: \u201cSergeant O\u2019Leary, after you met with Shirley Harman and learned that the last person who spoke to [the victim] was a man named Tony, did you take some steps to find a person named Tony?\u201d Sergeant O\u2019Leary responded: \u201cI did.\u201d O\u2019Leary did not testify further about Harman\u2019s conversation with the victim. Harman did not tell the jury that she related the content of her conversation with the victim to Sergeant O\u2019Leary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Where the defendant offers no basis for concluding that the difference in language between the right of confrontation under the Massachusetts Constitution and the cognate guarantee under the Federal Constitution offers greater protection under the former, we have said that there is no greater protection under the Massachusetts Constitution for questions involving the admissibility of hearsay statements against criminal defendants. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 28 (1998), and cases cited. As discussed at note 3, <em>infra, </em>the defendant does make such an argument here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In the case of criminal trials we require a greater level of scrutiny of hearsay statements and have said that such evidence can be introduced against a criminal defendant only if the statements bear \u201cadequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, 397 </em>Mass. 633, 637 (1986), quoting <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65-66 (1980). The reliability of a hearsay statement, we have concluded, \u201ccan be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, supra </em>at 637-638, quoting <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra </em>at 66. \u201cIn other situations, the evidence is admissible only if the prosecutor makes \u2018a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, supra </em>at 638, quoting <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra. </em>The defendant argues that admission of an extrajudicial statement for the limited purpose of establishing the \u201cstate of police knowledge\u201d is not a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to the general rule precluding the admission of hearsay statements and, as such, would not overcome the protection afforded by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights that a defendant meet the witnesses against him \u201cface to face.\u201d We do not decide whether extrajudicial statements admitted to explain the state of police knowledge would contravene the \u201cface to face\u201d guarantees of art. 12 because we conclude that Harman\u2019s testimony was not properly admitted for that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Where other jurisdictions have admitted extrajudicial statements to show police knowledge in order to explain police conduct, the witness is always an officer who testifies to the source of knowledge or reason for the particular police conduct.

We stated: \u2018In determining whether or not an error is harmless by weighing the prejudicial effect of the improper evidence, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>are several factors which this court and others have considered: (1) the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; (2) who introduced the issue at trial; (3) the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt; (4) the frequency of the reference; and (5) the availability or effect of curative instructions. These factors are not exclusive or exhaustive. Nevertheless, this scoreboard method to distinguish harmless or harmful error is useful.\u2019 (Footnotes and citations omitted.)\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 801-802 n.9 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Flarman\u2019s testimony did not place the victim with the defendant at the scene of the murder at the time it occurred, as the defendant argues.
