The Appeals Court affirmed a judgment of the Superior Court and held that Hingham Mutual, the homeowner\u2019s insurer of residential property that had incurred fire damage as a result of the wrongful act of the owner, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>obligated to pay the second mortgagee, the Money Store/ Massachusetts, Inc. (Money Store), the net proceeds that Hing-ham Mutual obtained from the foreclosure sale of the first mortgage. <em>Money Store/Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 636, 642 (1999). Hingham Mutual conducted the sale after it paid the first mortgagee, Chicopee Savings Bank (Chicopee), and received an assignment of Chicopee\u2019s mortgage. We conclude, based on the unambiguous provisions of the insurance policy, that Hingham Mutual, by reason of Chicopee\u2019s assignment of its first mortgage, acquired all the rights held by Chicopee; and that Hingham Mutual\u2019s foreclosure eliminated the interest of the Money Store. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and direct the entry of a judgment declaring that Hingham Mutual owes nothing to the Money Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The background of the case may be summarized as follows. Krystyna Matsunaga owned residential property in Springfield which was subject to a first mortgage to Chicopee and a second mortgage to the Money Store. Hingham Mutual insured the property under a standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy with the two mortgages noted on the declarations page in the order of their priority, Chicopee as the first lien, and the Money Store as the junior lien. Matsunaga intentionally damaged the property by setting off an explosion. Hingham Mutual properly refused to pay Matsunaga because of her wrongful act. Hingham Mutual determined that the actual cash value of the loss was $40,648.40, and it paid Chicopee $40,600, the full amount owed Chicopee on its first mortgage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with the terms of its policy, Hingham Mutual received an assignment of Chicopee\u2019s first mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Hingham Mutual, as assignee of Chicopee\u2019s rights, conducted a foreclosure sale of the property. The Money Store was represented at the sale, but did not bid. Hingham Mutual purchased the property at the foreclosure sale and eventually resold it to a third party. The foreclosure and resale netted Hingham Mutual $21,558. The Money Store did not make a formal claim for damages against Hingham Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The Money Store filed a complaint in the Superior Court against Hingham Mutual and Chicopee asserting that Hingham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Mutual could not affect the Money Store\u2019s mortgage by exercise of its assignment rights and requesting that Hingham Mutual pay damages. A judge in the Superior Court concluded that the Money Store should prevail, and she ordered the Money Store to recover the $21,558 in net proceeds received by Hingham Mutual from the foreclosure sale with that sum to be applied to the Money Store\u2019s mortgage debt. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment incorporating the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">1. Hingham Mutual\u2019s policy is a standard form homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued in accordance with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99, Twelfth. The pertinent provisions of the policy appear in a section entitled \u201cMortgage Clause,\u201d and read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cIf a mortgagee is named in this policy, any loss payable under Coverage A or B will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cIf we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">\u201ca. we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">\u201cb. at our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">\u201cSubrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee\u2019s claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">These provisions, if unambiguous, are to be construed according to their plain meaning. <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 422, 427 (1995). <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453 (1985). \u201cThis is consistent with our longstanding policy that the rules governing the interpretation of insurance contracts are the same as those governing the interpretation of any other contract.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. We also keep in mind in considering the application of the provisions to this case that the relevant policy language is the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>or substantially the same, as mandated by the Legislature in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99, Twelfth.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">There is nothing ambiguous in the provisions of Hingham Mutual\u2019s policy set forth above. The policy provisions recognize that the policy may provide coverage to multiple mortgagees (\u201cIf more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages . . .\u201d). The policy provisions do not provide for any rearrangement of the priorities of mortgagees, if a first mortgagee is paid before a junior mortgagee. The policy provisions expressly direct Hingham Mutual to pay any mortgagee named therein and, <em>at Hingham Mutual\u2019s option, </em>either to invoke that mortgagee\u2019s subrogation rights or upon payment to the mortgagee of all monies due to receive a full assignment and transfer of the satisfied mortgagee\u2019s rights. Hingham Mutual chose the second option (payment of all monies due Chicopee), and it received a full assignment of Chicopee\u2019s first mortgage. When Hingham Mutual exercised that option, the debt to Chi-copee was not extinguished. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Watertown Fire Ins. Co., </em>132 Mass. 480, 483 (1882). See also <em>Neises </em>v. <em>Solomon State Bank, </em>236 Kan. 767, 779-780 (1985); <em>Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>851 S.W.2d 22, 27 (Mo. Ct. App. 1993); <em>Commercial St. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hitson, </em>73 N.M. 328, 333 (1963); <em>Northwest Farm Bur. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Althauser, </em>90 Or. App. 13, 16-17 (1988). As a result of the assignment, Hingham Mutual succeeded to all the rights held by Chicopee to enforce the debt to it against the property (and to the detriment of junior liens) under the terms of the first mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Hingham Mutual was not required to exercise its rights as as-signee only for the benefit of the Money Store. Hingham Mutual was insuring physical risks to the property and not the Money Store\u2019s mortgage and debt. The Money Store should have been aware of these facts. If any loss was payable to mortgagees under the policy, the Money Store was on notice that Chicopee stood first in order of preference, and payment in full to Chi-copee allowed Hingham Mutual, as assignee, to exercise all of Chicopee\u2019s rights against the Money Store. Put differently, based on the policy language, the Money Store could harbor no reasonable expectation that Hingham Mutual\u2019s policy would fully protect the Money Store\u2019s security. See generally <em>East Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Ogan, </em>428 Mass. 327, 331 (1998) (\u201cA second mortgagee . . . accepts risks inherent in that security\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The nonimpairment provision in the policy, set forth above, does not alter this conclusion. That provision also is not ambiguous. It relates only to subrogation, and not to the assignment option, and no reference to subrogation is made in the assignment option.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subrogation and assignment are not the functional equivalent of each other. The former speaks in terms of broader equitable rights and remedies. See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Porter Leasing Corp., </em>386 Mass. 425, 426-427 (1982) (\u201cSubrogation is an equitable adjustment of rights that operates when a creditor or victim of loss is entitled to recover from two sources . . .\u201d); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Graye, </em>358 Mass. 238, 240 (1970), quoting Amould, Marine Insurance \u00a7 1225 (14th ed.) (\u201cSubrogation is an equitable arrangement incident to all contracts of indemnity and to all payments on account thereof\u201d). Assignment is legal in nature and has an established meaning, discussed above, with respect to the rights of an assignee of a first mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">2. As has been discussed, resolution of the controversy rests on an interpretation of the standard form homeowner\u2019s insurance policy provisions, specifically the assignment and subrogation provisions and the nonimpairment clause, in a multiple mortgagee setting. There is little case law on the issue raised in this case. Two courts have held that a junior mortgagee takes priority over an insurer that has paid the senior mortgagee the value of the mortgage and taken an assignment of that mortgage. See <em>Perretta </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>106 Mise. 91, 100-101 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.), aff\u2019d, 188 A.D. 983 (N.Y. 1919); <em>Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dilworth, </em>167 Md. 232, 239 (1934). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>are not persuaded by the reasoning of either decision. Both fail to distinguish adequately between the legal significance of assignment and subrogation, and they apply the nonimpairment clause, without explanation, to an assignment in a manner contrary to the unambiguous language of the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As a matter of policy, we also note that, if we were to follow the decisions in these cases, insurers might be reluctant to insure second mortgagees because the insurers would lose the option of paying the mortgage debt to the first mortgagee and taking an assignment of that mortgage to recoup their losses. This might lead to lending institutions not issuing second mortgages to homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Appeals Court placed reliance on <em>Eddy </em>v. <em>London Assur. Corp., </em>143 N.Y. 311 (1894), and <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>100 N.J. Super. 252 (1968). <em>Money Store/Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 636, 641 (1999). These decisions are not helpful because both deal with a mortgage clause and a non-impairment provision in the context of a single mortgagee. The <em>First Federal </em>case, a short per curiam decision dealing with multiple insurance companies refusing to pay a single mortgagee after denying liability to the mortgagor, stands for the unremarkable proposition that under a mortgage clause an insurer\u2019s rights are subordinate to those of a single mortgagee, and the insurers are entitled to an assignment only if they pay the mortgage debt in full. <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., supra </em>at 254-255. The <em>Eddy </em>case, in which a single mortgagee<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> began foreclosure proceedings on the property securing the mortgages, but did not complete the foreclosure until after fire had destroyed the premises and the insurance company had denied the claim as to the mortgagor, concludes that the mortgagee was not bound to stay foreclosure proceedings and accept insurance payments and assign its rights in the mortgages to the extent of such payments. <em>Eddy </em>v. <em>London Assur. Corp., supra </em>at 320. These results may well be correct, but they do not have authoritative pertinence to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">3. We have considered the arguments made by the Money Store in support of its position. The Money Store\u2019s main contention is that, for a variety of reasons, Chicopee should have applied the money it received from Hingham Mutual to Matsuna-ga\u2019s mortgage debt. As discussed above, unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>provisions of the policy, and the Money Store\u2019s knowledge of the risks it assumed, do not support its position. As a practical matter, the Money Store\u2019s arguments, if adopted, would allow a wrongdoer like Matsunaga to benefit from her wrongdoing by having her mortgage debt reduced or extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">4. The judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to be entered declaring that Hingham Mutual and Chicopee owe nothing to the Money Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">By reason of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99, an owner\u2019s wrongful conduct does not cut off the rights of mortgagees to claim against the mortgagee loss payable clause of a fire insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The interpretation that the nonimpairment provision applies only to the subrogation option requires no historical justification because its language speaks for itself. The interpretation is supported, however, by the language of the New York standard fire insurance policy on which the \u201cMortgage Clause\u201d in Hingham Mutual\u2019s policy is based. The New York standard fire insurance policy was introduced in 1943, and was the forerunner of the present provision. See 3 S.A. Cozen, Insuring Real Property \u00a7 52.01, at 52-3 (1999). The original provision read as follows: \u201cIf this Company shall claim that no liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner, it shall, to the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee, be subrogated to all the mortgagee\u2019s rights of recovery, <em>but without impairing mortgagee\u2019s right to sue, </em>or it may pay off the mortgage debt and require an assignment thereof and of the mortgage . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 52.04[1], at 52-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The intent of the nonimpairment language, then as now, relates only to the insurer\u2019s subrogation to the mortgagee\u2019s rights of recovery, the mortgagee\u2019s \u201cright to sue.\u201d That language was not intended to modify the insurer\u2019s rights as an assignee of a mortgagee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The single mortgagee owned three separate mortgages on the property at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
