BSI sought the vacation of an arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating Shawn Maloney and Carl Morton, two BSI investigators who were terminated after accessing confidential tax records without authorization. BSI and the union, which represents Maloney and Morton, filed cross motions for summary judgment. The judge allowed the union\u2019s motion in a marginal order, stating that \u201cthere is no basis justifying vacating the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>award.\u201d We transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s order allowing the union\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the undisputed facts. BSI is a government agency charged with investigating complaints of fraud related to assistance programs administered by the Department of Transitional Assistance and the Department of Social Services. Through an agreement with the Department of Revenue (DOR), Maloney and Morton, as BSI investigators, had \u201con-line\u201d access to a computerized database of wage reports of Massachusetts taxpayers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September, 1996, a DOR investigation revealed that Maloney and Morton had used their access to DOR records to examine the tax records of various Boston sports celebrities and three BSI managers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the individuals whose records were accessed were not under investigation by BSI, the DOR terminated BSI\u2019s access to confidential tax information. BSI discharged Maloney and Morton.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between BSI and the union, the union filed grievances protesting the discharges. The grievances were submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitrator concluded that \u201cShawn Maloney and Carl Morton were discharged without just cause.\u201d The arbitrator noted a number of factors that he considered \u201cextenuating.\u201d He found that Morton and Maloney did not disclose any confidential information, did not gain anything from their unauthorized access to the files, and readily admitted culpability and responsibility for their actions. But see note 2, <em>supra. </em>The arbitrator\u2019s award specified that the terminations be reduced to three-month suspensions without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>BSI asks us to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating Maloney and Morton because enforcement of the award would undermine the public\u2019s interest in keeping tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>records confidential. According to BSI, we should review the arbitrator\u2019s decision de nova. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u201cThe role of courts in reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award is limited.\u201d <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Worcester, </em>392 Mass. 184, 187 (1984), citing G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. Judges may not vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award except in the circumstances set forth in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. See <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 15 (1995), citing <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester, supra', </em>and <em>School Comm, of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 792 (1977). Only G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 <em>11(a) </em>(3), has potential application in this case. General Laws c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3), provides that: \u201cUpon application of a party, the superior court shall vacate an award if: \u2014 . . . the arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d \u201cArbitration, it is clear, may not \u2018award relief of a nature which offends public policy ....\u2019\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980), quoting S.E. Eager, The Arbitration Contract and Proceedings \u00a7 121.6 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Arbitrators are limited to considering matters encompassed by the collective bargaining or other agreements. Arbitrators do not have the authority to take into consideration the public policy implications of their awards. See, e.g., <em>Iowa Elec. Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 204 of the Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>834 F.2d 1424, 1427 (8th Cir. 1987), quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 759, Int\u2019l Union of the United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983). Also, courts may not enforce contracts or agreements that violate strong public policy. Therefore, \u201cthe question of public policy is ultimately one for resolution by the courts\u201d and not by arbitrators. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 16 n.5, quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co., supra', Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Esso Workers\u2019 Union, Inc., </em>118 F.3d 841, 845 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We start with the principle that there is a \u201cstrong public policy favoring arbitration.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 16, quoting <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local 97 </em>v. <em>Niagara Mohawk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>Power Corp., </em>143 F.3d 704, 714 (2d Cir. 1998); <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co., supra </em>at 764. Thus, because the public policy \u201cdoctrine allows courts to by-pass the normal heavy deference accorded to arbitration awards and potentially to \u2018judicialize\u2019 the arbitration process, the judiciary must be cautious about overruling an arbitration award on the ground that it conflicts with public policy.\u201d <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Grasselli Employees Indep. Ass\u2019n of E. Chicago, </em>790 F.2d 611, 615 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 853 (1986), and cases cited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>We have vacated (or affirmed the vacation of) an arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3), where that award directly conflicts with statutory provisions. See, e.g., <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, 376 </em>Mass. 706, 713-714 (1978); <em>School Comm, of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, 369 </em>Mass. 683, 685 (1976). See also <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 227 (1979). However, in <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra, </em>the Commonwealth asked that an arbitrator\u2019s award be vacated because \u201cit 'violate[d] the Commonwealth\u2019s explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy against the unauthorized possession of handguns.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The arbitrator\u2019s award in that case ordered the reinstatement of a highway department employee who was terminated after a loaded handgun was found in his locked toolbox. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. We held that the Commonwealth had not established that the award violated public policy to such an extent that it required vacation. We also implicitly set forth several prerequisites for establishing that an award violates public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">First, we wrote that, \u201c[t]o be vindicated, public policy \u2018must be well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained \u201cby reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co., supra </em>at 766. Second, we noted that the conduct involved cannot be \u201cdisfavored conduct in the abstract.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 17. Rather, to implicate public policy, an arbitrator\u2019s award must order reinstatement after an employee has engaged in \u201cdisfavored conduct which is <em>integral to the performance of employment duties.\u201d Id., </em>quoting <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>861 F.2d 665, 671 (11th Cir. 1988), cert, denied, 493 U.S. 871 (1989). Finally, we required a showing that the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating the employee violates public policy to such an extent that the employee\u2019s conduct would have required dismissal. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 19. Merely showing that the conduct is \u201cdisfavored\u201d by public policy is not sufficient. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>United States Postal Serv. </em>v. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>839 F.2d 146, 149-150 (3d Cir. 1988); <em>Lansing Community College </em>v. <em>Lansing Community College Chapter of the Michigan Ass\u2019n for Higher Educ., </em>161 Mich. App. 321, 333 (1987), vacated and remanded, 429 Mich 895, reaffirmed without decision, 171 Mich. App. 172 (1988) (\u201cIf an award is permissible, even if not optimal for the furtherance of public policy goals, it must be upheld. Arbitration awards reinstating employees are therefore upheld if the public policy, while disfavoring the employees\u2019 conduct, does not require dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">BSI satisfies the first two of these requirements. BSI adequately supports its claim that there is a \u201cwell-defined and dominant\u201d public policy of protecting confidential tax information against unauthorized access.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also clear that Morton and Maloney\u2019s conduct in accessing confidential tax records, unlike the conduct involved in the <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>case was integral and directly related to the performance of their duties at BSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">BSI\u2019s claim fails, however, because no public policy \u201crequire[s] dismissal\u201d of employees who access confidential tax records without authorization. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>supra </em>at 17, and cases cited. In this respect, the circumstances in this case are precisely like those in <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra. </em>\u201cThe applicable collective bargaining agreement gave the arbitrator the authority to impose a less severe sanction than termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Although Morton and Maloney violated public policies embodied by statutes protecting confidential tax information, the collective bargaining contract did not require dismissal. \u201cWhile [Morton and Maloney\u2019s] conduct \u2018would have provided sufficient grounds for an arbitrator to find \u201cjust cause\u201d for discharge, we recognize that the parties bargained for the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract and that even our strong disagreement with the result does not provide sufficient grounds for vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, quoting <em>State Auditor </em>v. <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Professional Employees, </em>504 N.W.2d 751, 757-758 (Minn. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">BSI and the union negotiated a collective bargaining agreement in which they gave the arbitrator final authority to sanction employees who commit misconduct such as that committed by Morton and Maloney. The arbitrator recognized that the \u201cunauthorized examination\u201d of the confidential records \u201cwas inappropriate conduct\u201d and that \u201cthe grievants had no right to examine . . . private tax files.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s award specified a three-month suspension without pay. \u201cThe arbitrator, as final judge of the proper means of discipline, concluded that this, in addition to a record of wrongful conduct, was sufficient disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We see no reason to overturn the arbitrator\u2019s award as BSI requests. \u201cDeference is premised on the simple notion that courts do not free the individual from his obligations merely because those obligations have turned sour on him.\u201d <em>Stead Motors of Walnut Creek </em>v. <em>Automotive Machinists Lodge No. 1173, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, </em>886 F.2d 1200, 1206 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 946 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">General Laws c. 22, \u00a7 15D (3), authorizes the director of the Bureau of Special Investigations (BSI) to \u201c[e]xamine upon written request to the commissioner of revenue the tax returns, wage reports, papers or other documents on file with said commissioner . . . concerning any person where there is reason to believe that such person has committed fraud . . . .\u201d Through a special arrangement with the Department of Revenue (DOR), BSI investigators were given access to these records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Morton and Maloney admitted to accessing the records of the sports celebrities, but not to accessing the records of the BSI managers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">We disagree with BSPs assertion that, \u201cwhere an employee\u2019s conduct violates a well-defined public policy, an arbitrator\u2019s award interpreting the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>lective bargaining agreement to require the reinstatement. . . also offends the public policy.\u201d Such a conclusion would weaken the policy favoring arbitration.
