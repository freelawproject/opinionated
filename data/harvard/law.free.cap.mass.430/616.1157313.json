The defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury of aggravated rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery. He was sentenced to serve from seven to ten years on the aggravated rape charge, and from three to five years on the kidnapping charge, to run concurrently; and the assault and battery conviction was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. The Appeals Court affirmed the aggravated rape conviction and reversed the kidnapping charge, set aside the kidnapping verdict and dismissed that indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 383 (1999). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The defendant maintains that the judge erred when he prohibited the defendant from impeaching the rape victim with her five prior convictions for prostitution-related offenses. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 231 n.8 (1981), the court left open the question whether, in a case like this, a defendant could introduce in evidence under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, records of conviction of prostitution, or other sex-related crimes, to impeach a rape complainant\u2019s credibility. We believe that, pursuant to the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, evidence of convictions of a rape complainant involving sexual conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>with others, including prostitution, is not generally admissible for the purpose of impeachment of the credibility of the testifying complainant, notwithstanding the provisions of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A complainant\u2019s convictions involving sexual conduct could be admissible if they are relevant to motive to lie or bias, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 229, 231, or fall within the two statutory exceptions to the rape-shield statute. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, and notes 7 &amp; 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The victim testified that in the early hours of July 2, 1995, she walked to a gasoline station in Brockton to buy cigarettes. The defendant drew his vehicle to within a couple of feet from her, and offered her a ride. When she declined, he grabbed her, pulled her into the vehicle, and, with a gun, threatened her with death if she tried to scream or flee. The victim testified he drove to an abandoned building on West Chestnut Street in Brockton, ordered her to undress, and threatened to cut off her clothes with his knife. The defendant forced her to perform oral sex on him, then raped her repeatedly, vaginally and anally, until approximately one hour after daybreak. She testified that she never had any conversation with the defendant about performing sexual acts with him for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The victim further testified that a few minutes after the defendant left her and drove away, as she walked down a nearby street, an unmarked police car pulled up to her and the officer asked her what had happened. She told the officer she had just been raped. Another officer who arrived on the scene testified that the victim was crying, confused, incoherent, and very upset. She was transported to a hospital by ambulance sometime around 6:30 a.m. The emergency room examining nurse observed fresh bruises on the victim, and testified that she was disheveled, rambling, crying, and upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">In his testimony, the defendant admitted having oral and vaginal sexual intercourse with the victim from sometime after 1:30 a.m. that morning until sometime after 2 a.m. But he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the following, very different account of the incident: He testified he was looking for a prostitute, as he had done in the past. After making eye contact with the victim at an intersection, she approached him in his car and offered to perform oral sex and have intercourse with him for $40. He suggested $30, which was agreed to. He testified the victim then directed him to drive to an abandoned building on West Chestnut Street where they had oral and vaginal intercourse until he told the victim to get out of the car. He refused to give the victim a ride home and an argument ensued. The defendant then pulled the victim out of the car by her arm. Before driving off, he pretended to give her $30, but in fact gave her only three dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Prior to trial, the prosecutor filed a motion in limine to preclude defense counsel from impeaching the rape victim with her prior convictions for prostitution-related offenses. The motion also sought to obtain the judge\u2019s permission to impeach the defendant with his prior conviction of indecent assault and battery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Defense counsel argued that evidence of the victim\u2019s prostitution-related convictions did not fall within the rape-shield exclusion, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, nor into the category of impermissible reputation or bad acts evidence. He argued the victim\u2019s convictions were admissible because of the statutory provision allowing impeachment of a witness with prior convictions. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. He made no constitutional claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge initially decided that the prostitution-related convictions would be admissible for impeachment purposes, despite the danger that the jury might use the convictions as propensity evidence concerning the victim, reasoning that the convictions showed the victim\u2019s \u201csupreme indifference\u201d to conducting herself in accordance with law. However, when he learned that the prosecution intended to introduce the defendant\u2019s prior conviction to impeach the defendant, the judge excluded evidence of both the defendant\u2019s prior assault and battery conviction and the victim\u2019s prior prostitution-related convic-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tians. The judge did permit impeachment of the victim by means of her prior convictions for cocaine possession and a violation of a G. L. c. 209A protective order. Defense counsel objected immediately to the exclusion of the prostitution-related convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">At trial the victim\u2019s estranged son testified that his mother had told him she had falsely claimed she was raped because a man had not paid her for an act of prostitution. He also stated that he did not know if his mother\u2019s comment referred to the defendant or to someone else. The son was impeached with several prior convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not object to this impeachment evidence, nor did he renew at that point his earlier objections to the exclusion of the victim\u2019s prior prostitution-related convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">This case takes us into the ill-mapped area where the mandate to shield rape victims, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, and the discretionary authority of judges to admit prior convictions to impeach witnesses, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, have unsettled or overlapping borders. The defendant argued that impeachment of the complainant with her five prior prostitution-related convictions was statutorily permissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. The Commonwealth argued that the judge should exercise his discretion to exclude the convictions and asserted that the convictions were excludable under the provisions of the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We discuss first the mandate of the rape-shield statute, because the Commonwealth\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting rape victims sets an important limit on a judge\u2019s discretionary authority to admit prior convictions submitted generally to impeach a complainant witness. The rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, prevents a defendant in a rape case who claims consent from putting the complainant on trial by raising collateral issues of little or no probative value concerning the complainant\u2019s alleged predisposition for promiscuity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute governs the admissibility of evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct with others and generally requires exclusion of this type of evidence, with several recognized exceptions. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 225-229 (1981). We recently reaffirmed that \u201c[t]he rape-shield statute is principally designed to prevent defense counsel from eliciting evidence of the victim\u2019s promiscuity as part of a general credibility attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 647 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>412 Mass. 516, 523 (1992). The policy rationale for this law is that evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct might divert attention from the alleged criminal acts of the defendant, inappropriately putting the victim on trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 227. Moreover, such evidence often has little relevance in rape cases where consent is the issue: the \u201cvictim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>consent to intercourse with one man does not imply her consent in the case of another.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>363 Mass. 220, 227 (1973). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanden-hecke, </em>248 Mass. 403, 404 (1924) (\u201c[t]he rule is well established that the fact that a female witness is a prostitute ... is not admissible to impeach her\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We have acknowledged, however, that evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct may be admissible to show the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to lie. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, supra </em>at 647-648; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 875-876 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domaingue, </em>397 Mass. 693, 699 (1986). The victim\u2019s prior prostitution-related convictions were not admissible under that exception here because they were not submitted to show motive to lie. The defendant instead argued only generally that the convictions were relevant, as convictions, to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility. Nonetheless, the defendant\u2019s arguments touch closely, if not directly, on the victim\u2019s possible motive to lie, and we find it necessary to discuss the possibility that her prostitution-related convictions were admissible as relevant to some motive to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The circumstances of this case differ markedly from those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra, </em>where we recognized error in the exclusion of evidence of prostitution charges relevant to a showing of bias or motive to lie. See <em>id. </em>at 223, 225-226, 231. In the <em>Joyce </em>case, the prostitution charges were relevant to whether the complainant might have had a motive to he about a rape. See <em>id. </em>at 224, 230. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 750-751 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 232 (Hennessey, C.J., concurring) (admissibility of prostitution charges confined to cases \u201cwhere the disputed evidence is clearly relevant to a showing of bias or motive to lie by the complaining witness\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 375-376, 378-379 (1990). In the <em>Joyce </em>case, the complainant had been charged twice with prostitution \u2014 the second time when she had allegedly been discovered undressed in a car engaged in sexual acts. According to the account the defendant offered of the night of the alleged rape, he and the complainant were engaging in consensual sexual intercourse in his car when he saw a police cmiser approaching and told the complainant to get dressed. In offering the prior prostitution charges, the defendant \u201cintended to show that the complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>having been found in a similar situation on two prior occasions, had been arrested on each occasion and charged with prostitution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 230. We consequently concluded that \u201c[w]e cannot say that this [prostitution charge] evidence has no rational tendency to prove that the complainant was motivated falsely to accuse the defendant of rape <em>by a desire to avoid further </em>prosecution\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In contrast, the defendant here has presented no particular circumstances involved in the victim\u2019s prior prostitution convictions that would point to a motive to he about the rape. When the police arrived, the victim was clothed and alone; she was not discovered in a compromising position. There is also no suggestion here that the victim feared she might again be arrested for prostitution if she did not fabricate a rape complaint. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 230. There was no basis for admitting the victim\u2019s prostitution convictions as relevant to a motive to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We now consider whether the victim\u2019s prostitution-related convictions should have been admitted pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. Evidence of prior convictions may be admissible to impeach any witness where the convictions meet the statutory provisions of \u00a7 21. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 249 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984). The rationale is that \u201ca defendant\u2019s earlier disregard for the law may suggest to the fact finder similar disregard for the courtroom oath.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fono, </em>400 Mass. 296, 302-303 (1987). Admission of evidence of prior convictions of a witness for impeachment purposes is at the discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>470. The judge must balance the danger of unfair prejudice against the probative value of the evidence for the purpose of impeachment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, supra </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">There is potential conflict between the application of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, and the rape-shield statute, \u00a7 21B, in the handling of prior prostitution convictions submitted to impeach the complaining witness\u2019s credibility in a rape trial. Section 21 apparently gives a judge discretionary authority to admit such convictions, whereas \u00a7 21B, read literally, would generally bar their admission.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislative intent behind the later-enacted rape-shield provision, \u00a7 21B, is not definitive concerning whether it was meant to modify the application of \u00a7 21 when rape trials are involved.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 228 &amp; n.6, citing Bumim, Massachusetts Rape-Shield Law \u2014 An Over-Step in the Right Direction, 64 Mass. L. Rev. 61, 63 (1979) (discussing legislative history of rape-shield statute and noting it \u201cis limited\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Four alternative versions of the bill that eventually became the rape-shield statute expressly provided that the shield provisions were not meant to limit the right to impeach credibility of the victim by use of prior convictions, but this language was dropped in the legislation that was enacted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See 1977 . House Doc. No. 4133; 1977 House Doc. No. 2586; 1977 House Doc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>No. 2228; 1976 Senate Doc. No. 678. See also Bumim, <em>supra </em>at 64-65. Compare G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, with 1977 Senate Doc. No. 1433. The fact the Legislature dropped language expressly allowing admission of prior convictions of the complainant suggests the Legislature did not want such convictions to be admissible for the impeachment of a rape complainant\u2019s credibility. Moreover, the legislative purpose of the rape-shield statute is to protect rape victims. See, e.g., St. 1977, c. 110, Preamble (arguing for the smallest number of judicially recognized exceptions to its general bar on admission of evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In his concurrence, Justice Lynch suggests that our view \u201camounts to an implied repeal\u201d of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. We do not agree. The later enacted rape-shield statute addresses the admissibility of a special category of evidence, a complaining witness\u2019s prior sexual conduct, while G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, is framed in very general terms. Our conclusion reads the two statutes harmoniously. However, to the extent a conflict between the two statutes exists, \u201cthe more specific statute controls over the more general one.\u201d See 2B Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02 (5th ed. 1992). Finally, \u00a7 21 significantly predates the rape-shield statute. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>If provisions of those two statutes are irreconcilable, the later enacted rape-shield provision should control. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We conclude that the rape-shield provisions excluding most evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct were intended to exclude this kind of evidence even when it involves the complainant\u2019s convictions submitted to impeach the complainant\u2019s credibility generally. Thus, despite G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, the trial judge generally does <em>not </em>have discretion to admit such convictions. A contrary rule, allowing a judge discretion on the point, infuses a substantial measure of illogic into the logical and fair conclusion that follows from reflection on the purposes of the rape-shield statute and the import of the court\u2019s statements in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>363 Mass. 220, 227 (1973), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vandenhecke, </em>248 Mass. 403, 404 (1924), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>among others. Our conclusion takes into account that the need to exclude evidence of prostitution or prostitution-related convictions should not be overridden by a theoretical argument that the evidence may be admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21 (but not under the rape-shield statute), because the statutes have different purposes. Surely, a jury, no matter how much effort the judge makes to purge their mindsets by admonitory instructions, are more likely to conclude that the impeaching convictions show that the complainant should not be believed, not because she is untruthful, but because she has been, and thus continues to be, indiscriminate in sexual relations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A complainant\u2019s convictions involving sexual conduct could be admissible if they are clearly relevant to a motive to lie or to bias, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 229, 231, or fall within the two statutory exceptions of the rape-shield statute. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. In this case, evidence of the prostitution-related convictions of the complainant did not fall into any of these exceptions, and was properly excluded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The Appeals Court dismissed the kidnapping conviction as duplicative of the aggravated rape conviction in the circumstances of the case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>46 Mass.

Our views here are consistent with the holding in that case. There, unlike here, evidence involving charges of the complainant\u2019s prior prostitution was admissible because it clearly touched on her possible motive to lie, not on her general credibility.

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domaingue, </em>397 Mass. 693, 698 (1986) (at common law, evidence of prior sexual conduct of victim with persons other than defendant inadmissible to impeach victim\u2019s credibility); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 751 n.12 (1983), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>105 Mass. 593, 594 (1870).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b647-13\">The rape-shield statute applies to trials and proceedings for a violation of, inter alla, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. The defendant\u2019s trial for aggravated rape came under the provisions of the rape-shield statute, and evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct with others generally would be statutorily excluded, unless governed by a recognized exception, such as evidence showing bias or motive to lie. The rape-shield law statutorily recognizes two exceptions where specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct are admissible: (1) where the conduct was with the defendant, and (2) where the conduct is alleged to be the cause of a condition of the victim. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. Neither of these exceptions applies in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>357 Mass. 245, 249 (1970), we held that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, gave judges no discretion to exclude such prior convictions. We overruled <em>West </em>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984), and recognized the discretion of judges to exclude prior conviction impeachment evidence. We did so in the context of a prior conviction of a defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 469-470. Our language suggested, without expressly holding, that this discretion also applied to witnesses other than defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 470. Judicial discretion to admit or exclude prior convictions of <em>any </em>witness submitted for impeachment purposes is clearly consistent with the statutory language. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21 (conviction \u201cof <em>a witness . . . may </em>be shown\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 249 (1996); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucknam, </em>20 Mass.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>397 Mass. 440, 445-446 (1986) (Lynch, J., dissenting). Furthermore, I have expressed my disagreement with the court\u2019s suggestion that error might arise from the admission of a <em>defendant\u2019s </em>prior conviction of rape in a rape trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, does not address the use of a complainant\u2019s prior convictions for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Today the three Justices see within the rape-shield statute the intent to limit the discretion of the judge to admit evidence of convictions specifically permitted by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222 (1981). No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>specific language of the statute supports such an interpretation. Therefore, I believe the three Justices\u2019 opinion amounts to an implied repeal of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. \u201c[T]here is a \u2018very strong presumption against implied repeal\u2019 \u201d in statutory construction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>404 Mass. 282, 286 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 391 (1981). Implied repeal should never be used unless there is a conflict between two statutes dealing with the same subject matter and the older statute is \u201cso repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment . . . that both cannot stand.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra, </em>quoting <em>Boston Horn. Auth. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 715, 718 (1986). Here, the exact relationship between the two statutes may not be clear, but there is no such repugnance.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In reconciling the two statutes, I would apply the rule the court developed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra. Joyce </em>provided sufficient guidance for judges when weighing the admissibility of evidence of prostitution against the rape-shield statute. The court said: \u201cIn the exercise of this discretion a trial judge should consider the important policies underlying the rape-shield statute. He should exclude evidence of specific instances of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct in so far as that is possible without unduly infringing upon the defendant\u2019s right to show bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231. There, the court also specifically declined to \u201cintimat[e] the proper result\u201d when the judge exercised discretion. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The three Justices, in part III, now opine that a judge should deny admission of a complainant\u2019s prior convictions of prostitution to impeach the complainant\u2019s general credibility. I find such a limit on the discretion of the judge improper because it defies the legislative directive to admit such evidence. Moreover, the three Justices themselves concede that it is not clear whether \u00a7 21B was meant to modify \u00a7 21 at rape trials. Because the legislative intent is not clear, any expansion of the rape-shield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>statute is a matter of legislative prerogative. Until the Legislature acts, I think the guidance that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra, </em>gave to judges that they should consider the important policies behind the rape-shield statute when exercising their discretion is equally appropriate guidance for evidence impeaching a complainant\u2019s general credibility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Under the rape-shield statute evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct is not admissible unless used to show \u201cthe victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B.

I do not disagree with the holdings of these cases. The latter two are, however, not on point in this case, which concerns the use of <em>prior convictions </em>for prostitution to impeach a witness\u2019s general credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b655-5\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">(concurring). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 231 n.8 (1981), we left open the question whether, in a case like this, a defendant could introduce in evidence under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, records of convictions of prostitution, or other sex-related crimes, to impeach a rape complainant\u2019s credibility. Today, the plurality opinion suggests \u201cthat the rape-shield provisions . . . exclude this kind of evidence even when it involves the complainant\u2019s convictions submitted to impeach the complainant\u2019s credibility generally. Thus, despite G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, the trial judge generally does <em>not </em>have discretion to admit such convictions. ... A complainant\u2019s convictions involving sexual conduct could be admissible if they are clearly relevant to a motive to lie or to bias ... or fall within the two statutory exceptions of the rape-shield statute.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 625-626.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">I cannot agree that a trial judge lacks the discretion to admit past sex-related convictions to impeach a complainant\u2019s credibility. I would hold that the rape-shield statute does not per se preclude a judge from exercising discretion to permit the defendant to offer convictions of past sex-related crimes against a complainant for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The plurality opinion identifies a potential conflict between G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, the statute that permits impeachment by prior conviction, and G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, the rape-shield statute. Pursuant to \u00a7 21, a prior conviction is admissible to impeach the credibility of a witness when the prior conviction meets certain requirements. Section 21B provides that \u201c[e]vi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>dence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct . . . shall not be admissible except evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim.\u201d The plurality reads \u00a7 21B as creating an exception to \u00a7 21 to prevent the use of sex-related convictions to impeach a rape complainant <em>except </em>when the convictions are relevant to a motive to lie or bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The plurality justifies its conclusion by noting that the purpose of the rape-shield statute is to protect rape victims and that, because the rape-shield statute was enacted after the impeachment by prior conviction statute, <em>ante </em>at 624 n.ll, its provisions should control. Certainly I agree that protecting rape victims from the unfair admission of their past sexual conduct is an important legislative goal advanced by the rape-shield statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Where two statutes conflict, however, as they appear to do here, our first task is to attempt to harmonize the respective provisions of both. We do not favor the implied repeal of statutory provisions. <em>LaBranche </em>v. <em>A.J. Lane &amp; Co., </em>404 Mass. 725, 728-729 (1989), citing <em>Dedham Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>395 Mass. 510, 518 (1985). <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Price, </em>273 Mass. 303, 308 (1930), quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>8 Met. 172, 174-175 (1844). We only prefer the later enacted statute after we have determined that the two statutes are irreconcilable. In my view, the statutes can coexist without repealing a portion of the impeachment by prior conviction statute or abandoning the policy of protecting rape victims from unfair examination regarding past sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">When enacting \u00a7 21B, the Legislature was presumably aware of the provisions of \u00a7 21. The provisions appear within the same chapter of the General Laws; only one section separates \u00a721 and \u00a7 21B. As the plurality states, the Legislature considered but did not adopt language that would have expressly stated that the use of prior sex-related convictions to impeach credibility was not limited by the rape-shield statute. The plurality suggests that this legislative inaction shows that \u201cthe Legislature did not want such convictions to be admissible for the impeachment of a rape complainant\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 625. Ascertaining meaning from the Legislature\u2019s decision not to enact statutory language, however, is an uncertain endeavor. It must be acknowledged that the Legislature has not altered the words of the prior statute. It has not repealed them or altered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>them in any form. The principal way the courts ascertain the intent of the Legislature is through the language the Legislature chooses. Here we have language in \u00a7 21 which presumably the Legislature intends us to implement. We should be guided by the familiar principle of statutory interpretation that \u201c[a] statute is not to be deemed to repeal or supersede a prior statute in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or of clear implication.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 512 (1977), quoting <em>Colt </em>v. <em>Fradkin, </em>361 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Legislature has not expressly stated or clearly implied that the rape-shield statute prevents the defendant from introducing sex-related convictions to impeach the credibility of a rape complainant. Therefore, the more plausible course is to construe the legislative will as intending that the policies embraced in both statutes be enforced. It is not the function of this court to develop policy. Both statutes exist and should be implemented, if at all possible. <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 715, 718 (1986), citing <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 50-51 (1977). <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>344 Mass. 585, 589 (1962). The Legislature is the body for enacting social policy change. In the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent to limit \u00a7 21, I would conclude that sex-related convictions are admissible to impeach the credibility of a rape complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Perceived in this manner, \u00a7 21B indicates a general policy to exclude evidence of the sexual conduct of a victim. Section 21 is an exception to that general policy which applies in a narrow class of cases, i.e, when the witness has actually been convicted of offenses within a certain time period, subject to the judge\u2019s discretion to exclude the conviction if the judge determines that its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 249 (1996). Section 21 is very narrow compared to the breadth of \u00a7 21B which relates to all other evidence of sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">It is not illogical for the Legislature to carve out this exception for convictions. Convictions bear indicia of reliability that distinguish them from other types of evidence that are excluded by \u00a7 21B, further indicating that the Legislature intended both these statutes to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">I would conclude that a prior conviction is admissible for the limited purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21 (\u201c[t]he conviction of a witness of a crime may be shown to affect his credibility\u201d). It is not admissible for any other purpose. Indeed, the jury must be instructed that its only purpose is to impeach the credibility of the complainant. This interpretation of the two sections permits us to give effect to each of the pronouncements of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Despite my belief that the rape-shield statute does not prohibit the admissibility of sex-related convictions for impeachment purposes, the important policy considerations underlying due process and the right to a fair trial require the trial judge to exercise discretion in deciding to permit the introduction of convictions for impeachment. Because of the distinct danger that a jury will consider sex-related convictions to bear on the propensity of the complainant to engage in sexual conduct, a trial judge should exercise caution before admitting these convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>400 Mass. 296, 303 (1987) (admission of prior conviction substantially similar to crime being tried presents risk that jury may be diverted from question of defendant\u2019s guilt to question of defendant\u2019s bad character). The judge should consider whether there is other available evidence to impeach the complainant\u2019s credibility including convictions that are not sexual in nature. Furthermore, a judge should instruct the jury as to the limited evidentiary purpose of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In this case the prostitution-related convictions of the complainant met the admissibility criteria of \u00a7 21. The judge had discretionary authority to admit the convictions and he chose to exclude them. He exercised his discretion fairly. He decided to exclude both the complainant\u2019s prostitution convictions and a prior indecent assault and battery conviction the Commonwealth sought to introduce against the defendant. The judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the prostitution convictions. Thus, I concur that the defendant\u2019s conviction of aggravated rape should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> While this concurrence is based on other grounds, I note that there is some ambiguity in the plurality opinion. The quoted language suggests that prior convictions are admissible to show motive or bias. It is my opinion that prior convictions are admissible for a single purpose: to impeach credibility. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. Apart from the narrow exception created by \u00a7 21, the prior convictions would be inadmissible as hearsay and as non-expert opinion. I assume that the plurality means that the rape-shield statute does not render inadmissible evidence of prior sexual activity of the complainant apart from convictions when offered for the purpose of showing bias or motive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
