At issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>whether the same policy concerns that make sobriety checkpoints reasonable and therefore constitutional also exist with respect to drug interdiction roadblocks. A District Court judge concluded that, under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the roadblock was unconstitutional. A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for an interlocutory appeal. See Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). After the case was entered in the Appeals Court, we transferred it here on our own motion. We conclude that art. 14 prohibits roadblocks to search for contraband such as drugs. We therefore affirm the order of the District Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On the evening of November 21, 1997, State and local police established a temporary roadblock in Holyoke to detect and deter trafficking in illegal narcotics. The roadblock was set up in an area of the city that had a reputation as a high crime area. Official guidelines stated that the purposes of the roadblock were to confiscate illegal narcotics, to apprehend persons transporting illegal narcotics in motor vehicles, and to deter illegal narcotics trafficking. Fifty-eight vehicles were stopped at the roadblock. Approximately one of every four drivers was directed to the \u201cpit\u201d area for further questioning. The police made three arrests and issued two citations. The defendant, Hector Rodriguez, was the only person arrested for a narcotics offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">After the defendant\u2019s vehicle, a Chevrolet Blazer, stopped at the roadblock, Officer Patrick Cadigan shone a flashlight through the window of the vehicle and observed an opened package of Philly Blunt cigars on the passenger seat. According to the Commonwealth, Cadigan knew from his training and experience that cigars are often used in smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Cadigan told a second officer, Lieutenant Frederick Seklecki, what he had seen. Leaning his head through the window of the Blazer, Seklecki sniffed the interior. He smelled a \u201cfreshly smoked cigar type marijuana smell.\u201d Seklecki then sent the defendant to a \u201cpit\u201d area a short distance from the place of the stop. There, the police, after learning that the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended, placed him under arrest for the traffic offense. Aided by a narcotics detection dog, the police searched the vehicle. They discovered two small ends of cigars containing marijuana. The defendant was charged with possess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ing a Class D substance and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized during the roadblock. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The Commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">2. <em>Constitutional principles. </em>We begin with basic principles of search and seizure jurisprudence common to art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment. A seizure occurs under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 whenever a motor vehicle is stopped by an agent of government. See <em>Michigan Dep \u2019t of State Police </em>v. <em>Sitz, </em>496 U.S. 444, 450 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 345 (1989). \u201cTemporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a \u2018seizure\u2019 of \u2018persons\u2019 \u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Whren </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-810 (1996). See <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 450-451; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 139 (1983) (applying protections of Fourth Amendment and art. 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Generally, searches and seizures must be conducted pursuant to a warrant based on probable cause. See Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. Where obtaining a warrant is not practical, searches and seizures may be proper if probable cause or reasonable suspicion exists. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51 (1970); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 347; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 54 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Federal courts have created limited exceptions to the Fourth Amendment requirement that seizures be based on probable cause or reasonable suspicion. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47 (1979), the United States Supreme Court employed a balancing test to determine whether a particular seizure violates the Fourth Amendment. In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court invalidated a criminal statute that required individuals to identify themselves to police when asked to do so. The Supreme Court weighed three factors in assessing the reasonableness of \u201cseizures that are less intrusive than a traditional arrest\u201d: \u201c[1] the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, [2] the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and [3] the severity of the interference with individual liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The Supreme Court has, on occasion, departed from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tripartite balancing test. In <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>520 U.S. 305, 308 (1997), the Supreme Court invalidated a Georgia law requiring certain candidates for public office to be tested for certain drugs. Rather than use the <em>Brown </em>balancing test, the Supreme Court noted that \u201cexceptions to the main rule [requiring individualized suspicion] are sometimes warranted based on <em>\u2018special needs, beyond the normal need for law </em>enforcement\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 313-314, quoting <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602, 619 (1989). These special needs typically involve an immediate or particularly serious risk to the public. \u201c[W]here the risk to public safety is substantial and real, blanket suspicionless searches calibrated to the risk may rank as \u2018reasonable\u2019 \u2014 for example, searches now routine at airports and at entrances to courts and other official buildings. . . . But where . . . public safety is not genuinely in jeopardy, the Fourth Amendment precludes the suspicionless search, no matter how conveniently arranged\u201d (citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Thus, except for the limited number of public safety intrusions that can be justified under tests such as those set forth in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Chandler, </em>\u201claw enforcement officers must possess at least articulable suspicion before stopping a vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Huguenin, </em>154 F.3d 547, 553 (6th Cir. 1998). In <em>Michigan Dep \u2019t of State Police </em>v. <em>Sitz, supra, </em>the Supreme Court applied the <em>Brown </em>balancing test in a Fourth Amendment challenge to a roadblock set up to detect individuals operating under the influence of drugs or alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 450-455. The Supreme Court concluded that sobriety checkpoints do not violate the Fourth Amendment because of the public interest in keeping drunk drivers off the roads. <em>Id. </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Although we have not applied exactly the same analysis as Federal courts, we have also allowed limited exceptions to the reasonable suspicion requirement where an intrusion is limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>and serves a pressing public purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 143-145 (1983), we first indicated that sobriety checkpoints could be conducted in such a way as to comply with constitutional constraints under both the Federal and State constitutions. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 86 (1985), although we did not explicitly apply the <em>Brown </em>balancing test, we acknowledged that \u201cthere exists a strong public interest in reducing the \u2018carnage caused by drunk drivers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 558 (1983). We noted that studies suggest that, \u201con any weekend night in Massachusetts, between five and ten per cent of all drivers on the road will be seriously impaired by alcohol.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. We have continued to recognize the immediate and grave danger posed by drivers who operate under the influence of drugs or alcohol. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 167 &amp; n.3 (1988). See also <em>Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police </em>v. <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 451 (\u201cNo one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the States\u2019 interest in eradicating it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We have emphasized not only the unique nature of the problems caused by those who drive while under the influence, but also the narrowness of the exception to the warrant requirement that we carved out. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 347, we stated that the \u201cexception from usual Fourth Amendment demands that has been made to accommodate fixed roadblocks for detection of illegal aliens . . . and drunk drivers ... is rather exceptional and very limited. This court has carved a \u2018sui generis\u2019 exception for the enforcement of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 ... on the grounds that a \u2018reasonable\u2019 roadblock <em>involves a \u2018minimal\u2019 State intrusion upon the reduced privacy of drivers, </em>one that is in any case outweighed by the strong public interest in reducing the carnage caused by drunk drivers\u201d (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The theme of our roadblock decisions is that the exception for operating while under the influence is very narrow. Because of the limited scope of those decisions, we rejected the \u201cargument that the result we reach[ed] opens the door for suspicion-less searches and seizures in other contexts\u201d and noted that \u201c[pjolice will not be allowed, for example, to cordon off \u2018high crime areas\u2019 and search all the people on the street.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In the context of determining the constitutionality of operating while under the influence roadblocks, our conclusions have, for the most part, paralleled those of the Federal courts. However, we have indicated that art. 14 might provide greater protection against the intrusions occasioned by roadblocks than does the Fourth Amendment. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>for instance, we noted that, \u201c[ajlthough the Supreme Court has indicated that roadblock seizures to enforce license and registration regulations do not violate the Fourth Amendment, <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 739 (1983), it may well be, given the much lower state interest in assuring compliance with license and registration regulations, that roadblocks for that purpose are not permissible under art. 14.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 167 n.3. See <em>id. </em>at 164 n.1. We next consider whether drug interdiction roadblocks may be distinguished from operating while under the influence roadblocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">3. <em>Characteristics of drug interdiction roadblocks. </em>Our discussion is limited to drug interdiction roadblocks because they are at issue here. Because there is no principled way to distinguish between drugs, unlawful guns, pornography, and other contraband, the general principles, set forth <em>infra, </em>apply to all roadblocks to interdict contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201croadblocks limited to countering the pernicious effects of drug trafficking are just as important as roadblocks designed to eradicate the drunk driving problem.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of the similarities between drug interdiction roadblocks and operating while under the influence roadblocks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the Commonwealth concludes, drug interdiction roadblocks are constitutional. We disagree. We think that there are major differences between operating while under the influence roadblocks and drug interdiction roadblocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The crucial distinction between drug interdiction and operating while under the influence roadblocks is that the purpose of narcotics interdiction checkpoints is \u201cthe discovery of evidence of crime.\u201d <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 537 (1967). Unlike the minimal and focused intrusion occasioned by operating while under the influence roadblocks, drug interdiction roadblocks are designed solely to further criminal justice goals. For example, the Holyoke roadblock at issue was a \u201cgeneral program[] of surveillance which invade[d] privacy wholesale in order to discover evidence of crime.\u201d <em>Edmond </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>183 F.3d 659, 664 (7th- Cir. 1999) (invalidating roadblock program with sole purpose of interdicting narcotics).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Further, the relationship between operating while under the influence and the public\u2019s safety on the roads is obvious and direct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The damage caused by impaired drivers occurs on the public roads. Impaired drivers present an immediate risk to the traveling public. Operating while under the influence roadblocks offer immediate relief by removing a \u201cdeadly menace\u201d from the public roads.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blais, </em>428 Mass. 294, 298 (1998). The corollary of these observations is that an operating while under the influence roadblock is not a generalized search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>for evidence of criminal activity conducted without probable cause or reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Unlike operating while under the influence, trafficking in illegal narcotics involves a wide variety of transportation modes. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 763 (1981) (recognizing \u201can increasing use of bicycles to transport illegal drugs\u201d). Thus, narcotics interdiction is not inextricably connected with the public\u2019s use of the roads. See <em>Merrett </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>77 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir.) (Barkett, J., dissenting from denial of petition for en banc rehearing), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 812 (1996) (harm caused by drug traffickers is \u201ccompletely unrelated to highway safety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The nature of the harm caused by drug trafficking also differs from that caused by drivers operating while under the influence. The drug problem in the United States is certainly grave. \u201cDrug-related deaths remain near historic highs.\u201d Office of National Drug Control Policy, The National Drug Control Strategy: 1999, 14. In 1996, 14,843 deaths in the United States were induced by drugs. See <em>id. </em>at 15. However, the risk that narcotics trafficking poses to the public is not immediate, as is the risk posed by a person operating while under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Unlike operating while under the influence roadblocks, narcotics interdiction roadblocks do not provide immediate protection to the public using the roadways. Although apprehending narcotics traffickers may have an eventual impact on the public safety, that impact will necessarily be more remote and tenuous than the impact of removing impaired drivers from the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">4. <em>The constitutionality of drug interdiction roadblocks. </em>The defendant argues that the Holyoke drug interdiction roadblock was an unconstitutional search and seizure under both the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. As a general rule in deciding such questions, we look first to any applicable statutes, then to our State Constitution (if argued separately), and only if necessary to the Federal' Constitution. We have held that art. 14 may provide greater protection than the Fourth Amendment against searches and seizures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We determine that roadblocks for the purpose of searching for evidence of drug trafficking and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>contraband violate art. 14. Therefore, we do not address the defendant\u2019s claim under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Article 14 was drafted in response to the blanket search powers granted to the British by \u201cwrits of assistance.\u201d \u201cBritish search policies generally are acknowledged to have spurred on revolutionary sentiment in colonial Massachusetts. Opposition to the search policies centered upon the use by British customs house officers of the writs of assistance, general warrants which allowed officers of the crown to search, at their will, wherever they suspected untaxed goods to be, and granted the officials the right of forcible entry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 143 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). See <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 625 (1886). \u201cThe history should not require retelling. But old and established freedoms vanish when history is forgotten.\u201d <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 120 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Roadblocks established for the purpose of interdicting drugs and other contraband essentially give to the police the same powers with respect to individuals in their automobiles as the writs of assistance granted to the British officials with respect to individuals in their homes. Viewed in light of the Commonwealth\u2019s history, it is clear that the Holyoke roadblock is precisely the type of search that the drafters of art. 14 sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>prevent. Drug interdiction roadblocks stop citizens without probable cause or reasonable suspicion to look for evidence of criminal activity (in colonial times, untaxed goods). Such a search is precisely what James Otis and John Adams sought to prevent by art. 14. \u201cThose who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it.\u201d G. Santayana, The Life of Reason: 1905-1906.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that this roadblock violated art. 14 and that the stop and seizure of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was unconstitutional. Absent an emergency or imminent threat to the lives and safety of the public, roadblocks to interdict contraband violate art. 14.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The order of the District Court judge suppressing the evidence is affirmed based on art. 14. This matter is remanded to the District Court for such further proceedings as may be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Immigration and customs search and seizure programs \u201cdepend ultimately on sovereign powers over foreign relations, foreign commerce, citizenship, and immigration . . . that states and cities do not possess\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Edmond </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>183 F.3d 659, 664 (7th Cir. 1999).

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra. </em>By contrast, here we do not use a balancing test because there is no imminent threat to public safety and no nexus between the activity (driving) and the law enforcement objective (narcotics interdiction). Because there is no connection between the driving and the interdiction, there is no reason to employ a balancing test. There is nothing to balance. The Commonwealth\u2019s conduct is unconstitutional under art. 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b612-8\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS6\">(concurring). I write separately to reiterate my views on our search and seizure jurisprudence and to note an unfortunate inconsistency between the court\u2019s decision today and prior decisions affirming the constitutional validity of operating while under the influence roadblocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">This court has recognized that the reasonableness of a seizure usually depends on facts which we measure against probable cause or reasonable suspicion that an individual has engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>criminal activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 170 (1988) (Liacos, L, dissenting, with whom Lynch, J., joined); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 139 (1983). I have consistently maintained that this test should be applied to seizures occurring in the course of automobile roadblocks. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 169, 177-178; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, 396 </em>Mass. 81, 98-99, 102 (1985) (Lynch, L, dissenting, with whom Liacos, J., joined). I accept, as I must, that both the United States Supreme Court and this court have supplanted this traditional rule with the illusive standard of a balancing approach that weighs the public interest against the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law enforcement officials. The virtue of this balancing approach, in the court\u2019s view, is its relaxation of the requirement of individualized suspicion for a warrantless search and seizure when this would serve ostensibly \u201cpressing public purpose[s],\u201d such as protecting the public from serious and immediate threats to its safety and welfare. See <em>ante </em>at 580-581. The vice of such a test is that it permits a standardless interference with important constitutional protections of individual rights. I have argued, with particular reference to operating while under the influence roadblocks, that the Commonwealth should at a minimum be required to prove that a chosen procedure for stopping and searching citizens without reasonable suspicion achieves \u201ca degree of law enforcement and [public] safety that is not reasonably attainable by less intrusive means.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 98-99 (Lynch, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 143-144.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternatively, I have argued that, if we are to balance the scales in our search and seizure cases, we must do so consistently, treating like cases alike; we must fairly and realistically evaluate the extent to which various search procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>intrade on personal privacy, and avoid distinguishing arbitrarily among the various public purposes which might be cited by law enforcement officials to justify the extraordinary act of randomly seizing and searching law-abiding citizens without particularized suspicion of criminal activity. See <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 692, 708-710 (1989) (Lynch, 1, dissenting). In connection with this latter point, I have observed that \u201cthe pervasive harmful influence of drugs on contemporary society cannot seriously be denied. It presents a social problem of at least equal magnitude to operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Precisely because I concur with the court\u2019s conclusion today concerning roadblocks to interdict contraband, I reiterate my position, first advanced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 98-102, that operating while under the influence roadblocks are similarly offensive to the protections afforded individual liberty and personal privacy by art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The distinction which the court attempts to draw in part <em>3, ante </em>at 582-584, between roadblocks designed to remove drunk drivers from the roadways and those aimed at curbing the flow of illegal drags or other contraband is, in my view, untenable. The court makes some effort to ground this distinction in the greater intrasiveness of the search entailed by a narcotics interdiction roadblock. See <em>ante </em>at 583 (describing operating under the influence roadblocks as occasioning \u201cminimal and focused intrusion\u201d). But this ground is illusive: the court\u2019s assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, an operating under the influence roadblock is most assuredly nothing other than \u201ca generalized search for evidence of criminal activity [i.e., violations of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24] conducted without probable cause or reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 583-584. The crux of the court\u2019s proposed distinction, however, consists in its twin assertions that narcotics interdiction roadblocks, unlike operating while under the influence roadblocks, serve exclusively criminal justice goals and that the threat to the public from illegal drags, while admittedly serious, is less immediate and more tenuous than the threat to public safety posed by drunk drivers. See <em>ante </em>at 583-584. But such assertions overlook the magnitude of the contemporary social evils linked to the trafficking in and use of illegal drugs. Furthermore, experience tends to demonstrate that most people engaged in the illegal transportation of controlled substances are users themselves. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>cannot be doubted that the danger to the public arising from the operation of motor vehicles on the highways of the Commonwealth by intoxicated persons is the same regardless of the substances that caused their intoxication. In short, the court, it seems to me, has here fastened on a distinction that lacks a difference. Even more importantly, the court\u2019s reasoning today further illustrates how ephemeral a balancing approach is when founded on debatable and changeable evaluations of society\u2019s most pressing needs and problems and, therefore, how unsuitable it is as a touchstone for the reasonableness of a warrantless search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Because I see no principled distinction between operating while under the influence roadblocks and roadblocks designed to interdict illegal drugs or other contraband, I believe that they should be accorded equal treatment by this court. Absent probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, both forms of warrantless search and seizure should be held constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The court, however, rejected the \u201cless intrusive alternative\u201d requirement as unduly burdensome to government. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 166 (1988). Instead, the court substitutes adherence by law enforcement officials with the criteria established in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 143-144 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 347 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 164-165; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>398 Mass. 98, 99-101 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 87, 89-90 (1985). It has apparently been somehow overlooked that the less intrusive alternative requirement as a prerequisite to constitutional road blocks is a concept the court employed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 143-144. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 168.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
