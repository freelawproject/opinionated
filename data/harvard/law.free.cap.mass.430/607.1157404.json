L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking reinstatement of its appeal. A single justice of this court concluded that TIC was not entitled to extraordinary relief because it had an available means to obtain appellate review. TIC appealed from the judgment of the single justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">Bruce at Park Chiropractic Clinic (Bruce) brought an action against TIC under the small claims procedure, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, for failure to pay $395.90 for chiropractic services rendered to an insured of TIC, in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. After a hearing before a clerk-magistrate, judgment was entered for Bruce in the amount sought, plus costs. TIC did not appeal from that judgment to the jury session of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">Bruce subsequently filed a motion under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>seeking attorney\u2019s fees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $2,178. Following a hearing in the small claims session before a District Court judge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> judgment was entered for Bruce in the amount of $1,710. TIC filed a claim of appeal within the period prescribed by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 23, together with an affidavit of counsel stating that the appeal from the judgment awarding attorney\u2019s fees was \u201cintended in good faith, and that there are questions of fact and law requiring jury trial, specifically: The sufficiency and weight off <em>[sic] </em>the evidence to sustain a judgment on behalf of the plaintiff for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,710.\u201d TIC paid the appeal bond and the entry fee required by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 23, and the surcharge required by G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 4C. TIC also filed a separate claim of trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Bruce moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that there can be no jury trial as to the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>District Court judge allowed the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> TIC then filed its petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. TIC filed a timely appeal from the denial of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">TIC\u2019s claim that it was denied the right to appeal to the jury session of the District Court is without merit. Statute 1992, c. 379, An Act improving the administration and management of the judicial system of the Commonwealth, changed small claims procedure,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> effective January 1, 1994 (see St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 226), to provide for hearings by clerk-magistrates in the first instance,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with the express right of appeal by the defendant from an adverse finding by a magistrate to the jury-of-six session of the District Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no provision for an appeal from the findings of a judge sitting in a small claims session. As a general rule, an express inclusion of one thing in a statute is an implied exclusion of things not mentioned, unless the purpose of the statute would be frustrated. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 484 (1980), and cases cited. The plain language of \u00a7 23 suggests that the right of appeal to the jury session lies only from the findings of a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">This construction is consistent with the purpose of the statute, which is to provide \u201ca simple, informal and inexpensive procedure ... for the determination ... of claims in the nature of contract or tort, other than slander and libel, in which the plaintiff does not claim as debt or damages more than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>thousand dollars.\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 21, first par. When the Legislature passed the Court Reform Act, it simplified the small claims procedure by reducing the number of trials before a judge, or a judge with a jury, to one; and it minimized the cost of small claims litigation by making the first stage of the procedure more informal. When TIC submitted to a hearing before a judge on Bruce\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, it waived the right of appeal to the jury session. It was only entitled to one hearing before a judge, and it received that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">TIC was not without an appellate remedy. It could have requested that the hearing on attorney\u2019s fees be conducted by a clerk-magistrate and thereby preserve its right of appeal to the jury session and there have the question of attorney\u2019s fees decided by a judge without a jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under that course, appellate review is available when, in the opinion of the judge, \u201ca question of law requires review ... in the form of a report of a case stated, to the appellate division.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 23. TIC had a second appellate remedy. It could have requested a \u201ctransfer ... to the regular civil docket for formal hearing and determination\u201d on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 24. See also Rule 4 of the Uniform Small Claims Rules (1999). Appellate review from an adverse finding is thereafter available under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 108, 109. TIC pursued neither of those available remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We conclude that the single justice correctly denied TIC\u2019s petition for extraordinary relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, because alternative legal remedies were available. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Newton Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>416 Mass. 1006 (1993); <em>Soja </em>v. <em>T.P. Sampson Co., </em>373 Mass. 630, 631 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The subject of attorney\u2019s fees was raised in correspondence between counsel approximately four and one-half months before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The record is silent as to the reason a judge, and not the clerk-magistrate, conducted the hearing on attorney\u2019s fees. There is nothing in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, to suggest that a clerk-magistrate could not determine the question of attorney\u2019s fees. The statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cIn any case where benefits due and payable remain unpaid for more than thirty days, any unpaid party shall be deemed a party to a contract with the insurer responsible for payment and shall therefore have a right to commence an action in contract for payment of amounts therein determined to be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In any such action commenced in the district court in the judicial district in which the unpaid party resides, the court shall, upon the filing of an answer by the insurer and upon the motion of the unpaid party, advance the action for a speedy trial. If the unpaid party recovers a judgment for any amount due and payable by the insurer, the court shall assess against the insurer in addition thereto costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">There is no right to a jury trial for attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. Trial by jury in civil matters generally is available only in those cases provided for by the Massachusetts Constitution at the time it was adopted in 1780, or that arise therefrom. See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Jarvenpaa, </em>404 Mass. 177, 185-186 (1989). That is not the case here. Attorney\u2019s fees generally are not recoverable except in limited circumstances or where a statute so provides. See <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70 (1977), and cases cited. When allowable by statute, generally \u201cthey are more analogous to costs\u201d than to damages. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., </em>394 Mass. 270, 272 (1985). The Legislature may create a right of trial by jury for a new cause of action, including a claim for attorney\u2019s fees. Cf. <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 312 (1983). However, it did not create a right of trial by jury for attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>fees in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, but instead expressly left the question for determination by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The motion to dismiss was filed, heard, and decided in the small claims session; the case was never transferred to the jury session.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\">See St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7\u00a7 135-137.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\">General Laws c. 218, \u00a7 21, states in part: \u201cActions brought under [\u00a7\u00a7 21-25], inclusive, may be heard in the first instance by a clerk-magistrate of the district court department. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b635-13\">General Laws c. 218, \u00a7 23, states in part: \u201cA plaintiff beginning a cause under the procedure shall be deemed to have waived a trial by jury and any right of appeal to a jury of six session in the district court department. If, however, said cause shall be appealed to a jury of six session in the district court department by the defendant as hereinafter provided, the plaintiff shall have the same right to claim a trial by a jury of six.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">\u201cThe defendant may, within ten days after receipt of the <em>magistrate\u2019s </em>finding, file in the court where the cause was determined a claim of trial by jury, or in the alternative for a trial before a single justice and shall file his affidavit that there are questions of law and fact in the cause requiring a trial by jury or a single justice, with the specifications thereof, and that such trial is intended in good faith\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\">To the extent that Rule 10 (e) of the Uniform Small Claims Rules (1999) provides for an appeal to the Appeals Court from the jury session, it is in conflict with G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 23, which provides for the report of questions of law to the appellate division in certain circumstances. General Laws c. 211A, \u00a7 10, provides for an appeal from the appellate division to the Appeals Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
