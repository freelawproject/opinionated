We granted the plaintiff unions\u2019 application for direct appellate review, and we now affirm the commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The interveners, David Dupuis; Eleanor Dupuis; Betsy Ann Wood; Charles Cipollini; and Peter Anthony (collectively, teachers), all teach in school districts represented by the unions. None of the teachers is a member of the respective union representing teachers in the collective bargaining process. In 1989 and 1990, the teachers filed charges with the commission challenging the unions\u2019 1988-1989 agency fee demands as to amount and procedural compliance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of these complaints, the commission issued separate two-count complaints against each union alleging that each union violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12, by demanding an agency service fee without providing the teachers with an independent auditor\u2019s financial statement of its revenues and expenses for the relevant period and by demanding an excessive fee. The commission bifurcated these two counts and, following a hearing, concluded that the unions\u2019 failure to provide audited financial statements was in violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 12<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 10 <em>(b) </em>(l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result of this conclusion, the commission ordered the unions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dissolve the escrow fund in which the teachers\u2019 agency fees were being held, and return the withheld fees to the teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. The unions\u2019 agency fee demands for the years in question each included a letter stating that the fees were calculated using actual financial records of the particular local affiliate for the preceding school year. Each contained the following statement along with the respective treasurer\u2019s unnotarized signature: \u201cIn signing this form, I certify that the information contained herein is a true and accurate reflection of the [local union affiliate\u2019s] actual expenditures during the 1987-88 year to the best of my knowledge and ability. Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury.\u201d The demands also included an explanation of how the local affiliate calculated its share of the service fee, and a book entitled \u201cMTA and NBA Combined Agency Service Fee Information for 1988-89 and Related Information.\u201d This book contained audits by a certified public accountant of the local affiliates\u2019 parent associations (the National Education Association and the Massachusetts Teachers Association). None of the demands included independently audited financial statements for the local affiliate requesting payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">With regard to the years in question, the commission found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the following facts: The FEA had an approximate income of $29,000 and represented 185 employees, of whom seven were nonmembers. The BEA had an approximate income of $17,900, and represented 116 employees, including two nonmembers. The WEA\u2019s approximate income for those years was $9,400, and it represented 205 employees, including one nonmember. The local portion of the fees sought from nonmembers did not exceed $45.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The commission further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201cThere are three levels or kinds of service that an accountant or auditor can provide of an entity\u2019s financial statements: a compilation, a review and an audit. The purpose of these services is to determine and disclose the level of reliance which can be placed on an entity\u2019s financial statements. Each level of service consists of three components: a report, a set of financial statements, and notes accompanying the financial statements. Although the financial statements and accompanying notes are generally the same for each level of service, the report differs significantly depending on whether the service performed is a review, a compilation or an audit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201cA compilation is the lowest level of service and offers no assurance that the numbers listed in the financial statements are fairly stated. In a compilation, an accountant receives financial information from the management of an entity, reviews the figures for clerical errors and records the figures in the form of financial statements. The accountant may also discuss the accounting policy with management and try to identify any issues that were not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and issues a report. The accountant is not required to make inquiries or perform other procedures to verify, corroborate or review information supplied by the entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201cThe review is the next level of service in which an accountant performs limited testing of the figures listed on the financial statements using analytical procedures and inquiries of management. The objective of a review is to provide a reasonable basis for an accountant to express limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements. A review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>requires no actual testing of documentation. Instead, the accountant reviews the accounting books and journals and relies on verbal inquiries of management. Specifically, the accountant performs an analytical review of the listing of accounts at year end, as well as a comparative analysis from year to year to look for consistency or unusual changes. The accountant also compares actual results to the entity\u2019s budget. Depending on whether problems existed with the analysis, the accountant would look for schedules that were tied to the listing of accounts, i.e. at cash to see if a bank reconciliation was completed. Finally, the auditor generates the report, the financial statements, and the note disclosures. Because these procedures are used, the review is more reliable than a compilation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cThe audit is the highest level of service. The objective of the audit is to express an auditor\u2019s opinion on the extent to which the financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the entity\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cAn auditor employs the following procedure when performing an audit. First, the auditor reviews the entity\u2019s internal controls \u2014 its internal procedures and accounting system \u2014 to determine the level of risk and the auditor\u2019s level of reliance. Based on this information, the auditor determines which testing methodology to use, either the substantive approach or the compliance approach. In the substantive approach, the auditor places no reliance on internal controls and tests all the account balances in detail (over the materiality level) by physically viewing the supporting documentation. For example, the auditor could review every check and invoice written on a particular account to ensure that the amounts matched and proper approval process was followed, using their judgment to determine how many accounts to review. The auditor could also review leases to determine whether payment matched the lease agreement. Conversely, in the compliance approach the auditor relies on internal controls and tests the accounting cycles, thereby reducing the amount of substantive testing that would be necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cIn addition, the auditor completes the confirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>process by sending confirmation requests to banks (for loans or cash), or others for accounts receivable and accounts payable. Finally, the auditor considers, subsequent events, such as whether a loss of assets occurred after the fiscal period or whether litigation existed which would substantially change the financial picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201cThere are certain limitations inherent in the auditing process. For example, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) <em>Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards </em>provides in part that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201c \u2018Because of the characteristics of irregularities, particularly those involving forgery and collusion, a properly designed and executed audit may not detect a material irregularity. For example, generally accepted auditing standards do not require that an auditor authenticate documents, nor is the auditor trained to do so. Also, audit procedures that are effective for detecting a misstatement that is unintentional may be ineffective for a misstatement that is intentional and is concealed through collusion between client personnel and third parties or among management or employees or the client.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\"><em>Matter of Wareham Educ. Ass\u2019n, Bridgewater Educ. Ass\u2019n, Fairhaven Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>24 M.L.C. 23, 26-27 (1997). The commission noted that the cost of audits for local unions in Springfield, Chicopee, Newton, and Taunton ranged from $2,230.36 to $4,105. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">It is apparent from the commission\u2019s findings that, although there are inherent limitations, the audit provides significantly more verification and reliability than the other accounting options. It is also discernable that the cost of the audits would likely eclipse the agency fees \u25a0 available to the unions under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292, 310 (1986), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe constitutional<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requirements for the Union\u2019s collection of agency fees include an adequate explanation of the basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.\u201d In a much discussed footnote apparently intended to clarify what constitutes \u201cadequate disclosure,\u201d the Court stated that \u201c[t]he Union need not provide nonmembers with an exhaustive and detailed list of all its expenditures, but adequate disclosure surely would include the major categories of expenses, as well as verification by an independent auditor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The unions claim that, because the cost of an audit would be unduly burdensome to these relatively small local affiliates, the commission erred in refusing to recognize an exception to the constitutional requirement set forth in <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra. </em>The unions also contend that, even if no such exception exists, the commission exceeded its authority in issuing its remedial order that all funds should be returned to the dissenting teachers. We disagree and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">1. <em>Existence of small union exception to the audit requirement. </em>The unions primarily argue that they should be excused from having to provide independently audited financial statements with their fee demands. Despite urging us to adopt this exception the unions cite no authority suggesting that the Supreme Court did not mean exactly what it said in <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra. </em>Rather, the unions argue that such a requirement would make it impractical to collect the fees. It should be noted however that, although G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12, permits the collection of agency fees, it by no means requires them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently rejected with criticism the position the unions now urge us to adopt. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado, </em>177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>F.3d 1102, 1107-1108 (9th Cir. 1999). In that case, the local union affiliate was only slightly larger than the unions here. <em>Id. </em>at 1104. The Federal District Court had concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to an audit in light of the local affiliate\u2019s size, reasoning that it could \u201cnot accept plaintiffs\u2019 position that a union must choose between an audit it cannot afford on the one hand, or being required to countenance [compelled union representation of nonmembers without compensation] on the other.\u201d <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado, </em>915 F. Supp. 1080, 1090 n.15 (E.D. Cal. 1996). The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cWe do not see how a mere review of the union\u2019s records can offer the \u2018verification\u2019 that the Supreme Court and we have spoken of. Audits are often required in business and public arenas, where others seek assurance that the reviewed books of an organization really do reflect the concrete world transactions to which they refer. It is just \"that kind of assurance that nonmembers are entitled to, even though it may prove somewhat costly to obtain it. As the Second Circuit has pointed out, it is not a question of balancing the cost to the union against the First Amendment rights of the fee payers. \u2018Excessive cost cannot form the basis for allowing the union or the government to avoid <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>requirement that the procedures used by the union to allocate bargaining and administrative costs be carefully tailored to minimize the intrusion on nonmembers\u2019 rights.\u2019 <em>Andrews </em>[v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Cheshire, </em>829 F.2d 335, 339 (2d Cir. 1987)]. In short, a true audit was required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>Prescott </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado, supra </em>at 1107-1108. Although the court in <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Cheshire, supra </em>at 340 n.2, expressly declined to decide whether a small union\u2019s affairs could be so simple as to obviate the audit requirement, its reasoning adopted in <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado, supra, </em>certainly suggests how these courts would resolve the conflict before us in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Our own cases are in accord. In <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Society of Professors/Faculty Staff Union, </em>405 Mass. 56, 64 n.8 (1989), we stated quite unequivocally, <em>\u201cHudson </em>requires that the union\u2019s \u2018major categories of expenses\u2019 be listed \u2018as well as verification by an independent auditor. \u2019 <em>Chicago Teachers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307 n.18.\u201d We said nothing to suggest that the Supreme Court\u2019s footnote is to be read narrowly, but rather suggested that the requirement applies, generally, to all union agency fee demands. Furthermore, in <em>Belhumeur </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>411 Mass. 142, 145 (1991), cert, denied, 503 U.S. 1004 (1992), although we rejected the fee payers\u2019 reading of <em>Chicago Teachers, </em>we reaffirmed the requirement of audited verification of expenses, reasoning: \u201cAn audit of major categories of expenses should tend to assure nonmembers that the union indeed did incur the expenses on which the agency fee was based.\u201d We further pointed out that \u201c[t]he information that <em>the union must provide </em>under the <em>Hudson </em>opinion is not intended to be dispositive of any dispute. That information is designed only to permit an agency fee payer to decide whether to oblige the union to prove before an independent fact finder that the agency fee charged was properly determined\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 146. Thus, because the unions now before us were also parties in <em>Belhumeur, </em>we have previously acknowledged that they remain within the ambit of the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement that the verification of major expenses by an independent auditor is a prerequisite to demanding agency fees under statutes such as G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We see no basis for modifying the United States Supreme Court\u2019s express requirement that a union must accompany any demand for agency fees with an independently audited verification of its major expenses. <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307 n.18. Succinctly put, there is no exception to <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>audit requirement for small local union affiliates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">2. <em>Propriety of commission\u2019s remedy. </em>The unions next challenge the commission\u2019s remedial order compelling them to return the fees to the teachers absent an audit. They rely on a number of Federal cases for the proposition that such an order would result in a windfall to the teachers and deprive the unions of funds to which they are unquestionably entitled. See, e.g., <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>University of Cincinnati, </em>970 F.2d 1523, 1533-1534 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(6th Cir. 1992), cert, denied, 507 U.S. 917 (1993); <em>Lowary </em>v. <em>Lexington Local Bd. of Educ., </em>903 F.2d 422, 432-433 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 958 (1990); <em>Hohe </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>956 F.2d 399, 415-416 (3d Cir. 1992); <em>Gilpin </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>875 F.2d 1310, 1313-1316 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 917 (1989); <em>Laramie </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, </em>784 F. Supp. 1492, 1501-1502 (N.D. Cal. 1992). This reliance is misplaced. The unions refer only to cases in which the courts rejected dissenting nonmembers\u2019 claims to be excused from having to pay the agency fees even if a properly audited verification is supplied. As we interpret the commission\u2019s order, however, the unions are free to renew their demands for any fees to which they may be entitled once they comply with the requirements of <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1. </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra. </em>See <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>University of Cincinnati, supra </em>at 1534 (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument that denying full restitution would encourage unions to disregard <em>Hudson's </em>reasoning that \u201cby granting a preliminary injunction barring continuation of fee collecting when a defective notice has been sent, the courts have a quick and efficient remedy for such a <em>Hudson </em>violation\u201d); <em>Laramie </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra </em>at 1500 (permanently enjoining defendants from \u201ctaking any action to withhold fair-share fees from plaintiffs\u2019 salaries until defendants establish and implement adequate procedural safeguards as described in <em>Hudson\" </em>and its progeny).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Because it was proper in all respects, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Justice Fried participated in the deliberation on this case, but resigned before the opinion was issued.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Under G.

This is so because under the color of a State statute, nonmembers may be compelled against their wishes to associate with and perhaps to subsidize the union charged with representing nonmembers\u2019 interests in collective bargaining as a condition of public employment. <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra. </em>Nevertheless, the Court has approved the constitutionality of such arrangements in acknowledgment of the government\u2019s strong interest in labor peace, so long as fees collected represent only the union\u2019s costs incurred in the collective bargaining process, and are not directed toward promoting the union\u2019s political agenda. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In light of our conclusion that <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307 n.18, requires the unions to provide an independent audit in connection with a demand for agency fees, the unions\u2019 argument that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it declined to follow dicta from its decision in <em>Malden Educ.
