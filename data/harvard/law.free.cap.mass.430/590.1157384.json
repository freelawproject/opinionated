Two boys, one age fourteen years and seven months, and the other age fourteen years and eight months, were eighth grade students at the same school in Braintree at the relevant time. Both boys had lived with their parents since birth. On June 13, 1999, the father of a fellow student telephoned the home of one of the boys. He spoke with the boy\u2019s mother and told her that her son had been involved in the rape of his daughter earlier that day. The parents of both boys subsequently communicated with their sons relative to the incident. On June 14, the complainant\u2019s father met separately with each boy\u2019s father and discussed the incident. On June 15, the Braintree police initiated an investigation into the incident. On June 17, the Braintree police contacted the parents of one of the boys to ask whether their son would come to the police station to answer questions. The boy\u2019s parents stated that they wanted to get an attorney. That same day, both boys were arrested by the Braintree police as a result of the rape allegations. On June 18, the two boys were arraigned in the Quincy Division of the District Court Department on charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and battery, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On June 22, the district attorney for the Norfolk district subpoenaed both boys\u2019 parents to testify before the grand jury investigating the incident. The assistant district attorney indicated that she might ask questions at the hearing about the substance of communications the boys had with their parents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The boys and their parents moved in the Superior Court to quash the subpoenas, asserting a \u201cchild-parent privilege.\u201d The Superior Court judge denied the motions, noting that no such privilege currently exists in the Commonwealth. The Superior Court judge stayed enforcement of the subpoenas, however, so the parties could seek relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 28, the single justice reserved and reported the consolidated cases for a determination by the full court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petitioners now ask the court to recognize a testimonial privilege such that the parent of a minor child may not be compelled to testify, in criminal proceedings, as to \u201cconfidential communications\u201d from the minor child to the parent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth counters that, if the requested parent-child privilege is to be created, the Legislature is the appropriate body to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In <em>Three Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 357, 364 (1983) <em>(Three Juveniles), </em>noting that the creation of evidentiary privileges is most often left to the Legislature, we declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>create a testimonial disqualification for minor children subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury investigating the possible murder of a nonfamily member by their father, at least as to \u201cwhat the children may have seen and heard in nonconfiden-tial circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. We concluded that \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s interest in obtaining all relevant information concerning . . . [the crime charged] must predominate over generalizations favoring the preservation of the American family through barring a child from testifying about nonconfidential matters involving his or her parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because it was not presented on the record, we declined to rule on the question of privilege as to confidential communications between parent and child, stating that \u201cthe question of a testimonial privilege as to such communications can be raised and dealt with in the specific circumstances presented [when the minors appear to testify].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Subsequent to our decision, the Legislature enacted a testimonial disqualification for minor children. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Fourth, inserted by St. 1986, c. 145.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute prohibits minor children from testifying in criminal proceedings against natural or adoptive parents with whom the child resides, except when the victim of the crime also lives in the household and is a member of the parent\u2019s family. See <em>id. </em>The statute was enacted after various amendments, revisions, and a public hearing date, and the privilege that thus emerged had the benefit of public debate during its creation and definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The course we followed in <em>Three Juveniles </em>left the creation and definition of a broad, intrafamily testimonial privilege to legislative determination. We did so for good reason, and conclude that we should adhere, in the first instance, to that course in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">As we stated in <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 359, \u201c[testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>privileges \u2018are exceptions to the general duty imposed on all people to testify.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 5 (1982). <em>Matter of Pappas, </em>358 Mass. 604, 607-609 (1971), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665 (1972). Such privileges diminish the evidence before the court <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, supra), </em>and contravene the fundamental principle that \u2018the public . . . has a right to every man\u2019s evidence.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryan, 339 </em>U.S. 323, 331 (1950), quoting 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2192, at 64 (3d ed. 1940).\u201d Although we have the authority to create privileges, it is \u201ca power that we have exercised sparingly, and \u2018only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Babets </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>403 Mass. 230, 234 (1988), quoting <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 359-360. See <em>Matter of Pappas, supra </em>at 609 (court will create privilege only when harm done to society by suppression of evidence outweighed by \u201cbenefits to society in general accruing from the preservation of a confidential relationship\u201d). The question we must answer, therefore, when deciding whether we should recognize the requested privilege, is \u201cwhether the privilege against adverse [parent-child] testimony promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence in the administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The petitioners argue that creation of this privilege promotes sufficiently important interests, such as to outweigh the need for probative evidence, because it is necessary to preserve and protect the family. Not only is forcing parents to testify against their children repugnant to our society, they argue, but it also will cause a breakdown of trust in the home, ultimately discouraging parent-child communications. Although the preservation of family harmony and communication is a valuable social goal, and forced incrimination of a close relative may be uncomfortable, these feelings and beliefs alone do not necessarily require the creation of a testimonial privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">To our knowledge, only one appellate court, with the authority to create privileges,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has considered whether a parent of an unemancipated minor child may be compelled to testify as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>confidential communications received from that child, in the context of criminal proceedings against that child, and reached a conclusion that a privilege did exist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions that have considered whether a parent-child privilege exists as to communications with adult children unanimously have rejected recognition of such a privilege, often expressing doubts about the privilege, or its absence, and its actual effect on parent-child communications, or have deferred to their respective Legislatures.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And while commentators generally have favored creation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>of some such privilege, they have usually proposed legislative solutions, some of which vary widely in their scope and duration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Deferring initially to the legislative process in this instance would accord with our general deference to the Legislature in the area of testimonial privileges. See <em>Babets </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., supra </em>at 234 (stating that we have \u201cconsistently concluded that the creation of such privileges ordinarily is better left to the Legislature\u201d). See also <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 360. Indeed, the vast majority of evidentiary privileges have been created by the Legislature. See <em>Babets </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., supra </em>at 235.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, our deference to the Legislature on this privilege is particularly compelling because the decision whether to create the requested privilege necessarily depends on balancing vital, yet competing, social policies. Assuming that such a privilege would protect and promote family harmony and communication, this interest must be balanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>against the interest in the ascertainment of truth and the just resolution of cases. In most instances, the balancing of such important and competing social interests is better left to elected representatives.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Likewise, once the broad social policy balancing is completed and a decision to create a testimonial privilege is made, the definition of that privilege will require extensive line drawing. Many sensitive subissues will need to be decided \u2014 issues such as who will hold the privilege<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; who would determine whether a child should waive the privilege; whether biological, adoptive, foster, and de facto parents will be included; the age of the child to whom the privilege will extend; should there be any exceptions for crimes such as child abuse or intrafamily violence; when would the right commence; which conversations or activities would be privileged. As these questions illustrate, the creation and definition of a parent-child privilege is a complex task, necessitating not just the broad consideration and balancing of competing social goals involved in deciding whether to create the privilege, but also requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the delicate consideration and balancing that is involved in defining the contours of such a privilege. In contrast to the judiciary, the Legislature would have available a whole array of resources and would be able to consider factors and circumstances that we may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The petitioners argue that in this case we should not await legislative action because the Legislature has already indicated a clear intent to protect families.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the petitioners that statutes such as G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4 (exempting spouses, children, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren from prosecution as accessory after fact); G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20 (providing testimonial privilege in certain circumstances for spouses and minor children); and G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 55, 55A, 58, 67 (requiring parent or guardian notification and involvement in various juvenile delinquency proceedings), indicate a Legislative acknowledgment that families serve a special role in society and deserve unique protections. Contrary to the petitioners, however, we interpret the existence of these statutes to demonstrate that the Legislature is aware of and actively involved in the issues facing families today and that it is the appropriate body, in the first instance, to address whether and how any intrafamily testimonial privilege is to be created. Moreover, while we agree that the Legislature has indicated a special aim to protect children who have been accused of a crime and are involved in the juvenile justice system, the Legislature has also indicated an intent to protect children, such as the complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>from abuse in general and sexual assault in particular.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Resolution and harmonization of these conflicting legislative policies belongs, in the first instance, to the Legislature, and we therefore decline to announce today the broad privilege requested by the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In order to afford the Legislature an opportunity to address the issue, the stay on the subpoenas is continued until the conclusion of the January, 2000, legislative session. This stay is only effective insofar as the subpoenas relate to confidential communications between the juveniles and their parents. In the interim, the parents are required to appear before the grand jury and answer all questions unrelated to the substance or circumstances of the confidential communications. If the Legislature has not acted within the above time frame, the petitioners shall be afforded an opportunity to raise and argue in Superior Court any constitutional claims surrounding their confidential communications.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-16\">We note at the outset that the petitioners have made no arguments that recognition of a privilege in these circumstances is required in order to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the constitutional rights of the juveniles. Such a case would necessarily be on a different footing and would be decided under different standards.

P. 4 (b), as amended, 378 Mass. 928 (1979). Because this matter is of such significance, however, and because the Commonwealth explicitly waived this issue, we heard the case prior to such an adjudication. See Mass. R. A. P. 2, 365 Mass. 845 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\">More particularly, one of the parents asks us to recognize a \u201cparent-child privilege as to confidential communications of a minor child living in the home of his natural parent when the child has been accused of a crime.\u201d She does not specify who should hold the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The other parents ask us to recognize a privilege that \u201cparents of an un-emancipated minor child residing with them may not be compelled to testify concerning confidential communications in the context of criminal proceedings against the minor child,\u201d and that the child should be allowed to assert the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Although the petitioners now request a privilege only as to confidential communications, their prior actions indicate that they were previously seeking a much broader privilege \u2014 a privilege not to appear or testify at all. We take the petitioners\u2019 requests at face value and will decide the issue of privilege as to confidential communications. We do note, however, that unless disqualified, when subpoenaed, witnesses are required to appear before a tribunal and assert privilege in response to particular questions.

Subsequent decisions by two New York trial courts considering whether a privilege extended to communications with adult children or to a non-parent have resulted in varying results as to who is the holder of the privilege, who qualifies as a child, and who qualifies as a \u201cparent.\u201d See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>101 Misc. 2d 712, 713-717 (N.Y.

Rev. 127 (1991), quoting 23 C.A. Wright &amp; K.W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5422, at 673-674 (1980) (\u201cIn a society with egalitarian pretensions, the creation and justification of a privilege to refuse to respond to a judicial inquiry is essentially a political question; i.e., it is an allocation of the power as between the various components of the society\u201d). Also, as we previously noted in <em>Ba-bets </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., supra </em>at 235 n.6, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders, 99 </em>Ill. 2d 262, 271 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cThe expansion of existing testimonial privileges and acceptance of new ones involves a balancing of public policies which should be left to the legislature. A compelling reason is that while courts, as institutions, find it easy to perceive value in public policies such as those favoring the admission of all relevant and reliable evidence which directly assist the judicial function of ascertaining the truth, it is not their primary function to promote policies aimed at broader social goals more distantly related to the judiciary. This is primarily the responsibility of the legislature. To the extent that such policies conflict with truth-seeking or other values central to the judicial task, the balance that courts draw might not reflect the choice the legislature would make.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">See <em>In re Grand Jury, </em>103 F.3d 1140, 1153-1154 (3d Cir. 1997) (noting that basis for the privilege, assurance of confidentiality to encourage children to communicate with their parents, is destroyed if it is waivable at the parent\u2019s option, and it would be intolerable State intrusion into family life if the privilege operated to silence parent when parent wished to testify).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Pointing to case law and statutes, the petitioners also argue that, because parental participation is often required in juvenile criminal matters, creation of this privilege is urgently needed in order to protect the integrity of the juvenile justice system. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A </em>Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128, 134-135 (1983) (juvenile entitled to \u201cmeaningful consultation\u201d with interested adult before waiver of rights is effective); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 55 (requiring summons to issue to at least one parent of juvenile brought before court); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 55A (requiring representation by counsel, or written waiver of counsel signed by parent or guardian, before juvenile may waive right to jury trial). Whether a parent or guardian serving in any of the above capacities could be required to answer, over the objection of the child, questions concerning the substance of conversations with a child pursuant to those obligations, is a question not presented on this record and one we do not address today. We note that, at a minimum, such questioning would raise serious issues regarding the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Compare G.
