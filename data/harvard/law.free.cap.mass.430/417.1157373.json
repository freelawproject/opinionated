G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 <em>2 (a). </em>The union claims that the judge\u2019s decision regarding the timeliness of the grievance was a ruling on \u201cprocedural\u201d rather than \u201csubstantive\u201d arbitrability in violation of the plain meaning of G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (a), settled State and Federal law, and public policy. The union also disputes the judge\u2019s finding of fact regarding the timeliness of the grievance. We granted the union\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and we affirm the decision of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>Paul Loranger and Thomas Stefanik (grievants) were fire fighters who had been employed by the city of Chicopee (city). Each suffered what were eventually ruled to be work-related injuries rendering them incapable of performing their duties as fire fighters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the two griev-ants were absent from work, before a determination that the injuries were work-related, the city did not place them on injured leave, but charged their absences to their accumulated sick or vacation leave.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Loranger claims that he questioned Chief Robert Nunes about the coverage and was told that the city would reimburse him for the sick leave when it was clear that Loranger\u2019s injury was work-related. The city granted the grievants\u2019 work-related disability retirements on November 22, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The grievants were members of the union which had a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) with the city. Article 25.05 of the agreement requires the city to compensate retiring fire fighters \u201cfor accumulated unused sick leave credited to their account [according to a formula].\u201d When the grievants retired, their compensation did not include reimbursement for the sick (or vacation) leave they used to cover their absences from work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Article 5.01 of the agreement provides for a final and binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>arbitration when grievances remain unresolved \u201cas to the meaning, application or interpretation of this Agreement relating to wages, hours, standards of productivity or performance or other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d On January 27, 1997, sixty-seven days after the grievants retired, the union filed grievances on their behalf arguing that the grievants should have been reimbursed for the sick or vacation leave they used during their work-related illness. The city refused either to proceed with the grievances or to allow them to be submitted to arbitration. The union then moved to compel the city to arbitrate, pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The city argued that the agreement\u2019s arbitration clause did not apply to this case for two reasons. First, it argued that, because the grievants were retired when the grievances were filed, they were no longer members of the union and thus not covered by the agreement. Second, the city claimed that the union\u2019s grievance was not timely because it was not filed within seventy-five days of the date the grievants became aware of a grievance, as required by the agreement. The city maintained that the grievances arose while the grievants were being denied injured leave. The city stated that the union had to file grievances within seventy-five days of the date they were first denied injured leave, not when they received their retirement compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">A Superior Court judge ruled that the union did have standing to sue under the agreement on behalf of retired employees because the grievances arose while the grievants were members of the union. The judge then ruled that the city could not be compelled to arbitrate over these particular claims because the grievances were not timely. The judge found that the grievants were aware or should have been aware that they had a grievance long before they retired.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge rejected the union\u2019s estoppel argument as to the issue of Chief Nunes\u2019s assurances to Loranger that the city would reimburse him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>The statute applicable to this case, G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (a), states that, if one party to a collective bargaining agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ment refuses to arbitrate, the aggrieved party may request a court order to arbitrate, and \u201c[t]he court shall order arbitration unless (1) the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate; or (2) the claim sought to be arbitrated does not state a controversy covered by the provision for arbitration; provided, that an order for arbitration shall not be refused where a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the arbitration provision is itself made subject to arbitration .... In either event the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of the issue so raised and shall, if it finds for the applicant, order arbitration; otherwise, the application shall be denied.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In applying this and other provisions of the labor statute, Massachusetts courts have looked to a series of United States Supreme Court cases for guiding principles, including <em>AT&amp;T Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Workers, </em>475 U.S. 643 (1986) <em>(AT&amp;T); United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593 (1960); <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574 (1960); and <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564 (1960).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (The latter are collectively known as the \u201cSteelworkers Trilogy.\u201d) See, e.g., <em>Old Rochester Regional Teacher\u2019s Club </em>v. <em>Old Rochester Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em>398 Mass. 695, 700 (1986); <em>School Comm, of Southbridge </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>375 Mass. 502, 504 (1978); <em>School Comm, of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 113 (1977); <em>Mugnano-Bornstein </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 351 (1997); <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Local 455, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">These United States Supreme Court decisions have established a set of principles governing arbitration that are most clearly set out in <em>AT&amp;T, supra. </em>The first principle is that \u201carbitration is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, quoting <em>United. Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., supra </em>at 582. See <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 547 (1964); <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>372 Mass. 605, 613 (1977), citing <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Lynn Hosp., </em>364 Mass. 502 (1974) (\u201cthere is an understandable attitude of wariness about arbitration forced on a party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The second principle is that the question whether an agreement creates a duty to arbitrate is \u201cundeniably an issue for judicial determination . . . [ujnless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.\u201d <em>AT&amp;T, supra </em>at 649, citing <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., supra </em>at 582-583, and cases cited. The courts determine whether a contract to arbitrate exists partly because of contract law and partly because of a public policy favoring arbitration. \u201cThe willingness of parties to enter into agreements [to arbitrate] would be \u2018drastically reduced,\u2019 however, if a labor arbitrator had the \u2018power to determine his own jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>AT&amp;T, supra </em>at 651, quoting Cox, Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1509 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The third principle is that, \u201cin deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration, a court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims . . . [including] determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.\u201d <em>AT&amp;T, supra </em>at 649-650, quoting <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>American Mfg. Co., supra </em>at 568. The final principle is that, \u201cwhere the contract contains an arbitration clause, there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that \u2018[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage . . . Such a presumption is particularly applicable where the clause is . . . broad\u201d (emphasis added). <em>AT&amp;T, supra </em>at 649, quoting <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., supra </em>at S82-583.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The provisions of G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (a), embody these principles because a court must order arbitration, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>under two conditions that reflect concerns over contract principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">For this case, it is important to note that the Steelworkers Trilogy and the <em>AT&amp;T </em>case all involved very broad arbitration clauses. A broad arbitration clause is known as a standard arbitration clause<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which essentially states that \u201call disputes\u201d regarding the agreement are subject to arbitration. See <em>AT&amp;T, supra </em>at 645 n.l (\u201cany differences arising with respect to the interpretation of this contract or . . . any obligation\u201d [unless excluded]); <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 594 (1960) (\u201cany differences \u2018as to the meaning and application\u2019 of the agreement\u201d); <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., supra </em>at 576 (\u201c[s]hould differences arise ... as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement\u201d); <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>American Mfg. Co., supra </em>at 565 &amp; n.l (\u201call disputes between the parties \u2018as to meaning, interpretation and application of the provisions of this agreement\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Cape Cod Gas Co. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers, Local 13507, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 262 (1975), quoting <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>American Mfg. Co., supra. </em>The principles established by the Steelworkers Trilogy and the <em>AT&amp;T </em>case lead us to conclude that, where the arbitration clause is not broad, courts must be sure that the parties contracted to arbitrate the issue at hand. See <em>AT&amp;T, supra </em>at 648, 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In this case, the union seeks to minimize the issue of the breadth of the arbitration clause and argues that it has not found any case which focused on this issue. We disagree with the union\u2019s contention that State and Federal courts do not base their decisions on the scope of the arbitration clause. Further, none of the cases the union relies on supports its contention. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The reason courts have not focused on the scope of the arbitration clause is precisely because the arbitration agreements were broad enough to allow the courts to find a contract to arbitrate. For example, the union cites <em>Bartley, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jefferson Parish Sch. Bd., </em>302 So. 2d 280 (La. 1974), but there the court first inquired whether there was an agreement to arbitrate. <em>Id. </em>at 281. The court concluded there was an agreement to arbitrate because there was a broad arbitration clause covering \u201c[a]ll claims, disputes and other matters . . . arising out of, or relating to, this Contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. Once it concluded there was an agreement to arbitrate the court allowed procedural issues to be considered by the arbitrator. Similarly, a New York court said in <em>City Sch. Dist. of Poughkeepsie </em>v. <em>Poughkeepsie Pub. Sch. Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>35 N.Y.2d 599, 607 (1974), that, although the arbitration clause at issue was not \u201c \u2018broad . . . nonetheless, it contemplates arbitration as \u2018to the interpretation and the application of the provisions of this agreement insofar as the same may be necessary for a determination of the grievance.\u2019 Since the 10-day limitation of time is found in a provision of the agreement, it would seem that a decision as to its application would be procedurally necessary to a determination of the grievance here.\u201d See <em>Lewiston Firefighters Ass\u2019n, Local 785 </em>v. <em>Lewiston, </em>354 A.2d 154, 164 (Me. 1976) (\u201c[a]ll claims, demands, disputes . . . arising under, out of or in connection with . . . this agreement\u201d); <em>Union County Sch. Dist. No. 1 </em>v. <em>Valley Inland Pac. Constructors, Inc., </em>59 Or. App. 602, 608 (1982) (all claims and disputes within certain limits); <em>Local Div. No. 812 of Clarksburg, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Central W. Va. Transit Auth., </em>179 W. Va. 31, 33 n.l, 35 (1987) (\u201c[a]ll grievances\u201d \u201cbroad\u201d language; thus employee\u2019s discharge falls within terms and conditions provision of agreement).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court ruled in <em>International Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local 150 </em>v. <em>Flair Bldrs., Inc., </em>406 U.S. 487 (1972), that the broad nature of an arbitration clause, which stated that \u201cany difference\u201d between the parties would be subject to arbitration, allowed a loches defense to be decided by the arbitrator. <em>Id. </em>at 488. \u201cThere is nothing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>limit the sweep of this language or to except any dispute or class of disputes from arbitration. <em>In that circumstance, </em>we must conclude that the parties meant what they said \u2014 that \u2018any difference,\u2019 which would include the issue of loches . . . should be referred to the arbitrator . . .\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In this case, however, the arbitration clause cannot be called broad because it contains words of limitation. Article 5.01 defines grievance as \u201ca complaint as to the meaning, application or interpretation of the Agreement <em>relating to wages, hours, standards of productivity or performance or other terms and conditions of </em>employment\u201d (emphasis added). Further, art. 5.06 states that, while the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding, \u201cthe arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Because of the words of limitation contained in the agreement, the question before us is whether the seventy-five day filing deadline falls within the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d portion of the arbitration clause. We conclude that it does not. The opinions which have addressed terms and conditions of employment apply the phrase to concrete issues about the way an employer interacts with its employees on the job. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 178 (1997) (terms and conditions encompass matters arising between employer and employee). See also <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Lynn Hosp., </em>364 Mass. 502, 508 (1974) (agency service fee for nurses who did not join union part of terms and conditions of employment); <em>School Comm. of Medford </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 140 (1979) (health and life insurance within terms and conditions under statute). Cf. <em>West Bridgewater Police Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 550 (1984) (unscheduled overtime not term of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The union asks that we read G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 <em>(a), </em>differently, and conclude that it limits a court\u2019s review of issues to those of \u201csubstantive arbitrability.\u201d It requests that we look at the underlying claim for sick time reimbursement the two griev-ants have, and conclude that it is that \u201cclaim\u201d that is covered by the arbitration agreement and thus it cannot be denied arbitration under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (a). However, even the union admits that the dispute is not whether the underlying claim is arbitrable. The dispute revolved around the city\u2019s claims that these particular grievances were not arbitrable because of un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>timeliness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The city\u2019s claim is, essentially, that it did not contract to arbitrate these particular grievances. We conclude it is proper for a court to consider timeliness when the level of inquiry is whether there was a contract to arbitrate a particular grievance. See <em>School Comm. of Southbridge </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>375 Mass. 502, 504 (1978) (proper function of court is to determine whether parties agreed to arbitrate <em>particular </em>dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The union urges us to adopt a broad based rule that would categorize any timeliness issue as a \u201cprocedural\u201d issue always subject to arbitration. The union claims that its proposed rule, encompassed in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 <em>(a), </em>is the rule the United States Supreme Court set out in <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 557 (1964), and is indorsed by most States. The union further claims that <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Local 455, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (1989), on which the judge relied, was incorrectly decided by the Appeals Court because it did not indorse the <em>Wiley </em>approach. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The union is correct that G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 1, demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to have parties resolve grievances through arbitration. But the plain language of G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (a), does not require that all procedural issues are a question for the arbitrator. The two statutory provisions properly balance concern for contract law with a policy favoring arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We also do not accept the union\u2019s assertion, based on <em>Wiley, </em>that the procedural rule it proposes is in keeping with Federal law. <em>Wiley </em>did not adopt a blanket rule that <em>all </em>procedural issues are a matter for the arbitrator. In <em>Wiley, </em>a union had an agreement with one company at the time it merged with Wiley. The question before the United States Supreme Court was whether Wiley, as the successor company, could be bound by the agreement and required to arbitrate, pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The Court ruled that union rights survived the merger. <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, supra </em>at 549-551. There was a procedural issue tied up with the substance of the agreement and the Court ruled that, if the two were tied together, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>then it made no sense to separate them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the Court also said, <em>\u201c\\o]nce it is determined </em>[by the court] <em>that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration, </em>\u2018procedural\u2019 questions which <em>grow out of the dispute </em>and bear on the final disposition should be left to the arbitrator\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Not only did <em>Wiley </em>not establish a blanket rule that all procedural issues must be decided by an arbitrator, but also, in <em>International Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local 150 </em>v. <em>Flair Bldrs., Inc., </em>406 U.S. 487 (1972), the United States Supreme Court declined an opportunity to extend the rule favoring arbitration to a case with facts similar to this case. There a company tried to prevent an order compelling arbitration by arguing loches. The union had waited over five years before filing a grievance when the agreement said that grievances should be filed within forty-eight hours after a dispute was not settled. <em>Id. </em>at 489. The union urged the Court to decide that, even if the parties had \u201cnot agreed to arbitrate the loches issue, <em>Wiley </em>requires that the arbitrator resolve the question as an integral part of the underlying contract <em>dispute.\u201d.Id. </em>at 490-491. The Court declined to create such a rule: \u201cWe need not reach the question posed by petitioner, for we find that the parties did in fact agree to arbitrate the issue of loches here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In this case, the union also argues that virtually every State except Maryland indorses the union\u2019s version of the <em>Wiley </em>rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The union cites a myriad of State court decisions from other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>jurisdictions without distinguishing the breadth of the arbitration clause at issue. Our examination of cases cited by the union reveals that, while it is true that the cases do cite <em>Wiley </em>for the proposition that procedural issues should be decided by an arbitrator, most cases involved broad arbitration clauses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 959 </em>v. <em>King, </em>572 P.2d 1168, 1171 (Alaska 1977) (any grievance); <em>Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen.

One case involved a vaguely worded procedural deadline. See <em>Boys Club of San Fernando Valley, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>6 Cal. App. 4th 1266, 1275 (1992) (notice of demand within \u201creasonable time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Given the significant distinction between narrow and broad arbitration clauses, we also disagree with the union that <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Local 455, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (1989) <em>(MMWEC), </em>was improperly decided. <em>MMWEC </em>also involved a timeliness issue. The Appeals Court inferred a narrow arbitration clause because the \u201cdefendant made no argument in the Superior Court or in [the Appeals Court] that the [agreement] contained a provision for arbitration of disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The agreement in <em>MMWEC </em>did contain an arbitration clause that outlined a grievance process and contained an explicitly worded waiver clause: \u201cNo matter <em>will be submitted </em>to an impartial arbitrator after sixty-five (65) days from the date of the incident. <em>Should either party fail to complete its steps in the grievance procedure, that party waives its rights to invoke arbitration.\u201d Id. </em>The Appeals Court relied on this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Old Rochester Regional Teacher\u2019s Club </em>v. <em>Old Rochester Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>398 Mass. 695, 700 (1986), and <em>School Comm, of Southbridge </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>375 Mass. 502, 504 &amp; n.2 (1978), to conclude that, because the agreement did not contain a provision concerning the interpretation or application of the arbitration clause itself, it was for the judge to decide whether there had been compliance with time constraints. <em>MMWEC, supra </em>at 922.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Here the arbitration clause contains words of limitation that leave to the court rather than the arbitrator the task of determining whether the city contracted to arbitrate the meaning of the seventy-five day limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The union raises concerns about the impact of our decision. Those concerns are unfounded. Our approach is a balance between contract concerns and a policy favoring arbitration. The approach allows arbitration where the clause is broad and denies it when the parties have contracted to limit the scope of arbitration. By this balanced approach, we differentiate from the Maryland rule which is to make all procedural issues a matter for the court, even when there are broad arbitration clauses. See <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>v. <em>Pessoa Constr. Co., </em>330 Md. 744 (1993); <em>Frederick Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bel Pre Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>274 Md. 307, 314 (1975).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The union argues that, even if we conclude that the language of G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (a), allows the court to decide the issue of timeliness, we should nevertheless overturn the judge\u2019s decision to reject the union\u2019s estoppel argument. The union argues that our principle of disfavoring estoppel against public officials, relied on by the judge in his decision, is inapplicable here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>because previous decisions were concerned with negating the requirements of statutes designed to protect the public interest. See <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>387 Mass. 687, 693 (1982) (court will not apply estoppel against public entities where to do so would negate requirements of laws protecting public interest); A <em>P East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Westborough, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 913-914 (1996), and cases cited (estoppel against public officials disfavored where reliance was on oral statement and statute set deadline for tax abatement application). The union\u2019s argument that there is no public interest to protect in this case, even if correct, is beside the point. There was ample support for the judge\u2019s findings that both grievants were aware or should have been aware that they had grievances when the city refused to treat the absences as injured leave, not when the grievants retired. In addition the judge found that neither party addressed the issue whether Chief Nunes had the authority to make such assurances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Because we conclude that the language of the arbitration clause excludes the issue of timeliness, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Loranger was unable to work after November, 1995; Stefanik, after July, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">According to art. 25.01 of the collective bargaining agreement (agreement) if the city had placed the fire fighters on injured leave, the leave would have been covered by the city and the grievants would not have used their sick or vacation leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The agreement does not contain a provision requiring the city to pay retirees for unused vacation leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">For Loranger, it was one full year before he retired, and for Stefanik it was more than five years before he retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The judge noted that neither party had addressed whether Nunes had the authority to make decisions about restoring leave and cited <em>A P East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Westborough, </em>40 Mass.

The case is not on point because it dealt not only with a court review of an arbitrator\u2019s <em>award, </em>but also with the fact that the city of Des Moines had voluntarily submitted the grievance issue to arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>the city contended that it did not have to arbitrate because retirees were not covered under the agreement. We also note that we do not agree with the union\u2019s contention that timeliness was not effectively raised by the city. The union claims that the city briefed only the retirement argument. However, the city did raise the issue in its answer as an affirmative defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 555-557 &amp; n.ll (1964), the grievance process entailed three steps, the last being to have the issue heard by an arbitrator. There was a clause in the agreement stating that failure to follow the procedures within a certain time limit resulted in an abandonment of the grievance. The procedural issue to which the <em>Wiley </em>court referred was whether the union was barred from grieving before an arbitrator because it had not followed the first two steps. The union argued that following the first two steps was futile because the new company had refused \u201cto recognize the Union\u2019s representative status,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 557, where meeting with the union was an integral part of the initial steps. It was in this context that the Court ruled that the procedural issue was one for the arbitrator to decide. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The union also cites a number of Federal decisions to support its position.
