We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"ApN\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AB1h\">In 1983, Anthony Celeste claimed entitlement to disability benefits under the Social Security Act. After three unsuccessful proceedings before administrative law judges and the Social Security Administration Appeals Council (\u201cAppeals Council\u201d), Celeste sought judicial review in the district court. Shortly after Celeste commenced the action in federal court, the Appeals Council determined Celeste required further medical testing; and the district court remanded the case to the Social Security Administration for further proceedings. The administrative law judge recommended a finding of disability for the period September 1980 through September 1985 because of Celeste\u2019s mental impairment. The Appeals Council affirmed that finding, and the district court entered a final judgment validating Celeste\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>for benefits. Celeste filed a petition for costs and attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court awarded to Celeste costs in the amount of $198.00 and attorney fees in the amount of $18,881.25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 734 F.Supp. 1009. The Secretary appeals the award of attorney fees, urging that the Equal Access to Justice Act permits no awards of attorney fees to pro se litigants. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kay v. Ehrler, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 1435, 1436, 113 L.Ed.2d 486 (1991), held that pro se litigants who are also lawyers are entitled to no award of attorney fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The Court in <em>Kay </em>noted the broad agreement among the circuits \u201con the proposition that a pro se litigant who is <em>not </em>a lawyer is <em>not </em>entitled to attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and stated that the cases so holding were correctly decided. <em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 111 S.Ct. at 1436-37. The Court reasoned that \u201cCongress contemplated an <em>attorney-client relationship </em>as the predicate for an award under \u00a7 1988\u201d and that a rule authorizing \u201cawards of counsel fees to pro se litigants ... would create a disincentive to employ counsel whenever such a plaintiff considered himself competent to litigate on his own behalf. The statutory policy of furthering the successful prosecution of meritorious claims is better served by a rule that creates an incentive to retain counsel in every such case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at - -, 111 S.Ct. at 1437-38 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-14\">The Equal Access to Justice Act is the \u201ccounterpart to \u00a7 1988 for violation of federal rights by federal employees.\u201d <em>West Virginia Univ. Hosps. Inc. v. Casey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 1142, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991). The fee shifting provisions in section 1988 and in the EAJA serve the same purposes. <em>See Crooker v. E.P.A., </em>763 F.2d 16, 17 (1st Cir.1985) (finding no fundamental difference between purposes of EAJA and Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act). So, we believe the principles announced in <em>Kay </em>apply with equal force to preclude attorney fees awards to pro se litigants under the Equal Access to Justice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-17\">Today\u2019s decision agrees with other circuits that have addressed this issue, each of which has held that pro se litigants are unentitled to attorney fees under the EAJA. <em>See Naekel v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>845 F.2d 976 (Fed.Cir.1988); <em>Merrell v. Block, </em>809 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Crooker v. E.P.A., </em>763 F.2d at 17 (1st Cir.1985). Our ruling is also consistent with our earlier decisions finding attorney fees unavailable to pro se litigants under analogous federal fee shifting statutes. <em>See Cofield v. City of Atlanta, </em>648 F.2d 986, 987-88 (5th Cir.1981) (\u00a7 1988); <em>Clarkson v. IRS, </em>811 F.2d 1396, 1397 n. 2 (11th Cir.1987) (Privacy Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-18\">Celeste argues that our ruling in <em>Jean v. Nelson, </em>863 F.2d 759 (11th Cir.1988), compels us to affirm. In <em>Jean, </em>we affirmed an award of attorney fees consisting in part of time spent by law clerks and paralegals performing work traditionally done by an attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 778. Celeste insists that <em>Jean </em>authorizes attorney fees awards under the EAJA not only to licensed attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>neys, but to \u201canyone who fulfills the role of an attorney,\u201d including pro se litigants. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 19. We reject this argument. In <em>Jean, </em>there was an attorney-client relationship to serve as a basis for a fee award: the plaintiffs were represented by counsel, who employed the clerks and paralegals involved. Our ruling in <em>Jean </em>simply encourages economy in litigation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and it is fully consistent with Congress\u2019 intention that fee shifting provisions \u201ccreate an incentive to retain counsel in every case.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 1438.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">For the reasons above, we reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees to appellee Celeste.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1148-12\">. The Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-13\">\"... [A] court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action ... including proceedings for judicial review of agency action ... brought by or against the United States ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-21\">... \"fees and other expenses\u201d includes ... reasonable attorney fees....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-19\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1148-20\">. Celeste appeared pro se during the third administrative proceeding and in his appeal to the district court. The district court calculated the award to Celeste based on the hours of work he performed (251.75) multiplied by an hourly rate of $75.00, for a total of $18,881.25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AxmP\">. We explained our affirmance of attorneys fees awards reimbursing counsel for law clerk and paralegal time in pragmatic terms, but in no way suggested that fees would be proper in the absence of an attorney-client relationship: \"To [deny reimbursement for clerk and paralegal time] would be counterproductive because excluding reimbursement for such work might encourage attorneys to handle entire cases themselves, thereby achieving the same results at a higher overall cost.\u201d <em>Jean, </em>863 F.2d at 778.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
