JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Appellant Danny Craig, recently a candidate for constable in Precinct 4 of Gregg County, Texas, challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to award him attorneys\u2019 fees for prosecuting a Voting Rights Act case against the County. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1971, 1973. Craig\u2019s lawsuit was filed only two weeks before the scheduled March, 1992 primary election and after the County had filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking approval of its decennial redistricting plan. We hold that under the circumstances of this case, although Gregg County reconfigured Craig\u2019s Constable precinct (in a way that Craig approves), its action responded not to Craig\u2019s lawsuit but to objections lodged by the Justice Department during the District of Columbia lawsuit. Craig was therefore not a \u201cprevailing plaintiff\u201d and was not entitled to claim attorneys\u2019 fees from the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">Following the release of 1990 census data, Gregg County prepared a revised redistricting plan for its County constable precincts and submitted the plan to the Justice Department for Voting Rights Act preclearance in early September, 1991. Voting Rights Act \u00a7 5, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c. The Justice Department failed to act on the plan within 60 days, as ordinarily required by the statute. As the March 10, 1992 primary elections approached, the County was growing impatient with the Justice Department\u2019s delay, which threatened the possibility that an unprecleared election would be declared illegal. <em>See Chisom v. Roemer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 2367-68, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991). Consequently, on February 24, 1992, the County filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaratory judgment that the 1991 redistricting plan was free from racially discriminatory purpose and effect. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-20\">Three days later, appellant Craig filed suit in federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that the constable precinct districts adopted by Gregg County for the 1992 primary election violated the United States Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. Appellant moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the primary election from taking place, but after a hearing, the district court denied this relief. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>court noted that Craig\u2019s delay in filing his lawsuit made an injunction on the eve of the election inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">A week after the election, the U.S. Department of Justice objected under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act to the County\u2019s proposed redistricting plan. Gregg County responded to the objection and revised the redistricting plan accordingly, resubmitting it about a month after learning of the objection. The Department of Justice then precleared the redistricting plan. Because of these events, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia promptly entered a stipulated order of dismissal of Gregg County\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Attention was again directed to the recent election, since it had been held under the plan that was tainted with the \u00a7 5 objection. After negotiations, the County and Craig filed an agreed motion in the local district court, seeking an order for a special election under the new scheme. After a hearing, the district court denied the agreed motion. The court stated that it had earlier rejected the preferable remedy, a pre-election injunction, and nothing had occurred to change its mind in favor of voiding the actual election results. The court held that in light of the relevant factors, \u201cthe due process and equal protection rights of the voters and candidates in Gregg County do not require a special election.\u201d <em>See also, MAPAC v. Hale Co., </em>CA 5-92-CV-0078-C (S.D.Tex. Nov. 5, 1992) (3 Judge Panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Although both parties had previously requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in their pleadings, the issue was not raised during the hearing on the agreed motion. Later, the court ordered each party to bear its own costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Craig\u2019s appeal is limited to the attorneys\u2019 fees issue. He also contends that the district court should have made <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highways, </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974), findings in connection with his fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Craig\u2019s claim is rooted in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973Z (e) of the Voting Rights Act. Despite the fact that he (a) failed to achieve preliminary injunctive relief, (b) failed to persuade the district court to enter an agreed order requiring a new election, and (c) suffered a dismissal with prejudice, Craig argues that he was \u201ca catalyst in the creation of a new redistricting plan for Gregg County.\u201d He takes credit for the events that occurred in the District of Columbia lawsuit and the Justice Department preclearance process, contending that Gregg County modified the boundaries for Constable Precinct 4 after it \u201cbecame aware that Craig intended to file suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Because the phrase \u201cprevailing party\u201d connotes the same general meaning under \u00a7 1973Z (e) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, cases under both Acts apply the same principles when determining plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Posada v. Lamb County, </em>716 F.2d 1066, 1071 (5th Cir.1983). The Supreme Court recently undertook to clarify the definition of a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for awards of attorneys\u2019 fees under the analogous civil rights fee-shifting statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992), the Court held that the recipient of a nominal damage award might be denied an award of attorneys\u2019 fees even though he is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the statute. In so holding the Court explained that significant term as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">Therefore, to qualify as a prevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim. The plaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought, ... or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement ... Whatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit him at the time of the judgment or settlement ... In short, a plaintiff \u201cprevails\u201d when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. \u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 573.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">Based on <em>Farrar, </em>it is a close question whether Craig could under any circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>stances qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in his Voting Rights Act case. He obtained no enforceable judgment against Gregg County. He obtained no relief through a consent decree or settlement. He obtained no direct benefit from the lawsuit, because no new election was ordered. A more precise reading of <em>Farrar, </em>however, might suggest that a party may prevail, even in the absence of a judgment, consent decree, or direct personal benefit \u201cif its ends are accomplished as a result of the litigation.\u201d <em>Associated Builders and Contractors v. Orleans Parish School, </em>919 F.2d 374, 378 (5th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). To make a <em>prima facie </em>case of prevailing party \u00e9nti-tlement to fees in the absence o.f such relief, the plaintiff must therefore show that he achieved the goal intended by the lawsuit, and his lawsuit \u201ccaused the defendant to remedy the discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Causation may be determined by considering the \u201cchronology of events in order to assess the provocative effect of the plaintiffs lawsuit.\u201d <em>Hennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Board, </em>749 F.2d 1148, 1152 (5th Cir.1985). Factors suggesting that plaintiffs are not entitled to fees include situations where a government entity is already \u201cdiligently working to have a [redistricting] plan submitted\u201d when plaintiffs filed suit; the plan was complete by the time plaintiffs filed suit; and plaintiffs were not a \u201csubstantial factor or a significant catalyst\u201d in creating a fair redistricting plan. <em>Posada v. Lamb County, </em>716 F.2d, 1071-72 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">While Craig now contends that the principal goal underlying his lawsuit was achieved by a realignment of the boundaries of Constable Precinct 4 favoring the election of a black candidate, he has not shown that <em>his suit caused </em>Gregg County to remedy the allegedly flawed voting scheme. Particularly, Craig failed to offer testimony concerning how he influenced the decisions of the Department of Justice or the district court of the District of Columbia. By the time Craig filed suit in local district court, Gregg County had already presented its proposed voting scheme to the Department of Justice over five months earlier. As the election approached, the County sought further assurances and filed suit in the District of Columbia. Only then, and virtually on the eve of election, did Craig file his own suit. A civil rights plaintiff would not be entitled to receive attorneys fees for demanding that Gregg County do something that it was going to do anyway. <em>See, e.g., Posa-da, </em>716 F.2d at 1072. Late arrivers cannot jump the train as it leaves the station and hope to seize prevailing plaintiff status. <em>Posada, </em>716 F.2d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Although the plan was not complete by the time Craig filed suit, without evidence to the contrary, it may be inferred that the train had been moving toward revision from the time the County submitted the original districting plan to the Department of Justice for approval. It may also be inferred that Gregg County was the catalyst toward the revised plan because it filed suit first in the \u201cchronology of events.\u201d <em>See Associated Builders, </em>919 F.2d at 378. That filing was logically linked to its earlier involvement with the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Nor has Craig shown at what other point he was a significant catalyst toward the development of the new plan. To the extent that Craig seeks attorneys\u2019 fees for services performed during preclearance proceedings with the Department of Justice, Craig\u2019s argument is misplaced. \u201c[F]ees may not be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs under the Voting Rights Act for services rendered in preclearance submissions to the Attorney General.\u201d <em>Arriola v. Harville, </em>781 F.2d 506, 507-09 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 820, 107 S.Ct. 84, 93 L.Ed.2d 38 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The district court did not articulate the basis for denying Craig\u2019s request for attorneys fees under \u00a7 1973\u00cd (e) and \u00a7 1988, but remand for further explanation is unnecessary. Craig failed to establish in the district court his entitlement to \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. For this reason, too, he could fairly be required to bear his own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the general rules of procedure. The district court did not err in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The judgment of the district court \u2022 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
