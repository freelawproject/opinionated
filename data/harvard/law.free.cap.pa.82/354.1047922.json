Affiant further says that a large portion of the consideration of said notes and money was the value of certain personal property alleged to have been on the premises at the time the purchase was made, and which was alleged to have been in good condition by said Rowley'; said Rowley further alleging that the tavern stand which was then established there, and which also constituted a part of the consideration of said notes and money, was a first-class stand, very valuable, and that it was to remain in the condition it was then, at the time of the purchase, about January 4th 1875.; whereas, in fact, the goods, property, &amp;e., alleged to be on said premises at the time, were almost worthless, and the better portion of them Were after the said purchase removed off the premises before its occupation by affiant, by either the said Rowley or some person acting in his behalf, as affiant expects to be able to prove. And whereas, also, the house was not a good or first-class stand, and almost entirely worthless. And the said Rowley, having represented that it would remain in the condition it was then, was also an inducement for affiant to purchase. Yet the same was in a very short time reduced to a condition entirely untenantable, and had to be entirely abandoned, and the defendant avers that the consideration for the note in suit has not only entirely failed, but more than failed, but affiant further avers, expects to be able to prove and show on the trial of this case, that James Littell, the plaintiff above named, is not the owner and holder for value, and before maturity of the note in suit, but the same Avas handed over to him by John Rowley, the payee, for the purpose of debarring the maker and endorsers thereof from a defence to the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">A rule was taken by the plaintiff for Avant of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which rule the court made absolute, and this action of the court was the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-7\"><em>Wm.

F. Smith 383. A reasonable intendment is to be made in favor of affidavits of defence, and they should not be subjected to a scrutiny unduly rigid: Twitchell <em>v. </em>McMurtrie, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-8\"><em>Bayne f Magee, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB5\">did not present a paper-book.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b356-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"ABlR\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 30th 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In this case the court below ordered judgment to be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The action was against the endorser of a promissory note. The affidavit averred that he endorsed it at the request, and for'the accommodation of Peter Moeck; that the latter delivered it to one John Bowley, in part payment, in the purchase of the lease of a tavern, and a large quantity of personal property thereon. It further asserted the worthlessness of the tavern, and the non-delivery of the most valuable portion of the personal property, and a failure of consideration to the full amount of the note. Neither in the court below, nor here, was it contended that the affidavit did not set forth a good ground of defence between the parties to the contract. As between them, and to the extent of the value of the personal property not' delivered, there was an undoubted failure of consideration. The contention then was, and now is, whether the affidavit avers sufficient facts to let in the evidence against the plaintiff below. The language is \u201c affiant further avers, expects to be able to prove and show on the trial of this case, that James Littell, the plaintiff above named, is not the owner and holder for value, and before maturity of the note in suit; but that the same was handed over to him by John Bowley the payee, for the purpose of debarring the maker and endorsees thereof from a defence to the same.\u201d This is not only an express averment that the defendant in error is not a purchaser for value of the note, before it matured; but in substance the further averment, that it is still the property of Bowley. If the fact of present ownership in Bowley be proved, undoubtedly the same defence may be made to the note, as if the suit was in his name : Eyre <em>v. </em>Yohe <em>et al, </em>17 P. F. Smith 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">It is true the more usual form of an affidavit of defence is that the affiant \u201c verily believes\u201d the facts which he alleges. Here instead of belief he positively avers their actual existence. In its legal effect this form of an affidavit may be no stronger than one in the usual form ; but certainly it is no weaker. It is quite as effective to prevent the taking of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The facts set forth as constituting the defence, need be averred with reasonable precision and distinctness only : Bronson <em>v. </em>Silverman, 27 P. F. Smith 94. A reasonable intendment should be made in favor of the affidavit: Twitchell <em>v. </em>McMurtrie, Id. 883. We think the controlling facts are averred with sufficient precision and distinctness. An ability to prove those facts is distinctly asserted. The assignments are therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
