Agnew\u2019s Estate.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-8\">1. In partition of real estate in which a minor ha,s an interest, a guardian who has no funds of the minor is not bound to take real estate charged with an owelty equal to the value of the purpart, even though it be to the minor\u2019s advantage that he should do so.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-9\">2. In proceedings in partition, A., a minor, and her guardian\u2019s wife had equal interests, the minor, as represeriting an older child, having the first right to accept or refuse to take real estate. A purpart was allotted to the wife at what was then a fair valuation, and the minor\u2019s share was charged upon this purpart as owelty. The guardian at that time had no funds to pay the owelty. There was no pretence of fraud in the proceedings. The real estate allotted to the wife increased very greatly in value: <em>Held, </em>that this fact did not in anyway impair the wife\u2019s title to the real estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-10\">3. The guardian in settling his account charged himself with the amount of this owelty, with interest, and his account was confirmed: <em>Held,, </em>that the proceedings in partition could not be inquired into in a proceeding for a review of the guardian\u2019s account.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-11\">4. The record in the partition did not'-show in express terms that the guardian declined to take real estate for his ward, but it did show notice to the parties to appear and accept or refuse, that the minor did appear by her guardian, that all the shares were allotted to other heirs, and that the minor\u2019s share was charged as owelty: <em>Held, </em>that this was enough to show that the guardian declined to take real estate; and that there was no evidence to impair the title of the guardian\u2019s wife to the purpart allotted to her.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-12\">5. Where a guardian, who stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to his ward, improperly charged her with her support and education, 'but the account was fully explained to her two years after her majority, and all the facts fully known to her at that time; the minor took a note for the balance due her, on which she received partial payments during several years; the account was duly confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and the petition for a review did not allege any new evidence to impugn the account: <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence to support a petition for a review.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-13\">6. In the absence of positive evidence that valuable bank stocks bought by a guardian while he had funds of his ward uninvested in his hands were bought with his ward\u2019s money, the minor, after attaining her majority, is not entitled to elect to take the stocks, instead of money.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-14\">7. Where a guardian, from 1850 to 1857, received $2746 of his ward\u2019s money in small amounts which he mixed with his own money and never invested in her name, and in 1856 and 1857, invested $1900 in valuable bank stocks, he himself being at that time a man of means and his wife having money of her own, and there was no further evidence to trace the ward\u2019s money into these stocks : I7eM,that the finding of an auditor that the ward\u2019s money did not go into these stocks was not unwarranted by the facts in the case, and that the minor could not elect to take the stocks .instead of money.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b389-15\">October 9th 1876.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AQcC\">Before Agnew, C.

Milligan (formerly Agnew) and her husband, for a review of the account of Dr. James Carothers, her former guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">The grounds upon which the review was asked were these: (1) Because the guardian, in the partition of certain real estate in which his ward and his wife were equally interested, had elected to take real estate for his wife (which afterwards proved to be very valuable) and had taken his ward\u2019s share of the estate in money; (2) because, though standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to his ward, he had charged her in his account with the amount expended for her support and maintenance ; and (3) because he mingled his ward\u2019s money with his own in the purchase of bank stocks, which increased greatly in value and yielded more than six per cent, interest, and had accounted only for the principal of the minor\u2019s estate with legal interest. The original and supplemental petitions filed were referred to an auditor who reported substantially these facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">The petitioner was the only child of Mary Agnew (formerly Graham); the latter died in 1843, and soon after her death the ' petitioner, then but a few weeks old, was taken to the home of her mother\u2019s younger sister, Mrs. Carothers, wife of Dr. Carothers, and lived there until some time after she had attained her majority and until she was married; she was brought up by and treated by her aunt and her guardian in all respects as their own child. In 1846 James Graham, the grandfather of the petitioner, died intestate, seised of a farm in Allegheny county, in which Mary Agnew and Mrs. Carothers were each entitled to an eighth interest. Proceedings for the partition of this real estate were begun in 1849 (Dr. Carothers having in the meantime been appointed guardian of the petitioner), and the inquest made a return dividing the estate into four purparts, of which the lowest in value was appraised at $3538. Mary Agnew\u2019s interest was valued at $2169. Dr. 'Carothers and his wife elected to take a purpart valued at $4500, and one was accordingly set apart to them, in October 1849, charged with the payment of $2169 owelty of partition to Mary Agnew as her entire share of the estate. Up to this time no money or property of the ward had come into the hands of her guardian. The purpart set apart to Mrs. Carothers turned out to be coal lands, and became very valuable. There was no evidence that the partition was not fairly conducted. The record of the proceedings in partition did not show in express terms that the guardian declined to take for his ward; it did however show notice to the parties interested to appear on a certain day and accept or refuse the real estate at the valuation; that the guardian was present on that day, that all the shares were allotted to other heirs, and that the petitioner\u2019s share was ordered to be paid in money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The petitioner reached her majority in July 1864. The account of her guardian was filed in September 1866; in- it the accountant charged himself, among other things, with $2169 and simple interest thereon, and claimed credit for over $3000, paid for the minor\u2019s support and education during' her entire minority. This account was fully explained to the minor before it was filed, so that she understood clearly that it' charged hpr for her support and education. There was some evidence that her relations to her aunt and guardian made it impolitic for her '[o object to the account as stated, but there was nothing to show that any improper influence was used in any way. The petitioner took a note for the balance due her, and signed a receipt therefor. Payments were made to her on this note at various times as late as 1870. Dr. Carothers died in April 1867. Mary Agnew was married some months later. At the filing of the first petition the purpart allotted to Mrs. Carothers was still in her possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">With regard to the third ground for a review, the evidence showed that Dr. Carothers never kept a bank account, except for a short time before 1860, and that he kept-no separate account of his ward\u2019s money. The owelty charged in the partition was never paid in money, but remained a charge upon Mrs. Carothers\u2019s share until the settlement of the account, and was then included in the note given to the petitioner. From January 1st 1850 to January 1st 1857, the guardian received other money of the minor to the amount of $2746. In May 1856, Dr. Carothers, having then in hand $1750 of the trust money, invested $900 in hank stock in his own name, and in June 1857, having in hand $2746 of the trust funds, he invested $1000 in bank stocks in his own name. It appeared, however, that at this time he was the owner of valuable real estate, and was a physician in active practice, and further, that both he and his wife had money of their own sufficient in amount to make these investments. He did not appear ever to have invested any of the trust funds in his ward\u2019s name. Beyond the above facts there was no evidence given to trace the minor\u2019s money into these investments. The auditor was of opinion that there was no evidence to show that any of the minor\u2019s money had been used in the purchase of the stocks claimed by the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">The first petition for a review was filed in December 1867. It set forth the proceedings in partition; that the petitioner was entitled to choose or refuse a purpart before Mrs. Carothers, being the only child of an older sister; and that the guardian, in electing to take a purpart for his wife, had committed a fraud upon his ward, and prayed a review of the account on this ground. A supplemental petition, filed in 1868, set forth that Dr. Carothers had been legally disqualified to act for his ward in the proceedings in partition, and therefore she had not been in fact represented; further, that Dr. Carothers had elected to take a purpart for his wife, though the first choice was in his ward, without having first refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>a purpart for the latter of record, all of which was a fraud upon the ward, and prayed that the petitioner, not having been represented in the partition, should be allowed to come into court and make choice of or refuse the purpart taken by Mrs. Carothers at its valuation. Neither of these petitions prayed to surcharge the accountant on the ground that his choice of a purpart enured to his ward. A third petition, filed the same day, was based upon the charges for support and maintenance of the ward; and a fourth petition, filed April 1871, prayed a transfer of the above-mentioned stocks and an account of the dividends received from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">Upon these facts, the auditor was of opinion that the petitioners were not entitled to a review; the court below confirmed the report, and the petitioners took this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-7\"><em>Hampton .$\u2022 Dalzell, </em>for the appellants. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuC\">The guardian, in the partition, became personally liable for the owelty, and to that extent became the real owner of the purpart allotted to his wife. He also took a life estate under his wife: Kean <em>v. </em>Ridgway, 16 S. &amp; R. 63; Snevily <em>v. </em>Wagner, 8 Barr 396. He therefore acted for himself and not for his ward, and his account should be surcharged: Hughes\u2019s Appeal, 6 Casey 471; Keech <em>v. </em>Sandford, 1 Lead. Cas. in Eq. 48; Galbraith <em>v. </em>Elder, 8 Watts 93. Dr. Carothers was disabled from acting for his ward; therefore she has never had a day in court; her title has not- been divested: Richards <em>v. </em>Rote, 18 P. F. Smith 248. The auditor found that the guardian stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to his ward; he cannot charge for her support: Lantz <em>v. </em>Fry, 7 Harris 366. It was admitted that the guardian mixed the minor\u2019s funds with his own, and did not invest them in her name. It was his duty to mark her property so that it could be distinguished, and as he did not do so, she may elect to take any investments that could have been bought with her money: Hart <em>v. </em>Ten Eyck, 2 Johns. Ch. 103: Lupton <em>v. </em>White, 15 Vesey 439; Lord Chedworth <em>v. </em>Edwards, 8 Id. 48; Fellows <em>v. </em>Owen, 2 Id. 516; Pennell <em>v. </em>Deffell, 23 E. L. &amp; E. 460; Lukenss\u2019 Appeal, 7 W. &amp; S. 48; Morris <em>v. </em>Wallace, 3 Barr 319; Stanley\u2019s Appeal, 8 Id. 432; Royer\u2019s Appeal, 1 Jones 36; Norris\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 106.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-8\">The petitioner was not estopped by her receipt to her guardian ; for when she gave it \u25a0 she did not have a perfect knowledge of her affairs: Wills\u2019s Appeal, 10 Harris 332; Elliot <em>v. </em>Elliot, 5 Binn. 8; Eberts <em>v. </em>Eberts, 5 P. F. Smith 119 ; Kinter\u2019s Appeal, 12 Id. 318; Stanley\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>Receiving payments on the note did not raise an estoppel; she was entitled to receive the amount of the note at least: Wills\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-9\">In cases of private settlement with a minor just come of age, and of merely formal settlements in court, liberality ought to be exercised in allowing a review: Kinter\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>A bill for review is the proper remedy to surcharge the fraudulent omission of assets received: McNeel\u2019s Estate, 18 P. F. Smith 412. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>omission to charge himself with the value of the land which he took as his ward\u2019s trustee was a fraud on her, and so averred in the petition. The charge for maintenance was an error in law which is reviewable. The question ofi-Jhe bank stock arose upon after-discovered evidence. Finally,'the case is within Kinter\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>Russell\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 258, and Whelen\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 425.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-6\"><em>Slagle Wiley, </em>for the appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_p\">If the proceedings in partition were void as to Mrs. Carothers they were void <em>in toto. </em>Mrs. Carothers\u2019s title cannot be impaired in these proceedings, as she is not in court: Herr <em>v. </em>Herr, 5 Barr 428; Snevily <em>v. </em>Wagner, 8 Id. 396. Even if there had been fraud it can only be shown in direct proceedings against her: Dundas\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 331. Besides, there was no prayer for a surcharge in the petitions. There was no evidence of fraud; and the burden of showing fraud was on the petitioner: Yeager\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 176. The increase in value of the purpart is not proof of fraud: Bowman\u2019s Appeal, 3 Watts 369. The decree of the court in the partition raises a presumption that every requisite was complied with: Neeld\u2019s Estate, 20 P. F. Smith 113. Dr. Carothers had no funds to pay owelty with and was not bound to advance money: Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey 316. Again, even if the guardian had committed a fraud, his wife\u2019s title would not be impaired: Totten\u2019s Appeal, 10 Wright 303; Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 18 P. F. Smith 411. There was evidence to show that the guardian always kept an account of his ward\u2019s maintenance and intended to charge her with it. Norris\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra, </em>has the qualification, that the trust money can fairly be traced into the investment. We are not obliged <em>in these proceedings </em>to show that her money did not go into .the stocks: Yeager\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>this would be hard to do, after many years and when the accountant is dead. In <em>this </em>court the only question is whether the petitioner is entitled to a review of <em>right; </em>that can only be for. errors in law on the record, and for after-discovered evidence: Kinter\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>neither ground exists here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-7\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"AGm\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 2d 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">This was an application for the review of a guardianship account duly confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">In September 1866 - Dr. James Carothers filed his account as guardian of Mary E. Agnew (now Milligan), the appellant. At the next December Term it was \u25a0 duly confirmed. In April of the next year, Dr. Carothers died. Some three months thereafter the appellant married. On the 28th of December following, the appellant presented her first petition, asking for a review of the account. She followed this with three supplemental petitions, the last in April 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The substantial grounds of complaint and prayers for relief may be considered in three parts:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">T. The omission of the guardian to elect to talce for the appellant a purpart of the real estate, at the time of the partition thereof, and therefore she asked to be allowed to come into court and make choice of or refuse said purpart at its valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">2. That the guardian had improperly charged for her support, maintenance and education, and that all those items should be stricken from the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">'3. That the guardian mingled his ward\u2019s money with his own in the purchase of bank stocks, and that the appellant is entitled to receive said stocks and their dividends, and not simply the money used in their purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">We will consider them in the order stated:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">1. The whole land partitioned was valued by the inquest at $17,352.15.' The appellant and the wife of Dr. Carothers were each entitled to one-eighth interest therein. It was divided into four purparts. The least valuable was valued at $3538. The appellant\u2019s share was of the value of $2169 only. The guardian had no funds of the appellant with which he could pay owelty. If he had elected to take a purpart for her, he would have been obliged to advance, of his own money, a sum nearly equal to the whole value of the appellant\u2019s share. This he was certainly not required to do. Had he done so, he would have incurred the risk of having the legality of his act questioned by his ward on her arriving at full age. He therefore took no purpart for the appellant. He did, however, in right of his ydfe elect to take a purpart valued at over $4500. This he.had a perfect right to do. The rights of his wife were not to suffer from the fact that her husband was guardian of the appellant. The wife was not thereby compelled to decline taking a purpart, nor was she obliged to take jointly with the appellant or any other heir. There is no averment that the partition was not honestly and fairly made, nor that any purpart-was appraised at less than its then market value. The partition was confirmed and the allotment made to Mrs. Carothers in October 1849. The court then ordered her and her husband to pay to his said ward the said sum of $2169, with interest from that date. He was charged Avith this sum in his final account, which was duly confirmed. A title thus acquired by Mrs. Carothers, in the absence of any fraud, cannot be divested or impaired by the discovery, several years afterwards, that the surface of the land was underlaid Avith coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">It is further urged, that inasmuch as the record does not aver in express terms, that the guardian declined to take for his ward, it still remains open as to her, and she may noAV come in and elect.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">The record, however, does show notice to \u201c the heirs and others interested in the estate\u201d to be and appear on a day named, and accept or refuse to accept the real estate at the valuation, or sIioav <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>cause why the same should' not be sold. It shows that on the day designated the heirs and representatives appeared, the appellant was there by her guardian. All the purparts were allotted. It shows that all of them were allotted to other heirs, and the share of the appellant was ordered to be paid in money. It does, therefore, substantially and sufficiently appear that the guardian declined to take any purpart for his said ward. There is no evidence in the case to impair the title acquired by Mrs. Carothers, or calculated to show any bad faith or fraudulent conduct of the guardian in the whole transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">2. If the question of the charges for the support, maintenance and education of the ward was now open, there is great force in the objection to their allowance. But the question is not now an open one. All the items complained of were distinctly and specifically set forth in the .account filed, and it was duly confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court. This is a petition for a review of that account. It is well settled that an account thus settled and confirmed can only be reviewed as a matter of <em>right, </em>for error of law apparent on the face of the record, or for new matter whichfhas arisen since the decree. As a matter of <em>grace </em>a review may, be granted for new proof, discovered after the decree, which proof could not possibly have been used at the time when the decree was made: Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7 404; Riddle\u2019s Estate, 7 Harris 431; Russell\u2019s Administrator\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 258; Hartman\u2019s Appeal, 12 Id. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In the case we are now considering it is not claimed that any error of law appears on the face of the record, nor is it shown that new matter has arisen since the decree, or that all the proof now offered to invalidate the decree was not known and accessible to the appellant when it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The answer to the petition, <em>inter alia, </em>avers:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">1. That the accounts containing all these' credits were well known to said ward, having been .examined before and after she attained her majority, and she made no objection thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">2. No objection was made to these credits in her first petition, nor has she specified in her supplemental petition her ignorance that the guardian claimed such credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">3. She does not.aver that they are not correct in amount, nor that they were not duly and properly expended in the. maintenance and education of said ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The master, to whom the case was referred to ascertain the facts and give his conclusions, reported, showing that when the guardian\u2019s account was made, the appellant was more than twenty-three years of age; that, she was present when the .items were \u201c discussed and considered during several evenings; that she was aware of the fact that a charge for boarding and clothing would probably be made, and the only question, if made,, was as to how much the charge \u2022would be.\u201d She was advised that it was a final settlement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>herself and her guardian. When the account was fully prepared it was presented to her. He therefore found, \u201c that the facts relied upon by petitioner for a review of the account were fully known at the time of the filing of the account, and not within that class of eases allowing a review for new matter discovered after the decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au7f\">It will be observed that the effort is not to surcharge the guardian with money or property withheld or omitted from his final account, but to strike therefrom certain credits distinctly claimed, stated in the account, and confirmed by the court. The evidence was wholly insufficient for that purpose. All the facts on which the appellant relies to attack the decree were as well known to her when the account was filed, as when she petitioned for the review. She received payments to apply on the account after its confirmation, and made no application for a review until after the death of her guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">3. The allegation that the guardian purchased stocks with his ward\u2019s money is not sustained by the evidence. The master states the law correctly. \u25a0 He says : \u201c If the proofs establish the fact that these stocks were purchased with the money of the ward she would certainly be entitled to make her election to take them in lieu of money,\u201d but he adds, \u201c the evidence fails to show that any of her money was used for that purpose.\u201d An examination of the testimony does not show his finding to be unwarranted. He therefore concluded, \u201cthat under the law such a case had-not been presented as entitles the party to a rehearing of the account.\u201d Exceptions having been filed to the report, they were dismissed, and the report confirmed finally by the court. We see no sufficient cause for disturbing the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Therefore, decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
