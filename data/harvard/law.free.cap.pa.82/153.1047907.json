The residue of his estate, according to the provisions of the will, was to go to his grandchildren, the children of his son Edmund Patterson Sellers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">The testator died on the 20th of January 1874, and George W. Soult was 'appointed administrator with the will annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">On the 10th of November 1874 appraisers were appointed, who made an inventory and appraisement of the goods and chattels pf the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-10\">The widow clainied under the $300 exemption law the specific articles bequeathed to her in the will, amounting in value to about $15, and the rest of the goods found on the premises, all of which, were accordingly valued and appraised to her, amounting in the aggregate to $48, which appraisement was filed of record in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and presented to said court and confirmed in January 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-11\">At the August Term following the administrator settled his account in which was a credit of $252, paid the widow out of the proceeds of the note of William Johnson, to make up, as she claimed, the balance of the $300 due her under the exemption law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-12\">The guardian of the minor grandchildren of George Sellers excepted to this payment of $252 to the widow, on the ground that she was concluded by the appraisement and confirmation thereof by the court, and the court appointed an auditor to report on the exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-13\">It appeared before the auditor that there was no note of the widow\u2019s claim in the appraisement, but there was the following evidence that she made the claim at the time the appraisement was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-14\">George W. Soult: The widow claimed her $300, and the balance over and above the appraisement out of the note of William Johnson. She claimed the $300 and we saw at once that the goods would not reach. She agreed to take them as far as they went at the appraisement, to save the expense of a sale, and the balance she claimed in money out of the William Johnson note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-15\">Cross-examined: I had not collected the money on the Johnson note at the time. No entry made in the appraisement as to the $252 because I did not think it was necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-16\">Amos Hoot, one of the appraisers, testified : On the day of the appraisement Mrs. Sellers, after the appraisement of the personal property, claimed the balance out of the Johnson note. I think, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>I am not certain about it, that there was a Johnson note and a Brought note; and I think she said Soult might collect the Brought note, and she would take her balance out of the Johnson note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">On cross-examination : I don\u2019t know whether her claim for the Johnson note is entered on the appraisement or not; I can\u2019t say positively whether Mrs. Sellers made a claim on the Johnson note or not, but I believe she did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">The auditor in his report said: <em>\u201c </em>The widow can only have what the court awards, and having in this case awarded but $48, she can claim no more. Whether an appraisement of money or notes as good as money, may be dispensed with in certain cases or not, is not material; but appraised or not appraised, the widow\u2019s claim must be set out, reported to the court and if approved, must be confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">The auditor found that the payment of the administrator to the widow of the $252, was a mispayment and surcharged him with that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">To this finding the administrator excepted.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">The court below (Bucher, P. J.) dismissed the exception and confirmed the report of the auditor, in their opinion saying, \u201c The decree of the court confirming the appraisement is final and conclusive. The widow could not get behind it. If she made the claim and the administrator neglected to note it in the appraisement, her remedy would be against him personally : Compher <em>v. </em>Compher <em>et al., </em>1 Casey 31. The administrator now seeks to avoid the decree and adjudication of the court, and thus allow the widow more than was adjudicated to her, and more than the record shows she demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-11\">\u201c But it is urged that here the widow did demand more than the appraisers set out to her, and that the administrator having paid her the demand injustice will be done him unless the credit is allowed. The only proof we have of this claim is in the evidence of the accountant, and it is in the teeth of the record; and whilst we do not say that he is unreliable as a witness, yet his mistakes or disregard of his duty is no reason why the rules of law should be set aside for his benefit. The vice in the whole matter is that this claim should have been included in the appraisement or reported to the court. It was not so done, and if a loss ensues thereby, it must be laid to the door of him who failed in the discharge of his duty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-12\">The administrator appealed and assigned for error the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-13\"><em>D.

To appraise money is only to count it: Larrison\u2019s Appeal, 12 Casey 130 ; Baldy\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 328; Peterman\u2019s Appeal, 26 P. F.

Its judgments are final and conclusive and cannot be assailed collaterally by parol: Gilmore <em>v. </em>Rodgers <em>et al., </em>5 Wright 120 ; Merklein <em>v. </em>Trapnell <em>et al., </em>10 Casey 46 ; Keech <em>v. </em>Rinehart, 10 Barr 242; Lockhart <em>v. </em>John, 7 Id. 137; Welty <em>v. </em>Ruffner, 9 Id. 225 ; Torrance <em>v. </em>Torrance, 3 P.

The demand for the exemption must be made, or the privilege will be held to be waived: Davis\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 256. It must be made within a reasonable time: Burk <em>v. </em>Gleason, 10 Wright 297 ; before a sale of property: Neff\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris 243; before the executor has incurred expenses in proceedings to effect a sale: Davis\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>before the estate has been administered: Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 65; and before the interests of other parties shall have been affected by delay : Kirkpatrick\u2019s Estate, 5 Phila. 98. There can be but one appraisement, and if property of less value than $300 be elected to be retained, the right to the residue is waived: Davis\u2019s Appeal and Baskin\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>If the claim be duly made, and be disregarded or refused, the remedy is by a personal action against the personal representative of the decedent: Compher <em>v. </em>Compher, 1 Casey 31. But the demand may be for property to the value of $300 out of the decedent\u2019s real or personal estate, or for the sum of $300 out of banknotes, money, stocks, judgments or other indebtedness: Acts of 14th April 1851, and 8th April 1859. If money, as such, or money out of any security is retained, appraisement is not necessary: Larrison\u2019s Appeal, 12 Casey 130; Baldy\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 328; Peterman\u2019s Appeal, 26 P. F. Smith 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">There is no doubt of the accuracy of the principle asserted on behalf of the appellees, that an appraisement confirmed by the court is a matter of record, possessing the effect of a judgment, and open to no collateral review. It is the foundation of the widow\u2019s right \u2014it forms her very title to the property. But such a record is conclusive of the subject to which it relates, and of nothing else. In this case the widow desired to retain certain personal property, and the administrator procured to be made what is recited to be, \u201c a true and perfect inventory and just appraisement of all and singular the goods and chattels, rights and credits which were appraised to Elizabeth Sellers, widow.\u201d The ascertained value was $48. It is alleged on behalf of the appellant that this sum formed part only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of her demand, and that her claim to $252, the residue of $300, was out of a security belonging to her husband. If the fact were so, the appraisement could in no way affect that residue. Conclusive as to the chattels, the record had no connection with the Johnson note. The widow\u2019s right to that rested on her election to retain the balance of her claim out of it, and not on any action of the appraisers, the administrator or the court. The whole question becomes one of evidence alone. Did Mrs. Sellers elect to retain $252 out of this particular s\u00e9curity? If so, the appellant performed a simple duty when he paid her.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Read in the light of Larrison\u2019s Appeal and Baldy\u2019s Appeal, the language of the Act of the 8th of April 1859 proves the propriety and accuracy of the construction that has been given to this claimant\u2019s rights. \u201c The widow or children of any decedent, entitled to retain $300 out of such decedent\u2019s estate, by the laws of this Commonwealth, and every person entitled to the exemption provided for by the act entitled \u2018 An Act to exempt property to the value of $300 from levy and sale on execution or distress for rent, approved the 9th day of April A. D. 1849, may elect to retain the same, or any part thereof, out of any bank-notes, money, stocks, judgments or other indebtedness to such person. And in all cases hereafter, where property shall be set apart for the widow and children of any decedent, the same shall be appraised and set apart to said widow and children by the appraisers of the other personal estate of the decedent.\u201d The word \u201cproperty \u201d in the concluding clause of the section was manifestly used in the relation in which the same word was used in the Act of 1851, and in contradistinction to the provision for the exemption that should consist of bank-notes or money left by the husband or realized from evidences of debt. The Act of 1851 had directed the appraisement of property elected to be retained by a widow or children, \u201c in the same manner as provided in the Act passed the 9th day of April 1849.\u201d The change made by the Act of 1859 consisted in directing an appraisement \u201cby the appraisers of the other personal estate of the decedent.\u201d Baldy\u2019s Appeal was decided in 1861, and Peterman\u2019s Appeal in 1874. In both cases, obviously, the provision for appraisement in the Act of 1859 was treated as applicable to property in the sense of land or chattels, and not to property in the sense of money, or of the proceeds of securities or stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">As already stated, the question here is one of fact. Did the widow claim in addition to the chattels appraised at $48, $252 out of the note of William Johnson? The auditor appears to have regarded the point as unimportant, and no distinct finding in regard to it was reported. His decision was based on the ground that \u201c the widow can only have what the court awards, and having in this case awarded but $48, she can claim no more. Whether,\u201d the report added, \u201c an appraisement of money, or notes as good as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>money, may be dispensed with in certain cases or not, is not material ; but appraised or not appraised, the widow\u2019s claim must be set out, reported to the court, and if approved, must be confirmed.\u201d The rule thus stated is supported by no recognised authority. So far from that, it is believed to be in conflict as well with the current practice throughout the state as with the spirit of the decisions of this court. The true rule is, that where a demand has been made in proper time, the money, in the language of Judge Thompson, in Baldy\u2019s Appeal, may \u201cbe claimed in the administration account without any appraisement.\u201d It is not the widow\u2019s claim, but the appraisement of chattels elected to be retained, on which it is made the duty of the court to pass. The right to elect rests in the statutes, and is a question between the widow and the administrator. It is the valuation of chattels, that canno't be calculated or counted, but must be estimated by appraisers, which the law requires the court to approve or set aside. Turning to the evidence referred to in the opinion of the court below, and contained in the paper-book, the question of fact becomes free from difficulty. George W. Soult, the appellant, testified that \u201c the widow claimed her $300, and the balance over and above the appraisement out of the note of William Johnson. * * * We saw at once that the goods would not reach. She agreed to take them as'far as they went, without appraisement, to save the expense of a sale, and the balance she claimed in money out of the William Johnson note. * * * No entry was made in the appraisement as to the $252, because I did not think it was necessary.\u201d Amos Hoot was one of the appraisers. He testified: \u201cMrs. Sellers, after the appraisement of the personal property, claimed the balance of the $300 out of the Johnson note. I think, but am not certain about it, that there was a Johnson note and a Brought note; and I think she said Soult might collect the Brought note, and she would take her balance\u2019out of the Johnson note.\u201d On cross-examination he said: \u201c I cannot say positively whether Mrs. Sellers made a claim on the Johnson note or not, but I believe she did.\u201d This was the only proof on the subject. It was uncontradicted, and for all that appears in the record was credible and trustworthy. It was ample to sustain the appellant\u2019s claim to be allowed for the $252, which it was admitted he had paid to the widow before the administration account was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Decree reversed at the costs of the appellees, and auditor\u2019s report set aside; and thereupon it is decreed that the exceptions to the administration account be dismissed, and the account be confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
