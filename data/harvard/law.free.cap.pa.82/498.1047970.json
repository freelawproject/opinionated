Where an administrator in a petition asking for the sale of real estate averred under oath that the decedent had no personal property, and gave a just and true account of all the debts of decedent which had come to his knowledge, the fact.that the record did not show that a bond had been filed by the administrator as required by law, did not invalidate the purchaser\u2019s title, and the irregularity was cured by the confirmation of the sale by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-7\">2. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court confirming a sale made by an administrator under its order for the payment of debts of a decedent is conclusive evidence that the title of the decedent was legally transferred to the purchaser. A sale thus made is a judicial sale and the title of the purchaser cannot be impeached for fraud unless the evidence thereof be clear and explicit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-8\">3.

Cohick, which sale was likewise confirmed. Subsequently Cohick refused to take the land, and the court made a pluries order, under which, on the 5th of December 1854, it was sold to the plaintiffs. The administrator executed, acknowledged and delivered a deed to plaintiffs, and made his report to the Orphans\u2019 Court, who confirmed the sale on the 5th of June 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">It did not appear that a bond was filed by the administrator for the due performance of his duty and for the proper distribution of the fund arising from the sale, or that a mortgage was given at the time .of sale by purchasers for part of purchase-money, as required by the order of court, the conditions of the sale being that one-third was to be paid down and the remaining two-thirds in annual payments ; but it was in evidence that the whole of the purchase-money was paid to the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">During all these proceedings James Potts, one of the plaintiffs, to whom the land was sold, acted as counsel of the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-10\">At the time this sale was made Isaac Haws, the son-in-law of John Harshberger, was living on the land, having entered before the decease of the latter and remaining there by his sufferance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-11\">Proceedings were instituted in 1856 before two justices, under the Act of April 9th 1849, to recover the land from Haws, who, as appeared by the record of the justices, refused to give possession to plaintiffs. In pursuance of these proceedings a writ of possession issued with an execution for costs, and the sheriff went to the premises, and finding no one there made proclamation and levied on some chattels he found in the house. He returned the next day and found Mary Haws in possession, and he then gave plaintiffs, who were with him, possession of the land, and took away the chattels for sale for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>It appeared that plaintiffs paid the taxes after the sale on the land and exercised other acts of ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">It appeared also that Mary Haws had lived on the land for short periods from about 1850 to 1873, one period of absence extending over ten years; that she had authorized her sister Betsy, who lived on an adjoining tract, to have a care over this land, and that Wright, her son-in-law, occupied the premises by her authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">Wright\u2019s only occupancy was a short time in 1860, and his occu.pancy which commenced in 1874, and to dispossess him of which this .suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">The contention of the defendants was that there was collusion and fraud practised in the sale and purchase of the land by the administrator and the purchasers; that the defendants, or those under whom they claimed, had held adverse possession of the premises for over twenty-one years previous to the issue of the writ of ejectment, and that the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction to decree an alias or pluries order of sale until the confirmation of the previous sales was set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">On the trial plaintiffs submitted the following points, accompanying which are the answers of the court:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-10\">1st. The court is requested to instruct the jury that the title of the plaintiffs, in evidence, being derived from the sale of the premises by an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, upon the petition of the administrator of John Harshberger, deceased, for the payment of his debts, the sale so made and confirmed by the court, the money paid by the plaintiffs, and a deed therefor executed and delivered by the administrator to the plaintiffs, and possession of the same obtained by the plaintiffs in pursuance of law, divested all the title and possession that was in John Harshberger, and his heirs claiming under him, and vested the same in the plaintiffs; and that the defendants, admitting themselves to hold their alleged title from the heirs of John Harshberger, deceased, cannot controvert the title of the plaintiffs in this collateral proceeding, and the verdict must, therefore, be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">Answer: \u201c Upon this point we instruct that if no fraud or collusion is shown between Iieyer, the administrator, and the plaintiffs in this case in the sale or purchase of this land, and the jury believe, under all the evidence, that there was such delivery to and possession by the plaintiffs as is contemplated by the law, we affirm this point. And this is a matter for you to determine upon the testimony.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\">This answer was the sixth assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-13\">2d. That the plaintiffs having been put in possession of the premises by the sheriff of Cambria county, on the 21st of July 1856, on a writ of possession issued by two justices of the peace, by virtue of certain proceedings had by them aird a jury, in which Potts and Bheam were plaintiffs, and Isaac Haws (husband of Mary Haws, one of the heirs of John Harshberger, deceased, and under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>whom defendants claim title), then in possession, was defendant, which proceedings were had under the provisions of the Act of 9th of April 1849, the plaintiffs thereby acquired the actual possession of the same as against the heirs of John Harshberger, and all persons claiming under them; and the alleged adverse possession o'f the defendants, under the heirs of John Harshberger, deceased, must, therefore, date from the delivery of the premises by the sheriff, as aforesaid, to the plaintiffs, under the proceedings aforesaid, and that twenty years not having elapsed from that time until the bringing of this suit, there is no adverse possession in the \u2019defendants to defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 title. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">Answer: \u201cWe affirm this point, with this exception. If the jury believe, from all the evidence, that there was such delivery of possession by the sheriff, on the 21st of July 1856, under the proceedings of said justices of the peace, and if the proceedings were regular, and in accordance with the Act of Assembly, we affirm this point. You have heard the testimony in regard to this. There must be three days\u2019 notice, including the day of service and excluding the day of trial. It seems to be pretty well shown that there was such service.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">This answer was the seventh assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-8\">4th. That to give title by adverse possession, the possession must be for twenty-one years; that such possession must be actual, visible, exclusive and notorious ; that it must also be continuous and uninterrupted; that from all the evidence in the case the defendants, or those under whom they claim, have not been in such possession, either by actual residence on the same, or cultivation thereof for twenty-one years before the bringing of this suit, as would defeat the plaintiff\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-9\">Answer: \u201c We affirm the first proposition in this point, that to give title by adverse possession, the possession must be adverse for twenty-one years, and we leave it to the jury, upon the evidence, to say whether or not the defendants, or those under whom they claim, have held such possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-10\">This answer Ayas the eighth assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-11\">5th. That the Orphans\u2019 Court of Cambria county, under the\u2019 proceedings and decrees of which the plaintiffs derive title, is a court of record, with all the incidents of a court of record at common law; that its proceedings and decrees in all matters where it has jurisdiction, cannot be reversed or avoided collaterally in this court or any other court, and are only liable to the usual modifications or alterations, on an appeal to the Supreme 'Court; that the order of said court for the sale of the premises in suit, being for the payment of debts of John Harshberger, the decedent, A\\'as clearly Avithin the jurisdiction of said Orphans\u2019 Court; and that the proceedings of said court on said petition and order of sale, cannot be controverted by this court or jury in this collateral proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>by the heirs of John Harshberger, or the defendants claiming under them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">Answer: \u201cIn the absence of fraud or collusion between the administrator and the plaintiffs, we affirm this point. But we say that fraud will make void any contract, no matter what the decree of the court may have been.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">This answer was the ninth assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-8\">6th. That the defendants, by an abstract of title filed in this case, claiming title under the will of John Harshberger, deceased, through Mary and Elizabeth, his daughters, are not at liberty to hold or claim adverse to that title in this suit; that the title of the said John Harshberger, being divested by the sale of his administrator, to the plaintiffs under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, the plaintiffs by virtue of the proceedings in said Orphans\u2019 Court, the payment of the purchase-money, and the delivery of the deed to them, have all the title John Harshberger had in his lifetime, and his heirs, under his will, to the premises aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-9\">Answer: \u201cWe affirm this point, if there has been no fraud or collusion shown in this .case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-10\">This answer was the tenth assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-11\">11th.

Under all the evidence in this case, the verdict of the jury must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-15\">Answer: \u201cWe refuse so to instruct you, but leave it to you to determine whether or not, upon all the evidence, the verdict should be for the plaintiffs or the defendants in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-16\">This answer was the twelfth assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-17\">Defendants submitted the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-18\">6th. That if the jury find, under all the evidence, that Mary -Harshberger was not, in fact, dispossessed by the sheriff, and no tenant was put in possession under and by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s writ for- the plaintiffs, or by the plaintiffs themselves, then there was nothing to interrupt the running of the Statute of Limitations, and their verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-19\">Answer We affirm this point, and leave it to the jury to determine if such possession was given to the plaintiffs by the sheriff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-20\">This answer was the thirteenth assignment of error. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-21\">9th.

It is a question for you to determine.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">This answer was the fourteenth assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-8\">The following are portions of the charge; those in brackets constituted, in the order they are marked, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and fifteenth assignments of error:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-9\">\u201c It is claimed here, on the part of the plaintiffs, that the return of the administrator was confirmed by the court, and that the title to this land is vested in them, in compliance with the confirmation of the sale to the purchasers. [Now this would give the plaintiffs here a-good title to the land, if there is nothing disclosed in the evidence before you which satisfies you that there are such irregularities or fraud in the. making of this sale to these parties as would avoid it. The question will be for you to determine upon the testimony.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-10\"><em>\u201c </em>The plaintiffs in this case claim that the irregularity spoken of here by the defendants, in the petitions and orders presented to and granted by the court, is not a matter to be inquired into by this court, the remedy being an appeal to the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Upon that point we will instruct you when we come to charge you on the points submitted to the court by counsel. It is claimed on part of the defence, that Judge Potts was the counsel for the administrator, and of this estate. [It is also claimed on part of the defence here, for the purpose of showing fraud in this transaction, that the settlement of this estate was not done in such a manner as was required by law, and, therefore, they infer that it was a fraudulent transaction on the part of Heyer, the administrator, and these purchasers. You will determine that question.] They claim [that after Heyer was appointed no inventory was made of the personal effects of the deceased.] The Act of Assembly requires that within thirty days the administrator shall go upon the premises and make an appraisement, by at least two suitable persons, under oath, of all the personal effects or estate of 'the deceased, taking into account any notes, bonds, book accounts, money, or anything of this kind that may belong to or may be coming to the decedent\u2019s estate, and also to give notice to all creditors to present their claims, duly probated or sworn to, for settlement. [They claim that this was not done, and that this is an element in this case to show fraud. You have heard the testimony of the register and recorder in this respect; and he testifies to you that there was no account filed, no inventory, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u25a0papers or on record showing that an inventory was ever filed in this estate.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">[\u201c The defence claims further that the administrator acted wrongly in exposing any of this real estate to sale, for the reason that it was not necessary; that Mr. Harshberger, the decedent, in his will designed and intended that there should be none of the real estate sold; that he contemplated that there was sufficient upon the premises to satisfy what debts he owed, and pay his funeral expenses ; that this is set forth in the will, and argues that this is an element to prove that the estate was not settled as it should have been, and consequently there was collusion and fraud between the purchasers and the administrator at this sale. They further claim that Judge Potts was' the attorney for the estate and for the administrator, and it became him, as attorney, to see that the estate was properly administered, as much so as it was the duty of the administrator. They say that there was no necessity for selling this land to pay these debts; that all the debts shown amount to only one hundred and six or one hundred and sixteen dollars, and that they could have been, by a proper administration of .this estate, paid without selling this property. This is a question for you, under all the evidence that is offered, both on the part of the defence to prove fraud and collusion, and on part of the purchasers, and you must detennine whether it amounted to sufficient in your judgment to enable you to say there was fraud. They also claim that there was no bond</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">' filed by the administrator for the due performance of his duty and the proper distribution of the money arising from the sale of this land, and that there was no mortgage placed on record for the purchase-money of this tract of land. You recollect the testimony of Bheam and Potts, the plaintiffs, that they have paid the purchase-money. The defendants claim that the position of Mr. Potts in regard to this estate, and the manner in which it was settled, are elements showing fraud in the case, and it is for you to determine whether it existed or not. It is not denied that Potts was counsel for Heyer, the administrator; but he denies that he was counsel for the heirs. You will determine that question frpm the testimony. If he was but counsel for the administrator, it was part of his duty, at least, to use the estate properly.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">44 The counsel for the defence calls the attention of the court to the acknowledgment of the deed. They contend that the acknowledgment before Esquire Mitchell was taken the same day that the order confirming the sale was made, and that the two could not have been done.at the same time, and that the court never confirmed the deed, neither was it acknowledged in open court. The only confirmation or acknowledgment on this deed consists in the words 4 By the court/ 'and they are in print, and would appear to have been done by the printer at the time the deed was printed. [It is for you to say whether this deed was presented to the court for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>firmation and acknowledgment, and, if so, whether or not the court adopted these printed words as its acknowledgment.

In the petition of the administrator asking for the sale, he averred under oath that the decedent had no personal property to appraise so far as he could find; and he gave a just and true account of all the debts of the decedent which had come to his knowledge. It is true the record does not show the filing of a bond as directed by the Act of Assembly; but the purchaser\u2019s title is not invalidated thereby: Lockhart <em>v. </em>John, 7 Barr 137. It was but an irregularity cured by the confirmation of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The Orphans\u2019 Court is a court of record. It has all the incidents and qualities of a court of record at common law. Its proceedings and decrees, in all matters within its jurisdiction, cannot be reversed or avoided collaterally in any other court: 2 Purd. Dig. 1103, pi. 4. Its judgments and decrees like those of any other court of record are final and conclusive. They cannot be questioned in a collateral suit unless for want of jurisdiction appearing on the record, or for fraud: Kennedy <em>v. </em>Wachsmuth, 12 S. &amp; R. 171; The President of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Dauphin County <em>v. </em>Groff <em>et al., </em>14 Id. 181; Lockhart <em>v. </em>John, <em>supra; </em>Merklein <em>v. </em>Trapnell <em>et al., </em>10 Casey 42 ; Gilmore <em>v. </em>Rodgers <em>et al., </em>5 Wright 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The petition shows debts of the decedent and no personal estate with which they could be paid. It was a substantial compliance with the requirements of the statute. The court accepted it as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>full compliance. It gave to the court jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and authorized a sale for the payment of debts. The sale was ordered. It was made, and confirmed by the court. Jurisdiction is thus shown by the record, and all irregularities are cured. The purchase-money was paid and the deed delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">It is true some of the earlier cases, prior to the Act of 1834, held the title which a purchaser acquired at an Orphans\u2019 Court sale might be questioned in ejectment; yet the later cases hold it cannot be done except for fraud or want of jurisdiction: M\u2019Pherson <em>v. </em>Ounliff <em>et al., </em>11 S. &amp; R. 422; Painter <em>v. </em>Henderson, 7 Barr 48. A sale under the order of an Orphans\u2019 Court is a judicial sale: Moore <em>v. </em>Schultz, 1 Harris 98; Vandever <em>v. </em>Baker, Id. 121. It may nevertheless be impeached for fraud ; but the evidence of the fraud must be clear and explicit. It cannot be established by showing some irregularities, and then making a general allegation of fraud. The irregularities were cured, and distinct acts of fraud must be proved to affect the title of the purchaser. This is not an attempt to set aside a sale, in the court which ordered it, before confirmation ; but to impeach it collaterally in another court twenty years thereafter, and after the purchasers had been put in possession by legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We have carefully examined the testimony in this case. We cannot find any evidence of fraudulent conduct on the part of the purchasers. The allegation-rests mainly on the fact that-one of the plaintiffs was counsel for the administrator, and prepared the writings connected with the sale. In the absence of any proof showing notice of some specific fraudulent conduct of the administrator, it would be a harsh rule to charge the counsel with implied notice. We however see no evidence of fraudulent conduct of the administrator in making the sale. Neither the fact that he sold it the third time before he found .a purchaser who would comply with his bid, nor the other fact that the deed is dated on the day the sale was confirmed, creates any presumption, of fraud. The case is barren of any facts to submit to the jury to find fraud in the purchase of the plaintiffs: Howard Express Co. <em>v. </em>Wile, 14 P. F. Smith 201; Phila. &amp; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Yerger, 23 Id. 121. The decree therefore of the Orphans\u2019 Court confirming a sale made under its order for the payment of debts is conelusive evidence that the title of the decedent was legally transferred to the purchasers: Iddings <em>v. </em>Cairns <em>et al., </em>2 Grant 88. The learned judge was not sufficiently careful to submit facts only to the jury. He inadvertently blended them with questions of law and conclusions of law. As a whole the general effect of the charge was calculated to mislead the jury as to their power and duties. Thus, in the second assignment, they were told to determine the question whether the settlement of the estate was done \u201c in such a manner as was required by law.\u201d In the sixth it was left to them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>determine whether \u201c there was such a delivery to and possession by the plaintiffs as is contemplated by law.\u201d In the seventh it was left to them to find whether \u201c the proceedings were regular and in accordance with the Act of Assembly.\u201d In the point covered by the fourth assignment, the defendants requested the court to charge the jury if there was any fraud, legal or actual, their verdict should be for the defendants. In answer to this, and ignoring all distinction between legal or actual fraud, or indicating what constituted either, the court said, \u201c If the testimony satisfies you that there was fraud and collusion in the sale and purchase of this land by the administrator and James Potts, it avoids the sale and renders the contract null and void. It is a question for you''to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">The court did not-instruct the jury what duty any Act of Assembly or any law imposed on the administrator. They were not informed by the court what acts were necessary to make the sale legal,, nor what would make it illegal. They were told what acts and conduct, the defendants alleged were fraudulent, and then the .court submitted to them to say whether those acts constituted fraud. They were not informed whether they were evidence of actual or legal fraud, or what constituted either. Whether the record showed a valid confirmation of the sale was for the court to decide. It was error to submit it to the jury. The testimony consisted of record, documentary, and parol evidence. It was manifest error to throw it all into the jury-box together, and say, as in the twelfth assignment, it was for them \u201c to determine whether or not, upon all the evidence, the verdict be for the plaintiffs or the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">2. If possession of the premises was given to the plaintiffs as shown by the sheriff\u2019s return on the writ, and corroborated by the testimony of the sheriff and the plaintiffs, it stopped the running of the statute; and it was error to charge substantially that it was necessary for the purchasers to have put a tenant in possession under them. If no person was in the house when the sheriff went with the plaintiffs to deliver possession to them, and the sheriff removed the goods from the house ; if he then and there proclaimed that he gave them possession of the premises, and they accepted the same and took possession, the delivery was full and complete. Its validity was not impaired by the defendants having returned to the occupancy of the house on the day following and continuing in the possession thereof.' Hence, if the defendants claimed under the will of John Harshberger, they could not have acquired title under the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">As an. abstract proposition, we cannot say there is error in the answer covered by the eleventh assignment. The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth point assumes certain facts to exist, which are for the jury to pass upon. So we are unable to say there is positive error covered by the eighth assignment. The other assignments are substantially sustained, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
