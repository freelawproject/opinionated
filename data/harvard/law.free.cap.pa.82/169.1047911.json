Douglas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-11\">The case was this:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-12\">In the end of 1849, Jacob Landis, of York county, died intestate, leaving to survive him his widow, Catharine Landis, and a daughter, Mary, then but a few weeks old. In April 1851, the Orphans\u2019 Court of York county appointed Jacob Ehrhart guardian of Mary Landis. In June 1851, when the daughter was about eighteen months old, Catharine Landis married James H. Bratten, and from that time until Bratten\u2019s death, in 1868, Mary Landis lived with her mother and step-father at Chambersburg, in Franklin county. As to the circumstances under which she lived with her step-father, Mrs. Susan Frey testified as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-13\">\u201c Mr. Bratten was one day in our house and talking to Mr. Frey; he said in my presence, in reply to Mr. Frey\u2019s saying to him about marrying a widow with a child, that <em>\u2018 </em>that made no difference to him, that he intended-to raise that child as his own, that he had promised his wife before he married her that as long as he had bread, she should have it \u2014 that he would care for and support the child as if it was his own.\u2019 He did do so; the child was in his family the same as his own children; when he bought for them, he bought for her just the same; if he gave to his own daughters for spending money or for church, he gave to her also; she called him <em>\u2018 </em>father,\u2019 and he called her <em>\u2018 </em>daughter,\u2019 or \u2018 Mary.\u2019 She was a young lady when he died; she did a good deal of work in the family, more I think, than any of them; she nursed the children, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>when I was there, I saw her cooking just the same as his own children.

Easton entered the necessary security, with James H. Bratten as his surety. In 1860, Easton being desirous of withdrawing from the trust, filed his account in the proper office in Franklin county, in which he charged himself with $600, under date of April 1st 1857, as \u201c money received when appointed,\u201d and claimed credit for the following :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">April 1st 1857 \u2014 Paid Jas.

It has neither law nor justice on its side. The opinion of the court in Duffey <em>v. </em>Duffey, 8 Wright 402, is direct to the point \u2014 that when a step-father takes his step-child to reside with him as one of his family, while the one cannot claim for services the other is precluded from compensation for expenditures. The facts reported by the auditor and fully sustained by the evidence make this a very strong case in illustration of the justice of that ruling. The only fact relied on to meet it \u2014 that the former guardian was allowed in his account a small sum paid to the step-father \u2014 is a very insignificant one, when we consider that he was the surety for that guardian, and was his successor in the trust. In the settlement of the account of Easton, before his discharge and the appointment of Bratten to succeed him the wise provision of the 11th section of the Act of March 1832, Pamph. L. 192, \u201c that in every such case it shall be the duty of the court to appoint some suitable person to appear and act for the ward in respect of the settlement of such account,\u201d seems to-have been entirely overlooked. We have not the question of the conclusiveness of that settlement upon the ward now before us. No exception was taken on the subject of the allowance of the f 100, for which Easton had credit in his settlement as paid to Bratten. The account of the latter settled during the minority of the ward, and hot accompanied or followed thereupon by his discharge, stands upon an entirely different footing. All partial accounts of guardians during the minority of the ward, whether filed in the Register\u2019s office or in the office of the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>for settlement and confirmation, and even if they go through the forms of a settlement and confirmation are not conclusive upon the ward. Yeager\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 173. There was here no one to represent her and take care of her interest. The court cannot be expected to do so. They have not knowledge of the necessary facts to enable them to adjudicate. In the present instance <em>non constat </em>that the court were made acquainted with the relation between the guardian and ward. The names were different and there was nothing to indicate that any such relation existed. It is clear that the decision in Rhoads\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 186, has no application, but only to cases where the account is properly and legally presented for settlement and confirmation. The learned court below were therefore entirely right in dismissing the exception of the appellant and confirming the report of the auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
