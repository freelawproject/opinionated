Bowser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-15\">Emma Bowser, the plaintiff below, and defendant in error, was the daughter and only surviving child by his first wife, still a minor and suing in the name of her guardian, John Peeling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-16\">The case was referred, under the Act of the 9th April 1868, to William Hay, Esq., who filed his report awarding the premises to Emma Bowser, the plaintiff below. Exceptions were filed, dismissed by the court below and judgment entered on the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-17\">Samuel Bowser bought the premises m dispute, which consisted of about thirty acres, from Nathan T. Meads, for the sum of $2600, paid $600 in cash, and gave a judgment for the balance of the purchase-money, $2000, payable in annual instalments of $500 each. Meads assigned the judgment to Thomas W. Wantland. Bowser at once entered into possession of the premises, residing there with his first wife Ellen, until her decease. He commenced to keep a store on the premises, did a good business and seemed prosperous, and was himself an energetic and industrious man. He however made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>default in the first instalment, and Wantland\u2019s administrators issued execution on the judgment, the land was seized, condemned and sold by the sheriff to Ellen Bowser, the defendant\u2019s wife, for #2275, a deed executed by the sheriff, acknowledged, delivered and entered on record. To pay the purchase-money, she borrowed #1100 from Jonathan Neff, for which she gave a note or due bill to him, which she afterwards paid, Neff receiving part from her personally, and part from her husband, saying that she had sent it. The balance of the money she obtained from the Shrewsbury Bank on notes endorsed by her friends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">The wife Ellen had no estate of her own, either before her marriage or coming to her after her marriage. After the sale, the sign of the store \u201cSamuel Bowser\u201d remained, but the books, business, bills, &amp;e., were in her name. She at times attended in the store, but was sickly, and the business prospered in and by the hand of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">Ellen, the first wife, died on the 12th of June 1862, leaving two children, Emma, the plaintiff, and Frank, who died intestate, unmarried and without issue. Subsequently Samuel Bowser married Lillie, the defendant below, with whom he lived upon the premises until his decease, leaving four children by this marriage. After his marriage with Lillie, Samuel built upon the premises a barn, warehouse, carriage-house, wood-house, corn-crib and other buildings, and conducted the business of storekeeping until his decease. Lillie continued to reside there, and Emma brought this ejectment to recover the premises as heir of her mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">The referee held that the title vested in the first wife Ellen by gift from her husband, and though the title would not be good as against the creditors of her husband, it was good as against him, his heirs and all other persons. It was conceded that the present value of the property was about #3000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-9\">Exceptions were filed to this report, which were dismissed by the court and the report confirmed; and this action was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-10\"><em>W.

Curiam. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AmT\">This is not a case between a wife and her husband\u2019s creditors. The only question is whether the wife of Samuel B. Bowser was in the deed from the sheriff to her of the estate of her husband Samuel B. Bowser, a trustee for her husband. This must be alleged either on the ground that he purchased the property in her name to defraud his creditors, or that he paid the money for his own use. But he cannot allege his own fraud as a ground of title; and on the ground of payment of the purchase-money, his wife did not stand in the relation of a stranger. Purchasing in the name of his wife the presumption is that it was a gift to her, and this was corroborated by his after conduct. Neither he nor she did any act to question her title.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
