The county of Westmoreland brought suit, on the 4th June 1857, against his administrator, to recover the costs on an indictment in the Oyer and Terminer for homicide, and on the 23d February 1859 judgment was obtained by the county for $625.55. On the 9th March 1865 a sci. fa. was issued on this judgment against Corrigan\u2019s administrator, with notice to his heirs and devisees, but no proceedings had on the sci. fa. until the 10th February 1874, when there was a trial and verdict rendered in favor of the county, as against the administrator, but in favor of the devisee; no judgment was ever entered on this verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">In July 1868 Corrigan\u2019s real estate was sold for the payment of his debts, under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court. This case arises upon the distribution of the proceeds of this sale. The court below decreed the payment of the judgment of the county in full, and awarded the residue of the fund to A. J. Corrigan, devisee of the real estate sold under the will, and rejected the claim of one McDermott. The claim of McDermott was against A. J. Corrigan \u2022as owner of the real estate, and by agreement of parties was to be paid only in case the judgment- of the court was adjudged not to be a lien upon the real estate. From this decree Foster, assignee of McDermott, and Laird, guardian of A. J. Corrigan, appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-7\"><em>IT. P. Foster, p, </em>p. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A89I\">Steel <em>v. </em>Henry, 9 Watts 523, decided, under the Act of 1797, a lien could not by any proceeding in a scire facias or otherwise be extended beyond twelve years from the death of the decedent. The Act of 1834 reduced the period to ten years, and made no other change. \u2022 So also in Maus <em>v. </em>Hammel, 1 Jones 228. The intention of the legislature was to produce a settlement of estates in a reasonable time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-8\"><em>H. P.

That action, when prosecuted, terminated in favor of the devisee, and although the land was sold in 1868, still the fund was only for the payment of valid debts judicially ascertained to be such against the devisee: Atherton <em>v. </em>Atherton, 2 Barr 112; Walthour <em>v. </em>Grosser, 8 Casey 259; Burdley\u2019s Appeal, 19 P. F. Smith 295.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-9\"><em>Fdgar Qowan, </em>for the appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqlu\">The judgment entered in February 1859 continued the lien for ten years from the death of the decedent: Penn <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 2 Watts 53. The scire facias issued in March 1865 had the same effect as in ordinary judgments <em>inter vivos, </em>and continued the lien for five years: Payne <em>v. </em>Craft, 7 W. &amp; S. 458. Judgment was not recovered against the devisee because the Orphans\u2019 Court sale in 1858 threw the lien of the debt upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the fund. In Payne <em>v. </em>Craft, supra, the lien- was extended for twenty years.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The judgment of the Supreme Court.was entered November 6th 1876,</p>\n<author id=\"b497-7\">Per Curiam. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AKe\">The cases of Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark, 7 Watts 224; Steel <em>v. </em>Henry, 9 Id. 623, and Payne <em>v. </em>Craft, 7 W. &amp; S. 468, followed by later cases, settle the law, that a suit brought against the personal representative of a decedent, within seven years after his decease, for a debt owing by him at his death, continues the lien of the debt against the real estate for a period of twelve years from the time of his decease, under the Act of 1797, and that a proceeding to revive within five years next following the seven years will continue the lien beyond the termination of the twelve years. It is also settled that it is immaterial how soon judgment is obtained in the first period of seven years; the lien runs to the termination of the period of twelve years without a further proceeding. In Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark, <em>supra </em>225, Justice Kennedy says: \u201c It is obvious that in the first case, when the judgment is obtained within the seven years, the five years ought not to commence before the expiration of the.latter period; for if it were to be held to commence-from the date of the judgment, it would be placing the vigilant creditor in a worse condition than the negligent one, and also be contrary to the express, as well as the plain, import and meaning of the Act of 1797, which terminates the lien only after a lapse of seven years from the death of the debtor.\u201d So the lien of the debt may be continued after the period of twelve years, by proper revivals. This is decided in Payne <em>v. </em>Craft, <em>supra, </em>where the death took place in 1813 and the sale of the real estate in 1833, and the lien was held to be continued by entries on the docket by agreement that the judgment should be revived without a scire facias. The later cases run in the same line, only that in cases, where the death has taken place since the Act of 26th February 1834 went into effect, the first period is <em>five </em>instead of seven, and the entire period <em>ten </em>instead of twelve years, and the widow and heirs or devisees must be made parties. In this case the scire facias to revive the judgment of the county was issued against all the parties within the ten years, and the sale of the property took place within three years thereafter, and consequently within the duration of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The decree of distribution was correct and it is therefore affirmed with costs to be paid by the appellants and their appeals are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
