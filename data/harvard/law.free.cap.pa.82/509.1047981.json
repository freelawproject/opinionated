The testator further expressed an intention that the trustee should hold the property with full power to sell and dispose of the same as occasion might offer, so that a partition might he unnecessary. He further provided that another portion of his property (his mahsion house) should, in certain contingencies, go into the \u201c possession, charge and trust of H. with the above estate to be held and managed by him in like trust;\u201d and also that the \u201c common fund for distribution among his daughters\u201d should consist, inter alia, of the <em>sales </em>of the real estate set forth in the petition and the mansion house. Some years after W.\u2019s. death, H., as trustee, and in behalf of his wife, one of the daughters of <em>W., </em>filed a petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court for the partition of that portion of the property which then remained unsold. Upon a demurrer thereto, the court below dismissed the petition: <em>Held </em>(affirming the court below), that the daughters took no estate which could be the subject of partition. <em>Held, </em>also, that the trust to sell was the main purpose of the will, and that the trustee would be answerable to the Orphans\u2019 Court, under sect. <em>4 </em>of the Act of 29th March 1832, and the Act of 16th June 1836, for the due exercise of this power, and therefore the power to rent did not tend to create a perpetuity.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b509-6\">October 80th 1876.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Api\">'Before Agnew, C.

If they bad not, whether by reason of an existing active trust inconsistent with any estate, possession and control on their part, or by reason of an absolute conversion into personalty, the petition must be denied; otherwise the will of the testator would be frustrated. That they had no such seisin or possession at law or in equity seems to be very clear. They had no estate as heirs at law, for the will took the estate out of the course of descent, and cast it upon the trustee for purposes which concern only a limited number of the heirs, viz.: these four daughters. As to these- daughters no trust of the land itself was created, but a trust only of the rents until sale, and then a trust of the purchase-money; while the nature of the trust of the rents, as we shall see presently, is inconsistent with such a devise of the income or profits as carries an estate in the land. The devise is to James A. Hutchison, his heirs and assigns. This carried the whole legal estate to him, at law. The devise was for \u201cthe purposes, trusts and conditions <em>hereinafter mentioned, </em>and <em>for no other </em>purposes.\u201d These hereinafter-mentioned trusts, therefore, constitute all the equities of the trust, for the testator says there shall be none other. The first condition of the trust is, \u201c He shall take the said property into his possession and eharge.\u201d This is inconsistent with a partition, which necessarily invests the purparts in the daughtei\u2019S, or carries the property to an immediate publie sale, on terms differing from those the discretion of the trustee may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>dictate. The will then continues, \u201c and at his option either <em>rent </em>the same, upon such terms as <em>he </em>may conceive conducive to the interests of the trusts with which <em>he </em>is hereby invested, or <em>malee sale </em>of the same for .such prices, upon such terms, and upon such securities as <em>he </em>may deem safe, and execute such contracts and deeds, in fee simple or otherwise, as may be necessary to secure titles to the purchasers, according to the terms of their respective contracts.\u201d These are the two and the only purposes, the testator having said, \u201c and for no other purposes,\u201d of the trust declared of the property itself, and both are inconsistent with any estate in the land in these daughters. A partition would take the land out of the \u201c possession and charge\u201d of the trustee, and prevent the exercise of either power to rent or to sell \u201c on such terms and securities as <em>he </em>might deem safe.\u201d He could make neither contracts nor conveyances, for the course of partition would supplant all his powers. The trusts as to the daughters are express, and therefore inconsistent with an implied trust, by reason of income or otherwise, for the will proceeds: \u201c And in further trust, that the said James A. Hutchison, upon the receipt of the rents or purchase-money, shall pay the same over to my daughters Maria D. Sanders, Catherine H. Hutchison, Sophia B. Carr, and Henrietta C. Wilkins, their heirs and assigns in equal proportions,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cit being my intention by this clause of my devise that my trustee shall <em>hold the property </em>for the uses and objects mentioned,\u201d thus excluding the daughters, \u201c with full power to sell and dispose of the same <em>as occasion may </em>offer, so that a partition of the property may become unnecessary.\u201d This clause is very demonstrative of the intent of the testator. Thus he says he intends that the trustee shall hold the property and <em>sell </em>(not rent) and dispose of the same as <em>occasion may offer. </em>The prime intent is to sell whenever circumstances make it \u201c conducive to the interest of the trusts,\u201d as he had before said. But as occasions may not offer when it would be conducive to these interests to sell, he had therefore given the option to rent. These too were intended to be the means which would render a partition unnecessary. This is an answer also to the argument that the option of the trustee to rent might be executed so as to create a perpetuity. Such an option would be an abuse of his discretion and contrary to the main and plain intent of the testator that he should make sales as occasion should offer. The option to rent is evidently secondary and ancillary to the power to sell. The main intent deduced from this clause is' made more manifest in the next succeeding paragraph but one, which declares that the common fund for distribution amongst these four daughters in this testament will consist of the sales of his real estate in Wilkins and Peebles townships, &amp;c. This intention is further aided by the fourth paragraph following, in which he declares that the direct devise of the Homewood mansion and the described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>sixty-seven acres annexed to it, should after the death of his wife \u201c go into the possession, charge and trust with the other estate, to be held and managed in like trust as is hereinbefore confided to him, James A. Hutchison, in the character of my trustee, as herein-before mentioned.\u201d Such being the intention of the testator, that the trust to sell shall be the main purpose, and the option to rent only secondary and ancillary, the trustee would clearly become amenable to the control of the Orphans\u2019 Court under the 4th sect, of the Act of 29th March 1832 relating to Orphans\u2019 Courts, which pi'ovides that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court shall extend to and embrace \u201c generally all cases within their respective counties wherein executors, administrators, guardians or <em>trustees </em>are or may be possessed of, or undertake the care and management of, or are in any way accountable for any <em>real </em>or personal estate of a decedent, and such jurisdiction shall be exercised in the manner hereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The 19th section of the Act of 16th June 1836, relating to the jurisdictions and powers of the courts is a substantial re-enactment of the same provision's. This subject was carefully considered in Dundas\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 325, in which it was held, under these clauses, that the Orphans\u2019 Court has power to control testae mentary trustees in the exercise of powers over real and personal estate. In this case therefore the trustee, were he to undertake to continue to lease contrary to the plain intent of the testator, that his real estate should be sold as <em>occasion should offer </em>as a fund for these daughters, would be amenable to the control of the Orphans\u2019 Court. It is very clear it would be an abuse of his option to lease, were he to make leases conflicting with the testator\u2019s intent to sell and furnish such a fund for distribution among his daughters, or contrary to the policy of law which forbids perpetuities. The lessees themselves may, under the decision in Dundas\u2019s Appeal, be made parties to the citation, if it should be necessary. The trust therefore being inconsistent with partition and possession of the daughters, and no estate in the land being conferred on them, the petition was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-8\">Sharswood and Paxson, JJ., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
