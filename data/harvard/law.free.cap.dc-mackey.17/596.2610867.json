District of Columbia, and said action was brought in violation of Section 767, R. S. D. O.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">To this motion an affidavit was attached, stating \u201cthat at the time this action was brought the defendant was not an inhabitant of, or found within,\u2018the District of Columbia; that he left said District May 1, 1880, for the purpose of residing in Mexico for an indefinite period, and did not return to said District until July, 1887.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">The motion was thereupon certified to the General Term for hearing in the first instance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-6\">Messrs.

If there is anything whatever in the defendant\u2019s claim it should be presented by a plea to the jurisdiction, or to the disability of the defendant. (Rule 22.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-9\">2. If raised by a plea, so that an issue could be made, it could be shown that the defendant was, in contemplation of law, an inhabitant of the District when the suit was filed, and ever since. He always retained his domicile here, called 'this his home, and never left it except for a temporary business sojourn in Mexico. He has always remained a citizen of the United States, and had no other domicile therein save in this District. For the purposes of this section the words \u201c inhabitant of \u201d are equivalent to the words \u201chaving a domicile in.\u201d Mitchell <em>vs. </em>U. S., 21 Wall., 353; Wharton on Conflict of Laws, 20-55;'3 Am. L. Reg., 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-10\">3. The said Section 767 must bo construed in connection with the other parts of the Revised Statutes; and giving-force to them, the language must be held-to mean that no personal action can be maintained and prosecuted to judgment without personal service can be had on the defendant. Actions may at any time be brought \u2014 that is, commenced\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>against any person, and if he cannot be found (which is not known until the marshal makes inquiry and returns the summons), then in certain cases publication is substituted for personal service. (Sec. 787.) In purely personal actions the suit is not dismissed on a return of \u201c not found,\u201d but it remains on the docket, although it can never ripen into judgment until process is served or waived. Whenever after suit entered the defendant comes into ihe District he is amenable to the.process of the Court. An <em>alias </em>summons may be taken out at any time, and if the defendant shall be then found the suit will proceed regularly from that point.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b610-4\">Mr. Chiee Justice Bingi-iam</author>\n<p id=\"ApK\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On the 18th day of August, 1880, the plaintiff commenced an action at law against the defendant to recover from him the unpaid balance of a decree in equity. A summons was issued and returned not found. Subsequently another summons was issued, which was also returned not found. On the 6th day of October, 1887, an <em>alias </em>summons was returned with the following endorsement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201cService accepted for Alexander R. Shepherd, October 6, 1887. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4O\">... ri -r&gt; \u201cA. C. Bradley,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\n<em>\u201cAttorney.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">On the 2d day of November, 1887, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, for the reason that at the time the action was brought the defendant was not an inhabitant of, or found within, the District of Columbia, and because said action was brought in violation of Section 767 of the Revised Statutes of the District of Columbia. This was supported by affidavit. The case was certified to the General Term to be heard upon this motion. Section 767 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the Revised Statutes for the District of Columbia, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">\u201c No action or suit shall be brought in the Supreme Court by original process against any person who shall not be an inhabitant of or found within the District, except as otherwise specially provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The claim made by the defendant is that as he was not an inhabitant of the District of Columbia at the date of the commencement of the action, and was not then found within the District, the action cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">It is moreover, claimed, that not only can it not be maintained, but that no action can be brought. That the fact that summons was returned <em>non est, </em>is proof incontestible that the suit should not have been commenced, and that its commencement was in violation of positive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On the other hand, it is claimed that the statute, when properly construed, merely means that a suit cannot be maintained; that is, cannot be proceeded with in this District, unless the party is an inhabitant of the District or is found within the District; and that upon a return of not found, another summons may be issued and the case may remain as commenced until the party may obtain service upon the defendant, and that when that service is made the case may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">From the affidavit filed with the motion, it is not shown to us that the defendant had not a domicile in this District; \u25a0that in the proper sense of the term he was not an inhabitant of the District. It is simply stated that before the commencement of this action he had gone to Mexico to stay an indefinite period of time. Such a circumstance does not divest a person of citizenship in this District, as we understand it. He may still have his domicile here, and still be intending to return to this District after having accomplished the business for which he went away. It is not stated in this affidavit that he left the District with the intention of becoming a citizen of another country or State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and not returning, or that while away he did not look to this District as his home. There is no proof, in fact produced upon this motion to show that the defendant was not an inhabitant of the District. The mere fact that he may have temporarily left the District does not, as we think, change his status in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">We are of the opinion, also, that this statute properly construed, is to be taken as meaning that no action or suit shall be <em>maintained </em>in this Court by original process against any . person who is not an inhabitant of or found within the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It is obvious that the object of this motion is to enable the defendant to plead the Statute of Limitations to any action that might hereafter be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We think the construction which we adopt is one in accordance with a proper understanding of the statute and the real intention of Congress. Parties have a right to bring their actions, for the purpose of preventing the Statute of Limitations from becoming a bar thereto. They have a right to exercise all diligence within their power to preserve their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\n<em>The motion to dismiss will therefore he overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
