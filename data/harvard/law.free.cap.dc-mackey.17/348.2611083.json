The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>defendant also asked affirmative relief for the injury and damages he had sustained through the complainant\u2019s nonperformance of his contract, and for the serious injury to the property caused by the unskillful manner in-which the work was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\">It was admitted on the hearing that the evidence showed that the work was not performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the contract and that the materials were not all of the required quality. It was claimed, however, that the contract had been substantially complied with and that the expenditure of a comparatively small amount of money (about $200) would put the work in the condition provided for by the contract. On the other hand, it was contended by the defendant that the evidence showed the materials furnished to have been so inferior and the work so defectively executed as to largely depreciate the value of - the building. It was also claimed that the plaintiff had willfully and fraudulently failed to comply with the terms of his contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">The Court below dismissed the bill on the ground that the plaintiff, having failed to fully perform his contract, was not entitled to the lien given by the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-6\">Mr. Leon Tobriner, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-7\">Plaintiff is entitled t\u00f3 a decree for at least $1,115.50 that being, the difference between the contract price and the amount claimed to be necessary to alter the work to conform to the specifications. 2 Smith, Lead. Cas., 8th ed., 21; Dermott <em>vs. </em>Jones, 2 Wall., 1; Burns <em>vs. </em>Whittlesy, 2 Mac Arthur, 189.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-8\">Messrs. Edwards &amp; Barnard, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-9\">The contract is not under seal, but is an entirety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-10\">Proof of full performance by the complainant is, therefore, \u25a0a condition precedent to his right to recovery. 2 Pars. Cont., pp. 658-675; Add. Cont, 925; Cutter <em>vs. </em>Powell, 6 Term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Rep., 320; Dermott <em>vs. </em>Jones, 2 Wall., 1; Jones <em>vs. </em>U. S., 96 U. S., 24, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\">It is the province of courts to enforce contracts \u2014 not to make or modify them. When there is neither fraud, accident nor mistake the exercising of dispensing power is not a judicial function. The Harriman, 9 Wall., 161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">The complainant concedes it to be necessary to all the work in a number of particulars to conform to the contract, for he says he \u201cis entitled to a decree for at least $1,115.50, the difference between the contract price and the amount alleged to be necessary to alter the work to conform to the specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-6\">This being so, the complainant is \u201cout of court.\u201d Nonperformance in part being admitted, it is unnecessary even to read the defendant\u2019s proofs to show it. The complainant must stand or fall by his contract. No case for a <em>quantum meruit </em>is made by the bill. The complainant is entitled to recover the full price agreed to be paid, or nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-7\">\u201cWhenever compensation or an equivalent is claimed by a party in return for the performance of conditions for which such compensation or equivalent has been stipulated, the person so claiming is bound to show a fulfillment in good faith of these conditions; and the party against whom the claim shall be made shall be permitted to repel it by proof of an entire failure to perform, or of an imperfect or unfaithful performance, or by proof of injurious conse* quences resulting from either of these delinquencies, and shall not be driven exclusively to his cross action.\u201d Van Buren <em>vs. </em>Diggs, 11 How., 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-8\">The affirmative relief asked by the defendant should be granted, a formal cross-bill not being necessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-9\">Mr.. Chief Justice Bingham</author>\n<p id=\"AvX\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">We think the statute gives the lien as security for the payment of whatever the party may be entitled to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>on his contract. If the failure to fully perform his contract would disentitle him to recover anything at all, of course there would he no lien, and the bill should be dismissed. Upon that point the Supreme Court of \u25a0 the United States has held, and such must be the rule with us, that where there appears to have been a <em>bona fide </em>intention to comply with the contract, but for some reason or other not involving a fraudulent purpose there has been a partial failure, there may be a recovery of the contract price, less the amount required to put the work in that condition which the contract calls for.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Of course, if there has been a fraudulent disregard of the contract, nothing whatever could be recovered in any court. The question of just how much the plaintiff should recover in this case is one, however, which, we think, ought to be decided at law by a jury. We shall, therefore, send this case back, with direction that issues be made up to determine -what, if anything, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The issues should be made broad enough to include every question that might be made upon suit originally brought at law to recover on the contract; and whatever amount, if any, the jury shall find for the plaintiff, the Court sitting in equity will enforce payment of by a decree against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Case remanded accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
