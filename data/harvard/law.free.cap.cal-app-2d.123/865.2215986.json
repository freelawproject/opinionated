Lacey, doing business as Lacey Trucking Company. Defendant Fordiee was operating the truck at the time of the accident. Mr. Lacey is a resident of and has his principal place of business in Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Upon issue being joined, defendants filed identical motions in each case for a change of venue to Madera County upon the ground that \u201cthe convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice will be promoted by changing the place of trial from said Los Angeles County to said Madera County.\u201d The motions were based on Code of Civil Procedure, section 397, subdivision 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Defendants appeal from the orders denying their motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Preliminarily, it should be noted that these actions were properly filed in Los Angeles County since this county is the residence of defendant Lacey and his principal place of business is located here. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">In an affidavit in support of the motions by Bobert M. Stevenson, one of counsel \u2022 for defendants, it appears that defendant Fordice is a resident of Bakersfield, Kern County, and is employed \u201cas a line haul driver\u201d by defendant Lacey between Bakersfield and various points north of the city of Madera, in the State of California; \u201cthat leaving said city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>for any length of time will prevent him from making his normal trips in the course of his employment ...\u201d This affidavit then states that one Himes was \u201cpresent at the scene of the accident\u201d and gives a resum\u00e9 of his anticipated testimony. Mr. Himes is a resident of the city of Kerman, Fresno County, and \u201cis self-employed in and around the said city\u201d which is approximately 15 miles south of Madera and 230 miles north of Los Angeles. Leaving Kerman for any length of time, says the affidavit, \u201cwill seriously interfere with his occupation causing him great loss\u201d and, continues the affidavit of counsel, \u201cit will be more convenient for him to appear in Madera than in Los Angeles.\u201d The other two witnesses are members of the California Highway Patrol stationed in Madera who investigated the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Two affidavits were filed in opposition to the motions. One was by Manuel Hermosa, an investigator for counsel for plaintiffs, who stated that pursuant to such employment, \u201che contacted witnesses in Madera and canvassed the neighborhood adjacent to the scene of the accident; that during the course of his investigation he interviewed approximately fifteen (15) or twenty (20) people; that in the course of these interviews, the majority of the people interviewed told him that they were not interested, that it was just a bunch of Mexicans that had been hurt, reflecting a general prejudice against Mexican workers in this area; that thereafter, because of this expressed prejudice against the Mexican workers in this area, he inquired generally as to whether or not a fair trial could be had in Madera; that due to the general prejudice he experienced in interviewing witnesses, it is his opinion that a fair trial could not be had by Mexican workers in the courts of Madera.\u201d The other affidavit was by D. W. Brobst, one of counsel for plaintiffs. He states that these cases will be tried before a jury; that he has talked to investigator Hermosa and as a result of the information received from him \u201cthat there is a general prejudice in and around Madera against Mexican workers\u201d it is his opinion that \u201cit would be extremely difficult to obtain an unbiased jury\u201d due to this general feeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. Subdivision 3 of section 397, Code of Civil Procedure, contains conjunctive conditions, both of which must be established before the moving party is entitled to change the place of trial; \u201cit is not only necessary that the convenience of witnesses be promoted but equally essential that \u2018the ends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>of justice\u2019 be promoted before the court is justified in granting the motion.\u201d <em>(Churchill </em>v. <em>White, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 503, 507 [259 P.2d 974]; <em>Willingham </em>v. <em>Pecora, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 289, 295 [112 P.2d 328]; <em>Figley </em>v. <em>California Arrow Airlines, </em>111 Cal.App.2d 285, 286 [244 P.2d 472].)  \u201cThe burden of proving both of these conditions is necessarily on the moving party.\u201d <em>(Willingham </em>v. <em>Pecora, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">A motion for a change of the place of trial on the ground that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly appears, as a matter of law, that there has been an abuse of such discretion. <em>(Sowers </em>v. <em>Sowers, </em>127 Cal.App. 579, 582 [16 P.2d 176]; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Schubert, 101 </em>Cal.App.2d 638, 642 [226 P.2d 50].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Upon examination of the affidavit in support of the motion re convenience of witnesses it is immediately apparent that the convenience of Mr. Fordice cannot be considered in the absence of unusual circumstances since he is a party. <em>(Wrin </em>v. <em>Ohlandt, </em>213 Cal. 158, 160 [1 P.2d 991]; <em>Carnation Co. </em>v. <em>El Rey Cheese Co., </em>92 Cal.App.2d 726, 728 [208 P.2d 63].) As to the two highway patrolmen, both would testify to the same facts, so one officer\u2019s testimony would only be cumulative of the other and therefore unnecessary. It does not appear that one of these officers could not attend the trial in Los Angeles, or that such attendance would unduly interfere with the work of the office in Madera. Nor are any facts stated to support the conclusion of the affiant that the absence of a state highway patrolman for a brief period for the purpose of testifying to facts ascertained in the course of his official duties could cause him \u201cgreat loss.\u201d As to witness Himes, the nature of his business is not disclosed. It is simply stated that \u201che is self-employed in and around the city of Kerman\u201d in Fresno County. Whether his work is regular, intermittent or part time does not appear. No facts are stated in support of affiant\u2019s conclusion that his absence from Kerman \u201cfor any length of time will seriously interfere with his occupation causing him great loss.\u201d It does not appear that Himes was either unable or unwilling to come to Los Angeles to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">On the question of the convenience of witnesses it thus appears that the court was required to consider the convenience of only two, and that there is a conspicuous absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>of factual support for counsel\u2019s conclusion that it would cause these two men \u201cgreat loss\u201d to come to Los Angeles for this trial. The trial court no doubt took this into consideration in determining the weight to be given the affidavit in support of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">We come now to a consideration of the affidavits in opposition to the motions. While these affidavits are not in commendatory detail they are sufficient to raise the question as to whether or not these plaintiffs could likely obtain an unbiased jury and a fair trial in Madera County.  The weight to be given to these affidavits was of course for the trial court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Defendants assert that the record fails to show that plaintiffs are Mexican workers and therefore fails to show they fall within the class of persons against whom it is claimed prejudice exists in Madera County. It is true that plaintiffs are not specifically referred to as Mexican workers but the trial court could reasonably have drawn such an inference from the Hermosa affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Defendants further contend that plaintiffs have prematurely raised the question of the difficulty of their getting a fair trial in Madera County. They point out that subdivision 2 of section 397, Code of Civil Procedure, authorizes the court to change the place of trial \u201cWhen there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein,\u201d i.e., in the county where the action is then pending. Hence, they argue, a motion for a change of venue on this latter ground would have to be made in Madera County after the action had been transferred there. The answer to this argument is that plaintiffs .are not moving for a change of venue on the ground that an impartial trial cannot be had in Madera County, or upon any other ground. They are not making <em>any </em>motion. Defendants are making the motion for change of place of trial. One of the elements they must establish is that \u201cthe ends of justice would be promoted by the change.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 397, subd. 3.)  Plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits are addressed to that question, and properly so, for the ends of justice would not be promoted if, by the change, a fair trial was unlikely, for such a trial is the very essence of justice. To hold that matters relating to a fair trial could not be considered in this proceeding but only by the Madera Superior Court upon motion of the plaintiffs after the case had been transferred there, would not promote \u201cthe ends of justice,\u201d for it would mean both delay and extra expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>In passing on these motions it was the trial judge\u2019s responsibility, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to weigh and evaluate (1) the inconvenience to Mr. Himes and to one of the highway patrolmen from Madera if the trial is held in Los Angeles, and (2) the uncertainty of the plaintiffs\u2019 getting a fair trial if the litigation is transferred to Madera County. As was said in <em>Figley </em>v. <em>California Arrow Airlines, </em>111 Cal.App.2d 285 [244 P.2d 472], \u201cconsidering the showing on both sides, the trial court was confronted with a situation where it could have decided the motion either way and its action in deciding as it did cannot be here disturbed.\u201d (P. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Moore, P. J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-13\">Seetion 397, subdivision 3, reads in part as follows: \u201cThe court may, on motion, change the place of trial in the following cases: ... 3. When the conveniences of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change; . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
