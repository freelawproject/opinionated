But the court directed the jury, that this was a limitation in law; and that the defendants must prove, that the conditions had been complied</p><p id=\"pA4R\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS, \u2022with, and that they had not, by ceasing to build vessels, J forfeited their estate. The defendants, after a verdict for the plaintiffs, moved for a new trial, for this supposed misdirection of the court. <em>Hosmer </em>and Clark, in support of the motion, contended, that a fee vested in <em>Nathaniel Tyler </em>by the grant; and, consequently, that <em>Simon.

The deed of <em>Jasefih Arnold </em>conveyed nothing in the lands now in dispute to <em>Nathaniel Tyler, </em>but an estate for life; and this, on condition that the grantee, and his heirs, should use the land for a ship-yard. The word \u201c heirs,\u201d as used in that part of the deed, is only-descriptive of the person for whose use the estate is conveyed, and cannot enlarge the estate. The remainder,, therefore, in fee, to <em>Simon Arnold, </em>was well created; and the rights of the plaintiffs, who claim under <em>Simon, </em>were correctly stated in the charge to the jury.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
