A natural and unavoidable result of this sentencing scheme, leaving as it does wide discretion to the trial judge, is that the length of a defendant\u2019s sentence rests in part upon the perceptions, experience, and judgment of the individual judge before whom he is tried. Were the wisdom of this scheme before us, we might question its fairness and capacity for deterrence. However, since it is not, our views on the question of the vindictiveness in resentencing must be defined in the context of our present system.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">We agree with Justice Boyle that where a second sentence is imposed by a judge other than the judge who imposed the original sentence, we should not invoke a presumption of vindictiveness. Were we to do so, we would be denying the fundamental realities of the above-described system. Different judges may perceive the same information differently, and to invoke a presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>vindictiveness because of the fortuitous circumstances of facing one judge or another would make all sentences constitutionally suspect. Thus, we agree with the result she would reach in <em>People v Mazzie, </em>since the two sentences in that case were imposed by different judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The circumstances are quite different, however, where the same judge imposes both the original sentence and the sentence after retrial. Justice Boyle, citing guidance from the United States Supreme Court, would hold that where the trial judge himself, rather than an appellate court, orders the retrial, an increased sentence does not give rise to a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">It is no doubt true, as the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Texas v McCullough, </em>475 US 134; 106 S Ct 976; 89 L Ed 2d 104 (1986), that where a judge orders a retrial he expresses agreement that the defendant\u2019s \"claims\u201d have merit. However, by ordering a retrial, the judge expresses his approval only of the claims, usually of procedural error, upon which the grant of retrial is based. By granting a retrial, the judge does not necessarily express a belief that the once-convicted defendant is innocent of the crime charged, that a retrial will result in a different verdict, or that the court\u2019s time will be put to good use by retrying the defendant. It is, in addition, only natural that trial judges prefer to correct their own errors rather than to have them corrected by an appellate court, and we think that a tendency towards vindictiveness could appear in the former setting as often as in the latter. The problem was bluntly described by Justice Marshall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">The mere grant of a new trial motion can in no way be considered a guarantee, or even an indication, that the judge will harbor no resentment toward defendant as a result of his decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>exercise his statutory right to make such a motion. Even where a trial judge believes that the assignments of error are valid, she may still resent being given a choice between publicly conceding such errors and waiting for her judgment to be put to the test on appeal. This will be especially true when the errors alleged, however substantial as a matter of constitutional or statutory law, are considered by the judge not to cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s guilt. In such a case, the judge might well come to defendant\u2019s sentencing annoyed at having been forced to sit through a trial whose result was a foregone conclusion, and quite ready to vent that annoyance by giving the defendant a sentence stiffer than he otherwise would have received. Even if a trial judge is confident that her conduct of a trial was error-free, she may still grant a new trial if she has any doubts as to whether the courts reviewing her ruling will agree. In this situation, the feelings of resentment already alluded to might be augmented by the judge\u2019s annoyance with the courts that review her judgments. <em>[Texas v McCullough, supra, </em>150-151 (Marshall, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Since both sentences in <em>Spangler </em>were imposed by the same judge, we apply the presumption of vindictiveness. As long as there is such a presumption where the same judge resentences and increases the sentence, we fail to see a distinction where the necessity to resentence is occasioned by that judge rather than by a higher tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">So applied, the question arises in <em>Spangler </em>whether the presumption was overcome in light of the reasons enunciated by the trial judge at resentencing. We believe Justice Boyle is correct in urging adoption of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s view, as stated in <em>McCullough, </em>that the presumption may be overcome where the judge at resentencing possessed information which was unavailable to him at the initial sentencing, even where that information does not concern conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of the defendant occurring <em>after </em>the first trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The new data referred to by the judge at Spangler\u2019s resentencing were defendant\u2019s apparent commission of perjury, the fact that such perjury contained allegations of misconduct by a police officer, and the fact that defendant had committed the crime in spite of his ability to earn a substantial income.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We agree with Justice Boyle\u2019s view that perjury, like so many other subjective factors may, within the framework of our present sentencing scheme, be considered by the sentencing judge. Nevertheless, we cannot agree with her disposition of <em>Spangler </em>and remand the case for resentencing. Justice Boyle\u2019s approach would permit a judge to vindictively increase a sentence, but nevertheless overcome the presumption by making reference to a new piece of information regarding the defendant no matter how minor that information or how little relevance it might have in determining a fair and appropriate sentence. Instead the presumption of vindictiveness may be overcome only when the extent of the increase in the sentence bears a reasonable relationship to the new information.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Certainly, appellate courts need not second-guess every increased sentence justified by new information. However, in <em>Spangler, </em>the judge was fully apprised of the nature and circumstances of the crime when he first imposed sentence after defendant pled guilty. The only new information to which the judge referred at the resentencing was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>as just stated, his \"impression\u201d that defendant had perjured himself, the accusations made in the course of that perjury, and the fact that defendant committed the crime in spite of his earning capacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This data would, according to Justice Boyle, be sufficient to justify a thirty-five year, i.e., one hundred percent increase in defendant\u2019s minimum sentence for first-degree criminal sexual conduct and an increase from thirty-five years to life as the minimum sentence for armed robbery. These increases do not, in our view, bear a reasonable relationship to the new information. We, therefore, hold that the presumption of vindictiveness was not overcome in <em>Spangler </em>and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with the principle herein defined.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-6\">Archer, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b245-7\">Levin and Cavanagh, JJ. Proceeding arguendo on the premise that perjury may be considered by the sentencing judge, we concur in Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> In <em>Payne, </em>we stated that our view as to what information could serve to overcome the presumption of vindictiveness was subject to change if we were supplied with \"clarification ... by the United States Supreme Court . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. Justice Boyle correctly notes that <em>McCullough </em>provides such clarification. However, she also seems to indicate that our wait for clarification went to all aspects of the <em>Payne </em>decision. In fact, we did not seek \"clarification\u201d in <em>Payne </em>as to when the presumption should be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> Justice Boyle claims that the testimony of the victim provided new information as to the seriousness of the crime. The testimony does indeed recount the commission of a heinous crime. However, the trial judge did not, at resentencing, refer to that testimony. While the judge did refer in general to the cruelty of the crime, the reference did not go beyond the judge\u2019s statement at the original sentencing that defendant is \"one of the most vicious persons that have come before me . . . .\u201d In addition, the length of the original sentence, thirty-five years, indicates that the judge was indeed aware at that time of the details of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">It is, of course, possible that the judge did have the victim\u2019s testimony in mind when he increased the sentence. However, appellate review would be meaningless if we were to presume that any new material raised during the second proceeding must have been the basis for the sentence increase. Therefore trial judges, when resentencing defendants, must state on the record upon what new information they are basing any increase in the length of the sentence. Since in this case the trial judge did not state that the victim\u2019s testimony led him to increase the sentence, we do not believe we should consider that testimony as relevant to our review of the sentence increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>The issue raised in these two cases, consolidated for purposes of appeal, is whether the trial courts properly imposed greater sentences upon reconviction after their guilty pleas were set aside.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In deciding this issue, we are also required to determine the continued vitality of <em>People v Payne, </em>386 Mich 84; 191 NW2d 375 (1971), in light of recent United States Supreme Court decisions. In both <em>Mazzie </em>and <em>Spangler, </em>we would affirm the decisions of the Court of Appeals, finding that, in both cases, it was proper to impose a greater sentence upon reconviction. We would further find that the rule articulated in <em>People v Payne </em>is no longer viable in this state as it was based on an erroneous interpretation of the due process requirements set out by the United States Supreme Court in <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In <em>Mazzie, </em>the defendant was initially charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping. He pleaded guilty but mentally ill of second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain and, in return, the premeditated murder and kidnapping counts were dismissed. Mazzie was sentenced to twenty-five to fifty years, in accordance with a sentence bargain. Over a year later, the defendant filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>motion for a new trial, which was granted by the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">A jury trial was held, and, after the defendant was found guilty of second-degree murder and kidnapping, he was sentenced to seventy-five to one hundred fifty years for the murder conviction and to life for the kidnapping conviction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the murder conviction, but reversed the kidnapping conviction on the basis of <em>People v McMiller, </em>389 Mich 425; 208 NW2d 451 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals opined that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Pearce </em>in <em>Payne </em>was incorrect, relying on <em>Wasman v United States, </em>468 US 559; 104 S Ct 3217; 82 L Ed 2d 424 (1984). We granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In <em>Spangler, </em>the defendant was originally charged with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, one count of armed robbery, and one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. On the first day of trial, Spangler pleaded guilty of one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and of the armed robbery count in exchange for dismissal of the other charges. He was sentenced to thirty-five to two hundred years on both counts. Defendant subsequently filed a motion to withdraw his plea, alleging that his former attorney had promised him a minimum sentence below that imposed by the trial court. After a hearing on the matter, the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion, setting aside the plea of guilty and awarding a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s motion to reinstate the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>missed charges was granted, and the defendant, after a jury trial, was found guilty of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, one count of armed robbery, and one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. He received sentences of sixty to two hundred years, seventy to two hundred years, two life sentences, and ten to fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Defendant appealed in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction. Spangler then sought leave to appeal in this Court, raising several issues, including the issue of the greater sentence upon reconviction. We granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We begin first with the primary issue in these two cases, namely, under what circumstances may a greater sentence be imposed upon reconviction. The United States Supreme Court first addressed this issue in <em>Pearce, supra, </em>p 723:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">[NJeither the double jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposes an absolute bar to a more severe sentence upon reconviction. A trial judge is not constitutionally precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original sentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant\u2019s \"life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.\u201d <em>Williams v New York, </em>337 US 241, 245 [69 S Ct 1079; 93 L Ed 1337 (1949)]. Such information may come to the judge\u2019s attention from evidence adduced at the second trial itself, from a new presentence investigation, from the defendant\u2019s prison record, or possibly from other sources. The freedom of a sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>judge to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the first conviction in imposing a new sentence is no more than consonant with the principle, fully approved in <em>Williams v New York, supra, </em>that a State may adopt the \"prevalent modern philosophy of penology that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.\u201d [337 US] at 247.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The Court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">Due process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal. <em>[Id., </em>pp 725-726.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">While it is true that the above-quoted language has caused considerable confusion and debate, see, e.g., cases cited in <em>People v Payne, supra, </em>p 95, it is clear that the focus of the due process concerns expressed in <em>Pearce </em>was on the possibility of vindictiveness playing a part in the second sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To address this concern the Court fashioned a prophylactic<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rule applying a \" 'presumption of vindictiveness, which may be overcome only by objective information in the record justifying the increased sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v Goodwin, </em>457 US 368, 374; 102 S Ct 2485; 73 L Ed 2d 74 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">This Court, in <em>Payne, </em>interpreted language in <em>Pearce, </em>which stated that the reasons posited for a greater sentence must be based on \"identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding,\u201d 395 US 726. We held, in <em>Payne, </em>that the imposition of a harsher sentence following a successful appeal was constitutionally impermissible where it was not supported by \"(known) conduct of the defendant occurring after the first sentencing which would support a stiffer sentence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In <em>Payne, </em>pp 95-96, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">Does \"occurring after . . . the original sentencing\u201d refer to defendant\u2019s \"identifiable conduct\u201d or to acquisition of \"objective information\u201d regarding his conduct before or after original sentencing? Since <em>Pearce </em>was decided, lower courts have split over interpretation of the above language. Some opinions hold that only conduct of the defendant occurring after his original sentencing may be relied upon by the sentencing judge who imposes a harsher penalty. . . . Others hold or indicate that regardless of when the defendant\u2019s \"identifiable conduct\u201d occurred, if it first comes to a sentencing judge\u2019s attention after the time of the first sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tencing it may be relied upon in support of a harsher penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">Pending clarification of <em>Pearce\u2019s </em>requirements by the United States Supreme Court, we are persuaded that those courts are correct which have interpreted <em>Pearce </em>to require that the \"identifiable conduct\u201d of the defendant upon which a resentencing judge relies in imposing a stiffer sentence must have occurred after the first sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">While in <em>Payne </em>this Court did not specifically adopt the presumption of vindictiveness rationale of <em>Pearce, </em>we later applied the <em>\"Pearce </em>presumption\u201d in a case in which two different judges sentenced the defendant, and the second did not know the length of the original sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">It is thus not decisive in this case that the resentencing judge lacked actual \"vindictiveness.\u201d . . . The resentencing judge did not point to any conduct of the defendant since the original sentencing as having influenced the sentence finally imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">We hold that the rule of <em>Pearce </em>applies to these circumstances. <em>[People </em>v <em>Jones, </em>403 Mich 527, 539; 271 NW2d 515 (1978).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">In <em>Texas v McCullough, </em>475 US 134; 106 S Ct 976; 89 L Ed 2d 104 (1986), the United States Supreme Court clarified its holding in <em>Pearce. </em>In <em>McCullough, </em>the defendant was tried before a jury and convicted of murder. The jury, as allowed under Texas law, sentenced McCullough to twenty years, after which the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. McCullough was again found guilty and elected to have the judge impose sentence. A sentence of fifty years was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ordered. The Texas Court of Appeals reversed the decision on the basis of its understanding that <em>Pearce </em>required that a longer sentence upon retrial could only be imposed on the basis of conduct of the defendant occurring after the original trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed and declined to apply a <em>Pearce </em>presumption of vindictiveness. With regard to the presumption, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">The <em>Pearce </em>requirements thus do not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial. Like other \"judicially created means of effectuating the rights secured by the [Constitution],\u201d <em>Stone v Powell, </em>428 US 465, 482 [96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067] (1976), we have restricted application of <em>Pearce </em>to areas where its \"objectives are thought most efficaciously served,\u201d 428 US at 487. Accordingly, in each case, we look to the need, under the circumstances, to \"guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process.\u201d <em>Chaffin v Stynchcombe, </em>412 US 17, 25 [93 S Ct 1977; 36 L Ed 2d 714] (1973) (emphasis omitted). <em>[Id., </em>p 138.][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The Court found in <em>McCullough </em>that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption of vindictiveness was inappropriate because the trial judge, herself, had granted the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. \"Granting McCullough\u2019s motion for a new trial hardly suggests any vindictiveness on the part of the judge to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>wards him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 138-139. The Court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIF\">The presumption of <em>Pearce </em>does not apply in situations where the possibility of vindictiveness is this speculative, particularly since the presumption may often \"operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v Goodwin, </em>457 US 368, 373 [102 S Ct 2485; 73 L Ed 2d 74] (1982). <em>[Id., </em>p 139.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">It was further found in <em>McCullough </em>that the presumption was inapplicable because the sentences had been imposed by distinct entities. The jury had imposed the first sentence, and the trial judge had sentenced the defendant at the second trial. The Court noted that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption was derived from a judge\u2019s \" 'personal stake in the prior conviction,\u2019 ... a statement clearly at odds with reading <em>Pearce </em>to answer the twosentencer issue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 140, n 3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Court in <em>McCullough </em>also clarified the requirement in <em>Pearce </em>that a trial court justify a greater sentence upon reconviction by affirmatively stating reasons \"based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding,\u201d <em>Pearce, </em>p 726, in a case where a presumption was appropriate. The Court concluded that even if the presumption were to apply in this case, which it did not, the findings of the trial judge were adequate to overcome that presumption._</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The trial judge in <em>McCullough </em>had based the greater sentence on two factors: the testimony of two new witnesses, which increased the credibility of the state\u2019s key witness and detracted from the defendant\u2019s credibility, and that of his witness, which \" 'shed new light upon [McCullough\u2019s] life, conduct, and his mental and moral propensities,\u2019 \u201d McCullough, p 143, and the information, not before the jury in the first trial, that defendant had been released from confinement only four months before committing the crime. Commenting on this new information, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">To foreclose reliance on the kind of pertinent new information developed in the second trial would be wholly incompatible with modern sentencing standards. This new objective information also amply justified McCullough\u2019s increased sentence. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\"><em>McCullough </em>has therefore clarified the language in <em>Pearce </em>and set to rest arguments about the type of information which will satisfy due process requirements in a case where a presumption of vindictiveness is appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">[The language in Pearce] was never intended to describe exhaustively all of the possible circumstances in which a sentence increase could be justified. Restricting justifications for a sentence increase to <em>only </em>\"events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings\u201d could in some circumstances lead to absurd results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">Nothing in the Constitution requires a judge to ignore \"objective information . . . justifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>increased sentence.\u201d[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] <em>[McCullough, supra, </em>pp 141-142.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The rule set out in <em>Payne </em>was based entirely on the requirements enunciated in <em>Pearce </em>and was only viable, in the specific words of <em>Payne, </em>\"[pending clarification of <em>Pearce\u2019s </em>requirements by the United States Supreme Court . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 96. As this clarification has now been given in <em>McCullough, </em>we are called upon to determine the continued viability of the <em>Payne </em>rule. We would find that the United States Supreme Court expressly rejected the requirement in <em>Payne </em>that in imposing an enhanced sentence upon reconviction the judge rely only on identifiable conduct which occurred after the original sentencing. Thus, we hold that the requirements of <em>Payne </em>are no longer appropriate and decline to follow them in cases tried in this state. We are persuaded that <em>McCullough </em>sets out the appropriate requirements in this area, and we adopt the <em>McCullough </em>conclusion that \"[n]othing in the Constitution requires a judge to ignore 'objective information . . . justifying the increased sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 142. We, therefore, analyze the two cases before us using the <em>McCullough </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In <em>Mazzie, </em>the defendant tendered a plea <em>of </em>guilty but mentally ill of second-degree murder before Recorder\u2019s Court Judge Robert Evans and was sentenced to a term of twenty-five to fifty years. At the time of sentencing, the defendant told the judge, \"I invited him [the victim] into the house, your Honor, and we had a hassle and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>were fighting and I strangled him.\u201d Over a year after the sentence, Judge Evans granted defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, which was presided over by Judge Leonard Townsend. After the jury convicted the defendant, Judge Townsend imposed the second sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Paralleling the situation in <em>McCullough, </em>the sentences in <em>Mazzie </em>were imposed by two different judges, and a new trial was granted by the original judge, not by an appellate court. Thus, we would find that a presumption of vindictiveness is not applicable in this case and that a greater sentence was properly imposed upon reconviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The discretion accorded to trial judges by the Legislature and in the sentencing guidelines is an implicit recognition of the existential fact that individual judges may have distinct views of appropriate sentences for a given offender. To assume that a second sentence is vindictive in such circumstances, is to assume, without any logical support, that the first sentence was \"correct.\u201d It no more follows that a higher sentence is a vindictive penalty for seeking a new trial than that the first sentencer merely imposed a lenient penalty. Simply stated, the logical inferences from these circumstances do not support the result urged upon us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Further, assuming arguendo that a presumption of vindictiveness was appropriate in this case, the reasons given by the second judge were more than adequate to justify the greater sentence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>second trial, a great deal of evidence was presented which was not available to the judge at the first sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As Judge Townsend noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">There was evidence which is not in Judge Evans\u2019 plea or came to his attention that there were notes written by Mr. Mazzie with definite sexual overtones and there were even some threats to torture the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">The Court [at the trial] also heard a report of the medical examiner. His report showed that there was an injury to the scrotum area of the victim. He also stated that it took four or five minutes for a person to die from strangulation. . . .[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">Then I had to take into consideration also the testimony of the defense psychiatrist, Mr. Robey. Mr. Robey testified that, in his opinion, Mr. Mazzie is an extremely dangerous person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">Now Judge Evans only had one sentence. \"We were fighting and I strangled him.\u201d That is all he had. I had all the other evidence to suggest all sorts of sadistic acts; sexual acts, strangulation, notes that were written suggesting torture to the victim, the fact that there was a jury that found no mental illness in Mr. Mazzie and, under those circumstances, the Court does not feel constrained or in any way under any legal obligation to follow the sentence that was imposed by Judge Evans.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Clearly, the judge in <em>Mazzie </em>relied on \" 'objective information . . . justifying the increased sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCullough, </em>p 142. We, therefore, would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case and find that the defendant\u2019s second sentence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In <em>Spangler, </em>Oakland Circuit Court Judge James Thorburn originally accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and sentenced him to two concurrent terms of thirty-five to two hundred years in prison. After a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea on the basis of his attorney\u2019s promise of a lesser minimum sentence, Judge Thorburn granted Spangler a new trial, finding that the plea was not voluntarily given. Judge Thorburn then presided over defendant\u2019s jury trial and ultimately imposed a longer sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">We would not hold as Justice Brickley suggests that vindictiveness could not be shown where the trial court granted a motion for new trial. See n 10. We simply would find that the situation in <em>Spangler </em>is not one in which this Court should apply a presumption of vindictiveness. As the Court in <em>McCullough, </em>pp 138-139, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">Granting McCullough\u2019s motion for a new trial hardly suggests any vindictiveness on the part of the judge towards him. ''[UJnlike the judge who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>has been reversed,\u201d the trial judge here had \"no motivation to engage in self-vindication.\u201d <em>Chaffin, </em>412 US at 27. In such circumstances, there is also no justifiable concern about \"institutional interests that might occasion higher sentences by a judge desirous of discouraging what he regards as merit-less appeals.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In granting McCullough\u2019s new trial motion, Judge Harney went on record as agreeing that his \"claims\u201d had merit. Presuming vindictiveness on this basis alone would be tantamount to presuming that a judge will be vindictive towards a defendant merely because he seeks an acquittal. . . . We decline to adopt the view that the judicial temperament of our Nation\u2019s trial judges will suddenly change upon the filing of a successful post-trial motion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In addition, even if a presumption of vindictiveness were to apply, as in <em>Mazzie, </em>the judge in <em>Spangler </em>articulated adequate reasons for imposing the greater sentence. As he noted at sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">Your whole conduct has been a fraud on the system and a fraud on the Court, in addition to these horrible acts that you performed. An innocent victim, minding her own business, working at her occupation and you subjected her to the most cruel and inhumane treatment it\u2019s possible to give to a human being, a fellow human being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">. . . You have talent. The record \u2014 your own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>testimony seemed to indicate that you could make $60,000 a year running a business. You had run several businesses successfully. You had all the opportunities in the world that other people do not have and yet you would conduct yourself in this bestial manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">When Judge Thorburn heard defendant\u2019s guilty plea, Spangler admitted the minimum facts necessary to make out the elements of one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of armed robbery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\"><em>Q. </em>State in your own words what you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\"><em>A. </em>That I inserted my finger into the victim\u2019s vagina, and I took her money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\"><em>Q. </em>At that time were you armed with a dangerous weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">Q. What was the weapon? What kind of weapon was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\"><em>A. A </em>razor blade. A razor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\"><em>Q. </em>Was it a straight razor as distinguished from a razor blade?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-13\"><em>Q. </em>It was a straight razor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-15\"><em>Q. </em>And she permitted you to insert your finger into her vagina and permitted you to take her money because you had placed her in fear and apprehension with the razor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-17\">At trial, as Judge Thorburn noted in his reference to \"these horrible acts . . . performed [on] [a]n innocent victim,\u201d the testimony of the victim brought out for the first time the fear and debasement she sustained as a result not only of the single manual penetration the defendant had acknowledged during the plea procedure, but also penetration by defendant\u2019s penis and tongue, fon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>dling of her breasts and coerced fondling of defendant\u2019s penis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The additional evidence alluded to by the judge was more than adequate to justify the greater sentence, even if a presumption of vindictiveness were to apply in this case. As is frequently the case, the factual basis for the plea consisted of the minimal statement of the elements necessary to support the charge. The evidence at trial, in contrast, was a re-creation of the incident, which provided the Court with far more insight into the effect upon the victim, the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation, and the potential damage posed by the defendant to the community. The evalua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tion of an individual who so terrorizes a victim that the victim \"agreed to anything,\u201d who blindfolds and binds the victim\u2019s hands and feet, and who engages in five acts of criminal sexual conduct<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is a different process than that which occurs when the trial judge evaluates the plea-offering defendant, even with the benefit of a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Defendant in <em>Spangler </em>also contends that a greater sentence was impermissibly imposed because the trial judge also felt that the defendant\u2019s defense had been a \"fraud.\u201d Although other adequate reasons were given for the sentence, even if a presumption of vindictiveness were applied, we consider it appropriate to speak to this issue for the guidance of the bench and bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">This Court, in <em>People v Anderson, </em>391 Mich 419; 216 NW2d 780 (1974), opined that it was not permissible to allow a trial judge to take into consideration at sentencing his impression that the defendant was protecting a codefendant. The Court regarded this circumstance as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">the equivalent of the error found in <em>Scott v United States, </em>135 US App DC 377; 419 F2d 264 (1969), wherein the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the argument that a judge may impose additional punishment because he believes the defendant committed perjury, saying that if the government wishes to prosecute for the independent substantive offense of perjury it may do so and that in such a proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ing the defendant would be entitled to all the protections of a criminal trial. <em>[Id., </em>p 423.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On the basis of this language and without further analysis, the Court of Appeals in <em>People v McConnell, </em>122 Mich App 208; 332 NW2d 408 (1982), vacated on other grounds 418 Mich 881 (1984), found that the trial judge had erred in increasing defendant\u2019s minimum sentence because of his impression that the defendant had lied under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\"><em>Anderson, supra, </em>is not persuasive precedent for the situation in this case. Although the facts are not set forth in the opinion, the majority in <em>Anderson </em>characterized the sentence error as punishment for the defendant\u2019s exercise of his \"right to remain silent at the trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 423. A defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent is clearly not implicated where, as here, the defendant has testified. In addition, the view taken in <em>Scott </em>of the use of a defendant\u2019s false testimony has been considered and expressly rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Grayson, </em>438 US 41; 98 S Ct 2610; 57 L Ed 2d 582 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In <em>Grayson, </em>the federal district judge had given, as the reason for the sentence imposed on the defendant, the fact that it was his view that the defendant\u2019s \" 'defense was a complete fabrication without the slightest merit whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 44. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had vacated the sentence, applying the rule from a prior case that a sentencing judge may not add a penalty because he believes that the defendant lied. <em>Poteet v Fauver, </em>517 F2d 393 (CA 3, 1975). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve conflicts in the Courts of Appeals as to the permissibility of allowing judges to increase sentences because of an impression that the defendant had committed perjury while testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The Supreme Court found in <em>Grayson </em>that the trial judge\u2019s need to tailor a sentence to the individual defendant required that all evidence, including evidence that defendant lied, be taken into consideration. The Court noted, quoting from <em>Scott v United States, </em>that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stood alone in directly rejecting the probative value of defendant\u2019s false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">As the Court opined, quoting from Judge Marvin Frankel\u2019s analysis for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\"The effort to appraise 'character\u2019 is, to be sure, a parlous one, and not necessarily an enterprise for which judges are notably equipped by prior training. Yet it is in our existing scheme of sentencing one clue to the rational exercise of discretion. If the notion of 'repentance\u2019 is out of fashion today, the fact remains that a manipulative defiance of the law is not a cheerful datum for the prognosis a sentencing judge undertakes. . . . Impressions about the individual being sentenced\u2014 the likelihood that he will transgress no more, the hope that he may respond to rehabilitative efforts to assist with a lawful future career, the degree to which he does or does not deem himself at war with his society \u2014 are, for better or worse, central factors to be appraised under our theory of 'individualized\u2019 sentencing. The theory has its critics. While it lasts, however, a fact like the defendant\u2019s readiness to lie under oath before the judge who will sentence him would seem to be among the more precise and concrete of the available indicia.\u201d <em>United States v Hendrix, </em>505 F2d 1233, 1236 ([CA 2] 1974). <em>[Grayson, supra, </em>p 51.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We find, as have most of our sister states,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>analysis of <em>Grayson </em>persuasive, and we would expressly reject the dicta of <em>Anderson. </em>If judges are to tailor sentences to best suit the individual defendant\u2019s needs and the possibility of rehabilitation, they must be given the opportunity to consider such obviously probative evidence as the defendant\u2019s propensity for false testimony. We find it most compelling that the rule here advocated by the defendant would only serve to impose an artificial restriction on the evaluative process which any trial judge in fact engages in in reaching a decision as to an appropriate sentence for a given defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Such rules undermine confidence in the appellate judiciary and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">the efficacy [of such an] \"exclusionary rule\u201d is open to serious doubt. No rule of law, even one garbed in constitutional terms, can prevent improper use of firsthand observations of perjury. The integrity of the judges, and their fidelity to their oaths of office, necessarily provide the only, and in our view adequate, assurance against that. <em>[Grayson, supra, </em>p 54.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This is not a case where the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent is being used against him, but rather is an example of the kind of evidence necessary for a proper sentencing decision. We are unconvinced, as was the United States Supreme Court, that this evidence has an impermissible chilling effect on the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights._</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Grayson\u2019s argument that judicial consideration of his conduct at trial impermissibly \"chills\u201d a defendant\u2019s statutory right, 18 USC 3481 (1976 ed), and perhaps a constitutional right to testify on his own behalf is without basis. The right guaranteed by law to a defendant is narrowly the right to testify truthfully in accordance with the oath\u2014 unless we are to say that the oath is mere ritual without meaning. This view of the right involved is confirmed by the unquestioned constitutionality of perjury statutes, which punish those who willfully give false testimony. See, e.g., 18 USC 1621 (1976 ed); cf. <em>United States v Wong, </em>431 US 174 [97 S Ct 1823; 52 L Ed 2d 231] (1977). Further support for this is found in an important limitation on a defendant\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel: Counsel ethically cannot assist his client in presenting what the attorney has reason to believe is false testimony. See <em>Holloway v Arkansas, </em>435 US 475, 480 n 4 [98 S Ct 1173; 55 L Ed 2d 426] (1978); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, The Defense Function \u00a7 7.7(c), p 133 (Compilation 1974). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of defendants\u2019 untruthfulness in testifying has any chilling effect on a defendant\u2019s decision to testify falsely, that effect is entirely permissible. There is no protected right to commit perjury. <em>[Grayson, supra, </em>p 54.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We would hold, therefore, that a sentencing judge may consider a defendant\u2019s false testimony in imposing a sentence, insofar as it relates to the prospects for rehabilitation. Judge Thorburn, in enhancing Spangler\u2019s sentence, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">Your theory of the case was ... a flight of fancy. It wasn\u2019t based on any reasonable interpretation of any fact, but it was solely out of your own testimony and it was obviously false and perjured testimony and it was to the effect that the officer in charge of the case had framed you by imposing your fingerprints, by putting you in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>chair which was the chair which was from the beauty parlor and used in the \u2014 as part of the res gestae circumstances of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">That obviously was a flight of fancy and the jury didn\u2019t believe it and I didn\u2019t believe it, and that, too, enhanced the crime. It shows that you have no intention of trying to rehabilitate yourself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We would find that the judge permissibly considered, in assessing Spangler\u2019s potential for rehabilitation, his impression that the defendant had falsely testified. In affirming the Court of Appeals we observe, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Grayson, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">Nothing we say today requires a sentencing judge to enhance, in some wooden or reflex fashion, the sentences of all defendants whose testimony is deemed false. Rather, we are reaffirming the authority of a sentencing judge to evaluate carefully a defendant\u2019s testimony on the stand, determine \u2014 with a consciousness of the frailty of human judgment \u2014 whether that testimony contained willful and material falsehoods, and, if so, assess in light of all the other knowledge gained about the defendant the meaning of that conduct with respect to his prospects for rehabilitation and restoration to a useful place in society. <em>[Id., </em>p 55.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The defendant in <em>Spangler </em>raises two further issues in this Court. First, Spangler claims that the circuit court improperly reinstated the charges which had previously been dismissed pursuant to the plea bargain, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v McMiller, </em>389 Mich 425; 208 NW2d 451 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In <em>McMiller, </em>this Court held that a charge may not be reinstated after a plea has been set aside on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>appeal for a defect in the prescribed procedure for taking a guilty plea. We stated, in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">The prescribed procedure for taking a guilty plea can readily be observed. Compliance in every case with the prescribed procedure is, we are convinced, essential to the integrity of the plea-taking process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">A prosecutor can protect himself against being forced to try a defendant on a lesser offense by calling the attention of the judge, before he accepts a plea of guilty, to any failure to comply with the prescribed procedure for taking such a plea. <em>[Id., </em>pp 433-434.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We would find <em>McMiller </em>inapplicable in the case at bar. Spangler\u2019s plea-based conviction was not reversed on appeal for a defect in the plea-taking procedure. Rather, the trial court set aside the plea because it found that the misconduct of the defendant\u2019s own counsel had caused the plea not to be voluntary. His original attorney had told Spangler that the judge had promised a minimum sentence below that ultimately imposed by the court if he would offer a guilty plea pursuant to the plea bargain.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In fact, the proper procedure under the then-applicable GCR 1963, 785.7 was followed, and the judge specifically asked the defendant at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">Do you understand that no other promises have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>been made to you by anyone, <em>that I have not agreed with anyone about anything, </em>that no one has threatened you, and that this guilty plea is your own free choice? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">to which Spangler responded, \"Yes.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The prosecutor was unaware of the attorney\u2019s promises to Spangler, as was the court, and could not have remedied the problem during the plea-taking procedure. It was only after the plea had been accepted that the issue was raised by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Because we would find, as did the Court in <em>People v Tillman, </em>406 Mich 898; 276 NW2d 456 (1979), that <em>McMiller </em>is not applicable to the facts in this case, we have no occasion to consider its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>continued viability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Spangler </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">[t]he primary aim of the <em>McMiller </em>rule is to ensure compliance with the plea-taking procedures. Implicit in the rule is the assumption that refusing to allow reinstatement of the original charges will assure that the prosecutor will make certain that the plea-taking procedure is followed exactly. In this case the trial court and the prosecutor did their jobs as required by the rule. It was the misrepresentations made by defense counsel which made it necessary to allow the plea to be withdrawn. Penalizing the prosecutor for the fraud committed by defense counsel will not induce a defendant or defense counsel to comply with the rules. Our conclusion is that <em>McMiller </em>does not apply in this case; the original charges were properly reinstated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We are no longer persuaded that the remaining issue raised in <em>Spangler </em>merits our review.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-7\">Riley, C.J., and Griffin, J., concurred with Boyle, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\"> We note that defendant in <em>Spangler </em>views the second sentence as an \"increased\u201d sentence.

His hands and feet were bound and a piece of black electrical cord and a length of cloth were found around the victim\u2019s neck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\"> It must be noted that Judge Evans presided over the <em>Walker </em>hearing in this case. While there is no transcript of the hearing, the judge\u2019s notes, which are part of the record, do not indicate that the additional information, on which Judge Townsend based the second sentence, was ever discussed. At the most, Judge Evans would have been aware of the confessions signed by Mazzie. The first merely implied that the death was an accident while the victim and Mazzie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>were fighting. The second admitted sexual feelings for the victim, but again implied that the victim was killed during a struggle after the victim took a swing at Mazzie. The confession does not indicate that there were sexual notes written to and about the victim. In addition, Mazzie did not discuss in his confession his plans to torture the victim or sexual activity with the victim, both of which were evidenced at the trial. Also, as Judge Townsend noted, the confession does not evidence the amount of time required to effect strangulation or the fact that the psychiatrist\u2019s evaluation of Mazzie indicated that he was an extremely dangerous person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> In one of his issues raised in this Court and in the Court of Appeals, the defendant appears to be attempting to show specific evidence of vindictiveness. Judge Thorburn, in his original sentencing, noted that the defendant was \"one of the most vicious persons that has come before me in my tenure as a judge.\u201d It appears that this was the ground on which the defendant moved, both before Judge Thor-bum and the presiding judge, to have the case heard before another judge. We agree with both judges who heard the motion that no prejudice was shown. Judge Thorburn was merely articulating, as required by this Court, the reason for the sentence imposed on the defendant. This is not an indication of vindictiveness toward defendant, as seen by the fact that the judge directly, thereafter, granted defendant a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\"> <em>Q. </em>Okay.

The comment to the proposed rule, quoting <em>United States ex rel Williams </em>v <em>McMann, </em>436 F2d 103 (CA 2, 1970), indicated that the Rules Committee felt that the <em>McMiller </em>approach \"encourages gamesmanship and does not enhance the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Additionally, the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that there is no constitutional basis for the <em>McMiller </em>rule. <em>Hawk v Berkemer, </em>610 F2d 445 (CA 6, 1979); <em>United States v Anderson, </em>514 F2d 583 (CA 7, 1975).
