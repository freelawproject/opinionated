We hold that the latter consideration controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The appellant in this case, the Rev. M. L. Hill, was charged with defrauding Michigan Consolidated Gas Company in the use of heat supplied to his church. On February 10, 1985, three investigators, two from Michigan Consolidated Gas Company and one from the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, went to the church to question Rev. Hill and conduct a search pursuant to a valid search warrant. During the brief questioning, Rev. Hill made a number of inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The questioning took place in Rev. Hill\u2019s office. In addition to the defendant and the investigators, two or three other persons, not known to the investigators, but presumably known to Rev. Hill, were also in the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The prosecution\u2019s investigator testified that by the time he and the other investigators questioned Rev. Hill, he was the focus of the investigation. However, at no time prior to or during the questioning was Rev. Hill informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">On this basis, defendant moved for the suppres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sion of all the statements he made to the investigators. The trial judge granted the motion on the basis of his finding \"that the triggering mechanism of the requirement of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is 'focus\u2019 and not 'custody\u2019 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision on the ground that, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the \"focus\u201d test in <em>Beckwith v United States, </em>425 US 341; 96 S Ct 1612; 48 L Ed 2d 1 (1976), the proper test for determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights must be provided is whether or not the defendant was in custody at the time of the questioning. We granted leave to resolve this question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Much of the confusion surrounding this area of the law stems from this Court\u2019s failure to clearly define the interplay between the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), and its earlier decision in <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478; 84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\"><em>Escobedo </em>was primarily an extension of <em>Massiah v United States, </em>377 US 201; 84 S Ct 1199; 12 L Ed 2d 246 (1964). In <em>Massiah, </em>the Supreme Court had held that once an individual is formally charged with a crime, any statements deliberately elicited from him without permitting him the assistance of counsel must be excluded as violative of the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court stated that any time the police try to so elicit a statement from a defendant his Sixth Amendment rights are brought into play since the time between arraignment and beginning of trial is \" 'the most critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>period of the proceedings , . . [and] defendants . . . [are] as much entitled to such aid [of counsel] during that period as at the trial itself.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, quoting <em>Powell v Alabama, </em>287 US 45, 57; 53 S Ct 55; 77 L Ed 158 (1932). The majority in <em>Escobedo </em>viewed the case as extremely similar to <em>Massiah. </em>The fundamental difference, of course, was that Escobedo, unlike Massiah, had not been charged with a crime at the time of questioning However, the majority determined that once the investigation had focused on the defendant legal aid and advice were as important as if he had been indicted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">It would exalt form over substance to make the right to counsel, under these circumstances, depend on whether at the time of the interrogation, the authorities had secured a formal indictment. Petitioner had, for all practical purposes, already been charged with murder. [378 US 486.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">While the <em>Escobedo </em>Court focused in particular on the degree to which the defendant had become the prime suspect, there is other language in the opinion which indicates that the Court was also concerned with the fact that at the time of questioning the defendant was in police custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">We hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, <em>the suspect has been taken into police custody, </em>the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \"the Assistance of Counsel\u201d .... [378 US 490-491. Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In <em>Miranda, </em>the analysis clearly shifted from whether the suspect was the focus of the investigation to whether he was in custody. In an oft-cited footnote and its accompanying text, the <em>Miranda </em>Court stated at 444:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived. of his freedom of action in any significant way.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Rather than clearing up the relation between focus and custody, this excerpt resulted in some courts holding that the triggering element of the <em>Miranda </em>requirement was to be understood within the focus paradigm of <em>Escobedo </em>rather than the converse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, subsequent United States Supreme Court cases have made clear that <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>custody concept has displaced <em>Escobedo\u2019s </em>focus concept.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Hoffa v United States, </em>385 US 293; 87 S Ct 408; 17 L Ed 2d 374 (1966), the defendant was the focus of a federal investigation for jury tampering. Federal agents paid an informer to report to them concerning a conversation the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>had had with him and others. The defendant argued, inter alia, that his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated, since the government had grounds to take him into custody on the jury tampering charge prior to the conversations in question, and had he been placed in custody at that time the government \"could not have continued to question [him] without observance of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel [citations to <em>Massiah </em>and Escobedo].\u201d 385 US 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The United States Supreme Court strongly rejected this claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">Nothing in <em>Massiah, </em>in <em>Escobedo, </em>or in any other case that has come to our attention, even remotely suggests this novel and paradoxical constitutional doctrine, and we decline to adopt it now. There is no constitutional right to be arrested. The police are not required to guess at their peril the precise moment at which they have probable cause to arrest a suspect, risking a violation of the Fourth Amendment if they act too soon, and a violation of the Sixth Amendment if they wait too long. Law enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of evidence which may fall far short of the amount necessary to support a criminal conviction. <em>[Id. </em>at 310.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">While not yet explicitly rejecting the focus test, this analysis left little if any room for its use. As one commentator described it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">[Considerations drawn from Escobedo\u2019s emphasis on \"focus\u201d underlay Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s claim that the Constitution confers a right to arrest. At an early stage in [the] \"investigation,\u201d he argued, the Government could present probable cause for his arrest, and therefore he had a constitutional right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>to be arrested and allowed the protection of counsel. The Court boggled at the novelty of this claim. But its surprise was unwarranted. Hoffa\u2019s lawyers had simply chosen inartistic phrasing for an argument substantially drawn from the Court\u2019s own opinions: when suspicion had focused on Hoffa the general investigation was functionally complete; at that point, he was the accused and thereby entitled to the absolute protection of the privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">Even if Hoffa had made his point in a less startling fashion, however, his chance for success would have been slight. In <em>Miranda </em>the Court had already . . . emphasized that the line was to be drawn mechanically at the point when the suspect was taken into custody. It would be all but impossible to determine the point outside the police station at which suspicion has been focused on a single individual. The point at which an accused is taken into custody, however, can be judicially determined with reasonable certainty. [Note, <em>Judicial control of secret agents, </em>76 Yale L J 994, 1008 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Any doubts that <em>Hoffa </em>may have left as to the status of the focus test were removed in <em>Beckwith v United States, supra. </em>The defendant was under investigation by the irs for criminal tax fraud. Two irs special agents came to the defendant\u2019s home and questioned him there after giving him incomplete <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The defendant argued that since he was the focus of the investigation, he should have been given full <em>Miranda </em>warnings, even though he was not yet in custody. The United States Supreme Court, while never citing <em>Escobedo, </em>made absolutely clear that the warnings need not be given simply because the defendant has become the focus of the investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">[W]e \"are not impressed with this argument in the abstract nor as applied to the particular facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of Beckwith\u2019s interrogation.\u201d It goes far beyond the reasons for that holding and such an extension of the <em>Miranda </em>requirements would cut this Court\u2019s holding in that case completely loose from its own explicitly stated rationale. The narrow issue before the Court in <em>Miranda </em>was presented very precisely in the opening paragraph of that opinion \u2014 \"the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation.\u201d 384 US, at 439. The Court concluded that compulsion is \"inherent in custodial surroundings,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 458, and, consequently, that special safeguards were required in the case of \"incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in self-incriminating statements without full warnings of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 445. In subsequent decisions, the Court specifically stressed that it was the custodial nature of the interrogation which triggered the necessity for adherence to the specific requirements of its <em>Miranda </em>holding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that he was placed in the functional, and, therefore, legal, equivalent of the <em>Miranda </em>situation asks us now to ignore completely that <em>Miranda </em>was grounded squarely in the Court\u2019s explicit and detailed assessment of the peculiar \"nature and setting of . . . in-custody interrogation,\u201d 384 US, at 445. That Courts of Appeals have so read <em>Miranda </em>is suggested by Chief Judge Lumbard in <em>United States </em>v <em>Caiello, </em>420 F2d 471, 473 (CA 2, 1969):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\"It was the compulsive aspect of custodial interrogation, and not the strength or content of the government\u2019s suspicions at the time the questioning was conducted, which led the court to impose the <em>Miranda </em>requirements with regard to custodial questioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\"><em>Mathis v United States, </em>[391 US 1; 88 S Ct 1503; 20 L Ed 2d 381 (1968)] directly supports this conclusion in holding that the <em>Miranda </em>requirements are applicable to interviews with Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Revenue agents concerning tax liability, when the subject is in custody; the Court thus squarely grounded its holding on the custodial aspects of the situation, not the subject matter of the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">An interview with Government agents in a situation such as the one shown by this record simply does not present the elements which the <em>Miranda </em>Court found so inherently coercive as to require its holding. <em>Although the \"focus\u201d of an investigation may indeed have been on Beckwith at the time of the interview in the sense that it was his tax liability which was under scrutiny, he hardly found himself in the custodial situation described by the </em>Miranda <em>Court as the basis for its holding. </em>Miranda <em>implicitly de\u00f1ned \"focus,\u201d for its purposes, as \"questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any signiffcant way.\u201d </em>384 US, at 444. [425 US at 345-347. Some citations omitted, emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The final citation in this excerpt is to the text accompanying footnote 4 in <em>Miranda, </em>cited <em>ante, </em>p 387, which some courts read improperly. The emphasized material leaves no doubt that, pursuant to federal law, <em>Miranda </em>warnings need only be given where there is \"custody\u201d and that, absent custody, the fact that an individual has become the \"focus\u201d of an investigation does not trigger the <em>Miranda </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Therefore, any reliance on federal law for the imposition of the \"focus\u201d test in Michigan cases is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The remaining question posed by defendant is whether either art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or our prior case law requires that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given at any time other than when an individual is in custody or has been otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In our past interpretations of the <em>Miranda </em>rule, even when in excess of what we now clearly note to be the United States constitutional standard as set forth in <em>Beckwith, supra, </em>we never grounded those interpretations on art 1, \u00a7 17 of our constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We decline to now convert our past misunderstandings of <em>Miranda </em>into an interpretation of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The wording of the self-incrimination provisions of our respective constitutions is nearly identical, and, as we have previously said \"It would be disingenuous . . . not to admit that our standards [in interpreting] the Michigan Constitution have been largely influenced by decisions of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Delta Charter Twp v Dinolfo, </em>419 Mich 253, 276, n 7; 351 NW2d 831 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">At the time of the drafting of our 1963 Constitution <em>(pre-Miranda), </em>the self-incrimination provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of the Fifth Amendment was only implicated when an extrajudicial statement was found to have been elicited involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">It is difficult to imagine that the drafters and ratifiers, having adopted nearly word for word the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment, would have envisioned that a noncustodial extrajudicial statement, regardless of voluntariness or involuntariness, would result in a violation of that provision, solely because the statement was not preceded by the application of a prophylactic rule that requires a recitation of the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Absent an indication that a noncustodial setting clearly implicates compulsion, we would not feel at liberty to consider such an expansion of the drafters\u2019 most likely understanding of the meaning of self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">As we have also said before, \"We have, on occasion, construed the Michigan Constitution in a manner which results in greater rights than those given by the federal constitution, [citation omitted] and where there is compelling reason, we will undoubtedly do so again.\u201d <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196, 215; 341 NW2d 439 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, this is not one of those times._</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In addition to his constitutional argument, defendant also suggests that the focus test must be applied in Michigan because, as a matter of case law, it constitutes stare decisis in this state. We note, however, that the Court of Appeals has long been split on this issue. See, e.g., <em>People v Wallach, </em>110 Mich App 37; 312 NW2d 387 (1981) (applying the focus test); contra <em>People v Martin, </em>78 Mich App 518; 260 NW2d 869 (1977); <em>People v Belanger, </em>120 Mich App 752; 327 NW2d 554 (1982) (applying the custody test). Moreover, this split is in large measure the result of this Court\u2019s less than precise decisions regarding the <em>Miranda </em>rule. See <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975), <em>People v Ridley, </em>396 Mich 603; 242 NW2d 402 (1976), <em>People v Brannan, </em>406 Mich 104; 276 NW2d 14 (1979), and <em>People v Paintman, </em>412 Mich 518; 315 NW2d 418 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In light of the unsettled nature of this area of the law in our state, we find dubious the assertion that the focus test is controlling as stare decisis in Michigan. However, to the extent that it is so viewed, we are convinced for the reasons we will now describe that custody is an \"undeniably better\u201d test than is focus. <em>Abendschein v Farrell, </em>382 Mich 510, 516; 170 NW2d 137 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In determining the proper scope of the prophylactic rule necessary to assure the protections of this provision we must determine the degree to which the competing standards correspond to the protective purpose of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The requirement that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be read has several purposes. First, to guard against the possibility that government agents may <em>compel </em>an individual, in violation of his constitutional rights, to make self-incriminating statements, i.e., to as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>sure that confessions and other incriminating statements that are made involuntarily are not used against them. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Berkemer v McCarty, </em>468 US 420; 104 S Ct 3138; 82 L Ed 2d 317 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">The purposes of the safeguards prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>are to <em>ensure </em>that the police do not coerce or trick captive suspects into confessing, to relieve the \" 'inherently compelling pressures\u2019 \u201d generated by the custodial setting itself, \" 'which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist,\u2019 \u201d and as much as possible to free courts from the task of scrutinizing individual cases to try to determine, after the fact, whether particular confessions were voluntary. <em>[Id. </em>at 433. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Another aspect of the <em>Miranda </em>rule is to ensure that where individuals are placed in a coercive setting, but ultimately not charged with a crime, the police respect such individuals\u2019 constitutional rights to be free of compulsion towards self-incrimination. Since courts by definition inquire only into the voluntariness of a <em>defendant\u2019s </em>statements, no specific judicial check exists to deter the police from applying coercive pressure and from denying counsel to those individuals subjected to custodial interrogation who are never ultimately charged with a crime. However, the requirement that incriminating statements made during custodial interrogation in which <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given be suppressed protects more than criminal defendants. Since the interrogators cannot know in advance who will be charged with a given crime, all suspects must be given the warnings prior to custodial interrogation, thus relieving for all individuals the fear and indignity inherent in coercive police activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>In a <em>pre-Miranda </em>article addressing the shortcomings of a test based solely on voluntariness, a commentator observed that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">share[d] the view that not many <em>innocent </em>men (at least those of average intelligence and educational background) are likely to succumb to [coercive techniques]. But how many <em>innocent </em>men are likely to be <em>subjected </em>to these methods? [What] would the American lawyer\u2019s reaction be if he had some notion of the price we pay in terms of human liberty and individual dignity? [Kamisar, <em>What is an involuntary confession? </em>in Police Interrogation and Confessions: Essays in Law and Policy, p 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">While \"arrests for investigation\u201d are constitutionally barred in this state,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the following passage from <em>Miranda </em>demonstrates that the Supreme Court was concerned generally with the fate of an innocent and ultimately uncharged suspect as well as that of the criminal defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests \"for investigation\u201d subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation. In one of the cases before us, . . . <em>California v Stewart, </em>police held four persons, who were in the defendant\u2019s house at the time of the arrest, in jail for five days until defendant confessed. At that time they were finally released. Police stated that there was \"no evidence to connect them with any crime.\u201d Available statistics on the extent of this practice where it is condoned indicate that these four are far from alone in being subjected to arrest, prolonged detention, and interrogation without the requisite probable cause. [384 US 482.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>It is our view that the purposes of the <em>Miranda </em>rule are better served by a custody test than by a focus test. The mere fact that an individual has become the focus of an investigation does not subject him to any avoidable offense against his liberty or dignity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is only in the coercive atmosphere of custodial interrogation that he must be protected from improper police tactics. Similarly, the specter of involuntariness is not raised simply because the person being questioned is the prime suspect if the environment in which he is questioned is not coercive, i.e., if the suspect\u2019s freedom has not been significantly limited. The fact that an individual is the focus of an investigation does not, in and of itself, present any danger that involuntary statements will be made. Indeed, it is likely that a prime suspect may not even know that he has been so classified in the minds of the police. At the same time, the \"focus\u201d test may not protect interrogated individuals who are subjected to coercive tactics if they cannot yet be designated as the focus of the investigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This situation may have occurred in <em>People v Brannan, supra, </em>where a defendant, in custody on another charge, was questioned regarding a murder. This Court held, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s confession which occurred after proper warnings was not tainted by the prewarning questioning because it had taken place prior to the time that the defendant became the focus of the investigation. Thus, custodial in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>terrogations may have been held constitutional in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">These considerations demonstrate that the custody test corresponds to the protected interests far more precisely than does the focus test which is both underinclusive and overinclusive. The custody test affords protection to those individuals requiring it where the focus test might fail to do so. In addition, the custody test does not decrease the likelihood that individuals being questioned in the absence of coercion will voluntarily provide answers. The focus test, on the other hand, may encourage silence by unnecessarily suggesting to potential witnesses that cooperation is risky, without any concomitant gains in the protection of criminal defendants from coercive police tactics or to society in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">It can be argued that police officers should inform every person of whom they ask a question that the question need not be answered. However, whether this would have a socially beneficial effect is doubtful, and this approach was specifically, and with good reason, rejected in <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">General on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding. It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement. In such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present. [384 US 477-478.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Once it is recognized that it is proper for members of society to voluntarily answer appropriate questions of law enforcement officers, it is difficult to conceive why a line should be drawn which might encourage silence simply because the person being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>questioned is the focus of a police investigation. It is desirable that such an individual also speak frankly and voluntarily to the police. However, he must never be put in a position where he feels that he must speak even though he prefers not to do so. Thus, we protect prime suspects through the reading of the <em>Miranda </em>warning, as we do any other individual, when he is in a situation in which he may perceive that he must speak against his will, i.e., during custodial interrogation. The purpose of the <em>Miranda </em>rule is to redress the disadvantage inherent in a custodial setting, not to create a confrontational atmosphere in the more neutral noncustodial environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We are, accordingly, of the view that the custody test is undeniably better suited to the task at hand than the focus test.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Nearly all states have adopted a custody test for purposes of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Many courts have also defined a list of factors relevant to the determination whether at the time of interrogation the suspect \"has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Miranda, supra, </em>p 444. Because the defense has not disputed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not in custody at the time of the questioning, we decline to define such a list ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">In the instant case, the questioning was brief and took place in defendant\u2019s own office, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>building which he owned, in the presence of other individuals known to him. In other words, other than the mere fact that he was being questioned and that the questioning was being conducted by-three individuals, only one of whom was a government agent, there was no basis for defendant to reasonably believe that he was in custody or that his freedom of action was significantly limited. We therefore hold that at the time of the questioning it was not necessary that defendant be informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Court of Appeals decision is affirmed, and the case is remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-6\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Order of September 4,1985.

We note, however, that <em>Paramount </em>dealt solely with the self-incrimination clause in the context of civil discovery and that in that case we based our holding in part on the fact that \"[t]he precedents relied upon by defendants [to support a separate interpretation of the Michigan constitutional privilege were] distinguishable on the ground that they involvefd] disclosures in the context of criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The case before us today deals with the nature of the privilege in the criminal context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> <em>People v Casey, </em>411 Mich 179; 305 NW2d 247 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\"> We recognize that being suspected of having committed a crime for which one is innocent can cause an obvious affront to one\u2019s dignity as well as a threat to one\u2019s liberty.
