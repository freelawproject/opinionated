Upon a hearing the chancellor denied her relief because of the insufficiency of the evidence. We are asked to review the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>It appears from the bill of complaint and the evidence that the complainant is under the age of twenty-one years and that the cause was instituted and prosecuted to final decree in the name of the infant instead of by her next friend. It is provided1 by Code, sec. 5331, that \u201cany minor entitled to sue may do so by his next friend.\u201d The failure to institute and prosecute the suit by a next friend casts substantial doubt on the validity of the decree. For that reason we are remanding the canse to the lower court with direction that the decree be vacated and the cause proceeded in by the next friend of the infant complainant to be assigned by the court should it be deemed advisable. <em>Wilson &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>22 Gratt.

Otherwise the cause should be dismissed by the trial court for the reason above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
