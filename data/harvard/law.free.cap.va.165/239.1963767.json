Under the circumstances the soundness of its judicial discretion cannot be raised by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>petition for a writ of mandamus, regardless of whether or not the exercise of such discretion was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The petitioners\u2019 only remedy, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, would ordinarily be by an appeal, hut an appeal is denied by the express terms of the statute, Code, section 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
