Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyB\">The issue dispositive of this appeal is whether the trial court erred in its charge to the jury on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, provided by General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-54a (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The defendant was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Brian Williams in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-54a. The trial court had granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on an additional charge of criminal attempt at murder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the victim\u2019s sister. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a (a). The defendant was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The defendant raises six issues on appeal: (1) whether the trial court\u2019s instructions on extreme emotional disturbance were adequate; (2) whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial and due process of law by the state\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his fifth amendment rights; (3) whether the trial court\u2019s instructions on insanity were erroneous; (4) whether the defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (5) whether the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on criminally negligent homicide; and (6) whether the trial court\u2019s instruction on manslaughter constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While our finding of error on the first issue is dispositive of this appeal, we will discuss such other assignments of error insofar as they may impact on a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: The defendant, Roy E. Casey, rented a room at a low monthly rental from eighty-three year old Madeline Bauerfeld of Belltown Road, Stamford, in exchange for general upkeep and maintenance of her property. On April 19,1982, at approximately 6:30 p.m., the defendant saw the victim washing a car in the driveway of his home next to the Bauerfeld residence. The defendant and the victim argued about the water from the victim\u2019s hose coming onto the Bauerfeld lawn which had been newly seeded that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The defendant, fifty-eight years old, and the victim, twenty-two years old, had argued about similar incidents over the years. On the day of the incident, the defendant went into the house to have Bauerfeld speak with the victim. Bauerfeld and the victim became involved in an argument during which the defendant heard the victim say: \u201cF__k you\u201d to her. Bauerfeld then heard her door open. The defendant fired four shots from a shotgun, three of which hit the victim and resulted in his immediate death.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Shortly after the shooting, the defendant telephoned the Stamford police department and reported that he had killed \u201cthe bastard that threatened me. [The victim] said he was going to kill me. [The victim is] not going to kill me, \u2019cause he\u2019s dead.\u201d He proceeded to supply the police with his and the victim\u2019s names, ages and addresses, the type of weapon he had used and its location. He said the argument had begun because the victim had let water run onto his lawn. The tape recording of this telephone conversation with the police from his home was an exhibit in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Two of the police officers who had responded to the scene testified that the defendant was \u201cunusually calm,\u201d \u201clike he was a shell\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really seem to respond too much to the situation.\u201d The defendant was then interviewed by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">A clinical psychologist, Charles Opsahl, testified for the defense that, based on the results of tests performed on the defendant, the defendant\u2019s behavior on the night of the shooting was consistent with a \u201ctransient, disassociative state.\u201d Opsahl further testified that in such a state, which is a disassociation or separation between thought and feeling, the defendant would have been incapable of forming any intentions and would have fired the gun even if two police officers had been standing \u201cright next to him.\u201d The defendant testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>at trial that he did not remember getting his gun, loading it, or shooting the victim and he remembered only \u201cparts\u201d of the telephone call to the police and his subsequent arrest and police interview. He remembered Bauerfeld yelling at him that he had killed \u201cthe kid next door\u201d and that when he looked out the door and saw the victim, he then telephoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court denied him his constitutional rights to an adequately instructed jury and to a fair trial by failing to provide the jury with complete instructions on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance. We see no need to invoke a constitutional analysis in order to resolve this claim. The defendant filed a written request to charge on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance that included the statements that a \u201chomicide influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance is not one which is necessarily committed in the \u2018hot blood\u2019 stage\u201d and that the \u201cdefense does not even require a provoking or triggering event.\u201d The court did not instruct the jury as requested by the defendant. The defendant contends that the instructions, because they did not incorporate his request, were inadequate under the circumstances of this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">A request to charge which is relevant to the issues of the case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given. A refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 418, 473 A.2d 300 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980). The state does not dispute that the request was relevant to an issue in the case, the defendant\u2019s intent, or that it was an accurate statement of the law. Rather, the state argues that the court\u2019s instructions \u201cadequately cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ered\u201d the substance of the defendant\u2019s request and that the requested language \u201cwould not have added appreciably to the jury\u2019s understanding of the law . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The trial court\u2019s charge on extreme emotional disturbance began with a reading of the relevant language of \u00a7 53a-54a (a) that \u201cit shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for or preclude a conviction of manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d The court then noted that a defense of extreme emotional disturbance may mitigate culpability and that the burden of proving its existence was on the defendant, and defined the terms \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cemotional disturbance.\u201d In informing the jury about the preconditions for invocation of the defense, the court stated that the defendant was required to prove that he \u201cwas exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state, that is, not mere annoyance or unhappiness\u201d and that \u201c[t]he defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to it as a result of which there was a loss of self control, and reason was overborne by extreme intense feelings such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions.\u201d The court nowhere alluded to the possibility that extreme emotional disturbance might arise by virtue of a significant mental trauma causing a long period of brooding and a sudden, apparently unprovoked, violent reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 6-7, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), we cited with approval <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>in which the United States Supreme Court \u201cnoted that the defense of extreme emotional disturbance is a considerably expanded version of the common law defense of heat of passion or sudden provocation.\u201d We determined in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, that \u00a7 53a-54a (a) \u201cdoes not require a provoking or triggering event\u201d nor does it require that the homicide be committed in the hot blood stage; id.; and that the \u201cdefenses of extreme emotional disturbance and heat of passion are not interchangeable.\u201d Id., 4. The charge on this defense to the extent given by the trial court was inadequate under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The basis for the defense theory at trial was the entire history of the relationship between the defendant and the victim rather than the single incident of the water on the newly seeded lawn and the subsequent argument that occurred just prior to the killing. The defense sought to show that the homicide in this case, as in <em>Elliott, </em>\u201cwas brought about by a significant mental trauma that caused the defendant to brood for a long period of time and then react violently, seemingly without provocation.\u201d Id., 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">This case more closely resembles <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>than <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 480 A.2d 463 (1984), in which we held jury instructions similar to those found to be erroneous in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, to constitute harmless error. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, the defendant was nevertheless found guilty of manslaughter in the first degree despite the erroneous jury instructions. Unlike the present case, the erroneous portion of the charge in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 659, was \u201cwholly compatible with the defendant\u2019s theory\u201d of a sudden, single incident of provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">To demonstrate the harmfulness of the trial court\u2019s charge, the defendant asserts that the state\u2019s closing argument to the jury, to which no objection was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>included a \u201cdetailed chronological analysis\u201d of the events on the evening of the shooting and \u201cinvited the jury to conclude that the defendant should have \u2018cooled down\u2019 during the process.\u201d In addition, the defendant notes that during the course of its argument the state questioned the adequacy of the provocation. The attorney for the state remarked that when he \u201cthink[s] of extreme emotional disturbance, [he] thinkfs] of a person coming home and finding their spouse committing adultery and then going crazy. That\u2019s what [he] thinkfs] of. Just to give you an example. It\u2019s got to be extreme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The defendant characterizes the example given by the prosecutor of finding a spouse committing adultery as the \u201cclassic \u2018heat of passion\u2019 scenario.\u201d The defendant does not claim that this portion of the state\u2019s argument was inappropriate or in any way unethical. The defendant\u2019s claim is that the court\u2019s charge omitting his requested language on provocation and heat of passion combined with the prosecutor\u2019s argument served to prejudice his right to a fair adjudication of his extreme emotional disturbance defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The state contends that in determining whether the jury had been misled, it should be remembered that \u201c \u2018an omission, or an incomplete instruction, is less likely to be prejudicial than a misstatement of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 563, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 198, 502 A.2d 858 (1985). We note that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>supra, 194, unlike this case, the defendant had not submitted a request to charge to the trial court on the issue later raised on appeal. While this general principle may be accurate in most circumstances, the omission of the requested instruction under the circumstances of this case was so prejudicial to the defendant that it constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>There was error in the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as requested by the defendant in light of all the circumstances set out above and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The defendant claims that he was deprived of due process of law and a fair trial when the state (a) elicited testimony that the defendant had invoked his right to terminate police questioning, and (b) commented in closing argument on the defendant\u2019s failure to relate certain details to the police. Although the defendant failed in the trial court to preserve this issue for appeal, we will review this claim because it is likely to recur upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We note initially that the defendant admits that \u201ctrial counsel failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.\u201d We agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that review is mandated under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), because this claim implicates the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The defendant was advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), at his residence when he was arrested and, again, shortly thereafter at the police station. The defendant was interviewed at the police station and validly waived his right to remain silent and indicated that he would agree to an oral questioning but he would not provide a sworn written statement. The police station interview lasted \u201cabout an hour and five minutes.\u201d The state elicited from Detective Edward Cook that the interview ended when the defendant stated that he wanted to stop the interview and \u201ctalk to a lawyer,\u201d that the police honored that request, and that questioning ceased upon the asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tion of this request. The defendant did not object to this line of questioning. Defense counsel, during cross-examination of Cook, also elicited references to the defendant\u2019s request to cease the interview and to contact an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201c[I]t is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 468 n.37. \u201cReferences to one\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent [are] not always constitutionally impermissible, however.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>177 Conn. 487, 496, 418 A.2d 870, vacated and remanded on other grounds, 444 U.S. 893,100 S. Ct. 199, 62 L. Ed. 2d 129, on remand, 179 Conn. 761, 409 A.2d 149 (1979). \u201cThe evidence was presented by the state to show the investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded (an acceptable purpose under State v. <em>Ralls, </em>[167 Conn. 408, 427-29, 356 A.2d 147 (1974)]).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>supra, 499. The defendant concedes that had the state\u2019s reference to his invocation of rights been limited to the exchanges during Cook\u2019s testimony, this court might reasonably have concluded that the references were a \u201cmere recitation\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>652 F.2d 735, 740 (8th Cir. 1981); of his response. The defendant claims, however, that \u201cin light of the theory of recent fabrication running through the state\u2019s rebuttal argument\u201d this court should not view the references as innocent, narrative statements. See <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>695 F.2d 124 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 911, 106 S. Ct. 282, 88 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We do not agree that the sequence of events as they unfolded on the night of the shooting are related to the state\u2019s theory of recent fabrication of an explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>for the shooting. Rather, we find this case similar to <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>supra, and that the state\u2019s introduction of the testimony was for permissible purposes, i.e., the sequence of events as they unfolded, and not for the impermissible purpose of showing that the cessation of his statement was \u201can indication of silence in the face of accusation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>supra, 499. The state\u2019s use in argument of the testimony of the sequence of events was therefore not improper. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant raises as a claimed related issue that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument \u201cinvited the jury to conclude that [his] failure to tell police certain details indicated he had had the disputed intent to kill.\u201d The defendant claims that these comments violated the rule of law enunciated in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 48 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 619, held that \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d The court stated that \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d Id., 618. The court further clarified its holding in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S. Ct. 2180, 65 L. Ed. 2d 222, reh. denied, 448 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 27, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1173 (1980), where it stated that <em>\u201cDoyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements. Such questioning makes no unfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>induced to remain silent. As to the subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not remained silent at all.\u201d We do not see any reason why prosecutorial comment during closing argument is not analogous to cross-examination for the purpose of the application of this rule. On cross-examination of his landlady, as well as during his own testimony, the defendant introduced evidence that he had heard the victim insult her during the argument that preceded the shooting. The fact that the defendant failed to mention the insult to his landlady during police questioning but testified to that incident during his trial is the equivalent of having given inconsistent statements for the purposes of this rule. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 748 n.4, 513 A.2d 86 (1986). The state\u2019s comments<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the defendant\u2019s omission of the insult incident in an hour long interview were not \u201cdesigned to draw meaning from silence\u201d and the defendant\u2019s statements at the interview and at trial \u201cpertained to the same subject matter.\u201d See <em>Hockenbury </em>v. <em>Sowders, </em>718 F.2d 155, 158-59 (6th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 975, 104 S. Ct. 2354, 80 L. Ed. 2d 826 (1984); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 534-38, 498 A.2d 76 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">As we held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985), we believe that \u201c[t]he <em>Doyle </em>decision ... is not applicable to the facts of this case. The crucial distinction is that, here, the defendant did not remain silent after he was arrested and advised of his rights. After being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>defendant clearly chose to forego his right to remain silent. Once an arrestee has waived his right to remain silent, the <em>Doyle </em>rationale is not operative because the arrestee has not remained silent and an explanatory statement assuredly is no longer \u2018insolubly ambiguous.\u2019 By speaking, the defendant has chosen unambiguously not to assert his right to remain silent. He knows that anything he says can and will be used against him and it is manifestly illogical to theorize that he might be choosing not to assert the right to remain silent as to part of his exculpatory story, while invoking the right as to other parts of his story.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 536, 537 n.12.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state\u2019s comments in its closing argument to the jury were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury on insanity. Three additional related issues on insanity are also raised by the defendant: (1) the court\u2019s comments on the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d warrant reversal; (2) the court erred in omitting legal sanity from its supplemental charge on the elements of the offenses; and (3) the court\u2019s instructions did not constitute harmless error as there was sufficient evidence to put insanity in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We have repeatedly held that a claim that a trial court\u2019s instruction on insanity which incorporates the statutory definition under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a) as well as \u201cextraneous considerations not encompassed within the statutory definition,\u201d here the <em>Durham </em>rule; <em>Durham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>214 F.2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954); is not reviewable when it was not properly raised at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>200 Conn. 607, 610, 513 A.2d 47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396-97, 503 A.2d 576 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>198 Conn. 314, 320-21, 502 A.2d 865 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 134, 502 A.2d 381 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). <em>\u201cWe </em>do not approve of the use of a common law definition of insanity in conjunction with an instruction on the statutory test. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 633, 424 A.2d 293 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 321-22. Further discussion of this claim is unnecessary because we do not anticipate that the same erroneous instruction will be given at a retrial. We also have no reason to believe that the remaining claims of error in the charge will arise at the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in refusing his written request to charge on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58 (a). We shall consider this issue because it is likely to arise on a new trial of this matter. The defendant filed a written request to charge on criminally negligent homicide. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court instructed the jury on a number of lesser included offenses<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the crime of intentional murder but it did not charge under \u00a7 53a-58 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c) provides that the \u201cjury before which any person indicted for murder ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u201d \u201cWhether an accused may avail himself of this statutory privilege by means of a jury instruction is governed by the principles set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 399-400, 429 A.2d 919 (1980), and State v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980) . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 28, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">A lesser included instruction is warranted only if the four conditions of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, are met. For purposes of this case, we need only examine the third requirement, the sufficiency of the evidence justifying conviction of the lesser offense, to conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">After the trial court had instructed the jury, the defendant excepted to the omission of the requested charge. The trial court stated: \u201c[Tjhe Court is of the opinion that there was no negligence presented in evidence that would warrant a charge on criminally negligent homicide. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s ruling was erroneous because there was sufficient evidence at trial to support a conviction under \u00a7 53a-58 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a person acts with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such a result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The defendant relies pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>marily on the testimony of the clinical psychologist, Opsahl, that the defendant, if he had been in a disas-sociative state at the time of the shooting, would have been incapable of forming any intentions and would not have known that he had a shotgun in his hand. The defendant claims that the jury could have inferred that if he did not realize that he was holding a gun then he also did not realize that if he used the weapon that there was a substantial risk of injury or death. We cannot agree with the defendant\u2019s reasoning. While we agree with the defendant that Opsahl\u2019s testimony was evidence, if the defendant had been in a disassociative state on the night of the shooting, that would tend to negate the intent necessary for murder, this same evidence, however, does not serve the defendant on this claim. Under the reasonable man standard of \u00a7 53a-58 (a), a person is criminally liable if he \u201cfails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk . . . .\u201d The defense theory was that the defendant was in a disassociative state in which there would have been no connection between thought and action. Hence, the defense theory was that there was no perception whatsoever on the part of the defendant that he was firing a gun, not that he failed to perceive the risk of death to the victim from his actions. The defendant himself testified that he did not remember most of the events surrounding the shooting. We agree with the ruling of the trial court on the basis of the evidence presented at this trial and express no opinion as to whether such a charge should be given in a trial if additional evidence is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides: \u201cSec. 53a-54a.

CLASSIFICATION, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that he was denied effective representation of counsel as a result of his counsel\u2019s erroneous request to charge on the issue of insanity. We need not review this claim because of our disposition of this case. We cannot conceive that counsel will again request or that the trial court will charge on other than the statutory definition of insanity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\"> We need not address this issue because it is unlikely to impact on a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> The state commented as follows in its closing arguments to the jury: \u201cYou know we heard all this testimony of the cursing of Mrs. Bauerfeld. But you know what\u2019s amazing to me, nobody mentions it that night. The defendant doesn\u2019t tell you that that\u2019s why he went out and did this. He doesn\u2019t mention a word about Mrs. Bauerfeld. We don\u2019t hear that until a year later when he comes to testify. Not on the phone, not to Officer Dolan, not to Detective Cooke, nothing about it. Not a word. Picture the defense wants to paint is this was the overwhelming situation that was confronting the defendant, and yet he doesn\u2019t mention a word about it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\"> The defendant\u2019s reply brief places great reliance on the recent decision of <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986).
