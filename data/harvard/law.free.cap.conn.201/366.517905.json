The underlying issues have been fully considered in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Conn. App. 235, 497 A.2d 1015 (1985); and it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The claim of the corporate defendant that it was improperly made a party does not merit further elaboration in light of the record, which demonstrates that, at trial, the corporate defendant, in the presence of its corporate officers, and represented by the same counsel that was counsel of record for the named defendant, had consented to an amendment to the pleadings which made the corporation a codefendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\"> The dismissal of this appeal is not to be read as our endorsement of the categorical statement in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Conn. App. 235, 238, 497 A.2d 1015 (1985); that it was unnecessary for that court to \u201creach the defendants\u2019 claim that the corporation was a necessary or an indispensable party, because the defendants never moved to strike the plaintiff\u2019s complaint because of nonjoinder of parties.\u201d See <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Shimelman, </em>180 Conn. 568, 570, 430 A.2d 1292 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
