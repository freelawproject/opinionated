J.</author>\n<p id=\"aja-dedup-1\">The dispositive issue on this appeal is whether autopsy reports compiled by the office of Connecticut\u2019s chief medical examiner are public records subject to public inspection under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the mainstay provision of the Freedom of Information Act. The plaintiff, Dr. Catherine A. Galvin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>was the state\u2019s chief medical examiner at all times relevant to this appeal. She refused to furnish a copy of an autopsy report requested by the defendant David W. Schoolcraft, a reporter for the defendant Norwich Bulletin Company. The defendants complained to the Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC). After a hearing, the FOIC ordered Dr. Galvin to furnish the defendants with a copy of the autopsy report. She appealed the decision to the Superior Court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>which sustained her appeal. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court, which set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment and rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. After petitioning for certification, the plaintiff appealed to this court. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed. On October 13, 1981, a sixteen year old Norwich boy, Dwayne Dodd, was shot and killed in the course of a struggle with a Norwich police officer. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-406 (then \u00a7 19-530),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the medical examiner\u2019s office performed an autopsy on Dodd\u2019s body. On October 21, 1981, at the office of the chief medical examiner in Farmington, the defendant Schoolcraft orally requested Dr. Galvin to furnish him with a copy of the autopsy report. The plaintiff refused to do so. She indicated, however, that Schoolcraft could obtain a copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>of the report upon the completion of a pending investigation by the office of the state\u2019s attorney, provided that he obtained the Dodd family\u2019s consent to disclosure of the report. Neither Schoolcraft nor the defendant Norwich Bulletin Company (Bulletin) ever sought or obtained such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Shortly after the meeting with Dr. Galvin, School-craft and the Bulletin filed a complaint with the FOIC, seeking to compel disclosure of the autopsy report. The FOIC received the complaint on November 2, 1981. After a hearing on February 18, 1982, the FOIC rendered a decision ordering the plaintiff to disclose the report. On January 12, 1984, the Superior Court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the FOIC\u2019s decision. The Appellate Court found error and ordered dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal in <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, 4 </em>Conn. App. 468, 495 A.2d 1089 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court erred in holding that: (1) state administrative regulations that limit public access to autopsy reports,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enacted pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00a7 19a-411,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are invalid under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a); and (2) General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), which exempts from disclosure under \u00a7 1-19 \u201cpersonnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy,\u201d did not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the autopsy report in question. Because we agree with the plaintiffs first claim of error, we need not resolve her second claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Before addressing the merits of this appeal, we must resolve an important threshold question of jurisdiction. The FOIC\u2019s schedule for hearing and rendering decision in this case exceeded the time limitations imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 1-2 li (b). See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 518 A.2d 49 (1986). We have previously held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u00a7 l-21i (b) time constraints are mandatory, and that the FOIC\u2019s failure to adhere to them invalidates its subsequent action. <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>199 Conn. 451, 452-53, 507 A.2d 1385 (1986); <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 503-506, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986). After these decisions were rendered, the General Assembly enacted Public Acts 1986, No. 86-408, which, in \u00a7 2 (a), retrospectively validated FOIC actions not in compliance with \u00a7 l-21i (b). In <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, we held that this retrospective validation is a legitimate exercise of legislative authority. We therefore hold that Public Acts 1986, No. 86-408, \u00a7 2 (a), preserved the FOIC\u2019s jurisdiction to act in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s dispositive claim requires the reconciliation of the provisions of two statutes, each of which deals with the public\u2019s right of access to records kept on file by public agencies. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-411 sets forth specific guidelines for the preparation, maintenance and disclosure of autopsy reports and other records of investigations conducted by the medical examiner\u2019s office. These statutory guidelines, and the administrative regulations which they expressly authorize, impose stricter limitations on the disclosure of such records than the Freedom of Information Act, General Statutes \u00a7 1-19, permits. By contrast, under \u00a7 1-19 (a), \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute,\u201d <em>all </em>records of public agencies are public records subject to public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 19a-411 gives the Commission on Medicolegal Investigations, which supervises the medical examiner\u2019s office, authority to promulgate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>restrictive regulations concerning the disclosure of autopsy reports. Thus, the plaintiff argues, \u00a7 19a-411 is a state statute coming within the \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided\u201d exception to \u00a7 1-19, with the result that autopsy reports fall outside the ambit of public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendants claim that \u00a7 19a-411 does not exclude autopsy reports from the coverage of the Freedom of Information Act. They argue that, read as a whole and in conjunction with \u00a7 1-19, \u00a7 19a-411 incorporates the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, and permits only such regulations on disclosure as do not conflict with the act. The defendants maintain that \u00a7 1-19 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1975, No. 75-342, and Public Acts 1984, No. 84-112,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> invalidates administrative regulations, such as those of the Commission on Medicolegal Investigations, that conflict with \u00a7 1-19.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Appellate Court relied on this provision of \u00a7 1-19 (a) to hold that \u00a7 1-19, as amended, superseded the commission\u2019s regulations limiting public access to autopsy reports. <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In our view, the disposition of this case turns on whether the authority to restrict disclosure of autopsy reports stems solely from the regulations of the Commission on Medicolegal Investigations, or whether such authority is <em>expressly </em>derived from \u00a7 19a-411.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the former case, the restrictions would be void under the provision of \u00a7 1-19 (a) that invalidates regulations inconsistent with the Freedom of Information Act. In the latter case, the restrictions would be valid under the provision of \u00a7 1-19 (a) that permits other statutes to exclude statutorily defined records from the category of public records to which the Freedom of Information Act applies. We are persuaded that autopsy reports fall within the latter category and that restrictions on their disclosure are therefore valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 19a-411 is not a model of the draftsman\u2019s art. We must rely on the tools of statutory construction to resolve its ambiguous and facially inconsistent provisions. It is an accepted principle of statutory construction that, if possible, the component parts of a statute should be construed harmoniously in order to render an overall reasonable interpretation. <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>200 Conn. 630, 637, 513 A.2d 52 (1986); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). Where statutes contain specific and general references covering the same subject matter, the specific references prevail over the general. <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 622, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975); <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 Conn. 396, 402, 288 A.2d 435 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>With these principles in mind, we turn to the construction of \u00a7 19a-411. The guidelines set forth in \u00a7 19a-411 for the disclosure of records of the medical examiner\u2019s office vary according to the categories of persons seeking disclosure. The statute differentiates among three classes of record seekers. Two of the classes are restricted to specific types of persons. The third class, into which the defendants fall, is general, encompassing \u201cthe public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The first of the specific classes defined in \u00a7 19a-411 includes \u201c[a]ny state\u2019s attorney, chief of police or other law enforcement official.\u201d Any such official \u201cmay, upon request, secure copies of such records or other information <em>deemed necessary by him to the performance of his official duties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the statute expressly requires law enforcement officials to make some showing of necessity as a condition to obtaining the records of the investigations of the medical examiner\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The second specific class in \u00a7 19a-411, less narrowly defined than the first, includes \u201c[pjublic authorities, professional, medical, legal or scientific bodies or universities or similar research bodies.\u201d Within this category, access to records kept by the medical examiner\u2019s office is <em>\u201cin the discretion of the commission </em>[on med-icolegal investigations] . . . <em>upon such conditions and payment of such fees as may be prescribed by the commission. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The statute itself specifies one such condition: \u201cwhere such information is made available for scientific or research purposes . . . the identity of the deceased persons shall remain confidential and shall not be published.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 19a-411 delimits the rights of scientists and researchers, among others, to obtain access to records of the medical examiner\u2019s office. The statute also expressly narrows the scope of access, when available, to prevent disclosure of the deceased\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The portion of \u00a7 19a-411 governing disclosure to the general public provides that autopsy reports and other investigative reports \u201cmay be made available to the public <em>only through the office of the chief medical examiner and in accordance with section 1-19 and the regulations of the commission. </em>Any person may obtain copies of such records <em>upon such conditions and payment of such fees as may be prescribed by the commission, </em>provided no person with a legitimate interest therein shall be denied access to such records.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Unlike the language relating to the two specific classes of record seekers, the language in this portion of the statute does not set forth any express restrictions on disclosure. As the Appellate Court held, however, the statute does condition the availability of autopsy reports to the general public on compliance with the regulations of the commission on medicolegal investigations. <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The defendants, focusing on the language \u201cin accordance with \u00a7 1-19,\u201d argue that the legislature intended the records of the medical examiner\u2019s office to be public records available for inspection under the provisions of \u00a7 1-19. This construction of \u00a7 19a-411, however, would allow the general provisions of the statute governing \u201cthe public\u201d to supersede the express provisions governing the specifically enumerated classes of disclosure seekers. Under the defendants\u2019 construction, for example, a representative of a medical school conceivably could evade the restrictions that \u00a7 19a-411 imposes on disclosure for scientific or research purposes by obtaining an autopsy report as a member of \u201cthe public,\u201d whose right to disclosure, under the defendants\u2019 construction, is limited only by \u00a7 1-19. Such a broad construction would defeat the policy behind the principle that specific statutory references prevail over general references where the same subject matter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>concerned. See <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>supra; <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 110, 214 A.2d 354 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The restrictions that \u00a7 19a-411 imposes on access to the records of the medical examiner manifest a consistent pattern. Both for specific classes, and for the general public, the statute embodies a policy of conditional rather than unfettered disclosure. With regard to public access to autopsy records, the statute expressly mandates that disclosure must be \u201cin accordance with . . . the regulations of the commission.\u201d In seeking copies of records, disclosure seekers are subject to \u201csuch conditions and payment of such fees as may be prescribed by the commission.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The source of the records is similarly restricted: the public\u2019s access is \u201conly through the office of the chief medical examiner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">It is in this context that we construe the reference in \u00a7 19a-411 on which the defendants rely so heavily: \u201cin accordance with \u00a7 1-19.\u201d We cannot accept the defendants\u2019 contention that, notwithstanding the remainder of \u00a7 19a-411, this lone, general reference evinces a legislative intent to make autopsy reports public records under \u00a7 1-19. To the extent that \u00a7 1-19 requires unconditional disclosure of the records of public agencies, its literal incorporation into \u00a7 19a-411 would defeat the policy of \u00a7 19a-411 and make its own provisions hopelessly inconsistent. We must, if possible, reconcile subsidiary provisions of a statute with the general tenor of the statute as a whole. See, e.g., <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>supra, 63. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 19a-411 incorporates only those provisions of \u00a7 1-19 that are not inconsistent with the former statute\u2019s restrictions on disclosure. These provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>include, but are not limited to, the exceptions to disclosure set forth in \u00a7 1-19 (b), insofar as they apply to the types of records covered by \u00a7 19a-411.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The defendants cite other language in \u00a7 19a-411 to buttress their claim that they are entitled to unconditional access to the autopsy report. In particular, they point to a provision in \u00a7 19a-411 that requires authorities to seek judicial authorization to limit disclosure of medical examiners\u2019 records. In relevant part, \u00a7 19a-411 provides that, \u201c[u]pon application by the chief medical examiner or state\u2019s attorney\u201d to the superior court, the court \u201cmay limit such disclosure to the extent that there is a showing by the chief medical examiner or state\u2019s attorney of compelling public interest against disclosure of any particular document or documents.\u201d The defendants claim that this language requires a showing of \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d before <em>any </em>person can be denied access to records of the medical examiner\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We do not read the provision so broadly. We reiterate that the statute, considered in its entirety, conditions the right to disclosure on compliance with all relevant administrative regulations and other requirements. Accordingly, we construe the provision at issue to apply only when disclosure is sought to be denied to a party who otherwise complies with the conditions imposed by \u00a7 19a-411, including the administrative regulations to which the statute refers. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Our construction of \u00a7 19a-411 recognizes that the legislature might reasonably have considered the information contained in autopsy reports to be sufficiently sensitive to warrant the imposition of disclosure restrictions not applicable to other records of public agencies. We note, for example, that autopsy reports could contain information which, if disclosed, might cause embarrassment and unwanted public attention to the relatives of the deceased. See generally <em>Meriden Record Co. </em>v. <em>Browning, </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 633, 634, 294 A.2d 646 (1971). Section 19a-411\u2019s prohibition on disclosure of the deceased\u2019s identity in reports furnished for scholarly, research and other related purposes indicates legislative awareness of a privacy interest in the contents of autopsy reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In the case of public records, General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) provides an exception to disclosure under \u00a7 1-19 for \u201cpersonnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Yet neither \u00a7 1-19 nor any other provision of the Freedom of Information Act provides a mechanism whereby a deceased person\u2019s family may invoke a right to privacy before the Freedom of Information Commission. In cases such as the one before us, the family members of the deceased have no standing to receive notice of an FOIC hearing, let alone to object or otherwise be heard at the hearing. Their interests must be represented by the official body seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>to oppose disclosure, in this case the chief medical examiner, whose standing to invoke their claims of privacy is questionable. Our construction of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-411 thus permits the vindication of privacy rights that cannot effectively be asserted under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) provides that all records kept on file by public agencies shall be public records \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-411 provides such an exception for autopsy reports. We hold therefore that autopsy reports are not records accessible to the general public pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-19. Accordingly, we hold that the Appellate Court erred in concluding that, notwithstanding \u00a7 19a-411, the disclosure regulations of the Commission on Medicolegal Investigations contravene the provisions of \u00a7 1-19 and are therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal of the plaintiff from the order of the Freedom of Information Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 1-19. access to public records, exempt records.

Upon application by the chief medical examiner or state\u2019s attorney to the superior court for the judicial district in which the death occurred, or to any judge of the superior court in such judicial district when said court is not then sitting, said court or such judge may limit such disclosure to the extent that there is a showing by the chief medical examiner or state\u2019s attorney of compelling public interest against disclosure of any particular document or documents. Public authorities, professional, medical, legal or scientific bodies or universities or similar research bodies may, in the discretion of the commission, have access to all records upon such conditions and payment of such fees as may be prescribed by the commission. Where such information is made available for scientific or research purposes, such conditions shall include a requirement that the identity of the deceased persons shall remain confidential and shall not be published.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\"> At oral argument the defendants abandoned the claim, raised in their brief, that the Appellate Court erred in holding that the plaintiff was an aggrieved party with standing to appeal the decision of the Freedom of Information Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\"> Public Acts 1975, No. 75-342, \u00a7 2 (a), provides in relevant part: \u201cSection 1-19 of the General statutes is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided by any federal LAW or state statute [or regulation], all records [made,] maintained or kept on file by any [executive, administrative legislative or judicial body,] PUBLIC agency, [commission or official of the state, or any political subdivision thereof,] whether or not such records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every [resident of the state] PERSON shall have the right to inspect or copy such records at such reasonable time as may be determined by the custodian thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Public Acts 1984, No. 84-112, \u00a7 1, added the following sentence to \u00a7 1-19 (a): \u201cAny agency rule or regulation or part thereof, that conflicts with the provisions of this subsection or diminishes or curtails in any way the rights granted by this subsection shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> Neither party disputes that \u00a7 1-19 and the regulations are in conflict. In particular, the commission\u2019s regulations provide: \u201cThese records pursuant to Section 1-19 of the Connecticut General Statutes, are not open to public inspection.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-525-10 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\"> We emphasize \u201cexpressly\u201d to distinguish this type of statute from one which authorizes an administrative agency to adopt general rule-making procedures. An example of the latter type of statute is General Statutes \u00a7 4-167, which in subsection (a) (1) provides that administrative agencies shall \u201c[a]dopt as a regulation a description of its organization, stating the general course and method of its operations and the methods whereby the public may obtain information or make submissions or requests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> In the context of the entire statute, we are unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 claim that this language merely permits the commission to charge fees, such as copying charges, to compensate for the cost of disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> Examples of applicable provisions of \u00a7 1-19 (b)include the \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) exception for \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes provided the public agency has determined that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure,\u201d and \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), pertaining to \u201cpersonnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d We express no opinion on the applicability of these, or any other provisions of $ 1-19 (b), to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> This construction is also supported by the language of \u00a7 19a-411 immediately preceding the excerpt on which the defendant relies: \u201cAny person may obtain copies of such records upon such conditions and payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>such fees as may be prescribed by the commission, <em>provided no person with a legitimate interest therein shall be denied access to such records. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This language is mirrored in the disclosure regulations of the Commission on Medicolegal Investigations, which provide in relevant part: \u201cCopies of records are furnished to those having a legitimate interest therein . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-525-10 (c). The defendants do not claim that they are persons with \u201ca legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of either the statute or the regulation. We need not and do not consider, therefore, the validity of administrative distinctions between persons based on the presence or absence of a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d in disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
