After a jury trial, he was found guilty of the crimes charged and was sentenced to an effective prison term of not less than seven nor more than fourteen years. On appeal, he claims: (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on the first and second counts; and (2) that the trial court erred in allowing the state to impeach the testimony of the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses by exposing their failure to volunteer exculpatory information to the police. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We examine first the defendant\u2019s claim that the state presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction for the crimes of accessory to attempted robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. In considering this claim, \u201c[w]e are obligated to review the evidence as favorably as possible with a view toward sustaining the verdict and then to decide whether the verdict is one which jurors acting reasonably could have reached. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>[188 Conn. 591, 601, 452 A.2d 642 (1982)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>172 Conn. 275, 281-82, 374 A.2d 209 (1977). Evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict if the jury could reasonably have concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the defendant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 126, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>176 Conn. 257, 262, 407 A.2d 948 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Maltese, </em>189 Conn. 337, 344, 455 A.2d 1343 (1983); see also <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 105, 505 A.2d 712 (1986); <em>State </em>v. Scielzo, 190 Conn. 191, 197, 460 A.2d 951 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">To establish its case, the state relied heavily on the testimony of the victim, Marc Perkis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified at trial as follows: On March 20, 1981, at approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m., he drove into the parking lot of the Stop 6 Shop Supermarket on South Colony Road in Walling-ford with the intention of buying groceries. He parked his car in a spot two to three hundred feet from the store with the front end of the car against a chain link fence. Another car was parked on the driver\u2019s side and there was only a two or three foot space between the two cars. As the victim stepped out of his car, he noticed two men walking toward him from across the lot. They came up to him and blocked his way to the store, standing at the rear of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The victim described the two men in detail. The first man was between six feet, four or five inches tall, approximately nineteen to twenty-two years old and had long light brown hair about an inch from the shoulder. He was relatively clean shaven but had some whiskers growing on his chin and upper lip. He wore a dungaree jacket, a pair of blue jeans that was ripped at the knees, a belt with a large brass buckle and a pair of black leather motorcycle boots in poor repair. The second man was the person whom the victim later identified as the defendant. He was approximately six feet tall, in his late twenties or early thirties and had dark brown hair of shoulder length. He had broad shoulders and a heavier build than that of the first man, untrimmed facial hair under his nose and chin and prominent scars and pockmarks on his face like those left by severe acne. He wore a \"very old, very dirty\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>sleeveless denim jacket which had several patches, including one bearing a motorcycle insignia. He also wore ripped blue jeans with patches and black motorcycle boots in relatively poor condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The first man confronted the victim and \u201casked [him] for money . . . .\u2019\u2019The victim responded that he \u201cdid not have any money.\u201d Apparently not satisfied with the response, the first man became indignant and retorted: \u201cIf you are going shopping you have to have some money.\u201d The victim, who described himself as \u201ca little annoyed\u201d at this point, replied that \u201cI don\u2019t [have money]. I pay by check . . . [w]ould you like a check?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Within one or two seconds of the last verbal exchange, the second man stepped toward the victim and displayed a blackjack approximately eight to ten inches long. The victim had not noticed the weapon up to this point in time because the man had concealed it behind his back. The man immediately swung the blackjack at the victim and struck him in the face below the eye causing him to reel back against his car. The same man then punched the victim \u201c[a] couple of times\u201d in the stomach and, as he fell to the ground, struck him again over the head. Once on the ground, the victim feigned unconsciousness and heard the second man call to the first: \u201cCome on let\u2019s get back to the shop.\u201d Then, without searching the victim, the two men quickly left the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The victim remained on the ground for a few minutes before being able to pull himself up into his car. When he felt well enough to drive, he went directly to the Wallingford police station and related what had happened. The police took a general description of the assailants and then sent the victim to the hospital by ambulance. After being treated and released, the victim returned to the police station at approximately 9 p.m. and gave a full statement describing the two men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and the attack. The victim also viewed a photographic array containing six to seven photographs, selected a photo of the defendant and identified him as the man who had hit him with the blackjack. He stated that he was \u201cextremely positive\u201d about this identification. He later viewed another array containing approximately ten to fourteen photos and again selected the defendant\u2019s photograph.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim testified that \u201cthere [was] no doubt in [his] mind\u201d that the defendant was the man who had struck him.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The defendant presented an alibi defense at trial. He took the stand himself and testified that on the day of the alleged crimes he had visited a friend at Hartford Hospital and then had gone to the workshop of his club, the Diablos motorcycle club, in Meriden between 5 and 5:30 p.m. There he had unloaded his motorcycle from the back of his truck and had worked around the shop for a few hours before going home. The defendant called three witnesses who testified that he had been at the hospital on the afternoon in question, one of whom said that he had remained there until 4 p.m. He called two additional witnesses who testified that he had been at the Diablos club from 5:10 or 5:20 p.m. until later that evening. It was also established during the examination of the defendant and his witnesses, however, that he had worn a sleeveless denim jacket with motorcycle and Diablos club patches at the time the crimes took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of being an accessory to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of attempted robbery in the first degree. He does not challenge the jury\u2019s conclusion that there was sufficient concert of action between him and his accomplice to support the accessory allegations made under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues instead that there was insufficient proof: (1) of his intent to commit larceny in that the assailants\u2019 actions constituted, at the most, \u201caggressive panhandling\u201d; and (2) that he used or threatened to use force \u201cin the course of\u201d attempting a larceny as required under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">A person is guilty of criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of mental state required for the commission of the crime, he intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be, or intentionally commits an act which constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Conn. 258, 276, 480 A.2d 526 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 964, 83 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1985). \u201cA person commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133. Simple robbery becomes robbery in the first degree if, \u201cin the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime . . . uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Turning to the defendant\u2019s claim concerning intent, we note from the relevant statutes that the state was required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s intent to commit larceny in order to obtain a conviction for attempted robbery in the first degree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>193 Conn. 602, 608-609, 478 A.2d 994 (1984). Generally, such an intent can be inferred from the conduct and statements of the defendant or his accomplice. Id., 609; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sober, </em>166 Conn. 81, 92-93, 347 A.2d 61 (1974). \u201c \u2018The use of inferences based on circumstantial evidence is necessary because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 404, 429 A.2d 919 (1980).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>195 Conn. 166, 170, 487 A.2d 177 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 105, 505 A.2d 712 (1986). Reviewing the evidence in this case, we reject the defendant\u2019s characterization of the assailants\u2019 behavior as panhandling and conclude that the jury could reasonably have inferred from this conduct that the defendant intended to commit larceny. The defendant and his accomplice approached the victim in a nearly deserted parking lot and hemmed him in between two cars. One of them aggressively demanded money while the other stood nearby armed with a dangerous weapon. The request for money was not, as the defendant suggests, made in the form of a casual request for a handout, but instead was made in the form of a demand. Furthermore, the fact that the defendant struck the victim shortly after his accomplice made the demand indicated the assailants\u2019 apparent intent to force the victim to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant also proffers the argument that there was insufficient evidence that he used or threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to use force \u201cin the course of\u201d attempting the larceny under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 and that, as a result, he could not be found guilty of attempted robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He correctly assumes that the elements of simple robbery under the definition provided in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 must be proven before robbery in the first degree is established. He also correctly argues that it was necessary for the state to establish that the defendant had used or threatened to use force \u201cin the course of\u201d attempting a taking of the victim\u2019s property in order to sustain a conclusion that the defendant had undertaken \u201csubstantial step[s]\u201d in furtherance of the alleged crime under the attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coston, </em>182 Conn. 430, 435, 438 A.2d 701 (1980). We cannot agree with the defendant\u2019s position, however, that the use of force was not \u201cin the course of\u201d the attempted robbery because the assault of the victim occurred subsequent to the demand for money. It is well established that, under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, if the use of force occurs during the continuous sequence of events surrounding the taking or attempted taking, even though some time immediately before or after, it is considered to be \u201cin the course of\u201d the robbery or the attempted robbery within the meaning of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 410-11, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gunning, </em>183 Conn. 299, 313 n.12, 439 A.2d 339 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coston, </em>supra, 435-36; <em>State </em>v. <em>Velicka, </em>143 Conn. 368, 371-72, 122 A.2d 739 (1956); see also 2 Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1980) \u00a7 222.1, comment 2. In the present case, although the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ant could have assaulted the victim for any number of reasons, including frustration, anger, fear or desire to keep the victim from pursuing him, the assault occurred within seconds of the demand for money. The blackjack was also apparently in the defendant\u2019s hand while the demand was made. From these facts the jury could reasonably have concluded that the force used \u201cwas within the sequence of events directly connected with the attempted robbery.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Velicka, </em>supra, 372. The jury therefore could reasonably have found the defendant guilty of attempted robbery in the first degree as an accessory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. To establish the crime of conspiracy under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cthe state must show that [1] there was an agreement between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime ... [2] the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators . . . [and (3) there was] intent on the part of the accused that conduct constituting a crime be performed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Ortiz, 169 Conn. 642, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>645, 363 A.2d 1091 (1975). The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence on each element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">On the question of the defendant\u2019s intent, we have already found that the jury could reasonably have concluded that he possessed the intent to commit larceny. Since the assault was also committed in furtherance of the attempted taking and was done by use of a dangerous instrument, there is no doubt that the jury also could reasonably have concluded that he possessed the intent to commit robbery in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-133 and 53a-134 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">On the issue of confederation, we note at the outset that the existence of a formal agreement between the conspirators need not be proved. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>184 Conn. 369, 378, 439 A.2d 1049 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 344, 387 A.2d 550 (1978). \u201c \u2018Conspiracy can seldom be proved by direct evidence. It may be inferred from the activities of the accused persons. <em>State </em>v. <em>Faillace, </em>134 Conn. 181, 185, 56 A.2d 167 [1947]. It is only in rare instances that conspiracy may be established by proof of an express agreement to unite to accomplish an unlawful purpose. The combination or confederation may be proved by circumstantial evidence, that is, by proof of the separate acts of the individuals accused and by proof of circumstances from which the illegal confederation may be inferred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerich, </em>138 Conn. 292, 297, 83 A.2d 488 [1951].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>160 Conn. 140, 150, 274 A.2d 153 (1970).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 604, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985). In this instance, the proof that the defendant and his companion confronted the victim and hemmed him in between two cars while one demanded money and the other stood by silently with a dangerous weapon in his hand was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could infer that there existed an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>between the two assailants. \u201cIt was enough if they knowingly engaged in a mutual plan to do a forbidden act.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>supra, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On the issue of the existence of an overt act in furtherance of the crime, it is important to emphasize that the essence of the offense of conspiracy is the unlawful combination and an act done in pursuance thereof, not the successful accomplishment of the objective of the conspiracy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 3, 505 A.2d 683 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>149 Conn. 640, 647-48, 183 A.2d 612, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>371 U.S. 930, 83 S. Ct. 303, 9 L. Ed. 2d 237 (1962). Thus, although robbery in the first degree may have been the conspirators\u2019 object, the failure of the attempt does not preclude a conviction for the inchoate crime of conspiracy. The state charged the defendant with committing the overt act of assaulting the victim with a dangerous instrument in pursuance of the crime of robbery in the first degree. Since we have already found that it was reasonable to conclude that the assault was committed \u201cin the course of\u201d the attempted robbery under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, and that this act constituted a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward the commission of robbery in the first degree within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49, we also find that the jury could reasonably have believed that the assault was \u201can overt act in pursuance\u201d of the conspiracy under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a). There is sufficient evidence, therefore, to sustain his conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The final claim raised by the defendant challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing the state\u2019s attorney to impeach the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses by exposing their failure to tell the police their story in support of the alibi. He argues that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of the witnesses\u2019 silence was irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also claims that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument to the jury using this evidence was improper. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The state filed a demand for notice of alibi on April 14, 1981, but the defendant, in violation of the time requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 763, did not comply until August 19, 1982, some sixteen months later. The trial court, in its discretion, nevertheless allowed the witnesses to testify and trial commenced on August 23, 1982. As previously noted, the defendant called five alibi witnesses. Three testified that they had seen him at Hartford Hospital a few hours before the crimes were committed and two testified that they had seen him in Meriden at the exact time the crimes were committed. Each of these witnesses was either a friend or an acquaintance of the defendant and was in some way associated with the Diablos motorcycle club. When cross-examining four of the witnesses, the state\u2019s attorney asked each if they had informed the police that he or she had seen the defendant on the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of the crime. The defendant each time objected to these questions on the ground of relevance, but his objections were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">During the closing arguments to the jury, the state\u2019s attorney attacked the defense witnesses\u2019 credibility on various grounds, including the observation that the witnesses were friends of the defendant, that the dates and times might have been inaccurate because of the effect of time on their memory, and that there was no way to verify their testimony because they had not given a formal statement prior to trial. In raising the possibility of fabrication, the state\u2019s attorney pointed out that the defense counsel had been able to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony by using his prior statement to the police, but that the defendant\u2019s witnesses could not be similarly cross-examined because \u201cthey did not give any statements to anyone.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defense counsel during her closing arguments attempted to bolster the witnesses\u2019 credibility despite their failure to go to the police by noting that: \u201cIf [the witnesses] have not gone to the police department to say: listen, a terrible wrong [has been] committed here, isn\u2019t it natural that these peo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>pie would go testify just like they have?\u201d The defendant later objected to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s arguments, claiming that it was improper to impeach the alibi witnesses by bringing to light their failure to make statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The principles by which we judge the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the relevance of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questioning are well settled. \u201cThe scope of cross-examination in a criminal trial is a matter properly left to the sound discretion of the trial court .... Every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. Reversal is required only where an injustice appears to have occurred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>170 Conn. 161, 365 A.2d 104 [1976]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 702, 364 A.2d 186 [1975].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 Conn. 328, 333, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 862 (1980). Generally, evidence is admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or corroborates other direct evidence in the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5, 8-9, 505 A.2d 685 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 645-46, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). Thus, \u201cif evidence adduced on cross-examination conduces in any reasonable degree to establish the probability or improbability of the fact in controversy, it should be admitted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>supra, 332; <em>Delmore </em>v. <em>Polinsky, </em>132 Conn. 28, 31, 42 A.2d 349 (1945). Clearly in the case at hand, the credibility of the alibi witnesses was properly in issue and it was permissible for the state\u2019s attorney to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the alibi on cross-examination in an attempt to discredit the alibi claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>supra, 333. The question before us, therefore, is relatively narrow: whether the failure of the witnesses to approach the police with their alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>story was relevant on the issue of credibility or, more specifically, the issue of fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We have never specifically addressed the relevance of such questioning in the context raised at trial. The defendant claims that silence is \u201cinherently ambiguous\u201d and that an alibi witness\u2019s failure to volunteer information is, therefore, of little, if any, probative value. In cases involving the use of the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of accusation under <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), we have recognized that a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence following <em>Miranda, </em>warnings was \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 535, 498 A.2d 76 (1985); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 177, 95 S. Ct. 2133, 45 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1975). Outside of the narrow confines of <em>Doyle, </em>however, the \u201c[c]ommon law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted. 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1042, p. 1056 (Chadbourn Rev. 1970).\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 239, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1980). Although we do not believe that an alibi witness has a duty to report an alibi story to the police or, for that matter, to any other person, a witness in many instances naturally may be expected to convey such information, especially when the witness is friendly with the accused. Failure of the witness to do so would, under these circumstances, constitute grounds for impeachment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>584 F.2d 612, 617-18 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 935, 99 S. Ct. 1280, 59 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>156 Cal. App. 3d 920, 203 Cal. Rptr. 338, 343-44 (1984); <em>People </em>v. <em>Welte, </em>77 Ill. App. 3d 663, 665-66, 396 N.E.2d 315 (1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>LaFayette, </em>138 Mich. App. 380, 389, 360 N.W.2d 891 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>472 Pa. 435, 459, 372 A.2d 771 (1977); cf. <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Dawson, </em>50 N.Y.2d 311, 406 N.E.2d 771, 428 N.Y.S.2d 914 (1980); see generally annot., 20 A.L.R.4th 245, 267-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The alibi witnesses in this case were shown to be friends or acquaintances of the defendant and it would only have been natural for them to exculpate the defendant of any wrongdoing by approaching the police. We therefore conclude that the trial court correctly allowed the state\u2019s attorney to impeach the alibi witnesses by questioning their failure to relate their stories to the police. Because we find that the impeachment of the alibi witnesses was justified, the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s final argument was improper is similarly unavailing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> The state also called two Wallingford police officers. They corroborated the victim\u2019s characterization of the events, testifying, inter alia, on the way the victim came into the police station, his physical condition, how he gave his statement to them and how he identified the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> The victim also made an in-court identification of the defendant. Although the defendant has implied that the identifications were unreliable, he does not argue that they were the product of unnecessarily suggestive police procedures and does not contest their admission into evidence.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 213-14, 506 A.2d 125 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 580, 469 A.2d 397 (1983). The defendant objected to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questioning and argument only on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant and never raised this constitutional claim below. The defendant cites no case law to support the position that mere impeachment of the credibility of alibi witnesses implicates the right to present a defense. In our judgment the defendant has placed a \u201cconstitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). Because the sixth amendment claim was not distinctly raised below and because the record does not adequately support a claim that the defendant was clearly deprived of a fundamental right and a fair trial, we do not review its merits. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyler-Barcomb, </em>197 Conn. 666, 674-75 n.5, 500 A.2d 1324 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1109, 106 S. Ct. 1518, 89 L. Ed. 2d 916 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). The focus of our discussion is therefore limited to the relevance of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questioning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b316-5\"> The state\u2019s attorney argued: \u201c[They are] going back 18 months and recalling, what occurred on this supposed date of March 20.

The record does not support such a claim. In fact, the state\u2019s attorney openly admitted in explaining his questioning that: \u201cI am not sure [a witness] has a duty but I am curious whether [he] did go down.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
