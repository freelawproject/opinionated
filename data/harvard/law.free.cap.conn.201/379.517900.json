App. 125, 128-29, 497 A.2d 79 (1985). Upon the grant of certification the state has appealed to this court, claiming error in the conclusion of the Appellate Court that \u201cour bribe receiving statute [\u00a7 53a-148] ... is not a specific intent crime.\u201d We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, but upon grounds different from those relied upon by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The facts as stated in the Appellate Court opinion are not disputed in this appeal. The defendant, a New Haven police officer, was employed in an off-duty capacity as a security guard during a rock concert at the New Haven Coliseum. It was the policy of the Coliseum to place uniformed off-duty police officers at the emergency doors of the arena. During intermission a security officer employed by the Coliseum observed the defendant permit two young men to enter the arena through the doorway he had been assigned to guard. The defendant then called the two men back, whereupon each of them took money from his wallet and passed it to the defendant. After the security officer reported the incident, the defendant was charged with bribe receiving in violation of \u00a7 53a-148.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The trial court, in rendering judgment in a decision delivered orally from the bench, found that the state had failed to prove the existence of any corrupt agreement or understanding prior to the defendant\u2019s receipt of the money from the two young men. Concluding that proof of such an element was essential for a conviction of bribe receiving under \u00a7 53a-148, the court implicitly acquitted the defendant of that charge. It found him guilty, nevertheless, of accepting <em>\u201ca </em>reward, gift or gratuity for the purpose of influencing his behavior\u201d as a police officer in violation of \u00a7 29-9, deeming this misdemeanor offense to be included within the felony charge of \u00a7 53a-148.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Appellate Court set aside the conviction upon the ground that \u00a7 29-9 was not an offense included within \u00a7 53a-148. The court reasoned that \u00a7 29-9 required an element of specific intent\u2014that the gratuity be received for the purpose of influencing the police officer\u2019s behavior in office\u2014not contained in \u00a7 53a-148. Accordingly, the Appellate Court concluded, it was possible to commit the greater offense proscribed by \u00a7 53a-148 without violating \u00a7 29-9 and, therefore, the latter was not encompassed by the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">When we granted certification for this appeal from the Appellate Court, the only issue presented by the petition was as follows: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court erred in concluding that our bribe receiving statute [53a-148], which requires proof that the benefit offered be accepted \u2018for, because of, or as consideration for\u2019 an official decision, is not a specific intent crime.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 3154 (now \u00a7 4132) provides that \u201c[t]he issues which the <em>appellant </em>may present are limited to those raised in the petition for certification . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) While \u201c[t]he only issues we need consider are those squarely raised by the petition for certification,\u201d we have recognized that an appellee, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a) (now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u00a7 4013 [a]), may present alternative grounds upon which the judgment may be affirmed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 434 n.6, 493 A.2d 865 (1985); see also Practice Book \u00a7 3158 (now \u00a7 4140). \u201cIn addition, under extraordinary circumstances . . . we may review matters not raised before the Appellate Court and resolve issues not determined by the Appellate Court.\u201d Id., 434 n.5; see <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>191 Conn. 309, 315, 464 A.2d 771 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We have concluded that it would be inappropriate to respond to the question contained in the petition because of the factual determination made by the trial court in acquitting the defendant under \u00a7 53a-148. The court found there was no \u201ccorrupt agreement\u201d prior to the defendant\u2019s receipt of the money from the two persons he had allowed to enter the arena. This finding precluded a conviction under \u00a7 29-9, which requires that the \u201creward, gift or gratuity\u201d be received by a police officer \u201cfor the purpose of influencing his behavior in office.\u201d The trial court clearly erred in implicitly finding this mental element to have been proved to support a conviction under \u00a7 29-9 after having expressly found that the \u201cexistence of a corrupt prior agreement or understanding\u201d could not be inferred from the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A response, therefore, to the question whether \u00a7 53a-148 is a specific intent crime, as posed by the petition, would be virtually an academic exercise. The finding of the trial court definitively resolves the issue of the existence of the mental element necessary for a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>viction under either \u00a7 53a-148 or \u00a7 29-9 in favor of the defendant, a factual determination which this court cannot overturn without disregarding constitutional principles of double jeopardy as well as standards of appellate practice. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D (now \u00a7 4061); <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 10-17, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978). Whether the state of mind claimed to be an element of \u00a7 53a-148 is identical in all respects to that required by \u00a7 29-9, the trial court by acquitting the defendant of the former offense must be deemed to have found any such mental element unproved. The question presented by the petition has essentially been mooted by the finding of the trial court, since a response thereto cannot affect the outcome of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">As we have noted previously, we are not limited to the issues presented in the petition if the judgment of the Appellate Court may be affirmed on some other ground. Our conclusion that the express finding of the trial court, that no agreement preceded the defendant\u2019s receipt of the money, precludes a conviction under \u00a7 29-9 requires that we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court setting aside the conviction and directing an acquittal. We also affirm the conclusion of that court that an acquittal is necessary because the defendant has been found guilty of an offense not included within the charge of bribe receiving as set forth in the information and bill of particulars.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The basis for our view, however, is that \u00a7 29-9 bans the acceptance of gratuities by police officers only and does not apply to other \u201cpublic servants,\u201d a term broadly defined for the purpose of \u00a7 53a-148 to mean \u201can officer or employee of government, elected or appointed, and any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>participating as adviser, consultant or otherwise, paid or unpaid, in performing a governmental function.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-146 (3). One need not be a police officer to violate \u00a7 53a-148, but must have that status for a violation of \u00a7 29-9. The information and bill of particulars charging the defendant with violating \u00a7 53a-148 failed to allege that he was a police officer and contained no reference to his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The test for determining whether one crime is a lesser included offense of another crime is whether it is possible to commit the greater offense in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars without having first committed the lesser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 428, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). Under the charging documents in this case a \u201cpublic servant\u201d other than a police officer could have violated \u00a7 53a-148 without necessarily violating \u00a7 29-9. It is clear, therefore, that \u00a7 29-9 was not a lesser included offense and the conviction of the defendant must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 29-9. acceptance or offering of gifts or REWARDS BY OR TO STATE OR LOCAL police, (a) Any state police officer appointed as provided in section 29-4, any police officer of any city, town or borough and any person having the power of arrest who, directly or indirectly, receives a reward, gift or gratuity for the purpose of influencing his behavior in office, or any person who gives, offers or promises to a police officer or any person having the power of arrest any reward, gift or gratuity with the intent to influence his behavior in office, shall be fined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both, and the police officer shall be dishonorably discharged from the division of state police or from the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u201c(b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to rewards, gifts or gratuities which are approved by the commissioner of public safety, or the police chief or board of police commissioners, as the case may be, and are given to the police officer on account of his official services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-148.
