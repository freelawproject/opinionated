General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 25-32, 25-34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first case is an equitable action brought by the Connecticut Water Company to compel the Metropolitan District Commission to honor contractual obligations under a 1914 contract between these two parties, and to order the commissioner of health services to stay administrative proceedings against the Connecticut Water Company until these contract claims have been resolved. In that case, the Connecticut Water Company has appealed from the judgment of the trial court, <em>N. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>granting the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity. The sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ond case is an administrative appeal by the Connecticut Water Company from the order of the commissioner directing it to build the needed water treatment plant. In that case, the Connecticut Water Company has appealed from the judgment of the trial court, <em>Clark, J., </em>dismissing the administrative appeal. We consolidated the two appeals in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">While these appeals were pending, the Connecticut Water Company and the Metropolitan District Commission, on August 13, 1986, entered into a new contract delineating their mutual rights and duties for the construction of the Collinsville water treatment plant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The commissioner thereupon filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in the equitable action on the ground of mootness. Upon consideration of the record before us and the arguments of counsel, we have determined that this motion should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In the administrative appeal, the parties are in disagreement about what effect this court should give to the contractual settlement between the Connecticut Water Company and the Metropolitan District Commission. The appeal by the Connecticut Water Company does not seriously dispute the administrative determination that the drinking water supply of the Collinsville Division of the Connecticut Water Company fails to meet regulatory standards for minimum color and turbidity. What continues to be at issue, however, is the question of who should bear the responsibility for correcting these deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The centrality of the issue of responsibility is evident from the administrative record. The hearing officer who made the factual findings of noncompliance with regulatory standards held both the Connecticut Water Company and the Metropolitan District Commission responsible, and proposed that each of them be ordered to terminate the continuing violations. The commissioner took a different view. He determined that \u201c[i]n the instant case, the Department of Health Services should not allow itself to become a party to the dispute between the Metropolitan District Commission and the Connecticut Water Company. It elects therefore to issue orders directed to the Connecticut Water Company alone as it has the obligation to see that the water it serves to its consumers meets the regulatory standards. Although the raw water supplied by the Metropolitan District Commission to the Connecticut Water Company does not comply with the regulations, the Connecticut Water Company as the purchaser of the water has the obligation to see that it does.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Accordingly, the commissioner\u2019s order required the Connecticut Water Company alone to comply with a stated schedule for the construction of a water treatment plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">It is obvious, on this record, that the administrative order presently on appeal was based, at least in part, on facts that no longer obtain. The record establishes that \u201cthe dispute between the Metropolitan District Commission and the Connecticut Water Company\u201d was a significant factor in the commissioner\u2019s assignment of unilateral responsibility for correction of the violation of water standards. As in <em>Laurel Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>194 Conn. 677, 683, 485 A.2d 1272 (1984), the eviden-tiary basis for the commissioner\u2019s decision has been cast into doubt by the emergence of new information that was not previously available. In these circumstances, we conclude that the administrative appeal has merit to the limited extent that this case should be remanded to the commissioner for reconsideration of his order in light of the contract of August 13, 1986. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In Docket No. 12720, the appeal is dismissed. In Docket No. 12878, the judgment is set aside and the trial court is directed to remand the case for further proceedings before the commissioner of health services.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 25-32 provides in relevant part: \u201cSec. 25-32. department OP HEALTH SERVICES JURISDICTION RE WATER AND ICE SUPPLIES.
