The defendant claims on appeal that: (1) the trial court erred in denying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>motion to dismiss on the basis of the warrantless arrest of the defendant; (2) the state failed to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence, thereby depriving the defendant of his right to due process of law; (3) the state refused to grant immunity to a defense witness who asserted her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, thereby violating the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to confrontation, compulsory process and the right to present a defense; and (4) he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On December 30,1983, at approximately 3 a.m., the defendant met the victim at the corner of Edge-wood Avenue and Garden Street in New Haven. The victim, a prostitute, was sitting with three other women at the time. She asked the defendant if he knew where she could get some marihuana. The defendant replied that he did and offered to take the victim to a place where she could obtain it. During their conversation, the victim agreed to perform fellatio on the defendant in return for a specified sum of money. The defendant told her that they could go to his car, which he had parked in a nearby parking lot. Upon passing the lot, however, the victim became concerned and informed the defendant that she wished to go back. When she attempted to walk away, the defendant grabbed her from behind and told her that he would stab her if she screamed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The defendant then forced the victim to continue walking with him to a four story house on Carlisle Street in New Haven. The defendant brought the victim to the back of the building and pushed her down a stairway into an empty room in the basement, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>he forced her to undress and lie on her coat. The defendant found $180 in the pocket of the victim\u2019s pants, which he took and placed in his own pocket. He then proceeded to assault the victim sexually. Thereafter, the defendant took the victim to an apartment on Davenport Avenue in New Haven. When the defendant fell asleep, the victim took the keys to the apartment and fled. She then encountered a police officer on the street and informed him that she had been sexually assaulted. Two other officers were dispatched to the scene, and the victim took them to the apartment on Davenport Avenue where she had left the defendant sleeping. The police found the defendant at the apartment along with some belongings of the victim. Both the victim and the defendant were transported to the police station where the defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. The defendant claimed in the trial court that his warrant-less arrest was unconstitutional, and that under <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900 (1965), the charges against him should have been dismissed. The trial court denied the motion, and on appeal the defendant initially asserted the same claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari. </em>Subsequent to the filing of the defendant\u2019s brief, we overruled <em>Licari </em>in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 257-63, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 341, 514 A.2d 337 (1986), we held that <em>Fleming </em>is to be applied retroactively. Thereafter, the defendant filed a reply brief addressing the effect of <em>Fleming </em>and <em>Ryerson </em>on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\"In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 263, we held that '[w]here the fairness of a subsequent prosecution has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>not been impaired by an illegal arrest, neither the federal nor the Connecticut constitution requires dismissal of the charges or a voiding of the resulting conviction.\u2019 An illegal arrest may impair the fairness of a subsequent prosecution only where <em>evidence </em>obtained as a direct consequence of that arrest is admitted against the defendant at trial. Id., 262; <em>State </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>179 Conn. 46, 425 A.2d 916 (1979).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>supra, 338. In the present case, the defendant appears to argue that he was deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial because statements obtained as a consequence of his unlawful arrest were admitted against him at trial. The defendant acknowledges, however, that he did not pursue a motion to suppress statements that he filed prior to trial, nor did he obtain a ruling from the trial court on this motion. Further, the defendant did not object to the admission of his statements at trial. He argues, for the first time in his reply brief, that despite these lapses he is entitled to a new trial, or, in the alternative, a remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We have consistently held that only in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 9-10, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985). Because the record in this case, however, adequately supports a claim that the defendant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial, we will review the defendant\u2019s claim of error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>190 Conn. 639, 654-57, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Without deciding whether there was probable cause to arrest the defendant, we find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim because any possible error resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the admission of the defendant\u2019s statements at trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>supra, 655. There was overwhelming evidence that the defendant had been with the victim on the evening in question and that he had had sexual intercourse with her. The main issue at trial was whether the intercourse had been consensual. The defendant\u2019s statements, which were admitted through a police officer who interrogated him, served only to corroborate the defendant\u2019s version of the incident. Under the circumstances of this case, therefore, the admission of his statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>supra, 657; see <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>168 Conn. 541, 548, 363 A.2d 49 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred in denying both his motion to strike testimony concerning missing evidence and his request that the state be prevented from referring to missing evidence during its closing argument. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">During the attack on the victim, the defendant spread the victim\u2019s coat on the floor and ordered her to lie on it. He then proceeded to assault her sexually. Since the victim had been menstruating at the time of the assault, the coat became stained with blood. Detective Donna Amato of the New Haven police department observed the blood stains on the coat, but did not retain the coat as evidence. Thereafter the victim had the coat cleaned. During the trial, the victim and Amato testified that the victim\u2019s coat had contained blood and semen stains. This testimony was admitted without any objection by the defendant. On cross-examination of the victim, defense counsel questioned the victim extensively about having had the coat cleaned. These were the only references to the stains on the victim\u2019s coat that occurred in the presence of the jury. Prior to closing arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the defendant moved to strike the testimony concerning the stains, and to have the court instruct the state not to emphasize the evidence in closing argument. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 724, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985), that \u201c \u2018[t]he requirements of due process are met in the trial of a person accused of crime if he has been given the benefit of a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the settled course of judicial proceedings in this state.\u2019 <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>145 Conn. 11, 19, 138 A.2d 512, cert. denied, 356 U.S. 969, 78 S. Ct. 1010, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1075 (1958).\u201d Whether testimony concerning the coat, without the coat itself being available, deprived the defendant of a fair trial depends upon the reason for its unavailability to the defense, the materiality of the missing evidence, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of testimony about the coat by witnesses or the jury, and the prejudice to the defendant caused by its unavailability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>188 Conn. 372, 381, 449 A.2d 1020 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 326-27, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Applying those factors to the present case, we conclude that the defendant was not deprived of his right to due process. There is no showing that the police acted in bad faith or maliciously in deciding not to retain the coat. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>supra, 382. Further, the police had no reason to believe that the coat contained exculpatory evidence. The stain on the coat was a blood stain that had been caused by the victim\u2019s menstrual bleeding. The defendant fails to show how any evidence of seminal stains on the coat, even if they existed, would have been material to his defense. Id. Admittedly, such evidence might be material in determining the identity of an assailant. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>173 Conn. 317, 325, 377 A.2d 1082 (1977). In this case, however, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>no question that the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim. The defendant does not address the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of the testimony by the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>supra. Since, however, there was no dispute at trial that the defendant had had intercourse with the victim, the jury was not likely to have misinterpreted any reference to seminal stains on the coat. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Herndon, </em>536 F.2d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir. 1976). Finally, the defendant has not made any showing that any test conducted on the coat would have produced exculpatory evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 725-26. The victim testified that she had had sexual relations with numerous men prior to the defendant\u2019s attack on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Under the circumstances, we find that the trial court did not err in (1) refusing to strike testimony concerning the missing evidence, or (2) denying the request to prevent reference to the coat during the state\u2019s closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s failure to grant immunity to a key defense witness deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. At trial the defendant sought to call Margaret Erkard, the defendant\u2019s sister, as a witness for the defense. On direct examination, the witness asserted her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination as to any questions concerning her contact with the victim. The defendant then sought a grant of immunity for Erkard from the state\u2019s attorney, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was denied. The defendant argues on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>appeal that the language of General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a should be construed broadly to include provisions for granting of immunity to witnesses for the defense, as well as recalcitrant witnesses for the prosecution. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The defendant concedes, as he must, that this very same claim was rejected by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 210-11, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976). As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra, 211, \u201c[a]s there is no other statutory authority granting immunity, and as \u00a7 54-47a does not apply to this case, the defendant has no source of authority for his position.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>172 Conn. 542, 561, 375 A.2d 1014, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 855, 98 S. Ct. 174, 54 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1977); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>174 Conn. 16, 21, 381 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>536 (1977). The defendant has failed to cite any new authority to support a different interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a, nor has he given any cogent reason for us to reconsider our prior interpretation of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of his witness, Tanya Randolph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Randolph testified concerning her relationship with the victim, and also stated in a nonresponsive answer that the victim \"had called somebody about some money to drop the charges.\u201d After further questioning by defense counsel, Randolph testified that the victim had telephoned the defendant\u2019s sister to discuss the possibility of dropping the charges against the defendant in return for a sum of money. According to Randolph, the defendant\u2019s sister told the victim that she had no money to offer her. The defendant did not move to strike the testimony of Randolph at this time. Subsequently, the defendant called his sister, Margaret Erkard, to the stand, but, as previously noted, she refused to testify by asserting her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. After the state refused to grant Erkard immunity pursuant to \u00a7 54-47a, the defendant moved to strike that portion of Randolph\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s phone call to Erkard. The trial court denied the motion and the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if error is not of constitutional dimension, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). The defendant argues that because Erkard did not testify, the only testimony concerning the phone conversation between the victim and Erkard that was before the jury was that given in a nonresponsive answer by Randolph. The defendant seems to argue that Randolph\u2019s testimony necessitated calling Erkard to testify on behalf of the defendant, and that the jury could have drawn an adverse inference from Erkard\u2019s failure to testify since they were unaware that she had asserted her fifth amendment privilege. These arguments, however, fail to establish that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to strike, even if erroneous, was harmful to the defendant. First, the defendant does not indicate how Randolph\u2019s testimony harmed him. If anything, it appears to be more prejudicial to the state\u2019s case than to the defendant\u2019s. Moreover, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that it could draw no adverse inference from Erkard\u2019s failure to testify. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s ruling was neither harmful nor prejudicial to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 404; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 141, 486 A.2d 637 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at his trial. Our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 542, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986), established the proper procedure regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claims. \u201c[W]e shall not review at this time even the portion of the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim that he contends is adequately supported by the record. Though we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>resolved his other claims of error, we believe that his ineffective assistance claim should be resolved, not in piecemeal fashion, but as a totality after an evidentiary hearing in the trial court where the attorney whose conduct is in question may have an opportunity to testify.\u201d Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> Another claim of error alleging a violation of the defendant\u2019s speedy trial right was withdrawn at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-47a. compelling testimony of witness, immunity FROM prosecution, (a) Whenever in the judgment of the chief state\u2019s attorney, a state\u2019s attorney or the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney, the testimony of any witness or the production of books, papers or other evidence of any witness, in any criminal proceeding involving narcotics, arson, bribery, gambling, election law violations, felonious crimes of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>lence or any violation which is an offense under the provisions of title 25, before a court, grand jury of this state or, as provided in subsection (b) of section 54-47, a state referee, judge of the superior court or a three-judge panel of said court, is necessary to the public interest, the chief state\u2019s attorney, the state\u2019s attorney, or the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney, may, with notice to the witness, after the witness has claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, make application to the court for an order directing the witness to testify or produce evidence subject to the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\u201c(b) Upon the issuance of the order such witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, papers or other evidence in such case or proceeding on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture.

In the past, we have declined to address issues not properly presented to this court. <em>Robert S. Weiss &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>196 Conn. 614, 617, 495 A.2d 1006 (1985); <em>Presutti </em>v. <em>Presutti, </em>181 Conn. 622, 625-26, 436 A.2d 299 (1980). Under the revised Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a) (now \u00a7 4013) effective October 1,1986, and made applicable to pending appeals by Practice Book \u00a7 4189 (formerly \u00a7 3166), the defendant\u2019s failure to identify this issue in his preliminary statement of issues does not preclude its review unless the state is prejudiced thereby. The state does not argue, nor do we feel, that it would be prejudiced by our review of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
