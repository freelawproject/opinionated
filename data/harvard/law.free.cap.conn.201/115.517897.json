Each petitioner, being unable to obtain bail, was confined in a community correctional center under a mittimus prior to sentencing. The habeas court ordered the respondent commissioner of correction (commissioner) to credit each petitioner with presentence jail time pursuant to \u00a7 18-98, which entitles a person who has been denied bail or has been unable to obtain bail to a commutation of his sentence by the number of presentence days that he spent in a community correctional center. The petitioners had already received credit for the same presentence time pursuant to \u00a7 18-97, which entitles a person to jail time credit for any presentence days spent in custody under a mit-timus.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In their stipulation of facts, the parties in both cases summarized the respective procedural histories. The petitioner Ronald G. Sutton was arrested on June 22, 1979, and was incarcerated pursuant to a mittimus and also because of his failure to obtain bail. On July 7, 1981, he pleaded guilty to the offenses of sexual assault in the first degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70; kidnapping in the second degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94a; and threatening; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62; as charged in the state\u2019s substitute information. After the petitioner had been sentenced, the trial court granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, held the sentences void, and ordered a new trial. At the ensuing trial, the jury found the petitioner guilty on all three counts of the substitute information, and the court resentenced him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time he was resentenced, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>awarded the petitioner credit for presentence jail time served under a mittimus, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-97. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The petitioner John J. McCarthy was arrested on August 5,1980, and was jailed pursuant to a mittimus and also because of his failure to obtain bail. He was convicted of multiple crimes of burglary and larceny and sentenced on June 26, 1981. The commissioner credited the petitioner with his presentence jail time served under the mittimus, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In the petitions for writs of habeas corpus presently before us, the petitioners challenged the commissioner\u2019s refusal to credit them with presentence jail time pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-98,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>credit already received for the same presentence jail time under General Statutes \u00a7 18-97. Petitioners Sutton and McCarthy claimed they were entitled to credit for 796 and 325 presentence days, respectively, for time spent in a community correctional center while they were unable to obtain bail. The trial court, <em>Barry, J., </em>finding the language of \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 to be plain and unambiguous, held that the petitioners were entitled to the additional credit they sought because their factual situations came within the precise language of each statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find error in the granting of the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The proper application of \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 requires us to reconcile a number of basic principles of statutory construction. Our fundamental objective in construing a statute is to carry out the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 716-17, 513 A.2d 43 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980); 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we have refused to speculate as to the legislative intention, because it is assumed that the words express the intention of the legislature. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Conn. 434, 438-39, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981); <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981). Accordingly, we have declined to \u201cread into the-terms of a statute something which manifestly is not there in order to reach what the court thinks would be a just result\u201d; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 315, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Malm, </em>143 Conn. 462, 467, 123 A.2d 276 (1956); and have consistently applied statutes \u201c \u2018without reference to whether we think [they] would have been or could be improved by the inclusion of other provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 247, 252, 363 A.2d 121 (1975), quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Way, </em>107 Conn. 633, 639, 141 A. 858 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Both \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 provide presentence jail credit to arrestees detained under different, yet precisely defined, circumstances. We have, therefore, refused on many occasions to delve into the actual intent of the legislature with respect to these statutes, holding that each statute was plain and unambiguous on its face. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 314; <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 438; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 251; <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 392, 362 A.2d 971 (1975); <em>Mancinone </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>162 Conn. 430, 439, 294 A.2d 564 (1972). While we have determined that each statute, when read separately, is clear and unambiguous, we have not resolved the issue, now raised, of whether they were intended to apply cumulatively to an arrestee who qualifies for credit under each statute, as the habeas court held. Because the statutes are silent upon the subject of alternative or cumulative application, they are ambiguous with respect to this issue and we are compelled to look beyond their words to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 674; <em>Tramontano </em>v. <em>Dilieto, </em>192 Conn. 426, 433-34, 472 A.2d 768 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Although we must presume that the legislature intended to enact one consistent body of law; <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 59, 444 A.2d 225 (1982); and that it knew of the existence of two bills on the same general subject, both having been raised during the same legislative session; <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 205, 440 A.2d 286 (1982); there is no indication in the legislative history of the statutes as to whether they were intended to apply alternatively or cumulatively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We look, therefore, to the practice of the department of correction in administering these statutes and in calculating presentence jail time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">While it is the province of the courts and not the administrative agency to expound and apply the governing principles of law; <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 144, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>FOIC, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980); this court has accorded considerable deference to the construction given a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement, particularly when the agency has consistently followed its construction over a long period of time. <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199 (1986); <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>163 Conn. 309, 326, 307 A.2d 155 (1972) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>concurring) cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S. Ct. 903, 34 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1973); <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>178 Conn. 509, 518, 423 A.2d 156 (1979). The habeas court, in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>memorandum of decision, was \u201cmindful of the seventeen year practice of the department of correction to apply these statutes alternatively, one to the exclusion of the other.\u201d We view this established procedure as according with the more logical interpretation of the statutes, presumably the construction contemplated by the legislature. We conceive of no rational basis, nor have the petitioners suggested any, upon which the legislature could have intended to distinguish between arrestees confined for the same period of time prior to sentencing who are held both because of inability to obtain bail and because of a mittimus and those who fit under only one of these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">This court has traditionally eschewed construction of statutory language that leads to absurd results or thwarts its manifest purpose. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 61, 502 A.2d 360 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 643-44, 410 A.2d 475 (1979); <em>Milano </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>166 Conn. 178, 187, 348 A.2d 590 (1974); see Llewellyn, \u201cRemarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to be Construed,\u201d 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 401 (1950). The law clearly favors a rational statutory construction and we must presume that the legislature intended a sensible result. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). The construction of \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 offered by the petitioners and adopted by the habeas court would reward a prisoner, fortunate enough to fall within the guidelines of both statutes, with double presentence credit upon his sentence. It would be bizarre to credit a pretrial detainee, unable to make bail, for presentence time in jail at twice the rate allowed for time served after sentencing. It is more reasonable to conclude that the legislature enacted \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 as alternative mechanisms in order to ensure that all those detained in jail prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>to sentence, whether pursuant to a mittimus or because of inability to make bail, earn credit for time served before sentence to the same extent as for time served after sentence has been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We further note that under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-64a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 54-64b<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> every arrested person unable to make bail or arrested for a crime which is not bailable is ordinarily committed to a community correctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>center pursuant to a mittimus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In light of this statutory requirement, every arrestee who is not released on bail will satisfy the requirements of both \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 and be entitled to double jail time credit under the construction of the statutes adopted by the trial court. This extraordinary consequence, doubling the presentence credit for prisoners, could hardly have been intended and further buttresses our conclusion that the petitioners\u2019 construction of the statutes is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Additionally, in <em>Holmquist v. Manson, </em>supra, 393-94, we recognized that \u201cthe purpose of the \u2018jail-time\u2019 statutes is to give recognition to the period of presentence time served and to permit the prisoner, in effect, to commence serving his sentence from the time he was compelled to remain in custody due to a mittimus (\u00a7 18-97) <em>or </em>because of the court\u2019s refusal to allow bail or the defendant\u2019s inability to raise bail (\u00a7 18-98).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Obviously, interpreting the statutes to allow double credit for the same sentence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> would not only allow an arrestee to begin serving his sentence from the time of his arrest, but would eventually result in a <em>shorter </em>period of incarceration than if the detainee had made bail. Again, this result defies common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Consequently, in light of the inveterate practice of the department of correction in calculating jail time credit and because the offered construction of the statutes leads to what we view as a bizarre result, we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 cannot be applied cumulatively to the same sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">There is error, the judgments are set aside and the cases are remanded with direction to render judgments denying the petitions for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>197 Conn. 485, 498 A.2d 65 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1073, 106 S. Ct. 833, 88 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1986), this court concluded that the new sentences, longer than the first, were constitutionally infirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>because the record did not demonstrate \u201cthat the increased sentences were based on objective information concerning identifiable conduct occurring subsequent to the original sentencing\u201d; id., 504; in accordance with the standard set forth in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). We remanded the case for further resentencing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>supra, 505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 18-97. confinement under a mittimus: presentence confinement credit prior TO .July 1,1981.

Further, because prisoners are committed to the commissioner of correction under \u00a7 54-64a, and because the commissioner has the authority to commit a prisoner to any state correctional institution; General Statutes \u00a7 18-87; a prisoner possibly may not be committed to a community correctional center. For these reasons, it is conceivable that some persons, not arrested pursuant to a bench warrant and unable to make bail, may fail to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 18-97, because they were not committed pursuant to a mittimus, and of \u00a7 18-98, because they were not committed to a community correctional center. See also General Statutes \u00a7 7-135 (presentence detention in lieu of bond and without a mittimus by a local police officer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> The habeas court, in its memorandum of decision, and the petitioners, in their brief on appeal, rely, to a large extent on our decison in <em>Mancinone </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>162 Conn. 430, 294 A.2d 564 (1972), in support of their argument that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 compel an award of multiple jail time credit. We find such reliance to be misdirected. In <em>Mancinone </em>we held that under \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 an arrestee detained both under a mittimus and as a parole violator was eligible for presentence credit on the postparole crime, as well as on the sentence on which he had been paroled, even though he would not have been released from custody if he had been able to make bail. Although <em>Mancinone </em>stands for the proposition that our presentence jail time statutes may require that jail time served be credited to multiple sentences, it does not address the issue, now before us, of whether presentence jail time that qualifies under both \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 can be applied twice to the <em>same </em>sentence. See also <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 439, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> We note that the legislature has made General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 inapplicable to offenses committed on or after July 1,1981, and has enacted General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d which grants credit for presentence confinement resulting from an offense committed after that date. Although the petitioners\u2019 claim of double credit on a single sentence is expressly precluded by \u00a7 18-98d, we have found no legislative history to indicate that this statutory change was intended to resolve the issue before us for prisoners who committed offenses prior to July 1, 1981. 23 S.
