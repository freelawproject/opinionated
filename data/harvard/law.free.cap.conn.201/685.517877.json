J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE5\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Teacher Evaluation Act in General Statutes \u00a7 10-151b makes proposals concerning the procedures that govern teacher evaluations a mandatory subject of collective bargaining between a local school board and a local teachers\u2019 union. The plaintiff, Wethersfield Board of Education, successfully appealed, in the trial court, a declaratory ruling of the Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations requiring the board to bargain about proposals concerning teacher evaluation procedures tendered by the defendant, Wethersfield Federation of Teachers. The defendant has appealed to this court from the judgment of the trial court. We find no error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The case has been tried on stipulated facts. The plaintiff, Wethersfield Board of Education (hereinafter school board), as the duly constituted board of education for the town of Wethersfield, is an employer within the meaning of the Teacher Negotiation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a et seq. The defendant, Wethersfield Federation of Teachers (hereinafter federation), represents the certified professional employees of the school board in the teachers\u2019 unit defined in the act. When these proceedings were initiated, the parties were engaged in bargaining for a successor collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The collective bargaining agreement that was in force in 1982 established procedures for the evaluation of teachers. Its provisions entitled each teacher to a written copy of each evaluation, and to the right to discuss his evaluation with his evaluator. They also permitted a teacher to file a grievance concerning an unfavorable evaluation, but only on the grounds of bad faith or discrimination. Finally, in a provision that the school board proposed to eliminate, an advisory committee was designated to suggest improvements in the evaluation form to the superintendent of schools. *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the process of bargaining for a new contract, the federation proffered ten new proposals for procedures to govern teacher evaluation. The school board agreed to negotiate about the first of these proposals, which provided that a teacher\u2019s rebuttal of an evaluation must accompany the evaluation contained in the teacher\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>personnel file. The school board has, however, refused to bargain about the federation\u2019s remaining proposals which would, inter alia, require prior consultation before evaluations, permit unlimited grievances, and preclude classroom observations by anyone other than a certified administrator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>In its declaratory ruling, the State Board of Labor Relations (hereinafter labor board) ruled only on those proposals of the federation that it determined would relate to the procedures to be used in evaluating teachers within the unit. The labor board expressly declined to rule on whether the substantive standards to be used in teacher evaluations are mandatory or permissive subjects of collective bargaining, and requested supplemental briefs concerning the federation\u2019s proposal to permit teachers to appeal adverse evaluations through the grievance process. With these limitations, the labor board ruled that the remaining federation proposals were mandatory subjects of collective bargaining because they related directly to teacher job security. This conclusion was, according to the labor board, bolstered by the language of General Statutes \u00a7 10-151b which permits local boards of education and teachers\u2019 representatives to supplement, \u201cby mutual agreement,\u201d state guidelines for the evaluation of teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The trial court decided, contrary to the reasoning of the labor board, that, in enacting a revised \u00a7 10-151b in 1974, the legislature had excluded the subject of teacher evaluation guidelines from mandatory bargaining. Relying on a textual change in the wording of the statute, which substituted \u201cmutual agreement\u201d for \u201cnegotiation\u201d as the operative method for arriving at local guidelines for teacher evaluation, the court held that the legislature had effectively removed the subject of teacher evaluations from the negotiation process. The court concluded that the present controversy was governed by the specific provisions of \u00a7 10-151b, rather than by the more general mandate of \u00a7 10-153a on which the labor board had primarily focused its attention. The court further concluded that the federation\u2019s proposals, although limited to procedures, infringed upon the school board\u2019s managerial author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ity to evaluate the teachers it employs in accordance with existing statutory law. Accordingly, the court reversed the decision of the labor board.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The federation in its appeal to this court claims that the trial court erred in each of its conclusions of law. The federation\u2019s written brief attacks the trial court\u2019s rulings that: (1) \u00a7 10-151b removes the subject of teacher evaluation guidelines from the scope of mandatory bargaining; (2) teacher evaluation procedures are not subject to mandatory bargaining, despite the fact that they relate, as the labor board held, to conditions of employment; and (3) the federation\u2019s proposals for teacher evaluation procedures infringe upon the school board\u2019s statutory authority to evaluate the teachers it employs. At oral argument, however, the federation agreed that the dispositive question is one of statutory construction. Does \u00a7 10-151b make it mandatory or permissive for the parties engaged in collective bargaining to negotiate about teacher evaluations? Like the trial court, we interpret \u00a7 10-15 lb to make such bargaining permissive rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Our interpretation of the meaning and scope of \u00a7 10-151b takes place within well defined limits. \u201cThe fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern this intent, we look to the words of the statute itself ... to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute ... to legislative practice and policy . . . and to judicial construction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673-74, 509 A.2d 20 (1986), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Section 10-151b is part of what is commonly referred to as the Teacher Evaluation Act. As first enacted, in 1973, it provided, in subsection (c), that teacher evaluations \u201cshall be based upon minimum performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>criteria established by the state board of education and such additional performance criteria as the local or regional board of education may, <em>by negotiation, </em>establish.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1973, No. 73-456, \u00a7 1. A year later the statute was amended to its present form. Public Acts 1974, No. 74-278, \u00a7 1. It continues to provide for locally adopted supplements to state prescribed baseline criteria for teacher evaluations, but it defines the process for arriving at such supplemental criteria differently. As reenacted, \u00a7 10-151b now states, in subsection (a), that there shall be continuous teacher evaluations \u201cin accordance with guidelines established by the state board of education for the development of evaluation programs <em>and such other guidelines as may be established by mutual agreement </em>between the local or regional board of education and the teachers\u2019 representative chosen pursuant to section 10-153b . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Despite this change in the text of \u00a7 10-151b, the federation, and the labor board as amicus, argue that the revised statute does not remove procedures for teacher evaluation from the ambit of mandatory bargaining for three reasons. First, they maintain that the statute\u2019s use of the permissive \u201cmay be established\u201d has no implications for the collective bargaining process. Second, they contend that the phrase \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d does not prescribe permissive bargaining as the manner in which the parties might reach a final agreement about supplemental evaluation guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Third, they assert that this court should defer to the labor board\u2019s construction of the statute because that agency is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>charged with the administration and enforcement of our labor laws. We will examine each of these arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We agree with the federation and the labor board that \u00a7 10-151b does not forbid mandatory bargaining about teacher evaluations merely because it states that supplemental evaluation guidelines \u201cmaybe established\u201d by local school boards and teachers\u2019 representatives. The statute makes it clear that such guidelines must comply with baselines established by the state board of education. If the legislature had amended the 1973 act to provide, in 1974, that supplemental guidelines \u201cmay be established\u201d by negotiation, the federation and the labor board would have had a strong argument that teacher evaluations are a subject of mandatory bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">As actually amended, however, \u00a7 10-151b provides that, after 1974, local supplements to state standards for teacher evaluations would be established not by \u201cnegotiation\u201d but by \u201cmutual agreement.\u201d This is the crucial change upon which the trial court relied in its judgment. Notably, the labor board\u2019s decision discussed the statute in its 1974 version without commenting on the inferences to be drawn from that version\u2019s departures from the 1973 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The federation and the labor board would have us read \u201cmutual agreement\u201d as a virtual synonym for \u201cnegotiation.\u201d They maintain that a legislature intending to remove teacher evaluations from the scope of mandatory collective bargaining would not have relied upon so ambiguous a phrase as \u201cmutual agreement,\u201d especially when the legislature simultaneously added an express statutory reference to \u201cthe teacher\u2019s representative chosen pursuant to section 10-153b.\u201d Instead, they claim that the phrase was probably inserted to prohibit unilateral establishment of sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>plemental evaluation procedures by local boards when bargaining has reached a final impasse. We are not persuaded by this proffered analysis of what \u201cmutual agreement\u201d means.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Although the meaning of \u201cmutual agreement\u201d is not free from inherent ambiguity, we have, in this case, numerous indicia of what the legislature intended by the use of these words. We must ascribe substantive significance to the legislature\u2019s act of amending \u00a7 10-151b to replace \u201cnegotiation\u201d with \u201cmutual agreement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 601-602, 498 A.2d 1041 (1985); <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 232, 477 A.2d 988 (1984). In the law of labor relations, the term \u201cnegotiations\u201d has a special meaning because, in one or another of its cognate forms, it is frequently associated with statutory instructions about collective bargaining. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a (b), 5-271, 5-272, 5-278, 7-273j, 7-468 (c), 7-473b, 7-474, 7-477, 10-153a, 10-153b, 10-153d, 10-153g, 31-48b (d); 31-101(8); 31-111b (a); 31-112(c). As this court noted in <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 576-77, 295 A.2d 526 (1972), when \u00a7 10-153d (b) speaks of a \u201cduty to negotiate with respect to salaries and other conditions of employment\u201d of teachers, that statute defines the scope of mandatory collective bargaining. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that, in deleting \u201cnegotiation\u201d and substituting \u201cmutual agreement,\u201d the legislature manifested an intent to remove teacher evaluations from the ambit of mandatory collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Our interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the 1974 amendment. The recorded proceedings in both houses of the general assembly demonstrate that the legislature\u2019s substitution of \u201cmutual agreement\u201d for \u201cnegotiation\u201d was a conscious decision to make a substantive change in the process for estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>lishing teacher evaluation criteria. Several speakers commented expressly and affirmatively on the merits of this change.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reply to a question, a sponsor emphasized that the act\u2019s implementation, on a local level, would depend upon the ability of interested parties to \u201ccome to a mutual agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Others noted that the amended act had received broad based support from diverse interested parties, including both school boards and unions, and attributed this support to the fact that every affected group would enjoy a veto power.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>expressions of legislative intent are utterly inconsistent with a construction of \u201cmutual agreement\u201d that subjects local additions to state promulgated evaluation criteria to mandatory collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The federation and the labor board suggest that the fact of the unions\u2019 support for enactment of the amended \u00a7 10-151b cannot be reconciled with any diminution in union bargaining power over evaluation guidelines. Before the 1974 amendment, however, unions lacked the power to prevent school boards from unilaterally promulgating evaluation criteria if negotiations on this subject had reached an impasse after exhaustion of good faith bargaining. Under the amended \u00a7 10-151b, in the absence of mutual agreement, the only operative guidelines are those promulgated by the state board of education. The unions\u2019 new ability to prevent unilateral imposition of additional local evaluation criteria may well account for their support of the amended statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Legislative action subsequent to enactment of the amended \u00a7 10-151b lends further support to our conclusion that, after 1974, teacher evaluations were no longer a subject of mandatory collective bargaining. Although \u00a7 10-151b itself has not again been amended in any manner relative to the present dispute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>important changes in our education law, in 1979 and in 1986, shed further light on the legislature\u2019s intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In 1979, the legislature amended the Teacher Negotiation Act by adding a new section to provide for mediation and binding arbitration if school boards and teachers\u2019 unions are unable to resolve irreconcilable differences about a new collective bargaining agreement. General Statutes \u00a7 10-1531 The new statute describes, as the predicate for these mandatory processes, a failure of agreement \u201cafter negotiation concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employees in such unit . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (b). This choice of language confirms the 1974 distinction between subjects of negotiation, to which binding arbitration applies, and other topics of discussion which fall outside these special procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Even more significantly, the General Assembly in 1986 enacted a new education enhancement act containing numerous provisions for career incentives and teacher evaluation. Public Acts 1986, Spec. Sess., May, 1986, No. 86-1, \u00a7\u00a7 11 through 19. These provisions underscore that bargaining about teacher evaluations is permissive. The new act, in \u00a7 13 (a), authorizes the creation of an \u201cevaluation development panel\u201d that \u201cshall develop a local teacher evaluation plan to meet the requirements of this act and the regulations adopted [pursuant thereto] .... [An approved] local teacher evaluation plan . . . shall be deemed to meet all of the requirements of section 10-151b of the general statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>tes.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The new act stipulates, in \u00a7 13 (b), <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that a local teacher evaluation plan must be approved by a newly created commission on career incentives and teacher evaluation, whose membership, as prescribed in \u00a7 11, includes two representatives of public school teachers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The legislature would not have delegated to a new commission the responsibility for approval of a local teacher evaluation plan if the criteria for such a plan were the subject of mandatory collective bargaining between local school boards and teachers\u2019 unions. There would have been no need to provide teacher representation on the new commission if teachers, through their bargaining representative, already had a major voice in the negotiation of local teacher evaluation guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We recognize that in construing \u00a7 10-151b as we have, we are departing from our usual rule of according deference to the construction given a statute by the labor board, the agency principally charged with its enforcement. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 68, 74, 411 A.2d 28 (1979); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 555, 400 A.2d 712 (1978). In this case, a departure from this rule is warranted for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">First, the issue of statutory construction in this case does not involve the application of open ended statutory language to a particular fact bound controversy, but rather concerns an issue of law about the scope of a Connecticut statute that this court has not previously interpreted. \u201c \u2018Although the factual and discretionary determinations of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts ... it is for the courts, and not for administrative agencies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to expound and apply governing principles of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980), and cases cited therein; see also <em>Real Estate Listing Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>179 Conn. 128, 138-39, 425 A.2d 581 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Second, neither the administrative record nor the administrative decision indicates that the labor board had before it the legislative history of \u00a7 10-151b or the subsequent legislative enactments on which we have relied in our construction of the statute. The labor board focused, in large part, on the general balancing test that would normally determine whether a particular issue is a matter of managerial prerogative and educational policy, under \u00a7 10-153a and <em>West Hartford Board of Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>supra. We have focused, instead, on the operative terms of a statute that removed this issue from the general ambit of \u00a7 10-153a.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Third, the construction that we adopt bears the imprimatur of the State Department of Education, another state agency with relevant expertise concerning the statute at hand. A State Department of Education guidebook published in 1978, before the enactment of binding arbitration, recommended \u201cthat teacher evaluation not be included as an issue in the collective bargaining of teacher contracts.\u201d A. Carrano, Teacher Evaluation: A Guidebook for Connecticut School Districts (1978) p. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In these circumstances, we do not consider ourselves bound, in this case, to follow the labor board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 10-151b. We conclude, as did the trial court, that teacher evaluations are not a mandatory subject of collective bargaining because the legislature, in enacting a revised \u00a7 10-151b in 1974, determined that state evaluation guidelines would govern teacher evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ations unless local school boards and teachers\u2019 representatives decided, \u201cby mutual agreement,\u201d to implement supplemental local guidelines. The effect of the enactment of the revised \u00a7 10-151b was to permit a local school board\u2014or a teachers\u2019 representative\u2014to refuse to negotiate about the subject of teacher evaluations. The trial court was correct in sustaining the school board\u2019s appeal from the contrary ruling of the labor board on this ground.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\"> The Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations was a named defendant in the trial court. In this court, the board elected to file an amicus brief supporting the appeal of the defendant union rather than itself taking an appeal. We attach no significance to this distinction, and have considered fully the arguments in each of the amicus briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> The stipulated facts do not indicate the expiration date of the existing collective bargaining agreement, or, for that matter, what has happened to the negotiation of a successor agreement. In the petition seeking declaratory relief from the labor board, the parties indicated that statutory dates for mediation and for binding arbitration would have occurred late in 1982. The school board filed its petition with the labor board on November 4,1982, and the labor board announced its decision and order on May 31,1983. The school board\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court, dated June 14, 1983, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>delayed by the labor board\u2019s failure to certify the administrative record until August 3,1984. Although this record puts into question the continuing nature of the bargaining process that we are today adjudicating, we will assume that this controversy is not moot because it raises an important question of statutory construction which is \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>197 Conn. 566, 572, 499 A.2d 1158 (1985). The issue of collective bargaining over teacher evaluations not only affects an ongoing part of the state\u2019s program for education but is likely to arise again in future labor negotiations between the parties to this lawsuit. In these circumstances, we have jurisdiction to address the merits of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> The operative collective bargaining agreement in 1982 contained the following provisions on the subject of teacher evaluations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201c9.2.1 Each teacher shall receive a written copy of each evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">\u201c9.2.2 Any teacher shall have the right to discuss his evaluation with his evaluator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">\u201c9.2.3 A teacher may appeal an adverse evaluation through the grievance procedure, but only on the grounds of bad faith or discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">\u201c9.2.4 A committee composed of members of the E.A.W. shall be convened to propose change, modifications and/or revisions of the evaluation form to the Superintendent of Schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">Both parties are willing to negotiate over \u00a7\u00a7 9.2.1 through 9.2.3.

In this court, neither the federation nor the labor board, in its amicus brief, has pursued this distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b708-5\"> Commenting on this bill, Representative Phyllis T. Kipp said: \u201cThis bill directs Superintendents of Schools to make evaluations of teachers based on guidelines which have been established by the State Board of Education for development of evaluation programs and upon any additional guidelines as may be established by mutual agreement. This is a change from last year in the Fair Dismissal Law . . . whereby we did add negotiation. It is now by mutual agreement. I think this is a very good change.\u201d 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1974 Sess., p. 4739.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In the upper house, Senator Ruth O. Truex noted: \u201cThe circle will remember that a year ago we passed the bill mandating teacher evaluation in the state of Connecticut. It was a bill which had some controversial sections largely to one which said, which required that guidelines criteria established by the State Board of Education could be increased and acted upon by negotiation with the Board of Education and local teacher\u2019s organizations. This caused some concern in the minds of many people that we were opening up teacher evaluation to the negotiation process. . . . Amendments to the old bill have been introduced which . . . [make] [t]his bill, I think . . . a very good move. . . . [I]t eliminates the section of by negotiation which I\u2019m sure will please practically everyone here.\u201d 17 S. Proc., Pt. 6, Spec.

Avcollie asked: \u201cWhat happens if there is no agreement on guidelines to be used for evaluation?\u201d Representative Phyllis T. Kipp replied: \u201cQuite briefly, Mr. Avcollie, after you\u2019re sitting with all these groups, one of the reasons we came to the phrase \u2018mutual agreement\u2019 was that it was decided in Committee by all these particular people that they could, indeed, come to a mutual agreement.\u201d 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1974 Sess., p. 4741.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> Representative Howard M. Klebanoff expressed skepticism about whether the revised act would succeed in its mission, commenting: \u201cThis is a change from a bill we passed last time, and one of the reasons we have total unification of all the groups supporting this is because every group has a veto power, and when you\u2019re saying there will be something estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>lished by mutual agreement . . . yes, it\u2019s a nice thing for all the groups to support, because any group that\u2019s not happy can just refuse to agree, and you\u2019re deadlocked.\u201d 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1974 Sess., p. 4744.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Representative William A. Bevacqua, commenting favorably on the legislation, emphasized that \u201cfor the first time in the deliberations . . . concerning the problem of teacher evaluation, there is, currently, an expression of unanimity in terms of the various groups that have to come together .... [T]he various and sundry groups that are concerned ... do have veto power in terms of determining what the specific criteria will be . . . .\u201d 17 H.R.
