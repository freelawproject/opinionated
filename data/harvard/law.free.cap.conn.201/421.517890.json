J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXz\">The dispositive issue on this appeal is whether the plaintiffs, the city of Hartford and its police department, have a statutory right to refuse to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>records of a police department internal investigation into the defendant Gilbert L. Clarke\u2019s complaints of police misconduct. Clarke requested from the police department, but did not receive, copies of records relevant to the investigation in question. Through his attorney, the defendant Irving H. Rosenthal, Clarke complained to the Freedom of Information Commission (the commission), seeking disclosure of the records under General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b). After a hearing, the commission ordered the plaintiffs to furnish copies of the records to Clarke. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (d), the plaintiffs appealed the commission\u2019s order to the superior court. That court, <em>Barry, J., </em>rendered a judgment dismissing the appeal. We find no error in the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The parties do not dispute the underlying facts. On June 12, 1981, Hartford police arrested and detained the defendant Clarke. Clarke subsequently filed complaints with the Hartford police department\u2019s internal affairs division alleging that he had been subjected to police brutality and deprived of his civil rights by nine officers involved in his arrest, processing and detention. On November 3, 1981, Hartford Police Chief George W. Sicaras notified Clarke by letter that the police department\u2019s internal affairs division had investigated his complaint. Sicaras\u2019 letter informed Clarke that eight of the nine officers had been exonerated of all charges, and that the ninth officer had been referred to the department advocate for further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On November 14, the defendant Rosenthal wrote to Chief Sicaras, on Clarke\u2019s behalf, seeking: copies of written reports of the internal affairs investigation; the review of the investigation by the involved officers\u2019 commanding officers and the police department\u2019s investigative review board; and the referral of the officer who had not been exonerated. On December 2, 1981, having received no response to his letter, Rosenthal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>filed a complaint with the Freedom of Information Commission seeking to compel production of the requested material. A hearing was held in February, 1982, after which, in accordance with commission procedures, both parties had the opportunity to submit written briefs. In July, 1982, the commission ordered the plaintiffs to furnish the requested documents. The Superior Court thereafter dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the commission\u2019s order in September, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claim that the lower court erred in determining that: (1) General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-128a (2) and 31-128f, which limit an employer\u2019s right to disclose information in personnel files, do not apply to municipal employees; and (2) the investigative records are not exempt from public disclosure under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), which exempts certain personnel files from the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act, General Statutes \u00a7 1-15 et seq. The plaintiffs also claim that this court must automatically sustain their appeal because the commission failed to hear and render a decision upon the defendant Clarke\u2019s complaint within the time limits imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consider this latter claim first.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional claim arises out of the juxtaposition of recent case law and even more recent legislation concerning the procedural constraints on administrative proceedings before the Freedom of Information Commission. In <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>199 Conn. 451, 452-53, 507 A.2d 1385 (1986), and <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 503-506, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986), we held that the time constraints imposed by \u00a7 1-2 li (b) on commission action are mandatory. Consequently, we concluded that the commission\u2019s failure to hear and decide cases within those time limits nullified any subsequent action that the commission had taken. Following these decisions, in May, 1986, the Connecticut General Assembly enacted Public Acts 1986, No. 86-408 (hereinafter No. 86-408), which repealed \u00a7 l-21i (b). Section 2 (a) of No. 86-408 validated those actions of the commission that did not comply with the time limits of \u00a7 1-2 li (b) but had not been fully adjudicated by the new act\u2019s effective date. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs do not dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>that the legislature intended No. 86-408, \u00a7 2 (a), to operate retroactively, nor that the commission\u2019s action in this case is covered by the language of the statute. Rather, they urge this court to hold that No. 86-408, \u00a7 2 (a), is void as an impermissible abrogation of their vested rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The legislature has the power to cure, by retroactive enactment, a party\u2019s failure to comply with a procedural statutory requirement, provided that two conditions have been met. First, the legislative enactment must address a procedural requirement that the legislature had the right to alter prospectively. Second, the enactment\u2019s retroactive application must not operate in a manner that would unjustly abrogate vested rights. <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 572, 440 A.2d 220 (1981); <em>Connecticut State Employees Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Policy Board, </em>165 Conn. 448, 454, 334 A.2d 909 (1973); <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>124 Conn. 183, 186-87, 198 A. 746 (1938); 2 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. 1986) \u00a7 41.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The record in this case discloses no evidence that any vested rights of the plaintiffs were impaired by the enactment of No. 86-408, \u00a7 2 (a). We are not confronted with a situation in which, but for the retroactive legislation, the defendants would be irrevocably barred from obtaining the relief that they seek. The case thus is distinguishable from <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 100, 355 A.2d 1 (1974), on which the plaintiffs rely. In <em>Hillier, </em>the legislature, via special act, validated the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with a statutory time limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tation for furnishing notice of injury to the defendant before commencing suit. The very existence of the plaintiffs right of action depended on her compliance with the notice provision. Furthermore, her late filing of notice prejudiced the defendant\u2019s ability to investigate the circumstances of the alleged injury and prepare a defense. Id., 107. Accordingly, we held that the retroactive legislation abrogated the defendant\u2019s vested rights, in violation of article first, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution and \u00a7 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 109-10. In the case before us, unlike <em>Hillier, </em>the act of the legislature merely excuses the commission\u2019s failure to comply with procedural requirements that do not directly affect the substantive rights of the parties. Were we to adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 position and sustain the appeal, the defendant Clarke would be free to file a second complaint with the commission and, assuming the commission again found in his favor, would be entitled to the same relief as he had been granted previously. Under these circumstances, we conclude that No. 86-408, \u00a7 2 (a) neither abrogates the plaintiffs\u2019 vested rights, nor deprives them of a legally cognizable property interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the documents included in the commission\u2019s disclosure order are absolutely privileged from disclosure by General Statutes \u00a7 31-128\u00cd,* 2**5<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a key provision of the Personnel Files Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-128a et seq. With limited exceptions not applicable here, General Statutes \u00a7 31-128\u00cd prohibits an \u201cemployer\u201d from disclosing \u201cindividually identifiable information contained in the personnel file or medical records of any employee . . . .\u201d \u201cEmployer\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 31-128a (2) to include \u201can individual, corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>partnership or unincorporated association.\u201d The defendants do not contest the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the documents in question as personnel files, but rather claim that the plaintiffs are not \u201cemployers\u201d within the scope of \u00a7 31-128\u00cd. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The plaintiffs contend that they fall within the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7 31-128a (2) because that definition includes corporations, and the city of Hartford is a municipal corporation. Citing examples of other state statutes dealing with corporations, in which the legislature has specifically defined the types of corporations covered,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiffs argue that if the legislature had intended to exclude municipal corporations from the ambit of \u00a7 31-128a (2), it would have done so expressly. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We note that, if \u00a7 31-128a (2) were construed to include municipal corporations within its scope, General Statutes \u00a7 31-128\u00cd would overlap and conflict with General Statutes \u00a7 1-19,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the centerpiece of the Free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>dom of Information Act, which makes disclosure of public records the statutory norm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While \u00a7 1-19 (a) does provide an exception to disclosure where \u201cotherwise provided by . . . state statute,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) provides a separate exemption for \u201cpersonnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Because the enactment of \u00a7 1-19 predates the enactment of the Personnel Files Act, \u00a7 31-128a et seq.,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we must presume that the legislature enacted the later statutory provision with the earlier in mind, and thus, that \u00a7\u00a7 1-19 and 31-128a et seq. should be construed harmoniously. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murtha, </em>179 Conn. 463, 466, 427 A.2d 807 (1980); <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 74, 230 A.2d 36 (1967); 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 51.02. Such a harmonious construction counsels that municipal corporations should be deemed to have been excluded from the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7 31-128 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Our construction of the Personnel Files Act finds support in the act\u2019s legislative history. The act originated in 1979 as House Bill 6938, became Public Acts 1979, No. 79-264, after its passage, and was codified as \u00a7 31-128a et seq. The original version of House Bill 6938 included \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d but the House of Representatives amended the bill before its passage to delete the reference to \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1979 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Sess., p. 5059. Representative Richard J. Balducci, the proponent of this amendment, explained that its purpose was to avoid confusion and conflict with the preexisting provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Id., p. 5057. The remaining House discussion of the bill focused on the effect of the anti-disclosure provisions on private employers and employees. Id., pp. 5058-81. Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiffs cannot invoke \u00a7 31-128\u00cd as a limitation on the categories of public records that fall within the governance of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that the police department investigative records are protected from disclosure by General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), which, as noted above, exempts from the coverage of the Freedom of Information Act \u201cpersonnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Our construction of this provision must be guided by the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s overarching policy favoring disclosure of public records. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984). As an exception to that policy, \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) must be narrowly construed. Id.; <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 183, 188, 470 A.2d 1209 (1984). The plaintiffs have the burden of proving the exception\u2019s applicability. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 329, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The plaintiffs must meet a twofold burden of proof to establish the applicability of the \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) exclusion. First, they must establish that the files in question are within the categories of files protected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>exemption, that is, personnel, medical or \u201csimilar\u201d files.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, they must show that disclosure of the records \u201cwould constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The plaintiffs must satisfy this dual burden whether the investigative records are characterized as \u201cpersonnel\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d files. It might be argued, exploiting the grammatical ambiguity of the statute, that only \u201csimilar\u201d files, the category of files immediately precedent to the restrictive clause \u201cdisclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy,\u201d is modified by that clause. Such a reading, however, cannot be supported.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Interpreting nearly identical language in the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (b) (6),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has held that the \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d restriction modifies personnel files as well as similar files. <em>Department of Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 370-75, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1976). In addition to this interpretation by the nation\u2019s highest court, our construction of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) is governed by \u00a7 1-19\u2019s policy of promoting disclosure of public records. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra. It is \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cardinal rule that the general purpose, intent or purport of the whole act shall control\u201d the interpretation of subsidiary provisions. 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 46.05, p. 91; accord <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>200 Conn. 630, 637-38, 513 A.2d 52 (1986); <em>Kerin </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>160 Conn. 463, 465-66, 280 A.2d 143 (1971). We therefore conclude that the final, restrictive clause of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) modifies all the categories of records that precede that clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot avoid disclosure of their investigative records unless they can prove both that their records constitute personnel or \u201csimilar\u201d files, and that such disclosure would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We conclude that the plaintiffs have met the first part of the \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) exemption by establishing that the records in question are personnel or \u201csimilar\u201d files. While the commission\u2019s hearing officer found to the contrary, the memorandum of decison of the trial court implicitly accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the records. The defendants do not contest this aspect of the trial court\u2019s findings on appeal, and therefore, they are deemed to have abandoned any claim of error relating to this issue. See Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a) (now \u00a7 4013 [a]);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>181 Conn. 434, 437, 435 A.2d 977 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The second part of the \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) exemption requires the plaintiffs to show that disclosure of the records \u201cwould constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The plaintiffs have utterly failed to make such a showing. At the initial hearing before the commission, the plaintiffs alleged in broad, conclusory terms that the records were exempt from disclosure because they related to investigations that <em>might </em>lead to discipline, suspension or termination of the police officers involved. At no time did the plaintiffs attempt to describe even generally the contents of the specific records in question.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the absence of such evidence, we cannot discern whether any legally cognizable privacy interest is compromised by the commission\u2019s disclosure order. The commission is not obliged to \u201caccept an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>agency\u2019s generalized and unsupported allegations relating to documents claimed to be exempt from disclosure.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, supra, 340. On the contrary, as the trial court aptly observed, the commission might reasonably have presumed that the public has a legitimate interest in the integrity of local police departments and in disclosure of how such departments investigate and evaluate citizen complaints of police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The plaintiffs have failed to establish on the record that they were entitled to the exemption to disclosure provided by General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). Accordingly, we hold that the commission acted properly in denying the plaintiffs the protection of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) and in ordering them to turn over the police department investigative records to the defendants Rosenthal and Clarke.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1985)] Sec. l-21i. denial of access to public RECORD OR MEETINGS.

We noted, however, that \u201c[a]ny such testimony or affidavits must not be couched in conclusory language or generalized allegations . . . but should be sufficiently detailed, without compromising the asserted right to confidentiality, to present the commission with an informed factual basis for its decision . . . . \u201d Id., 341.
