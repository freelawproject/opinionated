In his appeal the . defendant claims error (1) in the failure of the court to instruct the jury on the element of general intent to perform the physical acts that constitute the crime, and (2) in certain evidentiary rulings concerning the patient-psychiatrist privilege created by General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>utes \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d and 52-146e, claimed to have restricted both his cross-examination and direct examination of a psychiatric counselor-therapist who testified for the state. We conclude that additional proceedings are needed because of the failure of the trial court to conduct a voir dire of the witness to ascertain whether he had any information concerning the mental condition of the complainant, a thirteen year old boy, that would have been admissible to affect his credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">From the evidence at trial the jury could reasonably have found that the complainant, his mother and another woman occupied, as combined house sitters and tenants, the first floor portion of a home in Madison owned by the defendant. The defendant continued to occupy a separate upstairs bedroom on the premises, which he used only occasionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">According to the testimony of the complainant, about 4 a.m. on November 6,1982, the defendant entered the room on the first floor where the boy was sleeping and sexually assaulted him by committing fellatio. The defendant then brought the boy upstairs to his own bedroom where he again sexually assaulted the boy in a similar manner. About 4:30 a.m. the complainant returned to his own room where he fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">When the complainant awoke about 7:30 a.m. he told his mother, who slept in a separate bedroom on the first floor, about the incident, and she called the police. The boy repeated his account of the crime to the investigating police officer. Later that morning he was taken to a child therapist who, according to a statement in a hospital record, had begun to counsel him and his mother about one month before the incident in relation to \u201cparent-child conflicts.\u201d After telling his therapist about the sexual assault, the complainant was taken to a hospital for an examination. He again related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>his account of the crime, on this occasion to an emergency room physician and to a hospital social worker. At the trial the complainant\u2019s mother, the investigating police officer, the emergency room doctor, the hospital social worker and a schoolmate friend, all testified in varying detail about what the complainant had told them about the sexual assault incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The defendant filed no request to charge on the criminal intent he claims to be required as an element of the offense of sexual assault in the second degree, nor did he except to the charge as given. Realizing that review of his claim would ordinarily be precluded by failure to raise the issue in the trial court; Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 854, 3063; the defendant invokes the exception for fundamental constitutional errors depriving a person of a fair trial that we recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). He claims that, although no specific intent is expressly required by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for sexual assault in the second degree, at least a jury instruction upon the general intent to do the proscribed acts that constitute the offense was constitutionally necessary. Despite the absence of any request or exception in the trial court, this court has treated as a claim reviewable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Evans, </em>the failure to charge upon an essential element of a crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 326, 507 A.2d 457 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>175 Conn. 155, 162-63, 397 A.2d 89 (1978). The defendant claims that a general intent to do the prohibited act is an element of every crime and that a jury charge omitting any reference to general intent is fatally deficient. Such a claim qualifies for <em>Evans </em>review at least to determine whether any fundamental constitutional right of the defendant has been violated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 86-87, 502 A.2d 388 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Section 53a-71 (a) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is (1) under fifteen years of age . . . .\u201d The term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d is defined to include \u201cfellatio.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In charging the jury the trial court declared that the statute required proof of two elements: (1) that the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim; and (2) that the victim was under fifteen years of age at the time of the offense. This instruction corresponded precisely with our statement of the elements of the offense in <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 430, 435 A.2d 967 (1980). We have held that sexual assault in the first degree is a general intent crime with no element of specific intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 62, 502 A.2d 360 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>185 Conn. 163, 176, 440 A.2d 858 (1981), aff'd, 460 U.S. 73, 103 S. Ct. 969, 74 L. Ed. 2d 823 (1983). We have similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>construed the portion of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 that proscribes \u201cacts directly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to his moral or physical well-being\u201d not to require proof of a specific mental element. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 250, 188 A.2d 65 (1963); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>189 Conn. 1, 12, 454 A.2d 256 (1983). Accordingly, we conclude, despite the defendant\u2019s suggestion to the contrary,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the only intent required for a violation of \u00a7 53a-71 is a general intent to perform the acts that constitute the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u201cTo some extent ... all crimes of affirmative action require something in the way of a mental element\u2014at least an intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (1972) \u00a7 28, p. 201. Such an intent, to perform certain acts proscribed by a statute, we have referred to as the general intent ordinarily required for crimes of commission rather than omission. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 13; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 5, 291 A.2d 240 (1971). That the defendant intended to perform the physical acts that constitute the crime of sexual assault in the second degree in the manner proved by the evidence was implicitly a part of the state\u2019s burden of proof and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that sense, an element of the crime. \u201cAt all events, it is clear that criminal liability requires that the activity in question be voluntary.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, \u00a7 25, p. 180; see Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.01 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Our acknowledgement of the fundamental principle that a criminal act must be volitional does not mean that a charge to a jury that omits reference to this principle is constitutionally defective where the evidence at trial contains no suggestion that the defendant\u2019s conduct was involuntary and he has made no such claim either in the trial court or on appeal. The defendant has produced no authority in support of the novel proposition he advances and we have discovered none. There are some basic aspects of criminal liability that may be presumed and thus need not be discussed in a charge to the jury, at least in the absence of a request or some evidence casting doubt upon the presumption. Sanity of a defendant, an essential requirement for criminality, even before the advent of the 1983 amendment to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 making insanity an affirmative defense; Public Acts 1983, No. 83-486; never became an issue upon which jury instructions were required until evidence that the defendant may have lacked the requisite mental capacity came into the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra, 56. Duress and entrapment are recognized defenses to criminal charges because they also implicate the volitional aspect of criminality. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-14, 53a-15. Though the state bears the burden of disproving these defenses, once they are raised by the presentation of some evidence supporting them, there is no requirement that evidence negating them be produced as part of the state\u2019s prima facie case. A fortiori there is no requirement that a court suo motu instruct a jury upon these defenses in cases where the evidence produced by both parties contains not the remotest hint of their applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The defense of the absence of a general intent to do a criminal act may be treated similarly. Until something in the evidence indicates the contrary, the court may presume the defendant intended the prohibited bodily movements that constitute the offense and that he has acted under no duress, unlawful inducement in the nature of entrapment, or lack of requisite mental capacity. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that in this case the failure of the court to instruct the jury upon the general intent requirement was constitutional error or, indeed, error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court erroneously applied the patient-psychiatrist privilege created by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d and 52-146e<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to restrict his cross-examination and also his direct examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of a witness the state had called to prove \u201cconstancy of accusation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It is important in our analysis of this claim of error to detail the setting in which the statutory privilege was exercised. The defendant had served a subpoena duces tecum upon Jonathan Swift, the counselor-therapist who had treated the complainant, and, before the start of trial, sought to examine the records pertaining to the complainant that Swift had brought to court in response to the subpoena. Swift testified at the hearing upon his motion to quash the subpoena, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>court denied, that he was employed as a counselor at a family counseling center under the supervision of a child psychiatrist. He also testified that he had brought with him the records of his consultations with the complainant and his mother. The court, apparently without objection by anyone,* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> made an in camera inspection of these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">After inspecting the records, the court reported that \u201cno inconsistencies\u201d had been found and that there were only two entries relating to the complainant, one dated December 1,1982, and another dated January 1, 1983, the latter referring to the sexual abuse incident of November 6, 1982, when Swift had been consulted by the complainant and his mother. Swift testified outside the presence of the jury that he had made no contemporaneous notes of that conference because the policy of the counseling center was to make notations only at the beginning of each month regarding the sessions for the previous month.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also said that he had consulted with the complainant alone or in the presence of his mother on seven occasions from October 28, 1982, to December 7, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Before Swift began his testimony before the jury, the state declared that it would use him only for the purpose of showing constancy of accusation. The defendant, however, had also subpoenaed the witness and intended to go beyond the normal scope of cross-examination by presenting him as a witness for the defense. In order to avoid the necessity of excusing and then recalling Swift to the witness stand, the court, without objection, determined that the defendant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>both cross-examine the witness on the testimony elicited by the state and question him on direct examination after the state had presented his testimony. The court, however, rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the patient-psychiatrist privilege would be waived entirely once Swift testified about his interview with the victim and his mother on November 6, 1982, the date of the sexual assault. The court ruled that the privilege would not be applicable to inquiries relating to constancy of accusation but would remain for other matters. The defendant excepted to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">On direct examination by the state, Swift testified that on November 6, 1982, after a telephone request for an appointment, the complainant and his mother came to his office where he spoke with them together. Though he had taken no notes, he was able to relate in considerable detail the boy\u2019s account of the sexual assault by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">On cross-examination, after exploring some discrepancies between the complainant\u2019s testimonial account of the incident and that given to the witness, the defendant inquired whether Swift had been treating the boy and his mother for \u201cparent-child conflicts,\u201d as a notation in the hospital record<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicated. At this point Swift claimed the privilege and the jury was excused. After an extensive colloquy, in which Swift was represented by counsel, the court upheld the exercise of the privilege on the grounds that a response to the question of the purpose of the treatment would violate the privilege and that the inquiry was not related to constancy of accusation. The defendant, who argued that the privilege had been waived by virtue of the statement in the hospital record, presumably made by the complainant or his mother, concerning the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the consultations with Swift, excepted to the ruling. The cross-examination of Swift was then terminated without any further questions by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">No challenge has been made either in the trial court or on appeal to the ruling denying access to the psychiatric records relating to the consultations of the complainant and his mother with Swift, nor has appellate review been sought of the limited disclosure made by the court of pertinent information contained in those records. The defendant attacks only the court\u2019s ruling upholding Swift\u2019s exercise of the privilege in response to a question relating to the purpose of his consultations and the refusal to allow inquiry concerning the possibility that the complainant had been subject to sexual fantasies. He does not contest the applicability of the statutes creating the privilege<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as precluding inquiry into the subject matter of the psychiatric therapy sessions with the complainant but claims (1) that the privilege was waived by the testimony of the boy, his mother and Swift about the consultation on the date of the offense, which the state introduced to show constancy of accusation, and (2) that, whether or not there was such a waiver, the constitutional right of a defendant to confront his accusers requires that the statutory privilege stand aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Although this court has indicated that a patient may waive the privilege against disclosure of conversations and records pertaining to psychiatric treatment, we have never held that such waiver may be implied merely from testimony at a trial concerning events relevant to proof of the crime. The testimony concerning the complainant\u2019s narrative to Swift concerning the sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ual assault offense, which the trial court ruled was not privileged and was, therefore, properly subject to cross-examination, cannot be deemed to provide access to wholly separate communications related to treatment of the boy or his mother. \u201c[Wjaiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right.\u201d <em>Del Vecchio </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>146 Conn. 188, 194, 148 A.2d 554 (1959). The trial record is barren of any indication that the complainant or his mother was aware that, as a consequence of testifying at the behest of the state, consent to access by the defendant to the entire series of their consultations with Swift would be implied. \u201cConsent\u201d is expressly required by subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-146e for disclosure of psychiatric communications or records and is defined in \u00a7 52-146d (3) to mean \u201cconsent given in writing by the patient or his authorized representative.\u201d Subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-146e requires that \u201c[ajny consent given to waive confidentiality shall specify to what person or what agency the information is to be disclosed and to what use it will be put.\u201d These statutory provisions preclude at least the implied waiver that the defendant contends arose from the testimony offered to prove constancy of accusation on the part of the complainant. Even in the absence of such legislative restrictions upon the principle of implied waiver, none of the authorities relied on by the defendant has gone so far as to declare that revelation by a witness of one conversation that would otherwise be privileged constitutes a waiver of other unrelated conversations with the same person. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s first contention, that the complainant and his mother waived the privilege by virtue of their testimony or the use of Swift\u2019s testimony concerning their discussion of the events constituting the crime during their conference on November 6, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We must finally address the remaining claim, that to allow the statutory privilege to bar inquiry for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>purpose of eliciting from Swift information possibly relating to the credibility of such a crucial prosecution witness as the complainant in this case violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the defendant briefs this issue in terms of his right of cross-examination, the gist of his constitutional claim is that the exercise of the privilege prevented him from discovering whether the complainant in his therapy sessions with Swift had manifested any inclination toward sexual fantasy or other mental abnormality that might affect the credibility of his testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 103-104, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983). We can discern no flaw in the court\u2019s ruling that cross-examination of Swift should be limited to the subject matter of his direct examination, the complainant\u2019s narrative of the crime. \u201c[Ijnsofar as the cross-examination does not take the form of an attack on the credibility of the witness, it must be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination.\u201d <em>Mendez </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>151 Conn. 193, 198, 195 A.2d 561 (1963). The defendant does not contend that his cross-examination was in any manner restricted concerning either Swift\u2019s credibility or the account given to him of the sexual assault incident. Nor can it be maintained that the exercise of the privilege by Swift hampered the cross-examination of the complainant or his mother, who had been fully questioned without any attempt to probe their mental condition when they had testified earlier in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The ruling upholding Swift\u2019s invocation of the privilege, however, did prevent the defendant from learning through direct examination whether the complainant had shown during his contacts with Swift any mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>abnormality that might have reflected upon the credibility of his accusation against the defendant. If such information had been discovered, absent the privilege, it would have been admissible to discredit the complainant\u2019s testimony. <em>Taborsky </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 619, 629, 116 A.2d 433 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">This court has faced similar problems of attempting to reconcile the privilege with the right of confrontation in respect to disclosure of records of psychiatric treatment of a witness in a criminal case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>197 Conn. 326, 329-32, 497 A.2d 758 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1119, 106 S. Ct. 1635, 90 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 177-80, 471 A.2d 949 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 455-63, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>supra, an in camera inspection of the records had been made by the trial court, apparently without objection, as in this case, and we affirmed, after our own examination of these records, the denial of the defendant\u2019s request for access to them, because they did not \u201csufficiently disclose material especially probative of the victim\u2019s ability to know and correctly relate the truth so as to justify breaching their confidentiality in disclosing them to the defendant.\u201d Id., 460. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, where the trial court had refused to make an in camera examination of psychiatric records, we upheld the ruling upon the ground that, before the court should engage in that procedure, even with the consent of the witness, \u201cthere must be a showing that there is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the information is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation such that the witness\u2019 direct testimony should be stricken.\u201d Id., 179. In that case we found that there had been no \u201cthreshold showing that at any pertinent time [the witness] had a mental problem which affected her testimonial capacity in any respect, let alone to a sufficient degree to warrant fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ther inquiry.\u201d Id., 180. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, though we ultimately found harmless error, we concluded that the preliminary showing required by <em>Esposito </em>had been made adequately. We found some indication of the existence of mental abnormalities affecting testimonial capacity based upon testimony of the witness, elicited on cross-examination, \u201cregarding her psychiatric treatment and hospitalizations, her alcoholism and drug use, her suicide attempts, and her feelings of fear and anger toward the defendant.\u201d Id., 332. We decided that, \u201cabsent any knowledge of the contents of her psychiatric records, it is impossible to determine whether they included relevant impeaching evidence that was not cumulative or was contrary to her testimony\u201d and that \u201c[t]o rely on the testimony actually elicited on cross-examination in assessing whether the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were violated would involve pure speculation as to the contents of the witness\u2019 records.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">If we were to follow the requirement <em>of Esposito </em>for a \u201cthreshold showing that at any pertinent time [the complainant] had a mental problem which affected [his] testimonial capacity in any respect\u201d it is doubtful that the evidence before us of consultations with a psychiatric therapist for \u201cparent-child conflicts\u201d or the somewhat bizarre narrative of the incident itself would be sufficient to require the court to engage in a review of the psychiatric records of the complainant. Such an examination of those records did take place, however, and the defendant has made no claim that any pertinent material contained therein was not disclosed to him. His claim is that he was prevented by the privilege from discovering whether Swift had information, other than that contained in the records previously reviewed by the court, of any mental aberrations of the complainant that might reflect upon his credibility. Without any opportunity to ascertain whether such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>information exists, it would ordinarily be impossible for a defendant to lay the groundwork demanded by <em>Esposito </em>as preliminary to a fair judicial determination of the availability of evidence of the mental condition of a witness significantly related to his testimonial capacity or credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The privilege cannot be permitted to bar the court from access to such information as is necessary to decide whether the occasion is one where the witness must waive the privilege or have his testimony expurgated from the case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 179-80. In the closely analogous context of the privilege created by General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k attending communications of a sexual assault victim to a rape crisis counselor, we have not insisted upon a determination that the confidential communications of the victim were inconsistent with his testimony at trial before an in camera review may be conducted by the court, with the victim\u2019s consent, of the record of those prior statements. <em>In re Robert H., </em>199 Conn. 693, 709-10, 509 A.2d 475 (1986). It was held in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 320, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974), that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s policy interest in protecting the confidentiality of a juvenile offender\u2019s record cannot require yielding of so vital a constitutional right as the effective cross-examination for bias of an adverse witness.\u201d Similarly, the privilege created by \u00a7 52-146e for communications of a psychiatric patient must give way to the interest of a criminal defendant in determining whether there is substantial evidence of a mental condition of a vital witness for the prosecution that might reasonably affect the credibility of the witness. If the testimony of such a witness is to remain in the case as a basis for conviction, the defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to discover any infirmities that may cast serious doubt upon its truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The procedure we established in <em>Esposito </em>and <em>Bruno </em>for permitting the trial court, with the consent of the witness, to review in camera the records of psychiatric treatment that are before the court must be modified if a defendant is to have the same protection of his constitutional right of confrontation in respect to unrecorded communications made confidential by \u00a7 52-146e. Where there is any reasonable basis in the evidence for believing that psychiatric personnel may have information relating to the mental condition of a witness that might affect his testimony, the court must conduct a voir dire of the person who may possess such information in order to discover whether it would be admissible. This preliminary inquiry may be conducted only with the consent of the witness sought to be impeached, but, unless such consent is forthcoming, the testimony of that witness must be stricken. The voir dire for the purpose of determining the existence of such impeaching evidence must be conducted in the courtroom in the presence of the defendant and his counsel, who shall be allowed to participate fully in the proceeding. The court may, however, exclude the public from the courtroom pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 895. See <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of California for the County of Riverside, </em>478 U.S. , 106 S. Ct. 2735, 92 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1986). If, after conducting such a voir dire, the court decides that some of the evidence elicited is admissible at trial, the defendant shall be permitted to use it, but the remaining confidential communications shall be sealed. If no admissible impeaching evidence is discovered, the entire record of the proceeding shall be sealed for possible appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In the case before us we conclude that the trial court, before upholding the exercise of the privilege, should have conducted a voir dire of Swift to ascertain whether he possessed information about the mental condition of the complainant that would have been admissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>impeach his testimony. The error may be harmless, however, because it cannot be determined without a voir dire, which may be conducted only with the consent of the complainant, whether any such evidence exists. The case must be remanded for the purpose of conducting such a voir dire. In the event that the complainant refuses to consent to waive his statutory privilege for the purpose of such an inquiry, his testimony at the trial must be wholly stricken and, since he was the only witness to the crime, the defendant must be acquitted for insufficiency of the evidence. If the complainant does waive the privilege for this purpose and the court finds significant evidence that would be admissible for impeachment, a new trial must be granted. On the other hand, if no such evidence is discovered, the judgment of conviction must stand. See <em>In re Robert H., </em>supra, 710-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-71. sexual assault in the second degree: class c felony: nine months not suspendable. (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is (1) under fifteen years of age, or (2) mentally defective or mentally incapacitated to the extent that he is unable to consent to such sexual intercourse, or (3) physically helpless, or (4) less than eighteen years old and the actor is such person\u2019s guardian or otherwise responsible for the general supervision of such person\u2019s welfare, or (5) in custody of law or detained in a hospital or other institution and the actor has supervisory or disciplinary authority over such other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u201c(b) Sexual assault in the second degree is a class C felony for which nine months of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, or fellatio and does not require emission of semen. Penetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body. Its meaning is limited to persons not married to each other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\"> In a footnote to his brief the defendant maintains that some of the definitions of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2), particularly the provision that \u201c[p]enetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body,\u201d expose to prosecution such patently noncriminal acts as those performed by a physician in conducting a vaginal or rectal examination of a child. From this reductio ad absurdum he argues that a mental element, i.e., an intent to obtain sexual gratification from the act constituting intercourse as defined, is essential for a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71. In this case we need not consider whether General Statutes \u00a7 53a-18 (5) would protect a physician in the scenario posed by the defendant, as argued by the state, because the evidence indicates no circumstances that could reasonably be deemed to justify the acts the complainant testified the defendant performed on him. The defendant at trial never sought to justify the conduct alleged but contended that the complainant\u2019s account of the incident was wholly false.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-146d.
