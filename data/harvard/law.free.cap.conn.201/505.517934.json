The trial judge denied the motion and sentenced the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for five years. In the same trial the defendant was also convicted of using a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission, but the defendant does not claim error with regard to that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">There is no dispute as to the following facts. On June 12,1984, Irene Lasko notified the police that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>car was missing. In the early morning of the following day, Officer Vincent Raucci of the New Haven police department and his partner Officer Richard Poulten were patrolling in East Rock Park in New Haven when they observed a motor vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. When the approaching car reached a distance of about fifty feet from the officers\u2019 vehicle, the driver of the car negotiated a U-turn, accelerated the vehicle, and sped away. The pursuing officers radioed for a check on the registration of the vehicle. They were informed by return broadcast that the car was the stolen Lasko vehicle. After a chase for a distance of approximately one half mile, the officers stopped the fleeing car. The vehicle was occupied by the defendant, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, and a single passenger, Vaughn Outlaw, who was seated in the front passenger\u2019s seat. An examination of the car disclosed in the middle of the front seat a red nylon \u201cgym bag\u201d which contained five .16 gauge shotgun shells and a Bic lighter. On the floor beneath the front passenger\u2019s seat was a sawed-off shotgun. Both the driver and the passenger were arrested and charged with possession of a sawed-off shotgun and larceny in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The defendant did not testify at the trial; Outlaw testified for the prosecution. His testimony indicated that he had known the defendant for about five years. It was also brought to the jury\u2019s attention that at the time of this incident the witness was on furlough from the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Cheshire. Outlaw related to the jury that at approximately 12:30 a.m. on June 13,1984, as he was walking to his aunt\u2019s house, the defendant stopped the car he was driving and offered him a ride. Outlaw got into the car, and, after they had gone some distance, the defendant drove into East Rock Park and there they were apprehended and arrested. According to Outlaw, the defendant told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>not to worry and to tell the police that the defendant had picked him up. Outlaw testified that he had not brought into the car any of the items seized by the police, and that he had not seen the red gym bag while he was riding with the defendant. He also repeatedly stated that he was unaware of the presence of the sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">After Outlaw had testified for the state, defense counsel cross-examined Outlaw extensively about the charges pending against him, his furlough status and any arrangement between Outlaw and the state. Defense counsel was allowed great latitude to ask pointed questions in an attempt to show the jury why Outlaw might be motivated to slant his testimony in order to avoid being convicted on the charges pending against him. The defendant then called his cousin, Darryl Henry, as a witness. Through Henry\u2019s testimony, the defendant sought to show that Outlaw, and not the defendant, was the one in possession of the sawed-off shotgun. According to Henry, he saw Outlaw on June 12,1984, and, at that time, Outlaw showed him a sawed-off shotgun in a gym bag. Henry claimed that Outlaw told him that the shotgun was his \u201cMastercharge\u201d and that \u201c[w]ith this I can get anything.\u201d Henry identified the sawed-off shotgun and gym bag exhibited in evidence as those displayed to him by Outlaw on June 12,1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Thus, it appears that the case was in great part one of credibility of the defense witness as opposed to that of Outlaw and the other witnesses who were called by the state. It is unnecessary to relate additional facts, as this appeal is based wholly upon the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court erred in denying his oral motion for a mistrial and in a certain instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in refusing to discharge the jury because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of what he asserts was inadmissible and prejudicial testimony. The incident to which the defendant refers occurred during the redirect examination of Outlaw\u2019s mother, Barbara Bethea, called as a witness by the state. On recross-examination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bethea had testified that the defendant in a conversation with her had said \u201cthat he was going to see that Vaughn [Outlaw] walked.\u201d Bethea also testified that in the same conversation she had told the defendant that unless the situation involving her son was cleared up, she \u201cwas going to come down here and tell . . . what [she] knew.\u201d Her redirect examination proceeded as follows: \u201cQ. When you say you were going to come down here and tell what you know, what were you referring to? A. What was I referring to? The conversation I had with his mother. She had told me it was Reggie\u2019s gun.\u201d The defendant objected to the hearsay response and asked that it be stricken. The objection was sustained. The court struck the answer from the record and admonished the jury not to consider it. When Bethea finished her testimony, the trial was interrupted at the defendant\u2019s request, and a proceeding took place outside the presence of the jury during which defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The trial judge stated to defense counsel that he saw no grounds for finding any attempt on the part of the state to elicit the hearsay response. The defense counsel agreed but told the court: \u201cWhat I think, your Honor, it presents us in a precarious position where I don\u2019t think [the defendant] can receive a fair trial at this point. I don\u2019t think a jury can disregard such a statement.\u201d The trial judge denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the motion, noting, in effect, that the occurrence could be cured by instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"amh-dedup-1\">Our general rule on the subject of motions for mistrial is well settled. A motion for mistrial is granted only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during trial a party has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>198 Conn. 490, 495, 503 A.2d 1157 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>193 Conn. 350, 356, 478 A.2d 581 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). A determination of whether a mistrial is warranted is left to the sound judgment and discretion of the trial judge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>supra, 496; <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Maldonado, </em>supra. When Bethea repeated a statement made to her out of court and outside the presence of the defendant, the trial judge was in the best position to decide whether the statement was so prejudicial, in light of the entire proceedings, as to deny the defendant a fair trial. The trial judge acted promptly in striking the hearsay statement and in instructing the jury not to consider it in reaching a decision. The instruction was repeated in the final charge. We must assume that the trial judge was satisfied that Bethea\u2019s hearsay response did not place the defendant in a \u201cprecarious position\u201d from which a curative instruction could not extricate him. Under these circumstances, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that the hearsay statement did not deprive the defendant of a .fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 563. The motion for a mistrial on the basis of Bethea\u2019s hearsay response was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s contention that the jury was erroneously instructed regarding \u201cpossession,\u201d an element of the offense with which the defendant was charged. The defendant argues that the statutory definition of the word \u201cpossess,\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is satisfied in only two situations: first, where a person has actual physical possession; and second, where a person has exercised dominion or control over an object. The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the trial judge erroneously defined \u201cpossession\u201d to include a third situation: Where a person has the opportunity or power to exercise dominion or control over an object.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>We must first consider whether this issue was properly preserved for review. At the conclusion of both the court\u2019s instructions and reinstruction, extended colloquy occurred between the court and defense counsel in which counsel made a number of suggestions to the court concerning the instructions and took exception to a part of the instructions. Defense counsel did not, however, suggest that the court had not accurately defined the word \u201cpossession,\u201d nor did he object or except to the definition given. We generally do not consider a claimed error regarding the giving of or failure to give an instruction \u201cunless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken . . . immediately after the charge is delivered.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 852 (formerly \u00a7 854); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 259, 476 A.2d 550 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>5 Conn. App. 571, 573, 501 A.2d 764 (1985), cert. denied, 198 Conn. 804, 503 A.2d 1186 (1986). In addition, the exception taken must \u201cstate distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Because this procedure was not followed, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s instructions unless his allegations raise a claim that he has been denied a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). An accused has a fundamental right, protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions, to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>see In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 362, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 217, 479 A.2d 814 (1984). This court has consistently held that a claim like the one made here, that the judge improperly instructed the jury on an element of an offense, is appealable even if not raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 616, 490 A.2d 68 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Maltese, </em>189 Conn. 337, 341-42, 455 A.2d 1343 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Having determined that the defendant\u2019s second claim is properly before us, we must now consider whether the judge\u2019s instructions were so erroneous as to deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 324, 507 A.2d 457 (1986). For an individual to be guilty of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, the state must prove that he \u201cowns, controls or possesses\u201d the shotgun. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-211 (a). The trial judge instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he law recognizes two kinds of possession; actual possession and constructive possession.\u201d After defining actual possession, the judge explained the meaning of constructive possession in the following language: \u201cA person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and control over a thing is then in constructive possession.\u201d The defendant argues that this explanation, coupled with the examples of possession given by the judge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> expanded the meaning of the term \u201cpossess\u201d beyond its statutory definition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2) provides: \u201cExcept where different meanings are expressly specified, the following terms have the following meanings when used in this title . . . \u2018Possess\u2019 means to have physical pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>session or otherwise to exercise dominion or control over tangible property.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-211 (a), which describes the crime of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, does not define the word \u201cpossess.\u201d The meaning prescribed in \u00a7 53a-3 (2) is therefore controlling. The latter part of \u00a7 53a-3 (2) makes clear that the definition of \u201cpossess\u201d includes not only actual possession but also the exercise of \u201cdominion or control\u201d over an object. Connecticut has long recognized this concept of constructive possession. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 423, 473 A.2d 300 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 335, 363 A.2d 72 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonski, </em>155 Conn. 463, 467, 232 A.2d 483 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>5 Conn. App. 599, 607, 502 A.2d 418 (1985), cert. denied, 199 Conn. 803, 506 A.2d 146 (1986). The definition and examples of constructive possession given here by the trial judge are nearly identical to those approved by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant correctly points out, however, that in <em>Williams </em>a challenge was not made under the definition of \u201cpossess\u201d found in \u00a7 53a-3 (2). He argues that because penal statutes are to be strictly construed; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 352, 456 A.2d 305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>(1983); the phrase \u201cto exercise dominion or control\u201d in \u00a7 53a-3 (2) should be construed to include only a scenario in which a person <em>has exercised </em>dominion or control, but not one in which a person knowingly has <em>the power and intention </em>to exercise dominion or control. We decline to adopt the defendant\u2019s narrow reading of the statutory definition of \u201cpossess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">We note that in <em>Williams </em>the defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 19-480 (a), and possession of a narcotic substance in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 19-481 (a). <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 323-24. These offenses are not included in our penal code, Title 53a of the Connecticut General Statutes, and, consequently, are not subject to the definition of possession found in \u00a7 53a-3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statutes are, however, criminal in nature and, like the offense of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, involve the unlawful possession of an item. Related statutory provisions, or statutes \u201cin pari materia,\u201d often provide guidance in determining the meaning of a particular word. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 422, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 51.01. An approved definition of \u201cconstructive possession\u201d in the context of possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>narcotics is therefore a persuasive precedent for our determination of the scope of the word \u201cpossess\u201d as defined by \u00a7 53a-3 (2), as long as that approved definition is not inconsistent with the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">To \u201cpossess,\u201d according to \u00a7 53a-3 (2), is to have actual physical possession \u201cor otherwise to exercise dominion or control . . . .\u201d In construing statutes, we have repeatedly adhered to the rule that words and phrases are to be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 656, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983) <em>(Peters, J., </em>dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 465, 262 A.2d 166 (1969). The phrase \u201cto exercise dominion or control\u201d as commonly used contemplates a continuing relationship between the controlling entity and the object being controlled. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the noun \u201ccontrol\u201d as the \u201cpower or authority to guide or manage.\u201d The essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead it is the act of being in a position of control coupled with the requisite mental intent. In our criminal statutes involving possession, this control must be exercised intentionally and with knowledge of the character of the controlled object. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>166 Conn. 569, 573, 353 A.2d 776 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>159 Conn. 521, 531, 271 A.2d 74 (1970), cert. dismissed, 400 U.S. 1019, 91 S. Ct. 578, 27 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1971). Construing the phrase \u201cto exercise dominion or control\u201d in \u00a7 53a-3 (2) to refer only to a case where an individual <em>has exercised </em>control, as defendant urges, would alter the meaning of the term \u201cpossess\u201d as defined by the legislature in \u00a7 53a-3 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The definition of \u201cpossess\u201d contained in \u00a7 53a-3 (2) first appeared in our penal statutes in 1969, the year in which our penal code was extensively revised. The drafters of the new code relied heavily upon the Model <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Penal Code and various state criminal codes, especially the penal code of New York. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1,1969 Sess., p. 11. The definition of \u201cpossess\u201d contained in the New York penal code is identical to that found in \u00a7 53a-3 (2). See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 (8) (McKinney 1975). The New York provision, which first appeared in that jurisdiction\u2019s statutes in 1967, has been interpreted to include situations where a person knowingly has the power and the intent to exercise dominion or control. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>127 Misc. 2d 309, 310, 485 N.Y.S.2d 913 (1984); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stapleton, </em>94 Misc. 2d 850, 852, 406 N.Y.S.2d 223 (1978). We acknowledge that similarity of language between the New York and Connecticut penal codes does not compel a like construction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 522, 400 A.2d 276 (1978). The New York construction of an identical statute, however, combined with our approval of the same interpretation in a related context; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra; and the common usage of the phrase \u201cto exercise dominion or control,\u201d ineluctably lead us to conclude that the trial judge\u2019s instructions in the present case were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-211. possession of a sawed-off shotgun or silencer: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of possession of a sawed-off shotgun or a silencer when he owns, controls or possesses any sawed-off shotgun that has a barrel of less than eighteen inches or an overall length of less than twenty-six inches or when he owns, controls or possesses any silencer designed to muffle the noise of a firearm during discharge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-5\"> After Barbara Bethea had been examined and cross-examined, several sets of redirect and recross-examination followed.

I possess the furniture and other items in my home even though I am not actually there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AbF\">Although these examples appear to omit the mental intent necessary for possession, this element was adequately explained in the court\u2019s explanation of the concept of constructive possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-5\"> The trial judge in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 335 n.2, 363 A.2d 72 (1975), instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, a person who although not in actual possession knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing is then in constructive possession of it. The word possession as used in the statute has no technical meaning. It does not mean that one must have a narcotic substance upon his person although that is one form of possession. It means having something under one\u2019s control or dominion. As you ordinarily speak of things, we possess a thing which we have under our immediate control or dominion. You possess the articles on your person because they obviously are within your immediate control or dominion. I possess this book on the desk in front of me even though it actually belongs to the State of Connecticut simply because it is before me and subject to my control and dominion. I also possess a briefcase which happens to be in my chambers because it is under my control. I possess my car which is out in the parking lot because it is also under my control. I possess the furniture and other items in my home even though I am not actually there now for the same reason. . . . Regarding the question of dominion and control of the heroin, you are entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence that is before you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-5\"> We recognize that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-2 provides that the provisions of Title 53a \u201cshall apply to any offense defined in this title or the general statutes, unless otherwise expressly provided . . . Because \u00a7 53a-3 <em>expressly provides </em>that the definitions contained therein \u201chave the following meaning when <em>used in this title\u201d </em>(emphasis added) it appears the legislature intended to restrict the scope of this provision to Title 53a only. See also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-5. Language found in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6) to the effect that a particular definition does not apply to certain statutes outside the penal code does not contravene this conclusion. The legislative history of that language indicates that the language was considered unnecessary but was added to cure some misinterpretations of the former statute. See 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1974 Sess., pp. 3076-77; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, 1974 Sess., pp. 224, 238.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
