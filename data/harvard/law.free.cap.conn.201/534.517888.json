Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">During the night of April 11-12, 1977, a nineteen year old woman was brutally stabbed to death. Following his indictment, the defendant, Richard Ostroski, was charged with her murder in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 53a-54a (a) and (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a trial by a panel of three judges of the Superior Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant was found guilty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>sentenced to a prison term of not less than twenty-five years nor more than life. On appeal from this conviction, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress \u201cpotential testimony or other evidence that was obtained in violation of the constitution or laws of the United States or the State of Connecticut.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>184 Conn. 455, 456, 440 A.2d 166 (1981) <em>(Ostroski I). </em>This court remanded the case to the trial court for further articulation on the issue of the defendant\u2019s custody. Id. On remand, the trial court found that the defendant was not in police custody until his formal arrest following his confession. On the defendant\u2019s appeal after remand, this court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, ruling that the defendant had been in state police custody during interrogation, that such custody was without probable cause, and that the trial court had erred in admitting into evidence his confession and certain physical evidence obtained from the defendant as a result of the interrogation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982) <em>(Ostroski II). </em>The judgment was set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">After retrial, the jury, on April 19, 1983, found the defendant guilty of murder. The defendant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than twenty-five years nor more than life. The defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The defendant raises four issues on appeal. He claims that the trial court erred in granting the state\u2019s pretrial motions for nontestimonial evidence; in denying his motion to dismiss and motion to dismiss the indictment; and in denying his request to charge on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The defendant also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In his initial claim of error, the defendant maintains that the trial court erred in granting the state\u2019s motions for nontestimonial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Before the defendant\u2019s second trial, the state, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 776,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed nine motions for nontestimonial evidence. Three of the motions were directed toward obtaining the defendant\u2019s palm print, three toward obtaining a blood sample, and three toward obtaining a saliva sample, from which his blood type could be determined. Although the state already had in its possession a palm print and blood sample, these samples could not be used at trial because of our ruling in <em>Ostroski II. </em>In these motions the state sought an untainted source for this same evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Each of the three sets of motions relied, respectively, on three different affidavits filed by the state. The first affidavit contained twenty-four paragraphs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>and detailed all the information known by the police prior to the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>affidavit contained the twenty-four paragraphs of the first affidavit and four additional para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>graphs.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These additional paragraphs stated that the defendant had confessed to killing the victim and had admitted the crime to his friend, Stanley Allen, who was also a prisoner at that time. The third affidavit contained the first twenty-four paragraphs, the second four paragraphs and eight additional paragraphs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>vant part, these eight additional paragraphs in the third affidavit asserted that the defendant had been convicted of killing the victim and had written an incriminating poem in a prison newsletter. The multiple motions were filed, according to the state, in order to distinguish among three alternate bases for the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The defendant objected to all nine motions. For purposes of clarity in reviewing this issue, however, and because the trial court granted all nine motions at the same time, we will treat the defendant\u2019s claim as though made on the basis of the third and most comprehensive affidavit. We therefore do not decide the legal sufficiency of the first or second affidavit. The defendant argued that it would be improper to grant the motions in that the affidavits supporting the motions were insufficient. The defendant argued that the first twenty-four paragraphs, which referred only to information obtained prior to the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest, failed to support a finding of probable cause and that the remainder of the affidavit, paragraphs 25 through 36, could not be considered because it relied upon information seized pursuant to the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest and, therefore, was improperly included in the affidavit. Specifically, the defendant argued that the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>(1) the defendant\u2019s initial confession to the police following his illegal arrest (paragraph 25), (2) the subsequent admission made to Allen (paragraph 28), (3) the fact of the defendant\u2019s conviction in the first trial (paragraph 33), and (4) the fact that the defendant published a poem in a prison newsletter admitting his guilt (paragraph 35), to support a finding of probable cause was improper in that all of that information constituted \u201cfruits\u201d of the illegal arrest, and, therefore, could not be used as a basis for obtaining additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The trial court reviewed the affidavits submitted by the state and, on the basis of the facts contained therein, found that the evidence included in the affidavits was adequate to support the motions. The court, without any articulation of the specific evidence in the affidavits upon which it was relying, ruled that the evidence included in the affidavits was sufficiently attenuated so as to be purged of the taint from the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest. Accordingly, the court granted all nine motions, thus allowing the state to acquire the nontes-timonial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">At the outset, we note that the fact that the state, at the time of its motions, had in its possession an illegally obtained palm print and a blood sample, both of which were inadmissible at trial on the basis of our decision in <em>Ostroski II, </em>does not preclude the state from acquiring, through an untainted source, a second palm print and blood sample. <em>Bynum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>274 F.2d 767 (D.C. Cir. 1979). The exclusionary rule applies to suppress evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Its sweep is not so broad, however, that it mandates suppression of evidence obtained independently of the illegality. <em>Seguras. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 813-16, 104 S. Ct. 3380, 82 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1984); see <em>Bynum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra (fingerprints obtained independently of the illegality admissible, despite suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of illegally obtained fingerprints); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>462 Pa. 543, 342 A.2d 67 (1975) (evidence of blood type admissible where blood type evidence gained from second blood sample was derived from source independent of the illegality); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>718 P.2d 385, 392 (Utah 1986) (suppression properly denied where source of search warrant was independently legal and unrelated to illegal impounding of premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In order to acquire the nontestimonial evidence, the state must overcome two hurdles. First, because the acquisition of the palm print, the blood sample and the saliva is a search; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>394 U.S. 721, 724, 89 S. Ct. 1394, 22 L. Ed. 2d 676 (1969) (fingerprints); Schmerber <em>v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 766-72, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1966) (blood); the fourth amendment requires that the state establish probable cause. Assuming this requirement is satisfied, the state must also meet the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 776, namely, that \u201c(1) the evidence sought may be of material aid in determining whether the defendant committed the offense charged; and (2) the evidence sought cannot practicably be obtained from other sources.\u201d The defendant claims that the state has failed to meet the fourth amendment requirement because the affidavit supporting the state\u2019s motions fails to support the necessary finding of probable cause. The defendant also claims that the state has failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 776. We will address the defendant\u2019s claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The defendant claims that the affidavit fails to support a finding of probable cause as required by the fourth amendment. The defendant concedes that the first twenty-four paragraphs of the affidavit are untainted by the illegal arrest and can be used to support a finding of probable cause. The thrust of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>argument, however, is that the court erred in considering the information contained in paragraphs 25, 28, 33 and 35 because that information was tainted as a fruit of his illegal arrest and without this information the affidavit failed to support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We first will address the defendant\u2019s claim as it relates to the information contained in paragraph 25, the defendant\u2019s confession to the state police, and paragraph 33, the fact of the defendant\u2019s conviction in the first trial. We held in <em>Ostroski II, </em>supra, that the confession to the state police was illegally obtained, overturned the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. It is clear, then, that the use of this information to support the motions was improper. The state argues that the court did not rely on this information in making its decision on the motions. The transcript of the hearing reveals that the state included this information in the affidavit for \u201chistorical purposes,\u201d to set the averments in its motions in context, and <em>not </em>as a <em>basis </em>for its motions. Although we do not necessarily condone the state\u2019s practice of including such evidence in its affidavit for \u201chistorical purposes,\u201d we need not find error because that was done. Even if we were to determine that the court did consider this improper information as grounds for establishing probable cause, that alone would not be a basis for finding error in the court\u2019s decision to grant the state\u2019s motions. The correctness of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motions does not turn upon the presence of improperly obtained evidence in the affidavit. The trial court\u2019s decision is not erroneous, despite the presence of improperly obtained evidence in the affidavit, if the lawfully obtained evidence considered by itself is sufficient to establish probable cause. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Driver, </em>776 F.2d 807, 812 (9th Cir. 1985) (presence of tainted evidence in search warrant does not vitiate warrant when affidavit contains sufficient untainted infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>mation); accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lancellotti, </em>761 F.2d 1363, 1365 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>690 F.2d 60, 63 (3d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1214, 103 S. Ct. 1212, 75 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mearns, </em>443 F. Sup. 1244, 1254 (D. Del. 1978); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Arpin, </em>188 Conn. 183, 190-91, 448 A.2d 1334 (1982); 1 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 9.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Our inquiry then turns to whether it was appropriate for the admission to Allen and the incriminating poem to be included in the affidavit supporting the motions. If this information was properly included in the affidavit, there is no question that the trial court was correct in making the necessary finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The disposition of this issue necessarily turns on the application of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tr\u00e9e\u201d doctrine, which requires courts to exclude evidence that is the product or \u201cfruit\u201d of police conduct in violation of the fourth amendment. <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484-88, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963). Under <em>Wong Sun, </em>the question to be resolved concerning the admissibility of derivative evidence is whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which the objection is made has been \u201c \u2018come at by exploitation of [the initial] illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d Id., 488, quoting J. Maguire, Evidence of Guilt (1959) p. 221; <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 655, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977), overruled in part, <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). This standard reflects a deterrence based policy, which is \u201c[t]he core rationale consistently advanced ... for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>extending the exclusionary rule to evidence that is the fruit of unlawful police conduct . . . .\u201d <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 442, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 81 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1984);.State v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 157, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">United States Supreme Court decisions subsequent to <em>Wong Sun </em>have focused upon the attenuation aspect; at what point does the nexus between the fourth amendment violation and the challenged evidence, i.e., the admission to Allen and the poem, become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint of the primary illegality. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 95 S. Ct. 2254, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1975); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>supra. The decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, is instructive on the attenuation issue. In <em>Brown, </em>the police arrested the accused without probable cause. After the police had given him the warnings set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), Brown made two in-custody inculpatory statements. The trial court refused to suppress these statements, and Brown was convicted of murder. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois upheld the conviction, determining that the giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201cserved to break the causal connection between the illegal arrest and . . . the statements.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>56 Ill. 2d 312, 317, 307 N.E.2d 356 (1974). The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Illinois court erred in adopting a per se rule that <em>Miranda </em>warnings, standing alone, purged the taint of an unlawful arrest and rendered postarrest statements admissible. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 603. The United States Supreme Court, however, declined to adopt a \u201cbut for\u201d rule that would render inadmissible all statements given subsequent to an illegal arrest. Id. After stating that the <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>warnings are an important factor to be considered, the court adopted a case-by-case approach to determine whether evidence obtained after an illegal arrest has been purged of the taint of that illegality. Id. In addition to the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 603-604, identified three \u201crelevant\u201d factors to be considered in ascertaining whether a confession is obtained by the exploitation of an illegal arrest: (1) the \u201ctemporal proximity\u201d of the illegality and the challenged evidence; (2) \u201cthe presence of intervening circumstances\u201d; and (3) \u201cparticularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>172 Conn. 542, 556, 375 A.2d 1014, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 855, 98 S. Ct. 174, 54 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>supra; see generally R. Pitler, \u201c \u2018The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\u2019 Revisited and Shepardized,\u201d 56 Cal. L. Rev. 579 (1968). These factors focus upon the causal relationship between the primary illegality, in this case the illegal arrest, and the evidence allegedly derived from this illegal conduct, and the actual purpose and flagrancy of the police conduct. See generally 1 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, supra, \u00a7 9.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The defendant claims the admission to Allen is a fruit of the illegal arrest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. Although we recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>nize that \u201cbut for\u201d the illegal arrest the defendant might not have been in a position to admit the crime to Allen, the United States Supreme Court has eschewed a \u201cbut for\u201d rule. <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 487-88. We find the admission to Allen sufficiently attenuated from the primary illegality. The affidavit reflects significant intervening events which substantially broke the causal connection between the illegal arrest and the defendant\u2019s admission to Allen; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>457 U.S. 687, 697, 102 S. Ct. 2664, 73 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1982) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 603; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>558 S.W.2d 233 (Mo. App. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 970, 98 S. Ct. 1609, 56 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1978); so as to remove the taint of the earlier fourth amendment violation. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Gonzalez, </em>686 F.2d 93, 98 (2d Cir. 1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 651, 469 A.2d 1186 (1983). The statement to Allen did not come about by exploitation of the initial illegality but by \u201c \u2018 \u201cmeans <em>sufficiently distinguishable </em>to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Segura </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 804-805, 104 S. Ct. 3380, 82 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1984), quoting <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 488. In deciding that the admission to Allen was not a \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d we have applied, as we must, the factors set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 603-604. The burden of showing admissibility, of course, rests upon the state. Id., 604. In applying the factors set out by <em>Brown, </em>we considered whether there were events which broke the causal connection so that the defendant\u2019s statement to Allen was \u201c \u2018 \u201csufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 690; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In this case, the illegal arrest by the state police occurred on April 17,1977, and the statement to Allen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>was made at 8:30 p.m. on April 19, 1977. Approximately thirty-six hours passed between the illegal arrest and the statement to Allen. During this period of time, the defendant was not only given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but, at 9 a.m., April 18, 1977, he was also presented before a Superior Court judge who advised him of his rights, and counsel was appointed to represent him. Moreover, and perhaps most important, the defendant\u2019s voluntary conduct in admitting the killing to his friend was not the product of police exploitation of any prior illegality but was a totally unexpected voluntary admission by the defendant. Allen was not an agent of the police, nor is there any claim that he was. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>197 Conn. 180, 496 A.2d 486 (1985). Allen had been the defendant\u2019s friend for a period of time prior to this episode. Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the admission to Allen was \u201c \u2018come at by exploitation of [the] illegality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The final relevant factor noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, is the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. This factor effectuates the deterrence policy of the exclusionary rule by providing an incentive for police to engage in lawful conduct. In this case, the illegality was not flagrant. This is shown, at least in part, by the three judge panel\u2019s finding of a legal arrest. Certainly the purpose of his continued detention was not to give the police the opportunity to have him make the challenged statement to Allen to whom no police connection is claimed. Nor was the purpose of the illegality to acquire a totally unexpected, voluntary admission by the defendant to his friend Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Accordingly, a weighing of the above factors leads us to conclude that the admission to Allen was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal arrest so as not to conflict with the principal goal of the exclusionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>rule\u2014the deterrence of future police misconduct. In this situation, there was no exploitation of any prior illegal police conduct but rather a reliance by the state, among other circumstances, on a voluntary admission by the defendant to a friend who was not a police agent. The admission to Allen was properly included in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Similarly, we find the poem written by the defendant to have been sufficiently attenuated from the initial illegality. In reaching this conclusion, we have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the source of this poem and how it came into the state\u2019s possession. At the time of the defendant\u2019s 1983 trial, Dennis Coyle had been a state trooper for about four years and prior to that time had served as a correctional officer at the Hartford correctional center from December, 1976, to January, 1979. As a correctional officer, he met the defendant at the Hartford jail and saw him \u201cpretty much on a daily basis\u201d and \u201cspoke with him on occasions,\u201d although it was not a \u201cfriendship per se.\u201d At that time, there was a weekly publication put out by the inmates that contained such information as sports, news, puzzles, etc. In the November 10, 1978 edition of that paper Coyle read a poem that the defendant had written and he was \u201cimpressed by it.\u201d There was no signature on it, but the defendant\u2019s name was typed on the poem. One day in November, 1978, \u201cright after [the poem] was published,\u201d Coyle told the defendant that he thought it was a \u201cpretty good poem\u201d and the defendant said, \u201cThanks.\u201d Coyle took a copy home and kept it. In the summer of 1982, Coyle was attending a constitutional law seminar where the case was discussed. A couple of months before the 1983 trial at which Coyle testified, he contacted the prosecutor in this case and informed him that he had a copy of the poem. During his testimony, Coyle produced the copy he had retained as well as a copy of the jail newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>in which the poem was printed. The latter was secured as a result of the service of a subpoena at the Hartford correctional center. The poem was admitted as an exhibit at the hearing on the nontestimonial evidence motions. The poem had been written more than a year after the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest. Between the illegal arrest and the publication of the poem, the defendant was represented by counsel, had numerous court dates and had been fully advised of his rights prior to testifying at his first trial. Indeed, the wording of the poem itself strongly suggests that the defendant wrote the poem not because of his illegal arrest or his ensuing confession but because of his desire to educate the young on the vices of drugs. The state did not acquire the poem by exploitation of the illegal arrest, but rather, the poem was a voluntary act of the defendant wholly distinct from the illegal arrest. Inclusion of the poem in the affidavit was proper. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 776</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant also argues that the state has failed to meet the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 776. The defendant\u2019s argument is three pronged. First, the defendant argues that because his arrest was without probable cause, he was not a \u201cdefendant\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 776 and thus, the Practice Book provision could not have been used to obtain evidence from him. Second, the defendant argues that the state has failed to establish that the evidence sought, the palm print, the blood and the saliva, could not \u201cpracticably be obtained from other sources.\u201d Third, the defendant argues that the state has failed to establish that the evidence would be of \u201cmaterial aid\u201d in determining whether the defendant committed the offense charged. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 776 could not be applied to him because his very status as a defendant was based on an illegal arrest. While the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest resulted in the suppression at trial of evidence seized incident thereto, it did not alter the ability of the state to establish the existence of probable cause to justify holding the defendant to respond to charges against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The defendant\u2019s next argument is that the state failed to demonstrate that the evidence sought could not \u201cpracticably be obtained from other sources.\u201d The defendant argues that because the state already had in its possession the nontestimonial evidence it sought, i.e., a palm print and blood sample derived from the illegal arrest, it could \u201cobtain\u201d the very same evidence from another \u201csource.\u201d By this argument the defendant is attempting to reap the benefit of the exclusionary rule while at the same time expanding its scope to foreclose the state from obtaining like evidence through an untainted source. We recognize that once evidence is suppressed, it is no longer available to the state on the question of guilt. In <em>Ostroski II, </em>supra, 294-95, we held that the physical evidence seized as a result of the defendant\u2019s unlawful arrest, inter alia, the defendant\u2019s palm print and blood sample obtained at the time of arrest, was inadmissible in evidence. The defendant cannot now avail himself of that ruling while at the same time argue that the state is in possession of that evidence for purposes of this motion. The defendant himself is not a \u201csuppressible fruit\u201d and the earlier illegality cannot deprive the state of the opportunity to prove his guilt through evidence wholly untainted by prior police misconduct. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 474, 100 S. Ct. 1244, 63 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1980). Because of our ruling in <em>Ostroski II, </em>the nontestimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>evidence sought by the state could not have been \u201cpracticably obtained from other sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Little explanation is necessary to demonstrate that, under the circumstances of this case, the nontestimonial evidence was of \u201cmaterial aid in determining whether the defendant committed the offense charged.\u201d We previously have stated that this requirement is \u201c \u2018met if the prosecutor has <em>any </em>basis for tying the particular evidence sought to the case.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>177 Conn. 352, 354, 416 A.2d 1209 (1979), quoting Unif. R. Crim. P. 434 (a), 10 U.L.A. 156 (1974). In this case, the state had a palm print taken at the scene of the crime. The victim\u2019s blood type was known and blood believed to be that of the assailant was found at the scene. Obtaining the defendant\u2019s palm print and blood type, through a blood or saliva sample, in a manner untainted by the illegal arrest clearly was a \u201cmaterial aid in determining whether the defendant committed the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In his second claim of error, the defendant claims that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss and his motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This claim has two components: first, that his arrest was illegal because the probable cause which supported it was based in part on evidence tainted by his unlawful seizure on April 16, 1977; see <em>Ostroski II, </em>supra; and second, that because his arrest was illegal, the defendant\u2019s presentment to the grand jury, the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ment, and the subsequent prosecution should have been barred. Although the state concedes that the defendant\u2019s arrest was illegal, it contends that under both federal and state constitutional law this illegality does not affect the jurisdiction of the court, provide a ground for dismissing the indictment, or preclude trial and conviction for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The relationship between an illegal arrest and a subsequent prosecution under federal constitutional law is well settled. The federal case law is clear that an illegal arrest will not bar a subsequent prosecution or void a resulting conviction. <em>I.N.S. </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1036, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>supra; <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 119, 95 S. Ct. 854, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 255, 86 S. Ct. 1416, 16 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1966); <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S. Ct. 509, 96 L. Ed. 541, reh. denied, 343 U.S. 937, 72 S. Ct. 768, 96 L. Ed. 1344 (1952); <em>Ker </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>119 U.S. 436, 440, 7 S. Ct. 225, 30 L. Ed. 421 (1886).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Federal law, then, provides no basis for the defendant\u2019s argument that his motions to dismiss should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">If the defendant\u2019s claim that his illegal arrest requires dismissal of the charges against him is to be sustained, that claim must find its predicate in state law. The state contends that the defendant\u2019s claim in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>indistinguishable from the claim presented to this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 262-63. The defendant, on the other hand, recognizing the applicability of <em>Fleming, </em>claims that in <em>Fleming </em>we specifically distinguished <em>State </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>179 Conn. 46, 425 A.2d 916 (1979), thus leaving open a situation where the charges would indeed be dismissed. The defendant claims that this case is parallel to <em>Federici, </em>thus his motions to dismiss should have been granted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>we overruled <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900 (1965). <em>Licari </em>held that an illegal arrest per se invalidates a subsequent conviction. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 263, we held that \u201c[wjhere the fairness of a subsequent prosecution has not been impaired by an illegal arrest, neither the federal nor the Connecticut constitution requires dismissal of the charges or a voiding of the resulting conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We specifically excluded from our holding, however, cases such as <em>Federici </em>where the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial is compromised by the circumstances of his arrest. Id., 262. In distinguishing <em>Federici, </em>we stated that \u201c[a]n illegal arrest may impair the fairness of a subsequent prosecution only where evidence obtained as a direct consequence of that arrest is admitted against the defendant at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 338, 514 A.2d 337 (1986). <em>State </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>supra. The defendant argues that because illegally obtained evidence, the palm print, the blood sample, and the saliva sample, was introduced at his 1983 trial, <em>Federici </em>mandates that his motions to dismiss should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on the <em>Federici </em>exception to our holding in <em>Fleming </em>is misplaced. As was devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>oped in Part I of this opinion, illegally obtained evidence was not in fact admitted at trial; that is, the blood, the saliva, and the palm print which were admitted at trial, all of which the defendant claims are \u201cfruits\u201d of his illegal arrest, are not fruits, in that the evidence was obtained by means \u201c \u2018sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 599; <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 487-88; see <em>Bynum v. United States, </em>supra. Therefore, the factual predicate of the <em>Federici </em>type exception to our holding in <em>Fleming </em>does not exist in this case. The fairness of the defendant\u2019s 1983 trial was not impaired by his illegal arrest. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>supra. As we have stated, the defendant is not himself a \u201csuppressible fruit,\u201d and the illegality of his arrest cannot deprive the state of the opportunity to prove his guilt through introduction of evidence at trial which is untainted by the prior police misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>supra. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of error is that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s request to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant timely filed his request to charge prior to closing arguments, and took an exception when the charge was not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\"><em>\u201cIn State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), this court articulated a four pronged test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>for determining when it is proper to charge a jury with respect to a lesser included offense. \u2018A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if . . . (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>195 Conn. 567, 574, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 616-17, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155, 158, 506 A.2d 104 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The defendant argues that he has established all four prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>and thus, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter. The state, on the other hand, argues that the defendant has failed to meet even the first prong of <em>State </em>v. Whistnant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cWe have previously considered and rejected the claim \u2018that a defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra,] 581. The right to such an instruction is purely a matter of our common law as set forth in <em>Whistnant </em>itself. The first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that the defendant request \u2018an appropriate instruction.\u2019 A proposed instruction on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>lesser included offense, like any other proposed jury instruction is not appropriate unless made in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 852.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 158. Section 852 provides in pertinent part: \u201cRequests shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law <em>clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, and the facts supported by the evidence to which the proposition would apply. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In the present case, the defendant framed his request to charge as follows: \u201cIn accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, [427 A.2d 414 (1980),] and <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, [437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981)], the defendant requests the Court to charge on the following lesser included offenses; Manslaughter in the First Degree, Sections 53a-55 (a) (1) and 53a-55 (a) (3) of the General Statutes.\u201d A summary request such as this one does not comply with our rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In this written request, the defendant merely asked the court to instruct the jury, in pertinent part, that it could consider the lesser offense of manslaughter in the first degree. \u201c[A]n \u2018appropriate instruction\u2019 under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant </em>must contain \u2018 \u201ca complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>155 Conn. 406, 410, 232 A.2d 326 (1967), quoting <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>103 Conn. 678, 680, 131 A. 838 (1925).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Killenger, </em>193 Conn. 48, 57, 475 A.2d 276 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 160. The defendant\u2019s request contains no facts at all. Moreover, although the request cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant </em>as authority for the proposition stated, we have emphasized in the past that <em>Whistnant </em>by itself does not provide the substantive principles of criminal law which would jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>tify any particular instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra. While this court does not favor unyielding adherence to \u201crules of procedure where the interests of justice are thereby disserved\u201d; id.; the ever increasing refinement of our law justifies cooperation of counsel in stating requests for jury instruction. \u201cThe minor burden of cooperation imposed by this section is neither unreasonable nor novel.\u201d Id., 161. The trial court did not err in refusing the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on the elements of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim of error is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. In light of our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L.

In support of this claim, the defendant points to the judge\u2019s ruling in the second trial that the admission to Allen was an inadmissible fruit of the illegal arrest. At the hearing on nontestimonial evidence, the state argued that this court did not pass upon the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s confession to Allen. The trial judge based.his ruling on his reading of our decision in <em>Ostroski II. </em>The trial ruling was incorrect. Although we admit some possible ambiguity as to the scope of the terminology used in that opinion, our careful review of the records and briefs in <em>Ostroski II, </em>as well as the opinion itself, leads us to conclude that the issue of whether the admission to Allen was a fruit of the illegal arrest was not decided by this court in <em>Ostroski II.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> Contrary to the state\u2019s claim that this issue cannot be reviewed by us because it entails the use of the transcript of the grand jury proceedings which is unauthorized; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-45a; the disposition of this issue does not entail the use of that transcript.
