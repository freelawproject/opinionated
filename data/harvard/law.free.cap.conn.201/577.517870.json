The plaintiff, the town of Stratford, attacks on constitutional and public policy grounds the validity of a provision in its collective bargaining agreement with the named defendant, Local 134, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, under which the municipality must provide all members of the bargaining unit with hypertension or heart disease benefits mandated for municipal fire or police personnel under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c. The plaintiff asserts additionally that the trial court erred in denying its application to vacate the arbitration award because the failure of the arbitration panel to address the constitutional and policy issues rendered the award not \u201cmutual, final and definite,\u201d as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-418. We conclude that neither the challenged bargaining agreement provision nor the contested award violates public policy or any provision of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The parties stipulated to the facts. The defendant Warren Johns began working for the plaintiff in the public works department in 1971. At that time Johns passed a physical examination, indicating that he was then free from heart disease. In the years 1975 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>1977, however, he suffered a series of heart attacks, which culminated in bypass surgery in October, 1977. In 1978 Johns applied to the plaintiff for heart disease benefits, claiming coverage under article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That portion of the agreement extends to all members of Local 134 the hypertension and heart disease benefits mandated for municipal fire or police department employees under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff terminated Johns\u2019 employment without paying him such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Johns filed a grievance with the personnel appeals board for the town of Stratford, which the board denied. Johns then sought a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court. The court, <em>Saden, J., </em>dismissed the action because the parties had consented, under the terms of their collective bargaining agreement, to submit questions of contract interpretation to the state board of mediation and arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the arbitration proceedings that followed the plaintiff argued both that the bargaining agreement should be interpreted to preclude Johns\u2019 recovery, and that a contrary inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>pretation would render the provision unconstitutional and contrary to public policy. The arbitration panel interpreted the contract provision to afford Johns the payments he sought, but declined to discuss the constitutional and policy issues because \u201csuch matters are outside the jurisdiction of this arbitration panel.\u201d* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Superior Court, <em>Gerety, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 application to confirm the arbitration award and denied the plaintiff\u2019s opposing application to vacate, which had been filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417 and 52-418 respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>In this appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>plaintiff claims the trial court erred in concluding (1) that the award, which addressed only the limited issue submitted to the arbitration panel, ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was mutual, final and definite, and (2) that the plaintiff was precluded from litigating the constitutional and policy aspects of article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement. Presupposing that its constitutional and policy claims are reviewable, the plaintiff further asserts (3) that the challenged contract provision violates article first, \u00a7 1, of our state constitution by creating a class preference,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (4) that the contract provision contravenes public policy by granting public works employees a special bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We first reject the plaintiffs contention that because the arbitrators refused to consider the constitutional issue their award was not mutual, final and definite, and, therefore, ought to have been vacated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (d). We conclude, nevertheless, that the factors enumerated in \u00a7 52-418, each of which, if found, would require that an arbitration award be vacated, are not exhaustive and consequently do not in all instances limit the scope of judicial review of such awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">It is axiomatic in this jurisdiction that, when an award is challenged pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (d) on the ground that the arbitrators exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award was not made, the reviewing court is properly limited to a comparison of the award with the submission. E.g., <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Protection, </em>190 Conn. 14, 18, 458 A.2d 685 (1983); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>189 Conn. 16, 23, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983); <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>Trumbull Police Local </em>1745, 1 Conn. App. 207, 212, 470 A.2d 1219 (1984). The award will not be vacated under \u00a7 52-418 (d) if it conforms to the submission, and the award need contain no more than the actual decision of the arbitrators. <em>Ramos Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Construction Co., </em>174 Conn. 583, 589, 392 A.2d 461 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The issue submitted to the arbitration panel in the present case was whether the plaintiff had violated the labor contract in refusing to pay Johns the benefits he sought, and, if so, what the remedy should be. In their award the arbitrators answered that the plaintiff had violated the contract, and accordingly ordered it to make remedial payments. It is clear, therefore, that the award conformed to the submission. The award was dispositive of the dispute the parties had submitted to the panel. Because the submission, containing no limiting or conditional language, was unrestricted, the award was final and binding and not reviewable for errors of law or fact. See, e.g., <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 626-27, 509 A.2d 467 (1986); <em>Milford Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>179 Conn. 678, 683, 427 A.2d 859 (1980). Finally, the award was definite in its terms. We conclude, therefore, that the arbitrators did not imperfectly execute their powers within the meaning of \u00a7 52-418 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The plaintiff contends that it was reversible error for the trial court to deny the plaintiff an opportunity to litigate the constitutional and public policy aspects of the contract provision underlying the arbitrators\u2019 award. Our response is that the trial court, however succinctly, did address and dispose of those issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We next consider whether judicial review of the constitutional and policy claims raised by the plaintiff is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>We have said that \u201c[t]he right to review an arbitration award is wholly encompassed within the parameters of \u00a7 52-418.\u201d <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 22. Moreover, we have implied that in consensual arbitration, as opposed to arbitration made compulsory by statute, the parties can be deemed to have waived their right to challenge any constitutional infringement that the award may entail. <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 637-38, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985). In cases in which the parties have bargained for and agreed to an arbitration procedure, this court\u2019s respect for the autonomy of that process has motivated us to recognize such a notion of waiver. See <em>Waterbury Board of Education </em>v. <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn., </em>168 Conn. 54, 62, 357 A.2d 466 (1975); cf. <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra (compulsory arbitration).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Arbitration in the present case was a creature of the parties\u2019 agreement and not mandated by legislative enactment. Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons for considering the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional and policy claims. Our concern is not with whether the arbitrators have properly construed the collective bargaining agreement, but only with whether the agreement, and, a fortiori, the arbitration award itself, is capable of being enforced. <em>See Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>179 Conn. 184, 196 n.6, 425 A.2d 1247 (1979). \u201c \u2018Just as private parties cannot expect a court to enforce a contract between them to engage in conduct which is illegal or otherwise contrary to public policy, they cannot expect an intervening arbitral award approving (or ordering) that conduct to receive judicial endorsement.\u2019 Gorman, Basic Text on Labor Law, Unionization and Collective Bargaining (1976) p. 593.\u201d <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>supra, 195. Furthermore, when an arbitration panel declines to hear constitutional claims on the basis of this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>decision in <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, <em>Estate of Thornton </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the parties cannot reasonably be deemed to have waived their rights to make those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In the present case the plaintiff did raise its constitutional and policy claims in its brief before the state board of mediation and arbitration. The defendants responded in their brief that our holding in <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>precluded arbitral consideration of those claims. The parties may have felt that it would have been futile formally to submit such issues to the arbitration panel, because this court in <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>had upheld the panel\u2019s refusal to consider a constitutional question clearly included within the unrestricted submission. In any event, the arbitrators in the present case agreed that policy matters as well as constitutional issues were not within their jurisdiction. Because the parties\u2019 submission did not include such matters, we need not determine whether the panel correctly construed our decision in <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>which removed issues concerning the constitutional validity of a statute from the arbitration sphere, to apply also to issues involving public policy as expressed in common law or statute. We conclude, however, that the parties in this case have not waived their right to challenge article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement on constitutional and policy grounds, and that judicial review in such a circumstance extends beyond the parameters of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We proceed to review the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional and policy claims. The plaintiff contends that article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement (1) creates a class preference in violation of article first, \u00a7 1, of our state constitution, which provides in part that \u201cno man or set of men are entitled to exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community,\u201d and (2) grants a special bonus to public works employees such as the defendant Johns in contravention of public policy. We reject both of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Article first, \u00a7 1, of the constitution of Connecticut \u201cprohibits the adoption of legislation that has no public purpose but operates to confer private gain on an individual or group. <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 274, 292-93, 294 A.2d 67 (1972); <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>133 Conn. 511, 515-16, 52 A.2d 702 (1947). Where, however, the statute does serve a public purpose, the legislature may constitutionally differentiate between classes of persons, so long as the legislative classification bears a rational relationship to the public purpose sought to be served. <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 315, 417 A.2d 343 (1979); <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra; <em>State ex rel. Higgins </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>139 Conn. 102, 106, 90 A.2d 862 (1952).\u201d <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>192 Conn. 127, 134, 470 A.2d 1202 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>168 Conn. 84, 357 A.2d 922, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 805, 96 S. Ct. 14, 46 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975), this court upheld the constitutional validity of General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c, the statute incorporated into the contract provision at issue in the present case. We said that \u00a7 7-433c does not create a class preference in violation of \u00a7 1 of article first of our state con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>stitution because providing an inducement for persons to seek jobs with police and fire departments is a proper public purpose, and because \u201cthe legislature took into consideration the peculiar problems and unusual risks attendant upon these occupations in determining that they properly occupy a different status from other municipal employees.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra; see also <em>Pyne </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>177 Conn. 456, 460-61, 418 A.2d 899 (1979). Because, as the trial court stated, the benefits claimed in the present case are not mandated by statute but were agreed upon by the parties in arms length bargaining, we need not determine whether members of Local 134, the defendant Johns\u2019 bargaining unit, are employed in extra risk occupations comparable to those of police and fire department personnel that would justify their statutory entitlement to such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 88, we termed the benefits conferred by \u00a7 7-433c \u201cspecial compensation.\u201d As such, they are indubitably an appropriate subject of collective bargaining between a municipal employer and a designated employee organization. Under \u00a7 7-469 of the General Statutes, such parties have a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>bargain collectively \u201cwith respect to wages, hours and other conditions of employment,\u201d as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 7-470 (c). <em>See Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>White, </em>171 Conn. 553, 559, 370 A.2d 1070 (1976). We have often noted that the language of the Municipal Employee Relations Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-467 through 7-477; and of the National Labor Relations Act; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 through 161; \u201cis essentially the same.\u201d <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>175 Conn. 349, 354, 402 A.2d 332 (1978). Therefore, \u201c \u2018the judicial interpretation frequently accorded the federal act is of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own acts.\u2019 <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. v. DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 579, 295 A.2d 526 [1972], and cases cited.\u201d <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In <em>Inland Steel Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>170 F.2d 247 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 960, 69 S. Ct. 887, 93 L. Ed. 1112 (1949), the court construed the terms \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cother conditions of employment,\u201d as found in then \u00a7 9 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act. The court agreed with the National Labor Relations Board that \u201cthe benefits accruing to an employee by reason of a retirement or pension plan are encompassed in both categories,\u201d that the term \u201cwages\u201d \u201cmust be construed to include emoluments of value, like pension and insurance benefits, which may accrue to employees out of their employment relationship,\u201d and that \u201c[realistically viewed, this type of wage enhancement or increase, no less than any other, becomes an integral part of the entire wage structure . . . .\u201d Id., 250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We conclude that the \u201cspecial compensation\u201d represented by the hypertension and heart disease benefits presently at issue is certainly within the realm of acceptable, if not mandatory, bargaining subjects. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>thermore, each bargaining unit has a right individually to dicker over contract terms through untrammeled bargaining. See generally <em>Local 1219 </em>v. <em>Connecticut Labor Relations Board, </em>171 Conn. 342, 370 A.2d 952 (1976). We consequently agree with the trial court that because the present disability benefits would clearly have been permissible if spelled out in detail in the parties\u2019 agreement without reference to \u00a7 7-433c, \u201cthere would appear to be no reason why they might not be described in the shorthand manner employed here.\u201d We hold, therefore, that article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement does not create a class preference in violation of article first, \u00a7 1, of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that the contract provision it challenges grants a special bonus to public works employees in contravention of public policy. The plaintiff\u2019s policy claim can be disposed of largely on the basis of what has already been said. Although the plaintiff contends that the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers\u201d in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (d) by rendering a decision that contravenes public policy, we reject this as the basis of our review, noting, once again, that the arbitration award conformed to the parties\u2019 submission. We proceed to review the policy claim on grounds independent of \u00a7 52-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">As is the case with respect to contracts generally, the judiciary\u2019s power to enforce the terms of a collective bargaining agreement is at all times exercised subject to the restrictions and limitations of public policy as manifested in constitutions, statutes and applicable legal precedents. See generally <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>334 U.S. 24, 34-35, 68 S. Ct. 847, 92 L. Ed. 1187 (1948); <em>Muschany </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 U.S. 49, 64-68, 65 S. Ct. 442, 89 L. Ed. 744 (1945); <em>Avco Corporation </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>Preteska, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 475, 480-81, 174 A.2d 684 (1961). \u201cWhere the enforcement of private agreements would be violative of that policy, it is the obligation of courts to refrain from such exertions of judicial power.\u201d <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>supra, 35. \u201cAs the term \u2018public policy\u2019 is vague, [however,] there must be found definite indications in the law of the sovereignty to justify the invalidation of a contract as contrary to that policy.\u201d <em>Muschany </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We have made it clear today that article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement does not violate the equal protection policy against the governmental creation of class preferences underlying article first, \u00a7 1, of our state constitution. We now add that \u00a7 7-433c, which recites that one of the purposes for its enactment was to \u201cact as an inducement in attracting and securing persons\u201d for employment in police and fire departments nowhere indicates that the benefits it mandates shall not be available by consent of the parties to other municipal employees. We conclude that the purpose of \u00a7 7-433c is not to remove these benefits from the realm of arms length collective bargaining, but merely to ensure that they are provided for members of police and fire departments, even where their municipal employers object. Therefore, \u00a7 7-433c does not manifest a policy limitation that would render the challenged contract provision unenforceable. Nor do we find any such limitation in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Finally, we agree with the defendants that the most compelling policy considerations relevant to the present case weigh in favor of untrammeled bargaining over contract terms. \u201cIn the federal sector it has been said that the purpose of the NLRA is to seek the peaceful adjustment of labor-management disputes as a substitute for industrial strife and the promotion of industrial stabilization through the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>agreement. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 578, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409 [I960]. This is also the essential thrust of our State Labor Relations Act and the [Municipal Employee Relations Act].\u201d <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 356. Our conclusion is that neither article XII, \u00a7 3, of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement nor the arbitration panel\u2019s award contravenes public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-5\"> Article XII, \u00a7 3, provides: \u201cPENSIONS ....

E.g., <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Veterans\u2019 Bonus Divi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>sion Appeals Board, </em>179 Conn. 311, 319, 426 A.2d 289 (1979); <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>supra, 222-23; <em>Lublin </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>168 Conn. 212, 219, 362 A.2d 769 (1975); <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>133 Conn. 511, 515, 52 A.2d 702 (1947). Because the latter claim adds nothing to the former, we limit ourselves to the argument asserted under the Connecticut constitution. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Product Development Corporation, </em>167 Conn. 111, 119 n.3, 355 A.2d 72 (1974); <em>State ex rel.

We said that \u00a7 7-433c is free from the infirmity of a predecessor statute, General Statutes \u00a7 7-433a, which we declared unconstitutional in <em>Ducharme </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>161 Conn. 135, 285 A.2d 318 (1971), because it raised a conclusive presumption that hypertension or heart disease suffered by a fire department or police department employee whose physical examination on entry into the service had failed to reveal any evidence of such an impairment was a personal injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment. We note that a 1974 amendment to the Stratford Town Code, \u201cRetirement Plan for Employees of the Town of Stratford,\u201d \u00a7 3 (2), which provides in part that \u201c[i]n the case of firemen and policemen and all members of the Pension Plan, disablement due to hypertension or heart disease shall be conclusively presumed to be disability incurred in the line of duty,\u201d is not at issue today. There is no claim of a necessary link between this amendment and article XII, \u00a7 3, of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
