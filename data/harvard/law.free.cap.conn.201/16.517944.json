On appeal, the defendant claims the trial court erred in concluding: (1) that the three year limitation upon the initiation of paternity actions prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160, in effect at the time of the trial court\u2019s judgment, is unconstitutional; and (2) that blood grouping and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) test results are admissible to establish paternity. Because \u00a7 46b-160 has been amended to eliminate the three year statute of limitations, we need not reach the constitutional issue. Further, we hold that the trial court correctly construed \u00a7 46b-168 not to bar the inclusive use of blood grouping and HLA test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">On June 15,1982, Sharon Moore brought a paternity action against Howard McNamara alleging that he was the father of the child born to her on December 10, 1978. The defendant pleaded in a special defense that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barred the action because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the child was more than three years old when the suit was filed. The state, having assumed its party status pursuant to \u00a7 46b-160, because it had been paying lying-in expenses for the mother and child as well as support and maintenance for the child; see <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>196 Conn. 403, 406, 493 A.2d 213 (1985); replied that the three year limitation on paternity actions violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. On April 25,1984, the court, <em>Jackaway, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and held that Connecticut\u2019s three year statute of limitations was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>On May 7, 1984, the defendant moved for a court order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-168 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requiring that he, the mother, and the child submit to blood tests. At trial the plaintiff sought to admit in evidence as an exhibit the results of the HLA and other blood tests prepared by Herbert Silver, a physician. These results were offered to show the statistical likelihood of the defendant being the father of the child. The defendant objected to the admission of the results, claiming them to be inadmissible because \u00a7 46b-168 states that the results of blood grouping tests \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>be admissible in evidence only in cases where such results establish definite exclusion of the putative father <em>. . . </em>The trial court, <em>Reilly, J., </em>overruled the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On the basis of the testimony, the blood test results, and a visual comparison of the child with the defendant, the trial court found that the defendant is the father of the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ordered the defendant to pay $15 per week in child support, an additional $10 per week to the state toward an arrearage of $11,687.93, and an additional $5 per week to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney until the sum of $2187.50 is paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We need not address the defendant\u2019s first claim that the trial court erred in concluding that the three year limitation upon the initiation of paternity actions prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160 is unconstitutional. This court has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case. See generally <em>Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>331 U.S. 549, 568-74, 67 S. Ct. 1409, 91 L. Ed. 1666 (1947); <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-47, 56 S. Ct. 466, 80 L.

Ct. 161, 94 L. Ed. 144 (1949). \u201cAppropriate deference to a coordinate branch of government exercising its essential functions demands that we refrain from deciding constitutional challenges to its enactments until the need to do so is plainly evident.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 105, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). Effective October 1,1985, the state legislature amended \u00a7 46b-160 to increase the statute of limitations for asserting paternity claims from three years to eighteen years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Public Acts 1985, No. 85-548, \u00a7 3. It would be inappropriate for this court to resolve the constitutional issue the parties have briefed without first deciding whether the new eighteen year statute of limitations contained in Public Acts 1985, No. 85-548 is applicable to this case, thus making unnecessary a determination of the validity of the former three year statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue then becomes whether the new eighteen year statute of limitations is to be applied retroactively to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>It is a rule of construction that legislation is to be applied prospectively unless the legislature clearly expresses an intention to the contrary. <em>See Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 571, 440 A.2d 220 (1981). The rule is rooted in the notion that it would be unfair to impose a substantive amendment that changes the grounds upon which an action may be maintained on parties who have already transacted or who are already committed to litigation. See <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Ulysses, </em>149 Conn. 396, 401, 180 A.2d 632 (1962); <em>E.M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Alliance, </em>127 Conn. 415, 418, 17 A.2d 525 (1941). In civil cases, however, unless considerations of good sense and justice dictate otherwise, it is presumed that procedural statutes will be applied retrospectively. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 351, 456 A.2d 305 (1983); <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Ulysses, </em>supra. Procedural statutes have been traditionally viewed as affecting remedies, not substantive rights, and therefore leave the preexisting scheme intact. See, e.g., <em>Sherry H. </em>v. <em>Probate Court, </em>177 Conn. 93, 100-102, 411 A.2d 931 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u201cA statute of limitations is generally considered to be procedural, especially where the statute contains only a limitation as to time with respect to a right of action and does not itself create the right of action. <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 195, 286 A.2d 308 (1971).\u201d <em>Collucci </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>585 F. Sup. 529, 532 (D. Conn. 1984). This is so because it is considered that the limitation merely acts as a bar to a remedy otherwise available. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>149 Conn. 734, 735, 181 A.2d 592 (1962). Where a statute of limitations is procedural, it is subject to waiver; unless specifically pleaded it is deemed waived and the remedy continues beyond the prescribed period. See <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 15, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985). Where, however, a specific limitation is contained in the statute that creates the right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and establishes the remedy, the remedy exists only during the prescribed period and not thereafter. In this situation, the statute of limitations is considered substantive or jurisdictional rather than procedural or personal, and therefore may not be waived. Id.; <em>L.G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>167 Conn. 509, 511, 356 A.2d 144 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">At common law there was no remedy to compel a putative father to contribute to the support of his illegitimate offspring. One commentator explained: \u201cAt Common Law neither the mother nor putative father is liable to maintain a natural child. The right of custody being absent, the correlative duty of maintenance was absent also. The child of nobody was as regards its support the child of the people, and the people in the shape of the overseers had to undertake its suc-cour.\u201d W. Hooper, The Law of Illegitimacy (1911), pp. 135-36.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In an early legislative rejection of the common law rule that an illegitimate child was nullius filius, Connecticut enacted its \u201cstatute of bastardy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Hinman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 Conn. 357 (1817), the court stated: \u201cA suit for the maintenance of a bastard child is a statutory process <em>sui generis </em>.... The statute creates a right to commence and prosecute a civil suit . . . .\u201d Id., 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Because paternity statutes derogated from the common law and thus created the right of action, statutes of limitations within them were considered substantive and jurisdictional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It can no longer be said, however, that the right of action in Connecticut in paternity suits does not derive from the common law. The common law is generally described as \u201cthose principles, usage, and rules of action applicable to the government and security of persons and property which do not rest for their authority upon any express and positive declaration of the will of the legislature.\u201d <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>United States, </em>334 F. Sup. 415, 418 (S.D. Tex. 1971); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Muolo, </em>118 Conn. 373, 378, 172 A. 875 (1934); <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>50 Conn. 529, 541 (1883). The United States Supreme Court in <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>409 U.S. 535, 93 S. Ct. 872, 35 L. Ed.2d 56 (1973), added to the common law its holding that \u201conce a State posits a judicially enforceable right on behalf of children to needed support from their natural fathers there is no constitutionally sufficient justification for denying such an essential right to a child simply because its natural father has not married its mother.\u201d Id.-, 538. Thus, because the father\u2019s obligation to support his minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>legitimate child is created at common law; <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>138 Conn. 1, 5, 81 A.2d 450 (1951); <em>Bohun </em>v. <em>Kinasz, </em>124 Conn. 543, 546, 200 A. 1015 (1938); his similar obligation after <em>Gomez </em>to support his minor illegitimate child is now derivatively based upon common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Because our paternity statute no longer is the sole basis for a paternity action, the statute of limitations it contains is not substantive or jurisdictional, but rather procedural or personal. It follows that such a statute of limitations may properly be applied retrospectively absent the clear expression of a contrary legislative intent, unless considerations of good sense and justice dictate otherwise. No such contrary intent appears either in the wording of the amended statute, or in the proceedings that disclose its legislative history. Nor does it appear that retroactive application of the new statute of limitations would work an injustice on the defendant. If we were to hold that the amendment was inapplicable to this action, which was pending at the time of the enactment; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (u); the plaintiff would not be barred from commencing a new paternity action until 1996, when her child will reach his eighteenth birthday. Accordingly, we hold that the new eighteen year limitation upon the initiation of paternity actions prescribed by Public Acts 1985, No. 85-548, \u00a7 3, is to be applied retroactively to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court erred in concluding that blood grouping and HLA test results are admissible to establish paternity. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-168 states that the results of blood grouping tests \u201cshall be admissible in evidence only in cases where such results establish definite exclusion of the putative father . . . .\u201d When the state offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>in evidence the report of the laboratory that had performed the tests upon the defendant, the mother and the child, the defendant objected that, since the report did not exclude his paternity, the statute barred the admission of the test results. The court overruled the objection and an exception was noted. We must, therefore, address the issue of whether HLA tests are blood grouping tests within the meaning of \u00a7 46b-168. A preliminary discussion of some of the scientific principles and procedures involved in paternity testing is necessary to explain our legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Gregor Mendel, the nineteenth century anchorite who crossed peas, discovered that hereditary particles from each parent, which are members of pairs, segregate in forming reproductive cells and then recombine in the offspring. Blood types are inherited according to the Mendelian laws that genes determine inherited characteristics, occur in pairs on chromosomes, and that one gene of the pair is inherited from the father while the other is inherited from the mother. See Peterson, \u201cA New Things You Should Know About Paternity Tests (But Were Afraid To Ask),\u201d 22 Santa Clara L. Rev. 667, 669-70 (1982). If one knows the blood group (the phenotype) of a child, mother, and alleged father, one can infer the genes giving rise to that blood group (the genotype) and say whether a child with the observed phenotype could have been born to the mother and putative father. For example, a child having the phenotype A could not have been born to parents who are homozygous for the gene B (i.e., both parents have the genotype BB). See Lee, \u201cCurrent Status of Paternity Testing,\u201d 9 Fam. L.Q. 615, 616-21 (1975). In such a case, the nonpaternity of the putative father having the genotype BB is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Courts have allowed the use of blood tests in paternity litigation for the last half century. Exclusion of paternity has traditionally been the primary consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ation. See, e.g., <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>114 F.2d 479, 480 (D.C. Cir. 1940) (\u201c[t]he value of blood grouping tests as proof of non-paternity is well known\u201d); <em>Cortese </em>v. <em>Cortese, </em>10 N.J. Super. 152, 157, 76 A.2d 717 (1950) (\u201c[b]lood tests can now disprove paternity in over one-half of the paternity cases involving innocent men\u201d). The use of blood test results had been necessarily restricted in this way because at one time only a few antigens, which are molecules that are genetic markers and that can be detected on the surface of cells, were known. Consequently, only a few basic blood group systems, all being red cell antigen systems, could be tested. For example, a positive test result under the early ABO system would mean merely that the accused was one of the 87 percent of the male population not excluded as the potential father. Positive test results under the ABO, Rh, and MNSs systems cumulatively, which tests are commonly referred to as the Landsteimer series of red cell blood grouping tests, would mean that the alleged father was one of the 45.5 percent of the male population having the requisite genotypes. See generally \u201cJoint AMA-ABA Guidelines: Present Status of Serologic Testing in Problems of Disputed Parentage,\u201d 10 Fam. L.Q. 247 (1976); McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984), pp. 617-22.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Genetic technology has advanced substantially in recent years. The probability of exclusion of parenthood on the basis of the combined use of several red cell antigen systems has increased to 65 percent and 73 percent for black and white individuals, respectively. P. Tishler, \u201cGenetic Technology and the Solution of Crime,\u201d in Genetics and the Law II (A. Milunsky, G. Annas eds. 1979), pp. 284-85. In addition, the recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>discovery of the HLA system, present in cells throughout the body, has given rise to HLA testing for tissue compatibility in the context of organ transplants. Because of the \u201cextreme diversity\u201d of HLA types in humans, from which it follows that \u201cthe HLA types of virtually all individuals are rare\u201d; id., 286; the impetus arose to use HLA data as evidence <em>for </em>paternity. See id., 286-87; Terasaki, \u201cResolution By HLA Testing of 1000 Paternity Cases Not Excluded By ABO Testing,\u201d 16 J. Fam. L. 543 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Despite the name \u201cleucocyte antigen,\u201d the factors expressed by the HLA genes are present in most cells. J. Barrett, Textbook of Immunology (3d Ed. 1978), pp. 386-87. Blood cells are the easiest cells to obtain for HLA testing. \u201cThe HLA antigens occur in the white blood cells as well as in the tissue cells. Therefore, tissue typing for these antigens is done in the membranes of lymphocytes that have been separated from the person\u2019s blood.\u201d A. Guyton, Textbook of Medical Physiology (7th Ed. 1986), p. 75. However, an individual\u2019s HLA type is not related to his blood type. \u201cHLA testing can be thought of as tissue typing rather than blood group typing.\u201d Ellman &amp; Kaye, \u201cProbabilities and Proof: Can HLA and Blood Group Testing Prove Paternity?,\u201d 54 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1131, 1139 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In accordance with these considerations, we conclude that HLA tests are not blood grouping tests within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-168. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>397 Mass. 206, 213, 490 N.E.2d 788 (1986) (\u201c[w]e are Convinced by our review of the case law from other jurisdictions as well as the available scientific and medicolegal commentary that the HLA system is not a blood grouping test, but is a tissue typing system\u201d); <em>Cutchember </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>466 A.2d 1240, 1241-42 (D.C. 1983) (HLA test is not a blood test within the statutory meaning, but a tissue test for which blood is merely a convenient testing medium). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Nor do we believe that the combination of HLA tests and red cell tests, which may increase the probability of excluding a wrongly accused father to over 99 percent; see Peterson, supra, 671; falls within \u00a7 46b-168\u2019s ambit. \u201cThe results, produced by combining HLA tests with the Landsteimer test or series of tests, are no longer those of blood grouping but rather a hybrid not specifically excluded by the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 46b-168.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 66, 69, 481 A.2d 428 (1984); see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>supra, 213 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Our conclusion that HLA tests are not blood grouping tests within the meaning of the statute is supported by the legislative history of the adoption of \u00a7 46b-168. The legislative records indicate that the relatively low exclusion capability of the Landsteimer series strongly influenced the legislature to include the prohibition against using the test results affirmatively. Norman Solanch, a serologist, speaking at the hearings in 1957, said that the reason for the restriction upon the admissibility of blood grouping tests \u201cis very simple. At the present time, we cannot prove that an individual is the father, but in cases where an individual is wrongly accused we can exclude him with the groupings here that are presently available in a little over 50 percent of the cases.\u201d General Law Committee, Hearing on Public Acts 1957, No. 367, April 4,1957, p. 724. From this testimony, it appears unlikely that the 1957 legislature intended its statute to prohibit the admission in evidence of test results obtained by then unknown techniques such as HLA testing capable of achieving a decidedly higher probability of exclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Because the defendant\u2019s objection to the introduction of the laboratory report was solely upon the ground we have rejected that \u00a7 46b-168 prohibited admission of the test results for the purpose of establishing paternity, we need not consider whether the report was admissible under general common law rules pertaining to the use of evidence derived from recently developed scientific techniques. A party is limited to the ground of his objection in claiming error in a ruling on evidence. <em>Salvatore </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>144 Conn. 437, 443,133 A.2d 622 (1957); see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 290, 141 A.2d 634 (1958). The prevailing standard for judicial recognition of the probative value of scientific evidence has been carefully delineated in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. App. 1923): \u201cJust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts, will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d Id., 1014. This court has used the <em>Frye </em>standard in appraising the admissibility of evidence derived from innovative scientific techniques. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomanelli, </em>153 Conn. 365, 370, 216 A.2d 625 (1966) (\u201cgeneral scientific acceptance of the Doppler-shift principle upon which police radar operates\u201d); cf. <em>Molino </em>v. <em>Board of Public Safety, </em>154 Conn. 368, 376, 225 A.2d 805 (1966) (\u201cunreliability of the polygraph test has resulted in its universal rejection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We note that combined blood grouping and HLA testing has attained general acceptance in the scientific community as a means of testing for paternity. See, e.g., J. Barrett, supra; Joint AMA-ABA Guidelines: Present Status of Serologic Testing in Problems of Disputed Parentage, supra; Lee, supra; Peterson, supra; Terasaki, supra; P. Tishler, supra. \u201cThe American Medical Association, the American Association of Blood Banking, and the American Association of Histocompatibility have all approved HLA testing to determine paternity. See <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Shanholtz, </em>57 Md. App. 92, 100 [468 A.2d 1365] (1984). Moreover, while there is some disagreement among medicolegal commentators as to how inculpatory HLA test results should be presented to the fact finder in paternity cases, nearly all agree that such evidence is reliable and should be admitted in one form or another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>supra, 215-16. It also appears that the decided trend in other jurisdictions is toward admission of HLA test results as evidence of paternity. See, e.g., <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>88 Cal. App. 3d 873, 153 Cal. Rptr. 865 (1979); <em>Carlyon </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>387 So. 2d 455, 467 (Fla. App. 1980); <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Crain, </em>104 Idaho 666, 662 P.2d 538 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>supra; <em>Hennepin County Welfare Board </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>304 N.W.2d 879 (Minn. 1981); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>6 Ohio St. 3d 46, 53, 451 N.E.2d 241 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The state did produce an expert witness who testified concerning the scientific principles supporting the reliability of the test results and who had supervised the testing procedures used in this case. The defendant produced no expert witnesses. His cross-examination of the state\u2019s expert did touch upon some of the deficiencies in the assumptions used in the probability theorem employed to calculate the 99.6 percent likelihood of paternity that the laboratory report indicated. We cannot conclude, however, from review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ing the trial transcript that the issue of judicial acceptance of the results of combined blood grouping and HLA testing as establishing the probability of paternity was fully litigated in the trial court, presumably because of the absence of an objection to such evidence on that ground. This case also presents no occa^ sion for discussion of some of the problems related to the manner of presentation of statistical probability of paternity that may arise, especially in jury cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>supra, 220. Accordingly, we limit our holding on this aspect of the case to the conclusion that the admissibility of the results from the combined blood grouping and HLA testing is not precluded by \u00a7 46b-168.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Although we hold that the trial court correctly construed General Statutes \u00a7 46b-168 not to bar the inclusive use of blood grouping and HLA test results, we address two final concerns. First, a possible reading of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is that it used the results of the HLA and blood grouping tests to find that the named parties had sexual intercourse. That memorandum states in part: \u201cThe Court after having heard all of the testimony, <em>and after a review of the exhibits, </em>finds that the Plaintiff has proven that, during the period in question, the Petitioner Sharon Moore was a single woman and that the child in question was conceived on March 4, 1978 at the Defendant\u2019s apartment <em>when the Petitioner and the Defendant engaged in sexual </em>relations.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A was Dr.. Silver\u2019s report, in which he calculated that the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s paternity is 99.6 percent. Because this probability calculation was based upon an assumption of sexual intercourse during the period of conception,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> its use in proving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>intercourse would be incorrect. In the present case, however, the defendant admitted on examination by the court that he and the plaintiff mother had engaged in sexual intercourse on the date in question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because this admission was sufficient evidence of intercourse, such an impermissible use of the test results is not at issue today.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Our final concern is whether applying the results of the HLA and blood grouping tests to show paternity may be unfair with respect to this defendant. The defendant moved for a court order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-168 requiring that he, the mother, and the child submit to blood tests. Probably, the defendant believed that the results of these tests would be admissible in evidence only to establish that he was not the father. Nevertheless, even were we to find the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute reasonable, the fact that \u00a7 46b-168 allows the court to order blood tests on motion of <em>any party </em>would render futile a decision not to apply the test results to the defendant. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the next trial, the plaintiff would be able to move for a further round of blood tests, and then to have the results admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the court did not err in applying the results of the HLA and blood grouping tests to this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Revised to See. 46b-160.

In any proceeding in which a question of paternity is an issue, the court, on motion of any party, may order the mother, her child and the putative father or the husband of the mother to submit to one or more blood grouping tests, to be made by a qualified physician or other qualified person, designated by the court, to determine whether or not the putative father or the husband of the mother can be excluded as being the father of the child.

The Court further finds that the child in question was born on December 10,1978. The court further finds that during this period when the child was conceived the Petitioner Sharon Moore did not have sexual relations with any other man. The Court further finds that the Defendant acknowledged the paternity of said child to his daughter Linda. It is further found that the child bears a striking resemblance to the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b35-5\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b35-6\"> The brief of the plaintiff-appellee mentions the enactment of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-548, allowing a paternity action to be brought \u201cat any time prior to a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday.\u201d The brief also declares that \u201cthe act, effective October 1, 1985, will relieve the Connecticut trial courts of the responsibility of determining what time limit would meet the <em>Mills </em>criteria.\u201d It thus appears that the defendant was alerted to the existence of the new statute of limitations and the claim of the plaintiff that in any subsequent proceeding in the trial court involving the paternity of the child that a remand might necessitate, the eighteen year statute of limitations would control. Obviously, if the new statute now controls the ultimate disposition of the paternity claim against the defendant, as we conclude, it would serve no useful purpose to determine whether our former three year statute is subject to the infirmities that have resulted in invalidating the one year statute in <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Habluetzel, </em>456 U.S. 91, 102 S.

The rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>sons for the proposed bill\u2019s demise are not pellucid, and therefore such demise cannot be seen as the basis for a clear inference on the question of legislative intent. Further, the Committee\u2019s distinction between blood grouping tests and tissue typing tests bolsters our own interpretation of the current statute, namely, that the restriction it places on the use of blood grouping tests does not also restrict the use of tissue typing tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> See footnote 3, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\"> The probability of paternity was calculated by the use of Bayes\u2019 Theorem which is a basic formula of probability theory. The formula makes two assumptions: (1) that the mother of the child had intercourse with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>defendant during the possible period of conception and (2) that the mother also had intercourse with another male during that period. It then describes the way test results would influence a completely rational decisionmaker\u2019s evaluation of the probability of paternity. See Lempert, \u201cModeling Relevance,\u201d 75 Mich. L. Rev. 1021, 1022-25 (1977). The formula postulates that the prior probability of paternity should be revised according to a fraction whose denominator is the likelihood of positive test results if the defendant is the father (100 percent), and whose numerator is the probability of positive results if the alleged father is not the biological father.
