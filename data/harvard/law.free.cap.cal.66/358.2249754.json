Of such consideration the sum of $631.33 was paid in money, and a memorandum due bill given for the balance. Prior to the commencement of this action, Grossini and Tiscornia assigned such due bill to the defendant Spinetti, who assigned it to the defandant Childs. Soon after entering the partnership, the plaintiff discovered that the representations made to him by his copartners, as to their financial condition, were false and fraudulent. He thereupon \u2022brought the present action to dissolve the partnership, procure a cancellation of the due bill, and for other relief. Judgment was rendered in his favor, and costs awarded against Spinetti <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>and the other defendants. Spinetti appealed from the judgment, and from an order denying him a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-4\"><em>John M. Burnett, </em>and <em>Davis Louderback, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">The defendant Spinetti was neither a proper nor necessary party, as no relief was asked or granted against him. <em>(Kerr </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>6 Wheat. 50; <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>DeGraffenreid, </em>6 Ala. 303; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Rankin, </em>3 Bibb, 86 ; <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>11 Vt. 290; <em>Petch </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>8 Price, 12; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Santa Clara Min. Co., </em>12 Md. 443; Story\u2019s Eq.

Rep. 478.) As no judgment was rendered against him, there was no authority or power to make him pay costs. Under the code system, costs are simply an incident of a judgment. <em>(Lawrence </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>22 Cal. 178 ; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Taaffe, </em>29 Cal. 424.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-6\"><em>Tilden &amp; Tilden, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\">This being an equitable action, the matter of costs rests in the discretion of the trial court. (Code Civil Proc., \u00a7 1025.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b391-8\">Thornton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">The note assigned by the defendants Grossini and Tiscornia to Spinetti was affected by fraud, and was very properly ordered to be cancelled. But as it was not negotiable without offset, and Spinetti had assigned it before action brought, we cannot see that he was either a proper or necessary party to this suit. If the note had been negotiable, and Spinet-ti had assigned it to an innocent purchaser, the case would have been different, and it would then have been proper to have made him a party. Again, no judgment for money was asked for against Spinetti or his assignee, Childs\u2014nor would any such judgment be proper. As to the note, the plaintiff only asked that it be cancelled. This he procured. It was only necessary for this purpose to have Childs, the holder of the yote when the action was begun, before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The judgment must be reversed as to' Spinetti, and the cause remanded, that it may be modified in accordance with what is here said.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>As Spinetti only appeals, the judgment will in other respects remain unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Ordered as above.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Myrick, J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
