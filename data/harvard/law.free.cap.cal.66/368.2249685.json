We have been cited to no case, controlled by the principles of the common law, that holds that the action, under such circumstances, can be maintained. It seems that under the civil law it may be; and such an action was lately sustained by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, in the case entitled <em>Marionneaux </em>v. Brugier, reported in the 16th vol. of the Reporter, p. 208. Pothier, in his work on Obligations, says : \u201c The doctrine that fathers and others shall be responsible for the acts of children under their care, which it was in their power to prevent, appears highly reasonable; but I am not aware of any case in which it is adopted in the <em>English </em>law.\u201d (Vol. 2d, page 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In <em>Tifft </em>v. <em>Tifft, </em>4 Denio, 177, a minor daughter of the defendant, in her father\u2019s absence, and without his authority or approval, willfully set his dog, not ordinarily a vicious animal, upon the plaintiff\u2019s hog, which was bitten and killed; and the court held that the father was not, but the child was, liable in damages. To the same effect are a number of cases cited in Schouler on Domestic Relations, section 263, from which he deduces the rule that a father is not liable in damages for the torts of his child, committed without his knowledge, consent, or sanction, and not in the course of his employment of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Under this rule it is quite clear that the averments of the complaint do not fix upon the defendant any liability for the damage suffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Sharpstein, J., Thornton, J., McKinstry, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b401-9\">Myrick, J., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AtQ\">I dissent. As the complaint alleges that the father willfully, carelessly, and negligently countenanced his child in having the pistol, it is sufficient to show a cause of action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
