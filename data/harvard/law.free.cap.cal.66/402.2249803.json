The company doubled the number of its shares of stock, and resolved to issue new certificates for twice the number called for by the then out-, standing certificates, which should be surrendered to the company. The defendant, for the purpose of availing herself of this privilege, delivered to J. C. Duncan her certificate of stock, with her name endorsed upon the back thereof, so as to make the title thereto pass by delivery. Duncan pledged the certificate to secure the payment of his promissory note. The pledgee had ho notice of the real ownership, and received the certificate in due course of business. The note has never been paid, and the respondent, an assignee of the original pledgee, is now the owner of it. The appeal is from a judgment in favor of plaintiff, for the recovery of the. certificate- issued in lieu of the one endorsed by the defendant to Duncan.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-10\"><em>George F. &amp; Wm.

In this case the owner <em>allowed </em>another to assume the apparent ownership of the stock. In that, the owner <em>did not allow </em>another to assume the apparent ownership. The distinction is an important one, and brings this case within the rule stated in <em>NcNeil </em>v. <em>Tenth National Bank, </em>46 N. Y. 325, cited approvingly in <em>Barstow </em>v. <em>Savage Mining Co., supra </em>( <em>Vide Ambrose </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>66 Cal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
