The contract for the work was taken by the property owners,under the provision of the street law of 1871-2. The defense relied on was that the work was not completed until after the expiration of the extension of time granted on the contract by the Board of Supervisors; and that a further extension of time in which to complete the work was unauthorized.

We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>are of opinion that this point is well taken. A party cannot for value assign a contract and assessment, and then set up the defense that they are invalid, because not in compliance with the street law. The law does not tolerate such a procedure. Having accepted a benefit under it, he cannot be heard to say that it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Myrick, J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
