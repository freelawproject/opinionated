Thereupon he obtained an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The decree dismissing the suit was a final decree, and therefore after the end of the term at which it was rendered, it could be set aside only on appeal to this court, or by the circuit court-on a bill of review. But these remedies must be pursued, if at-all, within the time limited by the statute. Hence there was no longer power in any court to set aside the decree when the application to re-instate the cause was made; and the decree refusing leave to file the petition must be affirmed. <em>Battaille </em>v. <em>Maryland Hospital for the Insane, </em>76 Va., 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Decree aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
