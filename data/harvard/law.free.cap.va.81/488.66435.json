To rebut this, the prosecution asked James Marshall (colored), the following questions: State whether or not Samuel Page told you that Beverly Howard (the prisoner), burnt Mr. Chunn\u2019s stock-yard before he, Page, was charged with stealing Mr. Anderson\u2019s chickens ? To which question the prisoner objected; but the court overruled the objection, and the prisoner excepted. The witness then answered that Page, on the day succeeding the burning, fold him that Beverly' Howard burned the property, witness giving Page\u2019s statement. The Commonwealth next, also in rebuttal, asked the same question of Alfred Mars, who made a similar answer to that of Marshall. To all which the prisoner objected, and the court overruling the objection, the prisoner excepted,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-7\"><em>Ro. R.

Crim. Law, section 820; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Doug. 242; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>77 Va. 590. Hence, if the witnesses, Marshall and Mars, had been introduced for the purpose of confirming the testimony of Page given by him on the trial, the objection of the prisoner would be well founded; for in that view the evidence would have been hearsay, and, consequently, inadmissible. But such was not the case. Here the attempt by the defence was to discredit the witness by showing malice on his part, growing out of his arrest for larceny. And to repel the attack thus made, it was competent for the prosecution to prove that prior to his arrest, the witness gave the same account of the matter that he gave on the trial. The evidence was, therefore, not hearsay, but original, the point being not as to the truth or falsity of the previous declarations out of court, but whether they had been made. 1 Greenl. Ev., sec. 100, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In <em>Robb </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>23 Wend. 50, Bronson, J., states the rule thus: \u201cIf an attempt is made to discredit the witness on the ground that his testimony is given under the influence of some motive prompting him to make a false or colored statement, the party calling him has been allowed to show, in reply, that the witness made similar declarations at a time when the imputed motive did not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The evidence was, therefore, properly admitted by the county court, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
