This action was brought to recover for these services in addition to his compensation as clerk, and resulted in a verdict of a jury in justice\u2019s court for the full amount of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> An appeal was taken to the County Court, where the judgment was reversed; the learned trial court handing down a memorandum from which it appears that his controlling thought was that it was error to permit certain hearsay evidence to remain in the case, after objection and a motion to strike out. There can be no doubt of the correctness of the learned County Court upon this point, and, while many other interesting points are suggested, we deem it unprofitable to pursue the discussion at this time, except to suggest that in actions of this character it should be made to plainly appear that there is a legal obligation on the part of the municipality. In this case, as to the most important services, it is very doubtful whether the village of Patchogue had any authority to authorize the expenditure for the so-called re-recording of vital statistics, or the indexing of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> No duty rests upon the village clerk to record these statistics in the first instance \u2014 that is the duty of the clerk of the board of health \u2014 and the so-called re-recording would not amount to a recording at all; only the original entries of the clerk of the board of health would be of use in any event, and just why the taxpayers should be burdened for making a copy of such statistics does not clearly appear to us at this time. At any rate, the case contains the fatal error mentioned by the court below, and the judgment of the County Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">JENKS, P. J\u201e and CARR and RICH, JJ., concur. THOMAS, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
