KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuB\">(dissenting). Where a defendant is admitted to bail, he is supposed to be in the custody of his surety, and the responsibility of the surety is gouged in great part by that consideration. In this case the plaintiff had actually attached $1,920 in cash, which upon the execution of the bond in question the law required to- be released. It may fairly be considered to have been turned over to the custody of the surety or at his request upon his promise to refund it if a refund was required. I think it is not such a conditional promise as is referred to in People v. Commercial Alliance L. Ins. Co., 154 N. Y. 95, 47 N. E. 968, but is a promise to repay the money which has been surrendered on its account when required. I therefore favor a reversal of the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
