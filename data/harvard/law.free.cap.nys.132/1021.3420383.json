The relief demanded is that defendants account for the consideration received on the sale of the land to the purchaser procured by the plaintiff, and, if it be shown on the accounting that they received more than $12,000, they be decreed to pay to the plaintiff one-half of the excess, in so far as the same may be in money, and to assign to the plaintiff one-half the excess consideration, if any, received in other property. The demurrer is upon the ground that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">We are of opinion that the court erred in overruling the demurrer. It is not shown that the plaintiff has not an adequate remedy at law. On the facts alleged no accounting is required. There was no fiduciary relation between the parties and no joint venture. Plaintiff had no interest in the property. He merely was to receive for his services one-half the consideration received by defendants after the deduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>$12,000. On these allegations one-half of the consideration over said sum belongs to plaintiff, and, if he needs and is entitled to the intervention of a court of equity to obtain possession of or title to it, he should allege the requisite facts. It is only necessary for the plaintiff to show what consideration was received, and, if it was received in money and is .in excess of $12,000, he would be entitled to recover one-half of such excess. If any part of the excess consideration received was property other than money, the plaintiff would, on the facts alleged, be entitled to recover one-half thereof. \u2022 It is not shown whether any of the consideration was received in property other than money. If part of the consideration was other property which has no market value, it was incumbent on plaintiff to allege the facts upon which a court of equity might decree specific performance of the agreement of the defendants to deliver one-half thereof in excess of the amo'unt agreed to be deducted; and, if part of the consideration was property with which plaintiff could only be vested with legal title to one-half or to. a one-half interest by a formal assignment, the complaint should show the facts bringing the case within the cognizance of a court of equity. An examination of defendants to enable plaintiff to frame his complaint would have revealed facts showing whether plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law or requires the aid of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-3\">It follows, therefore, that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed with costs to appellant, and the demurrer sustained with costs, but with leave to plaintiff to amend on payment of the costs in this court.and at Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and CLARKE and MILLER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1047-5\">SCOTT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5V\">I dissent. The contract as plaintiff alleges it is that defendant would deliver to him in specie one-half of the gross consideration received for the land, over and above a given sum. It is not a contract for the payment of money alone. I think that the case, falls within the principle of Marston v. Gould, 69 N. Y. 220, and Marvin v. Brooks, 94 N. Y. 71.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
