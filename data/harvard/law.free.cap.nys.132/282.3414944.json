There is no evidence to support the finding that the judgment creditor has suffered any actual loss or damage, and the order must be reversed, on the authority of Ross v. La Cagnina, 68 Misc. Rep. 497, 124 N. Y. Supp. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We have not overlooked that in the case of Roos v. Treubig, 125 N. Y. Supp. 782, this court under similar circumstances, instead of reversing the order, modified it, by imposing a fine of $250 and costs. It seems to us that, where the amount of the fine is based upon an erroneous finding of actual loss and damage, this court should not undertake to fix the amount of the fine. The Special Term has the right in its discretion to determine the amount of the fine where no actual loss is shown, and the appellate court has no right to substitute its own discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
