A copy of the certificate of conviction was annexed to the petition, which shows that the relator was charged with petit larceny, and that \u201cthereupon pleaded guilty, and having been thereupon tried and upon such trial duly convicted, it is adjudged that said Edward Gainance be confined at the Albany county penitentiary at hard labor for the term of 180 days.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b963-19\">It appeared by the affidavit filed by the relator in support of the petition that the petit larceny was not charged as a first offense.

Laws 1909, c. 43]) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-6\">\u2018The superintendent of state prisons, the superintendents, managers and officers of all reformatories and penitentiaries in the state, shall, so far as practicable, cause all the prisoners in said institutions, who are physically capable thereof to be employed at hard labor, for not to exceed eight hours of each day other than Sundays and public holidays.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">It is evident therefore that the provision, in the judgment of conviction, for hard labor, did not increase the punishment and was not in excess of the jurisdiction or power of the court. That such a provision cannot render the judgment void or be reviewed on habeas corpus is too plain a proposition to admit of argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It may also be observed that the conviction was valid and the relator was not entitled to be discharged because, in the information, the crime of petit larceny was not charged as a first offense. It was held in People v. Cook, 45 Hun, 34, that it was not essential to the jurisdiction of a court of Special Sessions, in a case of petit larceny, that the information or the warrant should allege that the crime charged is a first offense. The same doctrine was asserted in People v. Johnston, 112 App. Div. 812, 99 N. Y. Supp. 411, where Mr. Justice Chester said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-9\">\u201cIf it be a first offense in fact, the court has jurisdiction to try the case, and it is to be deemed a first offense unless the contrary is charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">It follows that the order discharging the relator should be reversed, the writ dismissed, and the relator remanded to the sheriff of Albany county, and! the judgment of conviction carried into effect. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
