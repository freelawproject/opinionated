Issue was joined October, 1901. Plaintiff had judgment February 17, 1902. Upon appeal to this court said judgment was reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event December 5, 1902. Plaintiff failed to proceed with the action, and by order of July 10, 1911, the Special Term granted a motion to dismiss upon the ground of want of prosecution, \u201cwith all taxable costs and disbursements to defendants to date, together with $10 costs of this motion.\u201d Thereupon defendants served a bill of costs and gave notice of taxation. The plaintiff did not appear, but the clerk disallowed $15 costs after notice of trial, $30 trial fee, issue of fact, $50 for five term fees. A motion for retaxation was denied by the Special Term, and defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">The three items disallowed were taxed to the plaintiff when it got its judgment. Therefore the propriety of the items as taxable was established. The defendants were allowed all taxable costs to date. They were therefore entitled to these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-16\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the clerk directed to allow the items stricken out and retax the bill accordingly, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
