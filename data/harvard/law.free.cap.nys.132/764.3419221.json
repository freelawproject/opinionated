The appeal is taken under section 311 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, c. 580), on the ground that the defendant was not served with process. The defendant swears that she was not served. An affidavit of the defendant\u2019s husband is submitted, which corroborates the defendant\u2019s statement. Against these affidavits is a statement made by one Casey that he served the summons in this action on the defendant. This statement was not sworn to before a notary public authorized to act in New York county.
