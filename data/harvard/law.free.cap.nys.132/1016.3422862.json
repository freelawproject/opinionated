The petition is in regular form, and alleges title in fee in an undivided two-thirds of the premises in question to be in the petitioners. The respondents are alleged to be \u201csquatters\u201d upon the property, and the proceedings are instituted under subdivision 4 of section 2232 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for the removal by summary proceedings of a person from real property\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-16\">\u201c.where he, or the person to whom he has succeeded, has intruded into, or squatted upon, any real property, without the permission of the person entitled to the possession thereof, and the occupancy, thus commenced, has. continued without permission from the latter.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-17\">The answer denies the allegations of the petition, excepting that it admits that respondents are in possession of a part of the premises in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-18\">The petitioners\u2019 title to the property is-alleged in the petition to-,be derived from the state. In support of their claim, a certain document, referred to in the minutes as \u201cletters patent,\u201d was offered .in-evidence and excluded under the respondents\u2019 general objection. There is nothing showing the propriety of such exclusion, nor is any reason disclosed for the refusal of the court to receive evidence of the petitioners\u2019 title to the property. Upon the exclusion of the document the proceedings were dismissed on motion of the respondents. The exclusion of the documentary evidence of the petitioners\u2019 title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>in the absence of any claim or proof of a defect in it, was clearly error, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
