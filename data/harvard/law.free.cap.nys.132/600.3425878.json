About October 30, 1908, it entered into a contract with defendant to sell and deliver to him a soda water fountain. At the time of the sale the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">\u201cNo foreign stock corporation doing business in this state shall maintain any action in this state under any contract made by it in this state unless prior to the making of such contract it shall have procured such certificate.\u201d General Corporation Law (Gen. Laws, c. 35 [Laws 1890, c. 563], as re-enacted by Laws 1892, c. 687, \u00a7 15, as amended Laws 1901, cc. 96, 538; Laws 1904, c. 490.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">The certificate referred to must be procured from the Secretary of State, and must be to the effect that such corporation, if other than a moneyed corporation, has complied with all the requirements of law to authorize it to do business in this state, and that the business of the corporation to be carried on in this state is such as may be lawfully carried on by a corporation incorporated under the laws of this state for such or similar business. Id. section 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> Before the obtaining of such certificate becomes a material fact in connection with such an action, two things must concur: The corporation must be a foreign stock corporation doing business in this state, and the contract which is the basis of the action must have been made within this state. If the existence of these conditions precedent appears upon the face of the complaint, then such complaint is demurrable, unless it contains a further allegation that.the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>sions of the statute above referred to have been complied with. Welsbach Co. v. Norwich Gas &amp; El. Co., 96 App. Div. 52, 89 N. Y. Supp. 284, affirmed 180 N. Y. 533, 72 N. E. 1152; Wood &amp; Seliclc v. Ball, 190 N. Y. 217, 83 N. E. 21. If this does not appear, this necessity does not exist. In such case, until the contrary is shown, it must be presumed that the contract was not made within this state, and that the corporation is not doing business here. Otherwise the requirements of the statute would be extended to every foreign stock corporation seeking to enforce a cause of action in our courts. Southworth v. Morgan, 143 App. Div. 648, 128 N. Y. Supp. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The learned justice of the Municipal Court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint upon the ground that the contract sued upon was made within this state. Upon the evidence adduced this is a debatable-question, but if we assume, for the sake of the argument, that such is the fact, 'plaintiff should not have been dismissed, for it affirmatively appears that it was not doing business within this state. So far as the evidence discloses, this is the only transaction in the nature of a sale in which plaintiff had engaged within this state. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The preliminary negotiations for the purchase and sale of the soda fountain were had between defendant and one Gleichenhaus. These negotiations were had at an office at No. 403 Broome street, in the borough of Manhattan. Gleichenhaus\u2019 undisputed testimony is that plaintiff paid nothing for the maintenance of this office. That upon the office sign his name appeared in large letters at the top, and that below, in letters of a smaller size, appeared the words \u201cSanitary Soda Fountain,\u201d \u201cAcorn Brass Manufacturing Company,\u201d \u201cSoda Fountain Appliances,\u201d and \u201cSoda Fountains.\u201d At this office he had \u201cfive soda fountain samples, and small articles, a good many of them.\u201d It does not clearly appear whether all of these sample fountains were of plaintiff\u2019s manufacture, but the witness testified that plaintiff had no goods there, and that he was then engaged in selling soda fountains and different things fyr other concerns. The only testimony as to whether plaintiff had an office in New York, or a bank account there, was negative testimony from this witness that he did not know of any. Plaintiff\u2019s principal office was in Chicago, and their goods were manufactured there.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">On the day in question, at this office, defendant signed a paper, partly written and partly printed, entitled \u201cOrder Blank,\u201d which was addressed to plaintiff at Chicago, 111., and requested it to ship to him via Michigan Central Railroad, at an address given in Astoria, U. I., a soda fountain, describing it. The paper stated that the price was to be $428.50, and that inclosed with the paper was a check for $85.20, part of the purchase price. It contained provisions for the payment of the. balance in monthly installments, commencing'January 15, 1909. This paper was not signed by the plaintiff, or by any one in its behalf. When this paper was signed, defendant delivered same with a check to Gleichenhaus, who forwarded it to plaintiff at Chicago, and never saw it again until the date of the trial. Some time later the fountain was shipped to defendant, and defendant signed notes for the payments to become due, secured by a chattel mortgage on it. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>notes and mortgage were signed at the same place and sent to plaintiff at Chicago by Gleichenhaus, who testified that he had never seen them subsequently. He testified that he received \u201chis profit\u201d on the sale of the fountain, and it appeared that there was an agreement in writing between the plaintiff and the witness relative to his compensation for selling their goods, but this agreement was not produced nor offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The following authorities sustain the position that we have taken, that, under the circumstances here disclosed, the plaintiff was not doing business within this state: Vaughn Machine Co: v. Lighthouse, 64 App. Div. 138, 71 N. Y. Supp. 799; Cummer Lumber Co. v. Associated Mfr\u2019s Ins. Co., 67 App. Div. 151, 73 N. Y. Supp. 668; St. Albans Beef Co. v. Aldridge, 112 App. Div. 803, 99 N. Y. Supp. 398; E. T. Burrowes Co. v. Caplin, 127 App. Div. 317, 111 N. Y. Supp. 498; J. L. White Furnace Co. v. C. W. Miller Transfer Co., 131 App. Div. 559, 115 N. Y. Supp. 625; Penn Collieries Co. v. McKeever, 183 N. Y. 98, 75 N. E. 935, 2 L. R.A. (N. S.) 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The judgment of the Municipal Court should be re-versed and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
