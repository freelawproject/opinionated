The case was submitted to the jury upon a charge fairly presenting the law, and from the judgment entered upon the verdict the defendant appeals to this court, as well as from the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s driver was driving along Third avenue just as darkness was settling down on the evening of November 14, 1908. It was raining and foggy, and plaintiff\u2019s horse was not getting a good footing on the asphalt pavement. The driver looked to the rear, as he testifies, and saw no car. He then pulled his horse about so as to drive diagonally across the defendant\u2019s tracks, intending to get upon the south-bound track, and to make use of the Medina sandstone pavement between the tracks for his horse\u2019s greater safety in traveling. Just how far plaintiff\u2019s driver proceeded after making his first observation does not clearly appear, but from the evidence the inference could be fairly drawn that he made rather an abrupt turn in the direction of the track and drove a considerable distance, 50 to 70 feet, diagonally with, the track, and had nearly cleared^ the north-bound track on which the defendant\u2019s nor was approaching from the rear when the back wheel of his wagon was struck by the defendant\u2019s car, resulting in the demolishing of the wagon, the injury of the harness, and the maiming of the horse so that it became necessary to kill him. The car appears to have been riming at a high rate of speed, and it did not stop until it had traveled nearly a block beyond the scene of the accident, though this may have been due to the injuries resulting to the controller of the car in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> We think, under all of the facts testified to, a question was presented for the jury upon the negligence of the defendant, as well as to the contributory negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s driver. From the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses the plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon must have been within the direct line of vision of the defendant\u2019s motorman while the plaintiff was driving 50 to 75 feet, and the plaintiff\u2019s equipage had nearly cleared the track at the extreme distance when the\" collision occurred. There must have been a considerable length of time between the time that the plaintiff\u2019s wagon came into view of the motorman and the collision, time enough to have slackened the pace of the car at least, and yet there is not the slightest evidence of any action on ,the part of the defendant to avert the accident, except that it is in the evidence that the bell of the approaching car was sounded just at the instant before the contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> While it was the duty of plaintiff\u2019s driver to use reasonable care to give the defendant the right of way, he had a right to assume that the defendant would operate its cars with a reasonable degree of care, and having looked for an approaching car before entering upon the defendant\u2019s tracks, and no car being in sight, he had a right to expect that he would be given some warning of an approaching car after he had come within the view of the operator of such car. Highways are for the use of the general public, and each user owes the duty of reasonable care. The plaintiff\u2019s driver was not bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>watch behind him all of the time. He was obviously upon the track with a view to crossing. He had observed that the way was clear when he started, the way was slippery and he was trying to avoid that danger; and, if the defendant had used a reasonable degree of care, it is obvious that the accident need not have occurred. At least this view of the evidence was within the province of the jury, and we think its conclusions should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> We do not find reversible error in the charge. The court refused to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-6\">\u201cIf the jury find that Schroeder, the driver, drove 70 feet after looking, and did not look again until he was in a point of danger or on the track, at this time and place, knowing the danger of the situation and being familiar with the conditions there existing, and that cars come frequently, without making any effort to ascertain whether the car was approaching behind him, and that contributed to the accident, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">This language follows closely that which was refused, affording grounds for reversal, in Belford v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 86 App. Div. 388, 390, 83 N. Y. Supp. 836, but there the evidence showed that the driver had been upon the defendant\u2019s tracks for a distance of 800 feet or more, and- that he had not only not looked at all, but that, so far as the evidence went, he had not listened or made use of any of his faculties to ascertain whether a car was approaching or not. Here there was affirmative evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s driver looked back to see if a car was approaching when he turned to cross the tracks, that he saw no car at the time; and that he then attempted to drive diagonally over the north-bound track to the south-bound track, and that he had nearly cleared the north-bound track when the collision came. This could not have taken many seconds, for the evidence in the extreme only fixes his forward movement at about 75 feet, during the most of which time he must have been in plain view of the approaching car. This is quite a different situation from that involved in the Belford Case, where the accident occurred late at night, and the plaintiff had entered upon the track and driven there for 800 feet without making any effort whatever to ascertain whether a car was approaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
