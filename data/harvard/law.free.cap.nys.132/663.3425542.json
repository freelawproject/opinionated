This was decided, in line with the authorities cited, in Dexter &amp; Northern Railroad Co. v. Foster, 142 App. Div. 240, 126 N. Y. Supp. 835, and Matter of City of New York, 129 App. Div. 929, 114 N. Y. Supp. 681. The granting of a privilege to the plaintiff to bring in all of the owners whose property is to be acquired in a single proceeding ought not to deprive the individual defendants of their right to have that just compensation which the Constitution requires, and which contemplates that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant the cost sustained by him in defending his rights, except in those cases where the defendant fails to secure an award equal to the amount which has been offered him for the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the matter should be remitted to the Special Term for adjustment in harmony with this opinion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
