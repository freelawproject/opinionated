J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au7\">This is an action for the recovery of broker\u2019s commissions upon the sale of realty. The defendant sought to prove that, prior to the communication of the plaintiff to her that plaintiff had found a purchaser, the defendant had affirmed a sale made through another broker. But she was prevented by various general objections, which were sustained by the court under exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">It did not appear that the employment of the plaintiff was exclusive. Therefore evidence that tended to show that, before the plaintiff produced her customer, the defendant in good faith had accepted a pur chaser, produced by another broker, was relevant to the issue of the defendant's liability. Ettinghoff v. Horowitz, 115 App. Div. 571, 100 N. Y. Supp. 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial must be ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
