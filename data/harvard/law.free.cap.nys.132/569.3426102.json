The plaintiff swears that she is \u201cpossessed of no property whatever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>except that she receives the income of a trust fund of $15,000, given to her under her father\u2019s will, and aside from this she has no income whatsoever, except such as her mother may give her out of charity.\u201d The defendant answers this statement by showing that the plaintiff has also the income of a trust fund of $10,250.19, and was entitled to receive from her father\u2019s estate the sum of $2,914.24 as accumulated income under a surrogate\u2019s decree, dated October 15, 1910, and, in addition, that she was apparently seised of an undivided one-half interest in real property in Nassau county which was valued in 1907 at the sum of $36,000 for tax purposes. The plaintiff submitted no further affidavit answering or explaining this statement of alleged facts. Under these circumstances, no counsel fee should have been allowed, as there was no sufficient proof of its necessity. Lake v. Lake, 194 N. Y. 179, 87 N. E. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\">The order should be reversed and the motion for a counsel fee denied, without prejudice to a renewal of the motion on further facts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
