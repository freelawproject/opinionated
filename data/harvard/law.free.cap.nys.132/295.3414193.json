Thereafter the plaintiff moved for a substitution of attorneys, alleging no misconduct against his original attorney, and offering to pay him the amount of his disbursements. The original attorney asked the court that, if an order be entered substituting another attorney, the same provide for the payment of his disbursements, and that some provision be made in said order to protect his lien upon any verdict, decision, or judgment hereinafter procured by the plaintiff to the extent of $225. The trial justice then entered an order providing for a substitution upon payment of the disbursements. The order also contained a provision that the original attorney \u201chave a lien on any recovery had herein upon the cause of action set forth in the complaint to the extent of $225.\u201d The plaintiff appeals from this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">It is not seriously disputed that the attorney is entitled to a lien for the compensation to which he may be entitled for his services. He is not entitled, however, to compensation under the written contract. The attorney is bound \"to entire performance, and cannot recover under the contract until he has obtained the money on deposit. Roake v. Palmer, 119 App. Div. 64, 103 N. Y. Supp. 862; Johnson v. Ravitch, 113 App. Div. 810, 99 N. Y. Supp. 1059.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\">\u201cWhile the attorney is thus bound to entire performance, and the contract as to him is treated as an entire contract, it is a singular feature of the law that it should not be treated as an entire contract upon the other side; for it is- held that a client may discharge his attorney arbitrarily without any cause at any time, and be liable to pay him only for the services which he has rendered up to the present time.\u201d Tenney v. Berger, 93 N. Y. 524, at page 529 (45 Am. Rep. 263).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In this case there is no evidence of the value of the services up to the present time, and no reason appears why these services should have been appraised after a dismissal of the complaint at the same amount which the parties agreed should be paid only if the proceedings were carried to a successful termination. Upon the affidavits presented, the order should have contained a provision that the lien of the at-, torney for the value of his services should be preserved, the amount of the lien to be fixed either by the court or the referee, if the plaintiff ever secured a judgment in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">The order, so far as appealed from, should be reversed, with $10' costs and disbursements, and the proceedings remitted to the court below for further action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
