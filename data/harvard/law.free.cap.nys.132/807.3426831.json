Copies of each publication must be forwarded same day adv. appears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-21\">\u201cYours very truly, Albert Frank <em>&amp; </em>Co., per F. R.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">After certain insertions had been made, defendant undertook to cancel the order. .Plaintiff denied defendant\u2019s right so to do, and now sues for the full amount stated in the order, less a sum conceded to have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>The order being for a definite and fixed sum and for a specific number of - advertisements or insertions, it must be deemed, in view of the language used, to have been accepted in toto by the commencement of the advertisement, and that plaintiff thereby undertook to complete it. Having become a binding bilateral contract, defendant could not cancel it without plaintiff\u2019s consent. The part performance of an order for a definite number of insertions and for a definite amount necessarily implies an acceptance and an agreement to complete, as, unless completed, nothing would be earned. Mendell v. Willyoung, 42 Misc. Rep. 210, 85 N. Y. Supp. 647; Humphreys Mfg. Co. v. David Williams Co., 70 Misc. Rep. 354, 128 N. Y. Supp. 680. Cases such as White v. Allen Kingston Motor Car Co., 69 Misc. Rep. 627, 126 N. Y. Supp. 150, are not in conflict with-this rule, as there the part performance implied only an acceptance of the offer to pay according to the insertions. See per curiam opinion in North Side News Co. v. Michael Cypres, 132 N. Y. Supp. 806 (present term).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
