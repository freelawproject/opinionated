He has recovered judgment for the injuries thereby sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> He testified that, before starting to cross the street, he saw the defendant\u2019s automobile approaching rapidly. The automobile was then about 200 feet away according to the plaintiff, but apparently somewhat closer according to other testimony produced by him.' If the defendant had rested at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial justice could not have directed a verdict for the plaintiff; for it is \u00e1 question,of fact for the jury whether or not, under the circumstances, the plaintiff showed reasonable care in leaving a place of safety and proceeding across the street without regard to the approaching automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant did, however, introduce other evidence, which, if true, negatived both his own negligence and the absence of contributory negligence of the plaintiff. The issues to be considered by the jury were not only those raised by the conflict of testimony, but, even if they believed the plaintiff, they were still bound to consider whether under the circumstances he acted as a reasonably prudent man. In a similar case (Netterfield v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 129 App. Div. 56, 113 N. Y. Supp. 434) it was held that it was fatal error for the trial justice to refuse to charge that, even if the accident happened in the manner testified to by the plaintiff and his witnesses, the verdict may be for the defendant. In the case under consideration the trial justice refused the same request, and his error, in my opinion, requires that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
