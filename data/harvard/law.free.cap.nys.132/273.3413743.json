She joined, as defendants, the owner of the building and the tenant of the cellar, and recovered judgment against both.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">It appears that the tenant, having occasion to go into the cellar, opened the two iron doors, which formed the cover to the stairway, and left them standing upright, but hooked together by an iron bar. While the plaintiff was standing on the sidewalk beside the cellar entrance, both doors fell from their upright position to the sidewalk, and she was struck by the one nearest to her. It is not questioned that the doors, when closed, formed part of the sidewalk, and were entirely sufficient for that purpose; but it is urged that the landlord, by failing to provide a device which would have held them securely in position when open, was chargeable with the maintenance of a nuisance, and was therefore properly held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">I do not think the contention sound. There was nothing the matter with the doors, so long as they remained closed. When and how they should be opened, and whether, when opened, they should be left upright, or laid back flat, and, if upright, how they should be guarded, were matters entirely within the control of the tenant. In the present case, he chose to leave them standing upright and insecurely fastened, and the injury is chargeable solely to his negligence. Opper v. Hellinger, 116 App. Div. 261, 101 N. Y. Supp. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The judgment, as against the defendant King, should be reversed, with costs, and judgment directed dismissing the complaint, as against him, upon the merits, with costs, since the record shows that no judgment could properly be taken against him upon a new trial. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
