For their services in negotiating the loan \u00e1nd examining the title they were to receive $100. After such examination, they refused to carry out'the agreement, asserting that defendant\u2019s title to the premises was defective. Thereafter this action was brought to recover the sum which defendant had agreed to pay,'and from a judgment in-plaintiffs\u2019 favor this appeal is taken. \u2022. . . -</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">In April, 1903, Norman B.'Randall, Francena Randall, and Thurber L. Randall were the owners of record of the property referred to. Upon the trial defendant produced a paper purporting to be a deed from them. The certificate of acknowledgment indorsed thereon was in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-18\">\u201cState of Rhode Island, County of Providence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-19\">\u201cIn Providence on the sixteenth day of April A. D., 1903, before me personally appeared Norman B. Randall, . Francena Randall, and Thurber L. Randall to me known and known by me to be the parties executing the foregoing instrument, and acknowledged said instrument by them executed to be their free act and deed. Henry F. Thompson, Notary. Public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Plaintiffs contend that this acknowledgment is not sufficient to entitle this deed to be recorded. If that contention is well founded, this judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> A material provision of the statute expressly required to be stated in a certificate of acknowledgment cannot be wholly disregarded, and a deed thus acknowledged lawfully admitted to record. Irving v. Campbell, 121 N. Y. 354, 24 N. E. 821, 8 L. R. A. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The fact that this instrument was recorded is of no avail if it was not entitled to be recorded.. Record under such circumstances is not evidence of the due execution thereof. Bradley v. Walker, 138 N. Y. 291, 33 N. E. 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The fact that the original dead was produced by defendant does not relieve the situation, for, if improperly acknowledged, it could not be read in evidence without further proof of the signature of the parties thereto. Bradley v. Walker, supra. Such proof was not furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The real property law in force when this deed purports to have been executed provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201cA conveyance of real property, within the state, on being duly acknowledged by the person executing the same, or proved as required by this chapter, and such acknowledgment or proof duly certified when required by this chapter, may be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county where such real property is situated.\u201d Gen. Laws, c. 46 (Laws 1896, c. 547, \u00a7 241).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">After designating those officers who should be -authorized to take the acknowledgment or proof of a conveyance of real property within this state, in other states of the United States, or in foreign countries, the statute then prescribed as a requisite- to the exercise of such authority by the officers named that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">' \u201cAn acknowledgment must not be taken by any officer unless he knows or has satisfactory evidence, that the person making it is the person described in and who executed such instrument.\u201d Id. \u00a7 252</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The statute also provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">\u201cAn officer taking the acknowledgment or proof of a conveyance must indorse thereupon or attach thereto, a certificate, signed by himself, stating all the matters required\u00bb to be done, known or proved on the taking of such acknowledgment or proof.\u201d Id. \u00a7 255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">The first thing to be done is the acknowledgment of the instrument' \u201cby the person executing the same.\u201d This acknowledgment, however, must be \u201cin the manner required by the statute.\u201d The thing.to be known is the identity of the person making the acknowledgment with the person described in the instrument and the person who executed the same. This knowledge must be possessed by the official. The final act is the including in a certificate a statement of the things done and the knowledge possessed. This certificate must embrace both acts and knowledge. This act is the act of the official. Unless, therefore, .it follows that a person who asserts before -the .acknowledging officer that he has executed an instrument then present' is-necessarily the,same person who has been \u25a0 described in it.as a .party,'.thereto;-, this certificate of acknowledgment .is defective. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>statement of the proposition, as it seems to us, furnishes the answer. Even though there may be identity of name between the individual described and the individual who acknowledged that he executed, it does not follow that there is identity of'person. In our large cities particularly there are many persons who bear not only the same surname, but the same Christian name. Realizing this, the whole trend of recent legislation has been in the direction of more complete identification of the persons described in a deed. The form suggested in the present real property law provides that the residence of both grantor and grantee shall be inserted therein. Consol. Laws, c. 50; Laws 1909, c. 52, \u00a7 257. At the present time, before a deed may be recorded, not only the residence of the purchaser, but if in a city of over 500,000 inhabitants, the street number of such residence shall be stated therein, and such residence and street number recorded with the conveyance. Real Property Law, supra, as amended Laws 1910, c. 227, \u00a7 333. Appellant contends that the parties described in this deed as the grantors therein are Norman B. Randall and others; that they are therein described as the parties of the first part; that the attestation clause reads, \u201cIn witness whereof', the parties of the first part have hereunto set their hands and seals,\u201d etc. Hence he argues that the parties of the first part are necessarily both the parties described in and who executed, and as the notary certifies that he knew the parties who appeared before him to be the parties who executed, as things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other, this is equivalent to a statement by him that he knew them both as the parties described in and the parties who executed the deed. The reasoning is fallacious. The deed may assert that the parties are the same. There is no evidence that the notary knew this assertion to be correct, and he has not certified to that fact. The statute calls for his knowledge on the subject, included in such certificat\u00e9, and not an assertion of the parties contained in the deed itself. In Paolillo v. Faber, 56 App. Div. 241, 67 N. Y. Supp. 638, this court in the First Department condemned a certificate of acknowledgment as fatally defective where the recital was \u201cbefore me came Joseph A. Thompson, to me personally known,\u201d etc. The name of the grantor in the deed was the same as that of the person who made the acknowledgment. If such similarity of name may be deemed sufficient, then this certificate would be a compliance with the statute. In Freedman v. Oppenheim, 80 App. Div. 487, 81 N. Y. Supp. 110, this court in this department condemned a certificate where the recital was \u201cpersonally appeared before me the within named James Monroe Cruser, to me known and acknowledged the above letter of attorney to be his act and deed.\u201d The \u201cwithin named\u201d might be equivalent to the \u201cperson described in.\u201d But, if in that case it was not sufficient to certify that the person described in was the person who appeared and made the acknowledgment, without certifying also that he was the person who executed the instrument, the converse must be true. It is not sufficient to certify that the person who appeared and made the acknowledgment was the person executing, without also certifying that he was the person described in said instrument.
