Laws 1909, c. 50), pursuant to the provisions of which this action was brought, was repealed, and that, if not so repealed, the Code amendment affords an adequate remedy at law, without previous resort to which the present action is not maintainable. The Code amendment alluded to did not in terms repeal section 98 of the real property law, and nothing said in Brearley School v. Ward (201 N. X. 358, 94 N. E. 1001) justifies the court\u2019s postulate by the learned counsel for the defendants as favoring the view that a repeal resulted by implication. The question was not before the court, and the reasoning of the opinion is applicable strictly to the point decided \u2014 that there is no constitutional impediment in the way of the retroactive operation of the Code amendment. Repeal by implication is not favored (People ex rel. ICingsland v. Palmer, 52 N. X. 83), and the absence of an express repeal gives rise to the presumption that no repeal was intended (Arzonica v. Board of Education, of the Town of West New 'York, 75 N. J. Law, 21, 22, 69 Atl. 450).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-10\">\u201cIt is only when it clearly appears from the later statute that it was designed to take the place of a former one that a repeal will be held to have resulted (City of Buffalo v. Lewis, 192 N. X. 193, 200, 84 N. E. 809); and, since the Code amendment is not necessarily in conflict with the real property law, an intention to repeal the latter is not reasonably to be inferred. The Code amendment which authorizes the collection by execution of 10 per centum of a trust income was intended to apply to all incomes irrespective of whether or not the income was more than' sufficient to provide for the debtor\u2019s maintenance, while the real property law applies only to the surplus of the income remaining after satisfying the reasonable needs of the cestui que trust\u2019s maintenance. Public policy, as expressed by legislation in this state, has been to remove rather than to increase restraints upon the alienation of property, and it seems unreasonable, therefore, to attribute to the Legislature, when enacting the Code amendment, a design to protect a debtor possessed of the means of paying his debt in his refusal so to do, or ,to countenance his preference to pay the debt in installments while his means will enable him to pay it in full, or in a shorter time at least than his inclination would approve of. The Code amendment authorizes the application of a part of the income as it accrues towards the payment of the cestui que trust\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>debts without regard to the needs of his maintenance, and the real property law subjects all of the income not required for the reasonable needs of the debtor\u2019s maintenance to the same end. The plain intention of the Legislature was, when enacting the Code amendment, nothing more than to compel the application by the debtor entitled to a trust income of a certain proportion thereof towards the payment of his debt whether the income is sufficient for his maintenance or not, leaving a creditor to his choice of remedies where the income is more than enough to satisfy the debtor\u2019s reasonable needs of maintenance and the surplus is sufficient to pay the debt in full,, or within a shorter period of time, at least, than if the debt was sought to be satisfied by execution. The two remedies are not necessarily inconsistent, and should, therefore, be held to be concurrent. Arzonica v. Board of Education of the Town of West New York, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> \u201cTo defeat a creditor\u2019s action of the kind under discussion, it is not enough that there may be a remedy at law which may be adequate in some or even in most cases, but it should appear that the remedy at law is adequate to the particular case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> \u201cIts inadequacy to the case at bar is very apparent. It is not only the plaintiff\u2019s right, and justice so imperatively demands, assuming the defendant judgment debtor\u2019s ability to pay, that the farmer\u2019s judgment be satisfied without unnecessary delay, and it is self-evident from the pleadings that, if the plaintiffs are compelled to resort to the means afforded by the Code of collecting their judgment by execution against the defendant judgment debt- or\u2019s trust income, the judgment will not be satisfied within 12 years. The trust income ends upon the debtor\u2019s death, and the judgment may therefore never be fully satisfied. It is alleged in the complaint, and admitted by the demurrer, that the trust income is $35,000 per year, and that the judgment sought to be enforced in this action is upwards of $44,000, which sum, with interest compounded at the rate of 6 per centum per annum, will double itself in 11 years and 327 days \u2014 say 12 years. Within that period of time $3,500 per annum with interest compounded at the same rate will produce as follows: Principal, $42,000; interest, $21,600; in all $63,210. It is certain, therefore, that, if the plaintiffs seek to collect their judgment by execution, it would require far above 12 years\u2019 time to do so, and the foregoing computations make no allowance for the.reasonably certain expenses which will attend the collection, such as sheriff\u2019s fees, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">\u201cThe demurrer is overruled, with costs, with leave to the defendants to answer within 20 days upon payment of costs.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b537-7\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
