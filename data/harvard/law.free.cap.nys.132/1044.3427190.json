The answer of the defendant Lizzie Etkin is in effect a general denial. On the trial the plaintiff was the only witness. He testified, in so far as material to the question presented for decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>that he and the defendant Louis Etkin, the husband of the other defendant, made a paroi agreement to become copartners in the business of making cloaks for women; that plaintiff was to contribute $5,000, in cash, as his share of the capital; that he met defendant Louis Etkin, pursuant to appointment, to consummate the arrangement, and had with him his own check, drawn to the order of \u201cL. Etkin,\u201d for $5,000, for his contribution to the capital of the firm; that Louis Etkin stated that he had changed his mind about going into partnership, and that he had determined to go into business on his individual account, and proposed that plaintiff enter his employ at a salary of $40 per week and loan to him the $5,000 for one year; that plaintiff asked, if he gave the money, \u201cwho will be good for it,\u201d to which Etkin replied that his name would be good for it, and that his wife owned real estate and \u201cshe is good for it,\u201d and suggested that plaintiff loan the money to both of them and that they would both promise to pay him back the money at the end of a year with interest; that the respondent, who was in the next room, was then called in, and her husband stated to her that he did not wish to go into partnership with plaintiff, but wanted plaintiff to loan hirii \u201cthe money\u201d for a year, and t\u00f3 work for him for the same period at $40 per week, but that plaintiff \u201cis thinking about his security,\u201d and that he had assured plaintiff that his name was good.for it, but had informed plaintiff that she owned real estate, and \u201ccan say good for the money,\u201d and that plaintiff could \u201clend the money to both of us,\u201d if he did not wish to loan it to the husband alone, whereupon the respondent replied, \u201cMr. Isaacson, you can be sure you will get the money at the end of the year, with your 6 per cent, interest; we promise to pay you at the end of the year, with your 6 per cent, interest that plaintiff then said that he was loaning the money to both of them, and asked if it was necessary to make over the check, and was informed by Louis Etkin that it was not; and that thereupon he delivered the check to the respondent. The initials of the defendants are the same. Respondent evidently delivered the check to her husband, for he indorsed it and drew the money, which he used in his business. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The thory on which the complaint was dismissed as to the respondent evidently is, as it was the only ground of the motion, that the evidence failed to show that the money was loaned to both of the defendants^ We are of opinion that that was a question of fact for the jury. 'There is no merit in the contention that money can only be loaned to the party who actually receives and pursuant to the agreement uses it. It, may be loaned to two or more, although pursuant to the agreement under which the loan is made it is delivered to one of them only, or even to a third party. It may be immaterial to the lender who is benefited by the loan; but he is vitally interested in the question as to who become liable primarily to repay it, and they are those to whom it is agreed that the loan is made, regardless of what becomes of the money, i</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
