The appellant claims that this contract is vqid for want of mutuality, and relies for authority upon the case of White v. Kingston Motor Car Co., 69 Misc. Rep. 627, 126 N. Y. Supp. 150. The contract contains no express agreement on the part of the plaintiff to perform any act, but \u201cwhether a covenant will be read into a contract, where there is no agreement to perform, depends upon the intent of the parties, gathered from the instrument and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d Commercial Wood &amp; Cement Co. v. Northampton Portland Cement Co., 115 App. Div. 388, 393, 100 N. Y. Supp. 960, affirmed on other grounds 190 N. Y. 1, 82 N. E. 730, 123 Am. St. Rep. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">The acceptance of the offer, as evidenced by the insertion of the advertisement authorized by the defendant, did not, under the circumstances existing in the White Case, bind the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to continue the insertions. It was merely the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer to pay a certain amount per insertion. The acceptance of the whole offer was expressly made dependent upon confirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>by a committee of the corporation owning the newspaper. In this case the acceptance of the offer to pay a definite sum for the insertion of advertisements during a definite period necessarily implies that the plaintiff agreed to publish these advertisements during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
