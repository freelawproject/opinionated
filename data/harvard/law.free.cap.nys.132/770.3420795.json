The contract has been fully performed by the plaintiff, but the defendant seeks to avoid payment on the ground that he was induced to sign the contract by the fraud of plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, who represented that the trade circular has a circulation of 20,000 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Fraud does not make a contract void, but gives the innocent party the right to avoid the contract if he desires. The innocent party cannot, however, after discovery of the fraud, sit back and accept the benefit of the contract. In this case it does not appear when the defendant discovered the alleged fraud, but it does appear that until suit was begun he never claimed that the contract was induced by fraudulent representations. It was shown that even in the preceding month the defendant had in writing admitted the validity of the contract. Without clear evidence as to the time the defendant discovered the fraudj it would appear that his claim of fraud was merely a method of repudiating a contract after he had received its full benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
