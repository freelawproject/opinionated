The question litigated was whether the operator of plaintiff\u2019s taxicab or the operator of the defendant\u2019s bus was negligent. This judgment must be reversed because of an error in the charge of the learned court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">Counsel for the defendant requested the court to charge that the plaintiff\u2019s chauffeur was an interested witness, and that he had an interest to clear himself from the charge of negligence. To this request the court said: \u201cHe is not interested in the financial result of the verdict.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiff then consented that the court should charge as requested by the defendant. The court then charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-17\">\u201cI decline to so charge, even though you consent. Nobody is interested as a witness, unless he is financially interested in the result of the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">To the refusal of the court to charge as requested and to the charge as made the defendant excepted. The refusal of the court to charge as requested and the charge as made were clearly incorrect. The plaintiff\u2019s chauffeur was charged with operating the taxicab in a negligent manner, and he was therefore an interested witness, even though he had no pecuniary interest in the result of the action. \u201cThe interest which will authorize the jury to refuse to receive testimony of a witness is not solely a pecuniary interest in the result. In, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>action for injuries, the person directly charged with having caused the injuries, although he may not be the defendant, is so interested that the jury may be at liberty to disbelieve his testimony, although it is not otherwise impeached or contradicted.\u201d Hoes v. Third Avenue Railroad Company, 5 App. Div. 151, 155, 39 N. Y. Supp. 40, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
