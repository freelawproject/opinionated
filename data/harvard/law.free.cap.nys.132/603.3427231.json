J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFK\">This is an appeal from an order of the Special Term that requires the plaintiff to amend the judgment roll by inserting a copy of the answer of the defendant Kennedy to the amended complaint, and extends the time of the defendant Fischer to serve his proposed case on appeal for five days after the service of a written notice of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">This action for negligence was brought originally against Kennedy and Fischer. It appears that by stipulation and.consent, dated February 9, 1909, the action was \u201cdiscontinued\u201d against Kennedy without costs. The issue joined by Fischer was tried at Trial Term on April 4, 1911, with the result of a verdict for the plaintiff; and judgment was thereupon entered accordingly on April 6, 1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As the plaintiff had the right to sue either or both of the original defendants, or to hold them either severally or jointly, he \u201ccould, at any time, by leave of the court, discontinue the action as to any or all of such defendants as he should elect.\u201d Dyett v. Hyman, 129 N. Y. at 359, 29 N. E. at 263, 26 Am. St. Rep. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The judgment roll- properly consists of such papers as are necessary to support the judgment thereupon entered. Anderson\u2019s Law Dictionary, \u201cRoll.\u201d If the injury'of the plaintiff was due to the tort of Fischer as well as that of Kennedjq Fischer could not complain that the judgment was not against Kennedy also, inasmuch as the liability was several as well as joint. How can it avail Fischer that the judgment against him should show that Kennedy joined issue, or the nature of that plea? The only complication is due to the fact that an order of discontinuance as to Kennedy was not entered until after the rendition of the judgment against Fischer. _ <bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The order was a matter of course and could be entered ex parte. Rum-Bey\u2019s Practice, vol. 2, p. 164. I am not prepared to say that entry thereof was essential under the circumstances of this case (Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, vol. 2, p. 2114), although it is certainly the better practice. In any event, Kennedy alone could complain, for Fischer has no grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">The order must be reversed, but without costs, and the motion deified, without costs and without prejudice to the defendant\u2019s tight to serve his proposed case on appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
