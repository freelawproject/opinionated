A thief stole the horse and wagon while it was left unattended in front of defendants\u2019 place of business. The defendants are liable in this action for the value of the horse and wagon left in their custody, if they failed to exercise reasonable care to guard against loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Accepting the defendants\u2019 story as true, it appears that the wagon was brought to their place of business at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning. From 8 until 11 the driver and his helper worked in the defendants\u2019 factory. During that entire time there was no watch kept over the wagon, except that every 10 or 15 minutes the defendant or one of his workmen would look out from the fifth-story window to see whether the wagon was still there. It seems to me that the defendants exercised absolutely no care to safeguard the plaintiff\u2019s property. The mere fact that they looked every 10 or 15 minutes from a window on the fifth floor could hardly be calculated to deter a thief from jumping on the wagon and driving off. The horse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>wagon were unattended in the street for at least three hours, a constant temptation to a thief to take them. Under these circumstances I think that no finding that the defendants exercised reasonable care can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
