Judgment has gone against Smith, but the complaint was dismissed as against the corporation at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, apparently upon the ground that Smith had not been shown to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>have been the manager of the restaurant owned by defendant. From the judgment entered upon this dismissal, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">We think that the appeal must prevail. In the first place, the answer admits (by not denying) that Smith was the manager. The complaint alleges that Smith was respondent\u2019s \u201cmanager and superintendent.\u201d The answer denies that he was \u201csuperintendent,\u201d leaving undenied the allegation that he was \u201cmanager.\u201d It is said that the attention of the court was not called to this admission in the pleading, and that the appellate court should not, therefore, reverse the judgment on that ground. If this were the only reason urged for a reversal, the objection might carry weight; but the evidence adduced by plaintiff furnished ample ground for a finding by the jury that Smith was in fact the manager of the restaurant in which plaintiff was arrested, .and that Smith acted within what he supposed to be the scope of his authority when he procured the arrest to be made. Upon the evidence as it stood when the complaint was dismissed, a verdict by the jury that Smith was respondent\u2019s manager, and that respondent was liable for his tort, would have been entirely justified. The dismissal \u25a0of the complaint was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
