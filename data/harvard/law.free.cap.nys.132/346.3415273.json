Y. Supp. 344), the defendant cannot raise that point. The plaintiff did not appeal from the order transferring the cause to the Trial Term. He is willing to try the case as an action at law for damages, and the defendant cannot now object to doing so. It is manifest that the plaintiff cannot now safely proceed to trial without having had an examination of the defendant as well as an inspection of its books and papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> By the sixth subdivision of the order for examination, it is provided that the plaintiff may examine the- defendant respecting its defenses, which of course was not allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the order for the examination of the defendant before trial should be modified by striking therefrom the sixth paragraph or subdivision.
