The plaintiffs were passengers on a trolley car operated by the defendant which collided with another of defendant\u2019s cars. The actions are based on the negligence of the defendant in the operation of these cars, and upon the trial the defendant admitted its liability in both cases. The plaintiffs each testified to the injuries received and the attendant consequences. Their testimony is corroborated by their physician, and is not contradicted nor are they in any manner impeached. While the plaintiffs may have exaggerated and magnified their injuries, the evidence is such as to entitle each to recover something by way of damages. Levine v. Brooklyn, Queens Co. &amp; Suburban R. R. Co., 134 App. Div. 606, 119 N. Y. Supp. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The judgment and order must be reversed and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">HIRSCHBERG and CARR, JJ., concur. JENKS, P. J., and BURR, J., dissent on the ground that the jury was justified in finding that plaintiff sustained' no actual damage, and a court will not reverse for the sake of nominal damages. The Levine Case, cited in the prevailing opinion, was a \"nonsuit, and there was uncontradicted evidence of actual damage. In the case at bar the extent of the injury was disputed.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
