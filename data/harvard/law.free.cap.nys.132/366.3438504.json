The rule respecting the use of one\u2019s own premises, where it unfavorably affects adjacent premises, is well settled. If the use is rea-, sonable, there can be no private nuisance; but if the use is unreasonable, and results in substantial injury, an actionable, nuisance exists, and whether a given use is reasonable or not is a question of fact, depending on many and varied facts. McCarthy v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 189 N. Y. 40, 81 N. E. 549, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 465. That, ordinarily, is a question to be determined upon the trial, and should not be determined in advance upon a preliminary motion, unless the plaintiff\u2019s right to- relief is clear and practically beyond dispute; and more especially is this true where there is no doubt suggested as to the ability of the defendant to respond in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-23\">The order appealed from is in effe'ct a mandatory injunction, requiring the defendant to make important structural changes in its build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing or to discontinue business altogether. By the order the litigation is in effect determined, and gives to-plaintiff the same relief which lie seeks to obtain by judgment. Such orders should be granted with great caution, and only under exceptional circumstances. Maloney v. Katzenstein, 135 App. Div. 224, 120 N. Y. Supp. 418. This is not such a case. The defendant has already offered to remove at its own expense all cause for complaint by a method which involves the acquiescence of plaintiff, and we are by no means satisfied that plaintiff was not unreasonable, under all the circumstances, in withholding his acquiescence. This is one of the questions which can best be answered at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
