The plaintiff at the time he was injured resided in the city of New York. _ He says that, upon leaving the hospital where he was taken immediately after the accident, he took up his residence in the county of Westchester, and in doing this he acted upon the advice of his physician; that he did not change his residence in order that this action could be prosecuted in Westchester county; but that he intends to make the city of Mt. Vernon his permanent voting residence. In this respect the case at bar differs1 from Hislop v. Taaffe, 141 App. Div. 40, 125 N. Y. Supp. 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">We think that the question of plaintiff\u2019s residence was largely one of intention, and, as it is made to appear that he changed his domicile in good faith, it was error for the learned justice at Special Term to make this order, and it must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
