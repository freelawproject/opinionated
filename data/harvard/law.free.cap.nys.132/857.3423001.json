Upon the trial the defendant introduced in evidence the original docket of the justice of the City, Court of Albany, by which it appeared that on the 12th day of November,.' 1910, an action was commenced in that court, in which Joseph McDonald was plaintiff and the defendant in this action was defendant, to recover $1,000 damages for the same injuries'; that the action was brought to trial December 1, 1910, and at the close of the testimony upon the part of the-plaintiff the defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground that facts sufficient had not been proved to constitute a cause of action, and that no negligence on the part of the defendant had been proved from the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses; that by consent the decision of the motion was-reserved until the close of the testimony; that the same motion was renewed oq the same ground at the close of the whole case; and that the decision of that motion was also reserved.

He must further show that the judgment was rendered upon the merits. Genet v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., 170 N. Y. 278, 63 N. E. 350; Rudd v. Cornell, 171 N. Y. 114, 63 N. E. 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In such a case it is necessary that the ground upon which the action proceeded to judgment should affirmatively appear either from the record itself or from extrinsic evidence. Stowell v. Chamberlain, 60 N. Y. 272; Bell v. Merrifield, 109 N. Y. 202, 16 N. E. 55, 4 Am. St. Rep. 436. If there be uncertainty as to whether or not the precise question was raised and passed upon in the former action, the judgment is not conclusive. Lewis v. Ocean Navigation &amp; Pier Co., 125 N. Y. 348, 26 N. E. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The record of the prior suit produced by the defendant shows two judicial determinations \u2014 one the result of a motion, distinctly and expressly made, for a nonsuit; the other, following it, and purporting to be on the merits. It is difficult to understand how the court could have dismissed the action on the merits after it had disposed of the case upon the motion for a nonsuit. It is not necessary, however, to rest our decision upon this proposition. It is a sufficient answer to, the contention of the defendant that the judgment in question is a bar to say that the defendant failed to show which of the two different and distinct determinations in the record was actually made. There was, at least, an uncertainty as to whether the judgment was rendered on the merits or was a mere nonsuit. Moreover, no extrinsic evidence was produced to rebut the presumption from the face of the record that the merits were not passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> In Clark v. Scovill, 198 N. Y. 279, 91 N. E. 800, it was held that in determining whether a judgment is a bar the judgment roll is the primary, but not the exclusive, guide, and, when it appears therefrom that the judgment might have been rendered on the merits or upon a ground not involving the merits, the presumption is that it was not upon the merits, and the burden is upon the one claiming it is a bar to show by extrinsic evidence consistent with this judgment roll that it was in fact rendered on the merits. We think that the judgment invoked as a bar was in legal effect a mere nonsuit, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>it did not operate as an adjudication in favor of the defendant upon the questions litigated-in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., and! KELLOGG, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
