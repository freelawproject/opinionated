This statute (Code Pub. Gen. Laws Md. 1904, c. 57, \u00a7 1) was introduced in evidence, and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-13\">\u201cAll actions of account, actions of assumpsit or on the case, actions of debt on simple contract, * * * shall be commenced, sued or issued within three years from the time the cause of action accrued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">The present action is one on contract, and accrued more than three years before it was commenced!. The Maryland statute, however, contains a further clause, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">\u201cIf any person liable to any action shall be absent out of the state at the time when the cause of action may arise or accrue against him, he shall have no benefit of the limitation herein contained if the person who has the cause of action shall commence the same after the presence in this state of the person liable thereto within the terms herein limited.\u201d Article 57, \u00a7 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-16\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In this case the defendant is a New Jersey corporation and none of the officers have been in the state of Maryland since the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action\" accrued. Apparently, therefore, the statute of limitations has not begun to run against the defendant, for it seems that it was absent from the state during this time. The defendant claims that under the decisions of the courts of the state of Maryland interpreting this section it has been held that the word \u201cabsent\u201d does not mean physically absent, but means not amenable to the process of the state. It would seem that if the defendant expects to rely on decisions of the state of Maryland to prove the law of that state, even in regard to the meaning of the statute, these decisions should have been introduced in evidence. Congregational Unitarian Society v. Hale, 29 App. Div. 396, at page 400, 51 N. Y. Supp. 704. There is, however, no reason why we should not adopt the reasoning of these cases, so far as it bears upon the proper interpretation of the statute, even if the decision is not conclusive upon us. For the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>pose of this appeal it seems to me that we may therefore well hold that the statute has run against the defendant in Maryland if it was amenable to process in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> To prove that process could have been served upon it the defendant introduced in evidence volume 1, art. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 409 to 417, of the General Laws of Maryland governing service of process on corporations. Section 411 permits service of process upon \u201cany agent\u201d of a foreign corporation. The defendant has further shown that it had \u201ca number of agents in nearly every county.\u201d It has had \u201cagents\u201d in the city of Baltimore since \u00cd903. By \u201cagents,\u201d the witness testified, he means \u201cselling agents, who handled our product and received complaints.\u201d And in answer to the question, \u201cAre they permanent selling agents?\u201d he answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The trial justice has held that the testimony is sufficient to show that defendant had \"agents\u201d upon whom process could be served in Maryland. He relies for his authority upon the case of Central of Georgia Railway Co. v. Eichberg, 107 Md. 363, 68 Atl. 690, 14 L. R. A. (N. S.) 389, in which it was held that an agent whose duties were confined to soliciting business over the joint lines of two transportation companies, which paid jointly the expense of maintaining an office in Baltimore, was an agent upon whom process could be served. The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cWhile it is true that, when process is served on an agent of a foreign corporation, the service must be upon such an agent as represents the corporation with respect to business which it does within the state, yet the general principle, apart from statutory provision in regard to all corporations, is that process is sufficient if served upon some person upon whom it may fairly be presumed the duty devolves by virtue of his official position, or of his employment, to communicate the fact of service to the governing power of the corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">This opinion is quite in accordance with the decisions of our own courts and our own statute in regard to the service of process on foreign corporations. An agent must be some person upon whom it may fairly be presumed the dluty devolves to communicate the fact of service to the governing power of the corporation. It seems to me that, where a corporation has \u201cseveral selling agents in nearly every county,\u201d it is not a fair presumption that these agents are persons upon whom the duty devolves to communicate the fact of service to the governing power of the corporation. I do not think that we can close our eyes to the custom that has grown up amongst certain large manufacturers, making every retail dealer handling their products a \u201cselling agent,\u201d giving the \"agent\u201d power to sell the goods, but keeping title in themselves, in order that they may be able to control prices to the ultimate customer. I do not mean to imply that defendant\u2019s selling agents in this- case are shown to have been that kind of agent; but the word \u201cselling agent\u201d has frequently such limited significance that I believe that, in the absence of further proof of their duties and authority, no inference can be drawn that process could be served! on them. The defendant, to establish the running of the statute, must show that, though actually absent, it was still amenable to process; and this it has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The appellant also urges that under section 137 of article 23 of the Public General Laws of Maryland the defendant-is barred from urging that the statute has run against it. As these statutes were not proven, we have no right to consider their effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and' a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
