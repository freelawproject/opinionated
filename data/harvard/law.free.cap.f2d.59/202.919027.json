The recovery is for a breach of a contract of carriage. The ship Panola was a merchant vessel owned by the United States. Under the authority of United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Lustgarten, 280 U. S. 320, 50 S. Ct. 118, 74 L. Ed. 451, and Weinstein v. Black Diamond S. S. Corp., 40 F.(2d) 590 (C. C. A. 2), the exclusive remedy as against the United States is under the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 741-752). The rule announced in these cases is applicable to the instant suit, and upon such authority the bill was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
