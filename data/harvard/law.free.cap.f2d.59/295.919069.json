Daring 1917 plaintiffs were members of the partnership of McDonnell &amp; Truda, organized in New York in 1915 and dissolved \u2022J nly 1, 1928. There were no other partners. In the early part of 1915 plaintiffs were informed that the steamship company Trans-atl\u00e1ntica Italiana was considering a change in its Now York agency. They agreed that, in the event they could obtain, that agency, they would form a partnership to act as agents for that company and other steamship companies whose representation they might subsequently obtain. Truda thereupon went to Genoa, and, as a result of negotiations extending through a period of about two months, secured a contract appointing McDonnell and himself general agents for cargo and passengers for the United States and Canada for Transatl\u00e1ntica Italiana for on\u00a9 year beginning September 3, 3915.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-24\">Before the expiration of this contract, a second general agency agreement was entered into, effective from September 1, 1916, until December 31, 1918, and renewable each three years thereafter unless canceled by either pat ty three months before the expiration dato of any contract period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-25\">2. The plaintiffs\u2019 general agency contract with the Transatl\u00e1ntica italiana required them to maintain suitable offices in the ports in which the steamers of the Transatl\u00e1ntica Italiana made regular calls and to staff such offices with such a number of employees as was necessary for the complete and quick handling of the steamship company\u2019s business. It authorized them to appoint agents, and subagents, and required them to maintain one or more special employees to visit the subagents to aid and encourage the solicitation of traffic for the steamship company; to receive and deliver cargo in accordance with the instructions of the Trans-atl\u00e1ntica Italiana; to issue bills of lading for the captains of the steamers of the company; to collect and pay freight; to make collections and disbursements; to pay for the expenses authorized by the general offices; to generally take care of all' of the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>interests of the steamship company in the United States and Canada in the most suitable and diligent manner; and to promptly remit to the Transatl\u00e1ntica Italiana at Genoa all amounts collected by them for the steamship company, less deductions and payments made for account of the company, in consideration of which the plaintiffs were to receive certain fixed commissions on freight and passengers handled for the company. Ordinarily, the expenses of stevedoring, port taxes, brokerage to shippers, piloting, tug service, the plaintiffs\u2019 commissions, and other incidental expenses were deducted from the gross revenue and the approximate balance cabled to the company in Italy. A small amount was retained by the plaintiffs as an account current to cover any bills which might be presented after the steamers had sailed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">3. Upon organization McDonnell placed $5,000 to the credit of the partnership* and that amount was repaid to him a short time thereafter. The partnership conducted its business upon its earned commissions, current and accumulated profits, and borrowed money. No cash advances were made to the partnership by the Transatl\u00e1ntica Italiana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">4. The calendar year 1917 is the taxable year involved herein.

account of partner.\u201d The partnership\u2019s gross income from all sources for 1917 was $390,272.04, and its net book income was $129,253.82.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">5. A. J. McDonnell, brother of Peter L. McDonnell, was employed by the partnership throughout the year 1917, and was in charge of that department of the business which had to do with shipments of freight. Large quantities of war materials were being exported at that time, and such shipments constituted a substantial portion of the business done. Mueh effort was required to secure it and much attention was required in looking after it. His compensation was determined by the plaintiffs at the end of the year. During the year 1917 he received as his compensation approximately 32 per cent, of the partnership\u2019s net income.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">H. B. Walker, another experienced freight man, received $25*000 from the partnership for his services in connection with the operation of the American side of the plaintiffs\u2019 business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">During the year 1917 Hugo Strada received $10,000 from the copartnership for similar services performed during that same year, and the La Mediterr\u00e1nea Steamship Company, of Italy, which solicited freight and passengers and performed other services in connection with the European end of the plaintiffs\u2019 business, was paid $25,000. As in the case of A. J. McDonnell, neither H. B. Walker, Hugo Strada, nor the La Mediter-r\u00e1nea Steamship Company had any definite arrangement with the partnership for the compensation which they were to receive for their services, but were paid amounts which the plaintiffs considered to be commensurate with the services performed by them and the earnings which resulted from their services. All such payments were made by the plaintiffs out of current and accrued earnings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">6. In 1916 the plaintiffs, with A. J. McDonnell, organized a corporation known as the Maru Navigation Company with an authorized capital stock of $100*000 for the purpose of purchasing and operating ships. The corporation remained simply a skeleton, no money being paid in and no stock being subscribed for until August 1,1917, at which time A. J. McDonnell subscribed for $33,000 of stock, and November 3, 1917, Truda subscribed for $33,000; Peter L. McDonnell subscribed for the remaining authorized stock of $34,000. The amounts paid by the three individuals for stock in the Navigation Company were actually paid from accumulated profits of the partnership, and were charged by it to the individual accounts of A. J. and Peter L. McDonnell, and Truda.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-13\">7. In March, 1917, the partnership purchased the steamship St. Charles for $340,-000 and paid cash therefor. Interest, commissions, repairs, betterments, supplies, etc., ultimately brought the cost of the ship to $381,747.44. March 31, 1917, the partnership borrowed $250,000 to pay for the steamship. The balance of the purchase price and the other expenditures made in connection with the ship, as hereinafter related, was paid out of partnership funds, representing accumulated and current profits. The $250,000 loan secured from the partnership\u2019s New York bank was repaid August 10, 1917.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-14\">July 18, 1917, the partnership' sold the S. S. St. Charles to the Maru Navigation Company on credit, without interest, at a net profit to the partnership of $8,623.68. June 30, 1918, the partnership received 3,500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>shares of stock of the Mara Navigation Company of a par value of $350,000 in payment of the purchase price of the ship. The record does not show that the issue of 3,500 shares of stock of the Mara Navigation Company was an authorized issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">After March 18, 1917, the partnership performed services for the Mara Navigation Company similar to those performed by it for the Transatl\u00e1ntica Italiana. The partnership did not operate the S. S. St. Charles during its ownership of the ship, and did not operate any other boat during the year 1917.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">8. Approximately 97% per cent, of the gross income of the partnership for 1917 was derived from freight and passenger commissions, including those of the S. S. St. Charles; the partnership, however, had a total of $544,780.57 invested in securities and in the S. S. St. Charles in 1917.

Refund claims were timely filed on the ground that the partnership had properly filed a return for tho calendar year 1917\u00bb and that the commissioner\u2019s action in collecting the additional tax was erroneous, as no additional tax was due, and that the eollection of additional tax and interest totaling $29,748.-40 for the calendar year 1917 was made after the expiration of tho statute of limitations and after tho liability for the tax had been extinguished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\">These claims for refund wore disallowed by the Commissioner, November 7, 1928, and September 9, 1929. The Commissioner held that the partnership was required to file an excess profits tax return, form 3102, and, having failed to do so, tho statute of limitation did not run against assessment and collection; that the information return of income, form 1065, filed by tho partnership, was not a sufficient compliance with the statute and regulations, and the profits tax could not be accurately computed from information incorporated in or accompanying that return; balance sheet's alone not being sufficient from which to determine invested capital.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-9\">Robert Ash, of Washington, D.

Refund claims were timely filed and were rejected within two years immediately preceding institution of this suit. It is alleged that the tax and interest were collected after the expiration of tile statute of limitation of five years, and this contention is predicated upon the claim that the partnership return of income, form 1065, filed April 1,193.8, was a sufficient compliance with the statute, and that, the filing of the excess profits tax return, form 1102, was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Plaintiffs further insist that the invested capital of the partnership was nominal, and that it was taxable at 8 per cent, under section 209 of the Revenue Act of 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held, and we think correctly, that the partnership was required to file a profits tax return, .form 1102, and that the balance sheet, which the partnership attached to its income tax return, form 10G5, was not a sufficient compliance with the statute and the regulations. The hooks and records of the partnership were examined and investigated by the Commissioner through a revenue agent, with the result that it was determined that the partnership actually had a large invested capital within the meaning of section 207 of the Revenue Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 306), and the facts establish that the partnership had more than a nominal invested capital. March 18, 3 923, the Commissioner made a jeopardy assessment of excess profits tax against the\" partnership in the amount of $300,005.14. The partnership protested this additional assessment, and requested that the profits tax be computed and determined under the special relief provisions of section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917. Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Appeals and Review, to which it was sent by the Commissioner after the claim of the partnership that the tax should be determined under section 209 of the Revenue Act of 1937 had been denied, the Commissioner tentatively computed the profits tax of the partnership under the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>relief provisions, which, computation showed an overassessment of $75,141.86. Each change or proposed change in the partnership\u2019s tax liability naturally affected the income tax liability of the individual partners, and was reflected in the determination of their taxes. When the jeopardy assessment of $100,005.14 was made against the partnership, overassessments were allowed the individual partners in the amounts of $9,500 each. When the jeopardy assessment was reduced to $24,863.28, an additional assessment of about $6,800 was proposed against each partner, Ultimately the tax liability of the partnership and the two partners was reconciled and closed out together.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Upon the facts in this ease, we are of opinion that the partnership of McDonnell &amp; Truda was required to file an excess profits tax return, form 1102, and that in the circumstances the filing of the return of income, form 1065, was not a sufficient compliance with the statutes and the regulations.

C.) 38 F.(2d) 239; Morris County Crushed Stone Co. v. Com\u2019r of Internal Revenue, 6 B. T. A. 800. Assessment and collection of the tax in question were not therefore barred at the time made.
