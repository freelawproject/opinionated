This claim was settled by the parties, so the further history of that is unimportant to the detennination of the issue now for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The trustee in bankruptcy duly qualified August 3,1933. After this date an order was entered in the ancillary receivership proceedings in the Southern district \u201cin aid of the bankruptcy estate as receiver\u201d in the Northern district of California, from which this appeal is prosecuted: \u201cOrdered that the entire matter be i-c-ienm-od to the Hon. J. A. Isaacson, Referee, Ban Diego, with plenary powers to consider, hear, adjudicate and determine any and all issues in the matter of lien claimants as against the Trustee in Bankruptcy of the estate, and to exercise generally and to the fullest extent the powers of a Referee in Bankruptcy in ancillary proceedings and to appoint a Receiver or custodian of the property involved in the ancillary proceedings in bankruptcy within the territorial jurisdiction of this court, and that the referee in Bankruptcy shall hear such matter upon giving to the Trustee in Bankruptcy or to his attorneys -in San Francisco at least live days\u2019 notice m writing of the hearing of such matters before such Referee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">A glance at section 11, title 11, USOA, makes it imperative that the <em>order </em>must be reversed. The court\u2019s jurisdiction and power is fixed and limited by this section <em>to, \u201c(3) </em>appoint receivers, or the marshals, upon application of parties in interest, in ease <em>the </em>court finds it <em>absolutely necessary, </em>for the preservation of estates, to take charge of the property of bankrupts after the filing ol the petition and until it is dismissed <em>or the trustee is qualified\u201d </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Whether ihe petition and order appointing the ancillary receiver discloses jurisdictional facts to support the appointment is not for our determination. It is sufficient to say that upon \u201cqualification of the trustee\u201d (11 USOA \u00a7 13, supra) the receiver becomes functus officio, and the court had no power to make the order of reference, or any order other than to direct the ancillary receiver to file his account for acts done.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">The court\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to appointment <em>after first finding it absolutely necessary </em>to conserve the estate, and the power of the receiver to hold the property was limited to the <em>qualification of the trustee. </em>The property came into custodia legis when the petition was filed, and the ancillary receiver was only the custodian to hold it until the trustee qualified. Cameron v. United States, <em>231 U. S. 710, 34 S. </em>Ct. 244, 58 L. Ed. 448. Upon qualification of the trustee, the <em>i </em>itle vested in the trustee. Mueller v. Nugent. 184 U. S. 1, 14, 22 S. Ct. 269, 46 L. Ed. 405. This obtains whether the estate may be located within or without the district. Robertson v. Howard, 229 U. S. 254, 33 S. Ct. 854, 57 L. Ed. 1174. The jurisdiction of the bankrupt estate was and is exclusive in the court of the Northern district. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie &amp; T. Co., 282 U. S. 734, 736, 51 S. Ct. 270, 75 L. Ed. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">A bankruptcy receiver is purely statutory, and his power is limited by the statute. He has no power, nor can a court by <em>order confer </em>power, to adjudicate the right of lien claimants. Boonville Nat. Bank v. Blakey (C. C. A.) 107 F. 891. See, also, In re National Grain Corporation (C. C. A.) 299 F. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">The order is reversed, and the court directed to have the special master and referee make a report, and that he be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
