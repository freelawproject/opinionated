The plaintiff prayed that the sale be set aside and the trustees bo restrained from conveying the property to Humphries, and for an injunction pendente lite to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-25\">The cause was heard by the lower court upon the motion of plaintiff for an injunction pendente lite and defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss <em>the </em>bill of complaint. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was overruled, and the defendants\u2019 motion was sustained. The bill of complaint accordingly was dismissed, and this appeal was taken by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-26\">At the hearing of the case in this court the respective parties by their counsel stated in open court that the sale in question had been rescinded by the purchaser, Hum-phries, without objection of the defendants, because of the delay occasioned by this suit in procuring a deed for the property. .</p>\n<p id=\"b333-27\">It therefore appears that this appeal has become moot, and it is hereby dismissed; the costs to be assessed in equal parts against plaintiff and defendant The American Workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-28\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
