Weehawken, <em>ante p. </em>490, with which this case was argued, should be consulted for a full understanding of the relation of the two. Indeed, the \"reasons\u201d filed in the present case \u00bfre to all appearance the same as those relied upon successfully in that case\u2014only they do not fit the ease of an <em>ordinance </em>as they do that of a resolution. Neither' from these reasons, however, nor from any that have been advanced, has a shade of doubt been cast upon the right of the township committee to pass this ordinance. It is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
