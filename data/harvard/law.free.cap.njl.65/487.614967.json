The reasons put forward for annulling the assessment are that in 1897 the principal office of the prosecutor was not in the township of W\u00e1yne, and that the tract assessed was a farm, part of which was not in that township. These were physical facts with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s own property within its knowledge in 1897 as fully as they were three years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">To remain quiet for three years under an assessment such as this without satisfactory explanation is laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
