On the contrary, the testimony makes it appear more probable, at least, that plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted entirely from his own carelessness, in suddenly,, and without warning, turning his horse across the track of the defendant company, directly in front of an approaching car.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">The rule to show cause should be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
