The court overruled the demurrer, and thereupon the prosecutor, with the permission of the court, struck out the \u25a0said first count and proceeded to try the defendant upon the second count, and he was thereupon convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Error is assigned upon the action of the court in permitting the first count to be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">\u201cError cannot be predicated upon the overruling of a demurrer to a count in the information where a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is subsequently entered to such count.\u201d <em>Bartley </em>v. State, 73 <em>N. </em>W. <em>Rep. </em>744; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>35 <em>N. H. 22.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">If the rule were otherwise at common law, the defendant \u25a0suffered no injury, and is not entitled to a reversal for this reason. <em>Crimes act, </em>\u00a7 136 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1898, <em>p. </em>915).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">The alleged error mainly relied upon for reversal is that the trial court admitted evidence to show other acts of adultery committed by the defendant with said Ella Angleman qprior to that charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thrasher, </em>11 <em>Gray </em>450, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that it was competent to show prior acts of improper familiarity in corroboration of the case of the commonwealth, as they tended to show the disposition of the parties to commit the crime charged, but that it was not admissible to prove prior acts of adultery between the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Mr. Bishop, in his work on <em>Statutory Crimes (ed. </em>1883), \u00a7\u00a7 679, 680, says: \u201cIt is well settled law that where the attempt is to prove adultery at a particular time and place, familiarities between the same parties tending thereto, or adultery itself at a prior time and in another or the same place, may be shown in aid of the conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">And he thus comments, in section 680, on the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Thrasher, <em>supra: </em>\u201cBut strangely enough the Massachusetts court further held, on an indictment for adultery, that if the anterior familiarities extend so far, or are of such character as to show adultery actually committed on this previous occasion, the evidence of them, that is, of the previous adultery, is not admissible; according to which doctrine, if the evidence is a little weak, yet tending remotely to establish the crime, it may be submitted to the jury; but if it is a little stronger, and tends more clearly to the same result, it must be excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Thayer </em>v. Thayer, 101 <em>Mass. </em>111, which was a libel for divorce on the ground of adultery, alleged to have been committed October 2d, 1866, the Supreme Court of that state receded from its previous adjudications, and permitted evidence to be introduced of previous acts of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">And this departure was adhered to in the subsequent case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Nichols, 114 <em>Mass. </em>285, where Mr. Justice Gray held that upon the trial of an indictment for adultery, evidence of other acts of adultery committed by the same parties, near the time charged, though in another county, is admissible to support the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The later cases almost uniformly declare such evidence to be admissible, and that it is an exception to the general rule that when a defendant is on trial for one crime, the jury shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>be prejudiced by having another proved against him. <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>State, </em>35 <em>Ala. </em>395; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenness, </em>5 <em>Mich. </em>305; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bridgman, </em>49 <em>Vt. </em>202; <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>52 <em>Id. </em>33 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>76 <em>Me. </em>48; <em>Crane </em>v. <em>People, </em>168 <em>Ill. </em>395; <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>27 N. W. <em>Rep. </em>358; 2 Whart. <em>Cr. L., </em>\u00a7 2663.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The trial court did not err in admitting evidence to prove acts of adultery other than that charged in the indictment. There is nothing in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Snover, </em>34 <em>Vroom </em>382, or in the cases there cited in,the opinion of the court, which is in conflict with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The judgment below should he affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
