Evid., </em>\u00a7 367; 2 <em>Tayl. Evid. (part </em>1) 1170, \u00a7 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">In this ease, however, there can be no question, as the evidence satisfies this court that the lad sufficiently understood the nature of an oath and the consequences incident to false testimony. The boy under examination, to ascertain whether he should be sworn, was asked and answered the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>\"Q. </em>Do you know what it is to take an oath ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\"><em>\"A. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\"><em>\u201cQ: </em>Do you go to Sunday-school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\"A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Do you know what will happen to you if you do not tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\"><em>\"Q. </em>What will happen ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\"><em>\"A. </em>It is a sin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\"><em>\"Q. </em>Have you any idea as to the punishment which will \u25a0follow if you do not tell the truth ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-15\"><em>\"A. </em>They will 'put me in the reform school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-16\"><em>\"Q. </em>After you die do you know what happens? Do you \u25a0expect to live forever ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>After you have done living, what becomes of you then ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-19\"><em>\"A. </em>Then I shall go to heaven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-20\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Suppose you have not been entirely good, what becomes of you then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-21\"><em>\"A. </em>Then I shall go to hell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-22\">It seems to me that this youth, judged by what is ordinarily considered orthodox, had a comprehensive idea of the rewards and punishments incident to honest and dishonest living, and in addition knew .clearly what punishments the law inflicted for perjury, viz., confinement in the reform school. The examination of the boy by the court and counsel, taken as a whole, justified the court in admitting him to be sworn and to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-23\">There is no error found in this case, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
