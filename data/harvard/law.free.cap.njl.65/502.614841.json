It was without doubt the object of the pleader to charge that the \u201cstate oyster commission\u201d had made the lease by virtue of which Hager\u2019s permission was requisite, under chapter 194 of the laws of 1899. This, however, he has not done, and without this the word \u201clessee\u201d imports at most a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The indictment is quashed upon this ground without considering the questions that might arise upon an indictment that charged the violation of this statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
