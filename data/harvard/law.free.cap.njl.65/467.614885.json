L., p. </em>427), which, it is insisted, does not apply to Franklin street.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">But adequate authority, we think, is given by the fourth section of that supplement, which empowers the council to-make ordinances \u201cto prevent and remove encroachments, obstructions and encumbrances in and upon all streets.\u201d In this express power is necessarily implied authority to ascertain, so far as can be done without a judicial trial, the courses and lines of the municipal streets. Until such ascertainment the town cannot learn what encroachments exist and put in train the legal proceedings necessary for their removal. There is nothing in this ordinance to indicate that, when the lines of the street shall have been defined, any other than legal measures are contemplated for the actual establishment of the lines upon the ground. Certainly the determination of these commissioners will not affect any private titles to land, and cannot injure the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">The writ should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
