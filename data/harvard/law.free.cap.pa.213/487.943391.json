Nesbit, father of the appellants, under the will of David E. Nesbit, deceased, took a fee simple or life estate. The language of the will is as follows: \u201c I give and bequeath to my son, William E. Nesbit, and his heirs after him, all my real estate, consisting of a farm and appurtenances in the township aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">It is conceded that the word \u201c heirs \u201d as used in this as well as every-other will, is primarily a word of limitation, and will be so construed, unless it is so plain as to preclude misunderstanding that the testator intended to use it in other than its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ordinary legal sense. We have searched this record in vain to discover such facts or circumstances as would have the effect of cutting down the fee simple estate which is presumptively created by the use of the word \u201c heirs \u201d in the devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that the testator by use of the words \u201c his heirs after him \u201d intended to limit the first estate to the life of William E. Nesbitand at his death to vest it absolutely in his children. This contention is based on the theory that the word \u201c heirs \u201d is used in the sense of \u201c children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Our attention has not been called to any case that would support this position. There is no provision of the will, nor any circumstances shown by the record, to justify a departure from the settled rule of construction. There is no distinction, legal or grammatical, between the words \u201c after him,\u201d or \u201c after his death,\u201d or \u201c after his decease.\u201d The use of the words \u201c after him,\u201d must be construed to mean the same as if the provisions of the will read \u201c after his death,\u201d or \u201c after his decease.\u201d In a legal sense the devisee could have no heirs while he lived, they became his heirs \u201c after him,\u201d that is, \u201c after his decease.\u201d This case is ruled in principle by Reifsnyder v. Hunter, 19 Pa. 41; Price v. Taylor, 28 Pa. 95; Criswell\u2019s Appeal, 41 Pa. 288 ; Hiester v. Yerger, 166 Pa. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
