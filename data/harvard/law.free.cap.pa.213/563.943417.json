The only instruction given him was by the foreman who put a nut under the tap and showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>him how to do the work, and then directed another boy to show him, and he put four nuts in the machine. The foreman told the boy to be careful and not break any taps. On the next day he put a nut in the machine, tramped on the treadle and his foot slipped, the tap broke and the nut flew up and got caught in a cogwheel, breaking the cog. The boy did not know how to stop the machine, and had not been instructed, although there was a lever for that purpose. He took a stick and tried to poke the nut out, and by the pulling of the stick or in some other way his hand was caught in the cogs and injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\">It was no part of his duty to remove the nut from the cog, and the case is not like that of Creachen v. Carpet Co., 209 Pa. 6, where it was part of the boy\u2019s duty to remove the \u201c choke,\u201d which was the accumulated wool caused by the operation of the machine. The plaintiff was not injured in performing any duty for which he was employed and was attempting to remove a difficulty which was not caused by the ordinary operation of the machine, but was meddling with something that was not his business. Had he been hurt in the operation of the machine he might be entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">The case of Doyle v. Pittsburg Waste Co., 204 Pa. 618, differs from that before us in that the clearing out of the waste after it had caught fire and been extinguished was a part of the duty of the operator. This frequently happened and the case was for the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">We do not hold that this is a case of obvious danger, and were we satisfied that the removal of the nut was in any way a part of the plaintiff\u2019s employment we would take off the non-suit. As it is the motion is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-8\"><em>A.
