But this question is not material, as the transaction, if not a pledge of collateral for a debt, was clearly a conditional sale of the stock, i. e., a sale with an option in the vendor to repurchase on specified terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The fact that the time was left indefinite was not fatal. In either view of the transaction, the defendant, whether pledgee or vendee, could bring it to a close by notice to pay or redeem in a reasonable time or be barred: Sitgreaves v. Farmers\u2019, etc., Bank, 49 Pa. 859, quoting 2 Kent\u2019s Com. *582.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The court also found as facts that the stock of the Citizens\u2019 National Bank is limited in amount; that fifty shares, or any part thereof, are not purchasable in the market; that they have no quoted or ascertainable market value; and. that plaintiff held them as an investment having a peculiar value to him greater than the market price at the time of the transfer. Under these circumstances the jurisdiction of equity to enforce a retransfer is well settled: Goodwin Co\u2019s. App., 117 Pa. 514 (534-5) ; Northern Central Ry. Co. v. Walworth, 193 Pa. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
