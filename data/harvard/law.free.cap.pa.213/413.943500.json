J., dismissed the petition, saying:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">We have again gone over the case with care, and have failed to find anything in the decree itself to justify the issuing of an attachment on the ground of fraud, or in the findings and pleadings to show that the conduct and acts of the defendants were fraudulent, and with fraudulent intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">The only finding bearing at all on the question is one that there was-a misappropriation by the defendants; but this is far from finding that there was a fraudulent misappropriation. At any rate, until it is determined how much, if any, of the stock now held by the plaintiff is applicable to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, the court would not allow the attachment as prayed for to issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree refusing attachment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-9\"><em>Levi Bird Buff, </em>with him <em>L.

This would seem to bring the case within the rule in McCarrell v. Mullins, 141 Pa. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">But there is a second reason why the attachment should not issue, alluded to by the learned judge, though not dwelt upon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The decree was that the defendants \u201c must refund and repay so much of the stocks, bonds and assets of the McKinley Coal Company, received by them, or either of them, as may be necessary to pay the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, with interests and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0a\">This was an indefinite order which imposed no exact duty on the respondents. Until the required amount was liquidated, the decree was wanting in the precision necessary for its enforcement by attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
