One transaction between plaintiffs and James H.

Such premiums were contracted in good faith and without negligence by plaintiffs, and were paid by them, the same being included in the indebtedness account referred to in the first finding herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">5.
