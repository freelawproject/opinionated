M. </em>Todd, with him <em>Jas. A. </em>Wiley, for appellant. \u2014 The conclusion reached by the court below that the mere survey through a man\u2019s property and the passing of a resolution by the board of directors adopting a route for its railroad is sufficient to make such a location as would be conclusive upon the landowner, or his successor in title, is erroneous : Neal v. P. &amp; C. R. R. Co., 2 Grant, 137; Western Penna. R. R. Co. v. Johnston, 59 Pa. 290; Harrisburg Borough v. Crangle, 3 W. &amp; S. 460 ; Graham v. R. R. Co,, 145 Pa. 504.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">The weight of authority appears to be that the right to recover damages is personal to the owner at the date of the entry: McFadden v. Johnson, 72 Pa. 335; Davis v. Railway Company, 114 Pa. 308, without regard to any previous action by a board of directors establishing a route. If such entry was made without an attempt to agree with the owner, or the giving of a bond, but with the owner\u2019s consent, the railroad would not be such a trespasser as would prevent the court from intervening for its protection and allowing damages to be assessed nunc pro tunc : Oliver et al. v. P. V. &amp; C. Ry. Company, 131 Pa. 408; McClinton v. Railway Company, 66 Pa. 404; Railroad Company v. Warrell, 122 Pa. 613; Railroad Company v. Cooper, 105 Pa. 239; if, however, the entry is resisted by the landowner, the railroad necessarily is a trespasser and \u201c the owner is not bound to suffer an unlawful intrusion, and afterward fight an unequal battle for compensation : \u201d McClinton v. Railroad Company, 66 Pa. 404.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">In order to justify the taking of any portion of this land, it would become necessary for the plaintiff to show an absolute necessity for such taking. The land had been purchased by the defendants for corporate uses and the testimony discloses that it was necessary for the conduct of its business.

The permanent location of a railroad is an appropriation of the ground and vests the right to the damages assessed : Lawrence\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 865; Beale v. Penna. R. R.

In 1902, plaintiff, a Pennsylvania corporation, located its route and constructed a portion of it on this land by agreement with one Bamford who was then and had been for many years in possession under claim of title. On May 21* 1904, Bamford conveyed the land to plaintiff which had previously constructed additional tracks to those built in 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In 1903 the defendants\u2019 lessor acquired an adverse title to the land, but, as found by the court below, with knowledge of Bamford\u2019s possession. And the defendants made no claim to title prior to 1903, and no effort to take possession until May 16, 1904, when it entered and tore up complainant\u2019s rails.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">On these facts the court found as conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201c 1. That in 1902 the plaintiff company had power to take and condemn a right of way across the land, without regard to who owned it, and having found Bamford in long possession, it had entered and built part of its tracks with his consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201c 2. That defendants\u2019 lessor when it acquired title in 1903 took subject to a visible easement thereon, and cannot now call in question the legality of the plaintiff\u2019s previous entry and appropriation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">\u201c 3.- That this is not an ejectment suit and that it is not necessary for the court to adjudicate the title to the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">\u201c4. That the plaintiff company was in possession of its right of way under permission from one who was in possession under color of title and who made a claim of title that had such a reasonable basis as would put the defendant companies who never were in possession, at least so far as the ground covered by the right of way was concerned, to an action at law to test their rights. The defendant companies took the law into their own hands and undertook by force to redress what they claimed was an invasion of their rights, and in addition they threaten a repetition of this force, if the plaintiff company should attempt to restore the tracks destroyed. In doing so they committed a wrong, the repetition of which should be restrained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">\u201c5. That an injunction should issue, and damages should be assessed at $1,000, but that the injunction granted and the find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ings of fact and conclusions of law, which are held to justify it being granted, are not to prejudice the right of either of the parties hereto to establish, maintain or defend in a court of law its title and right of possession to the said 6.73 acres of land described in the fourth paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, or any part thereof, or its legal or equitable right of possession to the strip of land over and across said tract of land covered by the location of the plaintiff company\u2019s main line and branch B.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">On these findings and conclusions the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
