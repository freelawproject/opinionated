The property devised by this will consists of one house and lot in the village of Tarentum, Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and I do further will and direct that no part or parcel of said property be sold or disposed of until after the death or demise of my daughter, Sarah A. Davis, but that it be rented or leased, and the sum realized to be divided according to the above provisions. My reason for making the above provision is that my daughter, Sarah A. Davis, remained at home long after she became of age; giving me the benefit of her labor and is now providing a home for me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">A codicil to the will was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">\u201c I, Nancy Ingraham, the testator in the above will and testament, do make the following provisions, viz.: That if it becomes -necessary to dispose of or sell my real estate prior to or after my death, my daughter, Sarah A. Davis, shall be entitled to and is hereby authorized to lift and receive her portion annually until the death of her husband, William Davis, after which she is to receive the full amount of her share. But if she should die before her husband, the remainder of her portion, if any, to be paid to her children, if of age ; but if not of age, it shall be paid to their guardian, to be given to them when they arrive at the full age of twenty-one years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">The plaintiffs in the case stated claimed title from Sarah A.

Steel Co., 203 Pa. 249.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_HL\">January 2, 1906 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-5\">Per Curiam:,</author>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The testatrix devised four-sevenths of her estate to her daughter, but provided \u201c that no part or parcel of said property be sold or disposed of until after the death or demise of my daughter, Sarah A. Davis, but that it be rented or leased and the sum realized to be divided according to the above provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On this branch of the case the learned judge below well says : \u201c As a restriction of alienation on the grant of a fee is against the general rule of law, it must be construed strictly, and it requires no very strict construction of the will in question to read it as not being a restriction upon Sarah A. Davis, herself, but only a direction of the testatrix to her executors. It will be observed that the testatrix puts her personal property and the land in question into a common fund for the payment of her debts, and then directs, not that her daughter shall not sell, but that the property shall not be sold till after her daughter\u2019s death, and, in the codicil, directs that if it becomes necessary to sell it, then her daughter shall have a certain share. We think there can be little question that the testatrix did not intend that her daughter, who was the principal object of her bounty, as she says, should not sell, but that the land should not be sold for the purpose of the will unless it was necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">But in addition to this the testatrix by a codicil provided : \u201c That if it becomes necessary to dispose of or sell my real estate prior to or after my death, my daughter, Sarah A. Davis, shall be entitled to and is hereby authorized to lift and receive her portion annually until the death of her husband, William Davis, after which she is to receive the full amount of her share.\u201d William Davis, the husband, is now dead, and it thus appears that there is a power of sale, with an absolute right in Sarah Davis or her assignee to receive the proceeds. The title is good under the codicil without regard to the previous provisions of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
