The judgment was entered upon a scire facias to revive. It is almost unnecessary to say that no appeal lies in such case. The opening of such a judgment rests in the sound discretion of the court below. The act of 1877, allowing appeals from the order of the Common Pleas opening a judgment, applies only to judgments entered by virtue of a warrant of attorney or upon a judgment note. In Jenkintown N. Bank\u2019s App., 124 Pa. 837, the execution was not set aside; it was merely stayed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>authorities cited in regard to the setting aside of an execution do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Order affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
