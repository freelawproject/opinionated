D.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-13\">On April 25, 1890, Michael Collarn presented his petition to the Supreme Court, praying for an alternative writ of mandamus, directed to the judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia county, commanding them to show cause why a license to sell liquor at wholesale should not be granted to the petitioner, under the provisions of the act of May 24,1887, P. L. 194.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-14\">The petition filed averred: That on February 7, 1890, the said Michael Collarn filed his application in said Court of Quarter Sessions, for a wholesale license to sell liquor at No. 3701 Woodland avenue, Philadelphia, under the act of May 24, 1887; that subsequently there was filed of record in said court a paper styled a remonstrance against the granting of said license, not accompanied by any affidavit of the truth of the matters alleged therein, and reading as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-15\">The petition of the undersigned residents of the city of Philadelphia respectfully represents:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-16\">That they remonstrate against the application of Michael Collarn for a wholesale liquor license for the premises No. 3701 Woodland avenue, in the Twenty-seventh ward of the city of Philadelphia, and assign the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The said applicant is not a person of good moral character, as we are informed.

Collarn:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-15\">Dear Sir: This morning I stopped at Mr. Yail\u2019s office, but found it closed; perhaps I was too early. I sent him a letter, however, requesting him to withdraw my name from the remonstrance, as it was not my intention to defame any man\u2019s character, but told him that I was opposed to any saloons in general.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-16\">Hoping that this will prove satisfactory,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-17\">I am, respectfully yours,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-18\">E. W. Karker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-19\">That on April 14, 1890, the court refused the petitioner\u2019s application, without filing any opinion or assigning any reasons therefor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>Mr. IT. Legrand Fnsign </em>and <em>Mr. Frank T. </em>Lloyd, for the petitioner:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-4\">1. The facts of this case differ in no essential respect from those in Prospect Brewing Co.\u2019s Petition, 127 Pa. 523, and Pollard\u2019s Petition, 127 Pa. 507, notwithstanding that a paper styled a remonstrance was filed. That paper contained an averment that the petitioner was not of good moral character, as the signer, one Karker, was informed. The averment was not sworn to, nor did it even state as a fact the absence of good moral character, but simply that the remonstrant was so informed. It can hardly be considered as putting the petitioner\u2019s moral character in issue, notwithstanding the modern tendency to loose pleading. There should be reasonable certainty in an allegation; and if an averment be made on information, there should be a statement of an expectation to prove the facts, or a supporting oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-5\">2. If the remonstrance he considered good, it raised an issue to be decided upon the evidence, and should have been sustained by testimony : Prospect Brewing Co.\u2019s Petition, 127 Pa. 585. That decision is in accord with the constitutional guaranty of due process of law. No witness was called in this case to impeach the applicant\u2019s character. On the contrary, the letter of Karker, put on file, destroyed the only possible legal objection to granting the license. If it he said that the letter was not evidence, no more was the unsworn statement in the remonstrance. The sales on Sunday, years before, by the applicant\u2019s employee, without his knowledge, could hardly involve him in a charge of moral turpitude. That part of the remonstrance alleging that the \u201cproposed saloon\u201d was not needed and was in the neighborhood of educational institutions, requires no notice, as a saloon license was not applied for, and in the cases already cited such objections were expressly held inadmissible.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AnD\">Mr. Chief Justice Paxson :</author>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The petitioner\u2019s own statement of his case puts him out of court. A remonstrance was filed against his application, upon the ground that he was not a man of good moral character. A hearing was had upon the issue thus' raised, and, as there is nothing to show that it was not conducted in a legal manner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>there is an end of the case. We cannot review such cases upon the merits. All we can do is to see that the license court has proceeded according to law. Prospect Brewing Co.\u2019s Petition, 127 Pa. 523, has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Writ refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
