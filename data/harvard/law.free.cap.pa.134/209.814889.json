Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-13\">At the trial on January 15, 1889, the testimony was to the effect that the plaintiff, a boy thirteen years of age, was employed by the defendants, in their glass works, to pick out from a box placed on the floor unworked tin caps used for the covers of glass fruit jars, and to place the caps in a box upon a table, so that they could be within reach of an employee operating the finishing .machine. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was directed or expected to operate the machine. On June 29, 1883, while the operator was out of the room, and the machine was at rest, the plaintiff attempted to remove a cap which was caught in the machine, and as he was doing so the machine started and brought the punch down upon his hand, crushing the hand so that amputation was necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-14\">On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-15\">Q. In putting up caps, you took the caps out of one little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>box and put them in another box ? A. Yes, sir. Q.

A. Yes, sir. Q. Joe Reilly pointed to you where you were to work, and the boy working the machine told you to do what? A. Put caps in this box. Q. What kind of a box were you to take the caps out of ? A. A large box. Q. Where did it stand ? A. Right at the side of the machine. Q. The caps are those things shaped like a deep saucer? A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\">Q.

Q. That was all? A. Yes, sir. Q. You were not asked to run the machine, were you? A. No, sir. Q. Where did the other boy stand who ran the machine? A. He sat on the side of the machine. Q.

The testimony shows that he was to pick up caps, not to work the machine. This case is a question of law and not of fact. The verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. A rule for a new trial having been discharged, judgment was entered on the verdict, when the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying that the court erred in directing the jury to render a verdict for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-8\"><em>Mr. E.

The plaintiff\u2019s own version of the transaction shows he was not injured in doing, or attempting to do, anything properly within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of his employment. He testified, in substance, that defendants\u2019 foreman assigned him to work at one of the trimming machines operated by a boy about his own size ; that he was directed to lift the unfinished tin caps from the floor, and place them in a box where they could be conveniently reached by the operator, and placed in the machine. There is no evidence that he was either directed or expected to participate in the operation of the machine, and hence no instructions were given him in relation thereto. After attending for some time to the work assigned to him, he says, \u201c something stopped the machine, and the other boy ran away. I thought it was my place to take the thing out. So I put my hand in to pull the cap out after the boy jumped off the machine ; and the machine started up, and caught my hand.\u201d While plaintiff\u2019s motive in thus interfering with the machine, which the operator had left, was doubtless commendable, he undertook to do something that was not within the scope of the work to which he says he was assigned, and which, up to that point of time, he appears to have performed without any difficulty. That work was neither difficult nor dangerous <em>; </em>and, if he had not voluntarily undertaken to interfere with the machine, which appears to have been in the exclusive charge of the operator, he would not have suffered the much to be regretted injury. There was therefore no error in holding, as the learned trial judge did, that plaintiff \u201c was injured outside of his employment, not in it.\u201d We find nothing in the evidence that would have warranted the jury in finding that the injury complained of resulted from negligence of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
