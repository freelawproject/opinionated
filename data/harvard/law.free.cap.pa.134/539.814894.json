Broadhead, Abram Bellas and six others, filing a declaration containing four counts: the first, for treble damages for cutting and removing timber trees contrary to \u00a7 3, act of March 29,1824, 8 Sm. L. 283; the second, for double damages, under the act, for cutting down timber trees; the third, for damages generally for trees cut and grass and herbage destroyed ; and the fourth, for damages to trees cut and carried away. The defendants pleaded not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-10\">The cause was referred to a referee, <em>Mr. O. F. Nicholson. </em>On the hearing, the defendants justified under a contract with the plaintiff authorizing them to enter and cut timber trees of certain sizes. The referee found, as facts, that part of the timber cut and converted by the defendants they were entitled to under the contract, but that other timber cut and removed by the defendants, the value of which was found, was not covered by the contract and belonged to the plaintiff. As matter of law, however, the referee found that, as the defendants had the right to enter and cut timber which belonged to them un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>der the contract, trespass did not lie for the cutting and removal of that which belonged to the plaintiff, and this ruling was sustained by the court below. On writ of error to this court, at No. 47 January Term 1889, Sup. Ct., the conclusion of law reported by the referee and affirmed by the court below was reversed, with a procedendo: Shifter v. Broadhead, 126 Pa. 260.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">The remittitur having been filed in the court below, the plaintiff moved for judgment for treble damages, which was refused in the following order : *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\">\u201c The motion of plaintiff for judgment for treble damages is refused; and, in pursuance of the opinion and judgment of the Supreme Court in this case, it is now ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, for the sum of one hundred and twenty-four dollars and fifty cents, that being the value of thirty-six thousand and seventy-one feet of lumber, at the price of three dollars and fifty cents per thousand feet, as found by the referee in his final report.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\">Thereupon the plaintiff took this appeal assigning the refusal of his motion for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-8\"><em>Mr. F.
