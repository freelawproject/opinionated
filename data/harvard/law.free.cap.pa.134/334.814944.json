Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-24\">At the trial, on October 8, 1889, the court, on motion of the defendants, made an order that the jury be permitted to view the premises where the nuisance complained of was alleged to exist, and the jury accordingly examined the same. The testimony adduced tended to show the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-25\">Rosanna Wunder was the owner of a house and lot, No. 4239 Leibert street, in Manayunk, Philadelphia, and had resided there for thirty years. Catharine Craven owned and occupied the premises No. 139 Mechanic street, and the adjoining premises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>No. 141 Mechanic street, were owned by James H. McLean, but occupied by his tenant, Edward Rooney, to whom they were first leased in 1882 or 1883. The lots of Mrs. Craven and Mr. McLean were hounded at the rear by Mrs. Wunder\u2019s property. Upon the lots of the defendants were privies, used by the occupants of the respective premises, for which there was a common cess-pool. According to the testimony for the plaintiffs, this cess-pool was less than two feet, but, according to .the testimony for the defendants, more than three feet, from the wall of the plaintiffs\u2019 house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">\u25a0 Testimony for the plaintiffs tended to show that for about four years prior to the trial their cellar was made very offensive by foul matter coming through the cellar wall, on the side of the house next to the cess-pool of the defendants, and that the condition of the cellar was at its worst about August 6, 1888, after a violent rain storm which had flooded many cellars in the vicinity. Mrs. Wunder testified that she first complained of the nuisance in 1886. Testimony for the defendants tended to show that her first complaint was in 1888, after the storm mentioned; that soon after its occurrence, Mr. McLean, in consequence of a notice from the board of health, had the cess-pool cleaned out and its walls examined, when they were found to be in good condition; that they were not cemented, as the cleaning out was thought to be sufficient; and that after that cleaning the cellar of the plaintiffs was in good condition. The testimony disclosed the fact that there was another cess-pool near to the plaintiffs\u2019 house, located on property of one Mrs. Higgins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">The above-stated facts having been shown, the court interrupted the trial and inquired whether either of the parties had dug down to see what the actual cause of the nuisance was. Both parties said that they had not; whereupon the trial judge asked that a laborer be sent to dig, and see whether there was a leak or not, stating that he could not sustain a verdict either way until such was done, as otherwise it would be but conjecture at the best. Both sides agreeing that such should be done, the case was adjourned till Monday, October 14,1889, at which time testimony was adduced to the effect that, during the interval, a laborer in the employ of the board of health had dug down between the cess-pool and the plaintiffs\u2019 house, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ascertained that the filth came from that cess-pool. Further testimony was produced to show the extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Finletter, P. J., charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">[From the evidence you have heard to-day, there can be no doubt that defendants are liable; it is now only a question of damages.

Shoyer </em>(with him <em>Mr. John S. </em>MoKinlay), for the appellants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-19\">1. The charge of the' court disregarded well-settled principles defining and discriminating between the liability of a landlord and that of a tenant, for damages to a third party, caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>by a nuisance on the demised premises. Primarily the tenant is always liable for such damages arising from a bad state of repair of premises of which he has possession: Bears v. Ambler, 9 Pa. 193. The statement in Long v. Fitzsimmons, 1 W. &amp; S. 530, that the tenant is not bound to make \u201c lasting and substantial repairs,\u201d might be confusing, had not the same judge, in Cornell v. Vanartsdalen, 4 Pa. 370, declared that the word repairs must be defined in the sense in which it is commonly understood, viz., as the restoration to a sound state of what has fallen into partial decay or dilapidation ; mending or refitting. Without a provision in the lease that he shall make repairs, the landlord is under no obligation to do so: Moore v. Weber, 71 Pa. 432; Hazlett v. Powell, 30 Pa. 298; nor can he enter for that purpose without becoming a trespasser: Jackson &amp; Gross on L. &amp; T., \u00a7\u00a7 627, 628. The case of Grier v. Sampson, 27 Pa. 183, does not in any way affect our position, as in that case there was no tenant in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">2. The cases that are most similar to the present one, in their facts and circumstances, are the following, which hold that, although the landlord is liable, if the premises are so constructed, or in such a condition at the date of the lease, that their continued use by the tenant must result to the injury of a third person, yet the .landlord is not liable, where the tenant has been negligent in the use of the premises, for not making repairs necessary to abate the nuisance: Knauss v. Brua, 107 Pa. 85; Somers\u2019s App., 6 W. N. 441; Fow v. Roberts, 108 Pa. 489. Every circumstance of law and fact, in the present case, operates to relieve the landlord from liability. He had made no covenant to repair, and the tenant was bound to make repairs; though, even if there had been such a covenant, the primary liability to third persons would be on the tenant. The remedying of the nuisance is clearly within the meaning of repairs, and it was not shown that the cess-pool was in bad condition when the lease was made. No defect of construction was shown, nor can such properly be inferred. But, in any case, the question whether the landlord or the tenant was liable, should have been left to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-6\"><em>Mr. Emanuel J. Page </em>(with him <em>Mr. Patrick F. Fever), </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The cess-pool was prima facie a nuisance: Wood on Nuisances, \u00a7\u00a7 78,124, 579; Tenant v. Goldwin, 2 Ld. Raym. 1089. A person maintaining a nuisance is liable, even though it occur without negligence or from inevitable accident: Tenant v. Goldwin, supra; Fletcher v. Rylands, L. R. 1 Exch. 265; Hodgkinson v. Smith, 4 B. &amp; S. 228. The person erecting, as well as the person maintaining a nuisance is liable therefor :; Penruddoek\u2019s Case, 5 Rep. 100. The owner of real estate is liable for a nuisance thereon; it is his duty to abate it, and his tenant must suffer him to enter for that purpose: 2 Lead. Cas., Am. Law of Real Prop., 94; Grier v. Sampson, 27 Pa. 183. An owner of a house who leases it to a tenant, with a cess-pool so situated and constructed on the premises that its use must necessarily result in a nuisance to the occupants of an adjoiningliouse, is liable to the latter in damages: Fow v. Roberts, 108 Pa. 489; Rex v. Pedley, 1 A. &amp; E. 822; Knauss v. Brua, 107 Pa. 85 ; and even if the tenant had covenanted to repair: Marshall v. Cohen, 3 El. &amp; Bl. 128. A cess-pool is a permanent fixture, and the tenant is not bound to make repairs amounting to a permanent improvement to the property : Wood on Nuisances, \u00a7\u00a7 73, 124. The cases cited by the appellants clearly establish the latter proposition.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AvH\">Mr. Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The fourth assignment of error complains that the learned judge of the court below took the facts wholly from the jury, leaving them nothing to do except to settle the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages. Whether this was right or not depends on whether the case presented, when the evidence closed, any open, questions of fact for the jury to pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The defendants owned separate but adjoining houses and lots, Nos. 139 and 141 Mechanic street. The house of the plaintiffs is on Leibert street, and the defendants\u2019 lots extend back to and adjoin that of the plaintiffs, on oue side. The action is brought to recover damages alleged to have arisen from leakage from the cess-pool used in common for the privies on Nos. 139 and 141 into the plaintiffs\u2019 cellar. Mrs. Craven, one of the defendants, owned and occupied No. 139. No. 141 was owned by McLean, but was, and for several years had been, occupied by Rooney as a tenant. The plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover depended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>on whether the leakage existed as alleged, and, as to McLean, on whether such leakage was due to improper construction, or defective condition when the lease was made, for which the landlord would be answerable, or to negligent use by the tenant, for which he alone should be held responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">By a city ordinance, it is made unlawful to locate a cess-pool within two feet of the wall of an adjoining building. This one is not within the prohibited distance, and its location may be regarded as a lawful one. If it was properly built, and in good repair when the tenants took possession, the landlord ought not to be held responsible for the consequences of his tenant\u2019s neglect. On the other hand, if the cess-pool was defectively built, or was oug of repair when the tenant was put in possession, the mere fact of the tenant\u2019s occupancy, when the injury arises, will not relieve the landlord from the consequences of his own negligence. He is liable because of the defective construction or condition at and before the tenancy began, and this liability continues notwithstanding the possession of the tenant. He cannot escape liability for an existing nuisance by leasing the property to a tenant, and putting him in possession: Knauss v. Brua, 107 Pa. 85. The tenant who should use the defective cess-pool would be liable because of his use, but such liability would not take the place of, or in any manner affect, that of the landlord. This was distinctly ruled in Fow v. Roberts, 108 Pa. 489. In that case, the plaintiff was nonsuited in the court below, the court being of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s action should have been brought against the tenant who was in possession during the time when the alleged injury was sustained. This court, however, held that, inasmuch as the cess-pool was maintained by the landlord within the prohibited distance, in violation of the city ordinance, and the testimony showed that, as often as the contents of the pool rose to a level with the bottom of the plaintiff\u2019s cellar, they began to find their way into the cellar, the plaintiff should have been allowed to go to the jury on the question of the landlord\u2019s defective construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In this case, the question of the character of the original construction, and the actual state of repairs when the premises passed into the possession of the tenant,, was one upon- which McLean had the right to go to the jury. The learned judge of the court below seems to have overlooked this question, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>have taken its decision into his own hands. This was doubtless an inadvertence, but we do not see how the mistake can be repaired without sending the case back for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
