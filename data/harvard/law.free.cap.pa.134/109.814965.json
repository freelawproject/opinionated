He continued the owner of the residence or dwelling in Towanda township, until the taking of the testimony in this case in March, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">The master found further, that from about December 1, 1884, the plaintiff made visits to his married daughters in Iowa and California, and spent the winters in the latter state; that he returned to Towanda township each spring of the year and did, business there, as usual, his business being the lending of money, buying notes, etc.; that he frequently stated that his health was improved in California and he intended to make his residence at Almeda, in that state; that in his absence from Pennsylvania his family was left in his dwelling in Towanda township, he paying the family expenses; that in the spring of 1887 he voted in California, but paid no taxes there except upon a mortgage he held upon property owned by his son-in-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">Upon the foregoing, facts, and others of like character, the master, considering Guler\u2019s Case, 1 Binn. 349; Fry\u2019s Case, 71 Pa. 302; Hindman\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 466; Pfoutz v.

Thereupon the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-4\"><em>Mr. If A.

A. Oaliff, </em>for the appellees, was not heard.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-7\">In the brief filed, as to the conclusiveness of a master\u2019s report, counsel cited: Sproull\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 137; Burton\u2019s App., 93 Pa. 214; Bedell\u2019s App., 87 Pa. 510.

There was not only evidence enough on behalf of the defendants to submit to a jury, but ample to sustain a verdict; and, had it been so submitted, the probabilities are very strong the verdict would have been the' same as the master\u2019s finding. It is always unprofitable to discuss the testimony in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
