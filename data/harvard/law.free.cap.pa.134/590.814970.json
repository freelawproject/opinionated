The defendant\u2019s plea was non-assumpsit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">At the trial on March 17, 1890, the following facts were shown: On October 14, 1884, the defendant company issued to the plaintiff the policy in suit, containing the following provisions and stipulations:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-7\">\u201c IV. When property, insured by this policy, or any part thereof, shall be alienated, or in case of any transfer or change of title to the property insured, or any part thereof, or of any interest therein, or if any part of such property shall be encumbered by mortgage, judgment or otherwise, at the time of effecting this insurance, or if it shall hereafter become in any manner encumbered, or if proceedings be commenced to foreclose any mortgage upon any property herein insured, without the consent of this company indorsed hereon, or if the property hereby insured, personal or real, shall be levied upon, attached, or taken into possession or custody, under any legal process, or the title or possession be disputed in any proceeding at law or equity, this policy shall cease to be binding on this company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-8\">\u201c VII.....This company shall not be liable for a greater sum than two thirds the actual cash value of the buildings burned, at the time of the fire;.....\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-10\">\u201c X.

During the life of the policy, six other judgment liens were entered, for amounts aggregating 1379.06. Of these, one was satisfied in December, 1885, four were satisfied in March, 1887, and one was satisfied at a date not given. No recognition of the fact that the real property was encumbered at the date of the policy was made therein, nor was any consent of the company to the entry of any of the judgments indorsed upon it, nor was it shown that the plaintiff ever notified the company of the entry of any of the encumbrances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">On the night of January 6, or the morning of January 7, 1887, the plaintiff\u2019s barn and its contents were totally destroyed by fire. On the latter day, the plaintiff prepared a statement setting forth the fact of the fire, a list of the property destroyed, and the fact that the origin of the fire was unknown, verified the statement by his affidavit, and sent it to the home office of the company, accompanied by a letter requesting that an agent be sent to view the premises and settle the loss. In response, the secretary of the company wrote to the plaintiff on January 11th, acknowledging receipt of the letter, promising that it would receive early attention, and asking that in the meantime the plaintiff send information as to the supposed origin of the fire, who occupied the barn, etc. This request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>for further information the plaintiff responded to on January 14th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-4\">About four days later, W. D. Crawford, who was not a regular agent of the defendant, but was occasionally employed by it as an adjuster of losses, was sent by the company to see the plaintiff, \u201csee his loss, look over it and make proofs.\u201d He came to the plaintiff\u2019s house, inspected the remains of the barn, and then went with the plaintiff to the Ward House, at Tyrone. The plaintiff testified that when they arrived at the Ward House, Crawford showed to the witness the proofs of loss that had been sent to the company, and also a list of the judgments that were standing on the docket; that the witness then gave some explanations to the effect that he was always buying and trading in land and had bought some since the date of the policy, and of course there were some judgments against him; that Crawford studied a little, shoved the list of liens to one side and said: \u201c McFarland, I don\u2019t see anything better we can do than hold an appraisement; you choose one man and we will choose a man, and if the two can\u2019t appraise it, let them get a third man; we will have to stand to it, and you will have to stand to it: \u201d that the witness finally agreed to this, and Crawford said the appraisement would be held in two or three weeks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">On March 30,1887, Crawford, acting for the defendant, sent to the plaintiff duplicate blank agreements for an appraisement, which, after reciting the stipulation of the policy upon that subject, and the fact that \u201c the parties interested have failed to . agree upon the proper amount of damage to be awarded,\u201d stipulated for the submission of that question to appraisers, specified the matters to be considered by them in determining the loss, and limited the scope of their inquiry by the following provision : \u201c It is expressly understood that said appraisers shall not decide upon any question relating to the construction of said policy, or any other matters of difference'within the terms and conditions of the insurance, but their acts shall have binding effect only as to the actual cash value of or damage to such property, covered bjr policy No. 25,732, of said company, as may be found to have been saved in a damaged condition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">Along with these blanks, the plaintiff received a letter in the handwriting of the company\u2019s secretary, but signed by Crawford for the company, suggesting that as each party had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the privilege of choosing one of the appraisers, the plaintiff should name as his choice a competent builder, and requesting him to sign both blanks and mail one of them to the company. The plaintiff complied with this request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-6\">Delay taking place in the holding of the appraisement, some correspondence on this subject passed between the parties, the plaintiff complaining that the delay greatly inconvenienced him by preventing the rebuilding of the barn. Finally, on May 26, 1887, the appraiser selected by the defendant being sick, Crawford appeared and proposed to act in his place as the appraiser for the company. The plaintiff assented, and on that day the appraisers made an award in writing, appraising the damages to the barn at $775. Testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that Crawford stated it was not worth while to make any appraisement of the personal property destroyed, as he would give the plaintiff the amount claimed upon it or within $5 or so of that, and said, after the appraisement was completed, that the plaintiff would be paid in ninety days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">In pursuance of an arrangement therefor, the plaintiff met Crawford at Altoona on the morning after the appraisement. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to what then took place was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-8\">\u201c Q. Did he have these papers with him ? A. He had the appraisement papers with him and showed me \u2014 he wanted to show me, \u2014 I didn\u2019t understand figures very well, and he added it up, and he said I would get $577 and something. That\u2019s the way he brought it up. Q. What did he say to you about the payment of it? A. I says to him, \u2018What about the inside\u2014 what was lost inside ? \u2019 He says, \u2018We\u2019ll see about that again;\u2019 and I says \u2014 I kind of got a little mad \u2014 I says to him, \u2018 I understand that I will only have to law you at last, any way. By what I hear everybody saying I will have to law you at last, at any rate ; \u2019 but he made no answer. Q. What, if anything, did he say to you as to when they would pay you if you accepted the amount he figured up ? A. He told me he would pay me in 90 days. Q. That he would pay you in 90 days ? A. In 90 days. Q. Did you agree to the offer ? A. I was afraid to sign the paper. I didn\u2019t like to sign the paper, because I didn\u2019t know what I was signing. I didn\u2019t understand it. I never had got anything insured in mj*- life before.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Crawford, testifying for the defendant, denied that he had ever told the plaintiff that the company would pay the loss, but said that what he told him was that the company\u2019s terms were to pay in ninety days from the time proofs of loss were filed. He testified further that the object of the meeting at Altoona was to make out complete proofs of loss, and that while engaged in so doing the witness learned for the first time there were encumbrances on the property; that at the time the witness and the plaintiff were together at the Ward House in Tyrone, the witness-did not produce a list of liens, and was unaware that there were any against the property; that the witness discovered at Altoona an error of $100 in adding up the items in the appraisement, explained this to the plaintiff, and showed him that according to the conditions of the policy he was entitled only to the \u201c two thirds of the actual cash value of the building which the award calls for,\u201d and the plaintiff said \u201che wouldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d and for this reason the proofs of loss were never completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">On September 28, 1887, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys wrote to the defendant, notifying the company that his claim had been placed in their hands for collection, and expressing a hope that it might be adjusted without suit. Their letter was referred to S. G.W. Brown, an agent of the company, who replied to it that he would visit the attorneys some time during the month of October, 1887. Neither in any of the correspondence with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, nor otherwise, was any objection to its payment raised, upon the ground of the encumbrances against the plaintiff\u2019s property, prior to the bringing of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-7\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Dean, P. J., charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-8\">This plaintiff, Silas McFarland, sues the Kittanning Insurance Company on a contract of insurance against loss by fire to the extent of $1,500 on his barn and personal property in Antis township, in this county. He exhibits in evidence an insurance policy with no less than twenty-five conditions, printed in small type, which I can hardly read; not only twenty-five printed conditions, but quite a number of these having many distinct stipulations. The plaintiff accepted this policy, say<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ing thereby' that his recovery should depend on a strict compliance with these conditions. Not only does he accept it and make it a part of the contract that his recovery shall depend upon'these conditions, but he goes further and say's, in effect, that he agrees there shall be no waiver of any one of these printed conditions, unless by a specific waiver indorsed in writing on the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">The defendant has shown here that there were encumbrances on this property at the time it was insured, and, immediately after, others were entered to the amount of several hundred dollars. No notice was given the company of these encumbrances. Now here is the contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\">\u201c When property' insured by this policy or any part thereof shall be alienated, or in case of any transfer or change of title to the property insured or any part thereof, or any interest therein, or if any part of such property shall be encumbered by mortgage, judgment or otherwise at the time of effecting this insurance, or if it shall hereafter become in any manner encumbered, or if proceedings be commenced to foreclose any mortgage upon any property herein insured, without the consent of this company indorsed hereon, or if the property hereby insured, personal or real, shall be levied upon, attached or taken into possession or custody under any' legal process, or the title or possession be disputed in any proceeding in law or equity, this policy shall cease to be binding on the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-8\">There were encumbrances on the property' at the time of the insurance, and others obtained afterwards. The plaintiff agrees that the policy shall become void if that shall happen. Then he further agrees that there shall be no waiver of this condition unless it be expressed in writing on the policy. I do not say that a sane man should [not] accept a policy of this kind; but I say that when a sane man does accept such a policy, and these stipulations are pleaded to defeat a recovery for a loss, he cannot expect the court to violate the law and the contract to aid him, however great may be the hardship to him. There is some evidence of parol waiver, but to submit it to you we would have to disregard altogether the stipulation that there shall be no waiver except in writing indorsed on the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-9\">There is no case here for you on the facts. There are no disputed facts. It is altogether a question of law for the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>If I should err in this ruling, I am glad to know the plaintiff can have me corrected by a higher court. You will, therefore, render a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-6\">The jury found for the defendant, as directed, and judgment was entered upon the verdict; whereupon, the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-7\">1. In not submitting the case to the jury upon the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-8\">2. In directing a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-9\"><em>Mr. A. A. Stevens </em>(with him <em>Mr. G. L. Owens), </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-10\">1. There was abundant evidence of a waiver by the company of the conditions of the policy set up to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the case should have been submitted to the jury: Wachter v. Assurance Co., 132 Pa. 428; Snowden v. Insurance Co., 122 Pa. 510; Girard L. Ins. Co. v. Insurance Co., 97 Pa. 15; Coursin v. Insurance Co., 46 Pa. 323; Thierolf v. Insurance Co., 110 Pa. 41; Penna. F. Ins. Co. v. Dougherty, 102 Pa. 568; Lebanon Mut. Ins. Co. v. Erb, 112 Pa. 149; Eureka Ins. Co, v. Robinson, 56 Pa. 256; Niagara F. Ins. Co. v. Miller, 120 Pa. 504; Elkins v. Insurance Co., 113 Pa. 386. If the other formal conditions of the policy can be waived, why cannot the tenth, which provides that- there shall be no waiver otherwise than by indorsement on the policy, be waived too ? The demand for an appraisement was a waiver, by the terms of the policy, of any prior forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-11\">2. In holding that the tenth condition could not be waived, the court below was misled by a misapprehension of the decision in Universal F. Ins. Co. v. Weiss, 106 Pa. 20, which rested upon an entirely different condition, in the policy there considered, from the one resembling the tenth condition of our policy. If that decision was correctly interpreted, it stands alone and has been ignored in every case since decided. Such a provision will not disable the company from giving a waiver by parol: Elkins v. Insurance Co., 113 Pa. 386; National Ins. Co. v. Brown, 128 Pa. 386; Wachter v. Assurance Co., 132 Pa. 428; Insurance Co. v. McCrua, 41 Am. Rep. 652; N. W. Iron Co. v.

Garrett, 47 Pa. 213.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-4\"><em>Mr. John B. </em>Blair, for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\">The policy is the law of the relation between the insurer and the insured, and the latter is not allowed to appropriate its benefits and at the same time disregard its conditions. The condition against encumbrances is not a formal one, such as those applying to the proof of loss, but goes to the very heart and essence of the contract: Seybert v. Insurance Co., 103 Pa. 285; Penn. M. F. Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 119 Pa. 449; Hench v. Insurance Co., 122 Pa. 135. There is not a scintilla of evidence that the company ever recognized any liability or encouraged the plaintiff in any expense, after it knew of the encumbrances. A waiver is an equitable defence and must be established by the measure of proof required in equity. Crawford was a special agent, not vested with authority to waive this breach, and the plaintiff was bound to inquire into the scope of his authority: Wood on Insurance, 873. But the tenth clause of the policy precludes all the vague testimony of the plaintiff as to waiver: Universal Ins. Co. v. Weiss, 106 Pa. 26.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Adk\">Mr. Justice Mitchell:</author>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The subject of waiver by acts in pais, notwithstanding stipulations in a policy of insurance that nothing less than an express agreement indorsed on the policy shall be effectual for that purpose, has just been considered in Dwelling-House Ins. Co. v. Gould, ante, 570, (opinion filed herewith,) and we refer to the review of the cases there made, to show that the charge of the learned judge, that evidence of a parol waiver was not competent, cannot be sustained. Before reaching the conclusion, however, that the case was wrongly withdrawn from the jury, we must examine the facts set up as evidence of a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The policy contained rather unusually stringent conditions that if the property was encumbered by judgment or otherwise, or should become so encumbered, without the consent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>company indorsed thereon, it should cease to be binding on the company, and that nothing less than a specific agreement, clearly expressed and indorsed on the policy, should be construed as a waiver of any of the conditions. It is undisputed that there were encumbrances at the date of the policy, and others subsequently, of .which no notice was given or consent obtained. The liability of the company was therefore discharged if the company chose to so treat it, and had it remained passive there would have been no cause of action. But, in fact, the company did not remain passive. On receipt of the proofs of loss the secretary wrote asking for further information, which was furnished. An agent then called on plaintiff, with the proofs of loss in his possession, examined the remains of the fire, and, according to plaintiff, produced a list of the liens from the docket of the court, received explanations in regard to them, and then demanded an appraisement under'the terms of the policy. This latter statement and some others are denied by the defendant, but for the present purpose we must assume that the jury would have found them to be true. After some delay, appraisers were appointed by the parties, respectively, and an adjustment of the loss was made, which the agent of the company then promised should be paid in ninety days. These negotiations lasted nearly five months, and plaintiff alleges that during that time he was prevented from rebuilding his barn, and suffered other inconveniences and damage in consequence. In addition to this, the adjustment of the loss by the appraisers was, under the twenty-second condition of the policy, binding and conclusive as to amount; and, though they might give him but a small part of what he deemed his loss, the plaintiff was nevertheless harred, by his submission, from any larger claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Do these facts, assuming the jury to find them, afford sufficient evidence of such a change in plaintiff\u2019s position, to his detriment, and in reliance on the. acts of the company, as will justify the jury in finding a waiver, under the second branch of the rule laid down in Dwelling-House Ins. Co. v. Gould? In Coursin v. Ins. Co., 46 Pa. 323, the facts constituting the waiver are not reported, but the language of Justice Thompson, on page 331, is closely applicable to the present case: \u201c If it [the company] acted and promised, after the action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>legally barred, as if it did not intend to insist on the limitation, and <em>put the party to </em>trouble, expense, and anxiety in regard to his claim, they need not complain of a jury finding that they did waive it.\u201d And in Niagara F. Ins. Co. v. Miller, 120 Pa. 504, 517, the present Chief Justice says: \u201cIf, with the knowledge in its possession of every fact upon which to avoid the policy, they misled the plaintiff for nearly a year, <em>subjected him to the expense of procuring plans and specifications of his </em>building, and never informed him that they would not pay because the policy was avoided, they have no ground to complain if they are now held to be estopped from setting up such a defence.\u201d In this last case,'and also in Snowdqn v. Insurance Co., 122 Pa. 502, the facts relied upon to establish a waiver were certainly no stronger than they appear to be in the present; and, under those decisions, the latest and most analogous of a long line, we must hold that the evidence in the present case should have gone to the jury on the question of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The learned judge apparently fell into error by following Universal F. Ins. Co. v. Weiss, 106 Pa. 20, too literally. Some of the expressions in the opinion therein upon the question of waiver of proofs of loss would probably justify the taking of the present case from the jury. But the opinion must be read in its connection, as applied to the evidence. The principle of waiver by acts and declarations, is expressly stated by the learned judge, but he then proceeds to the facts, and says that of waiver as to proofs of loss there was no sufficient evidence, and of waiver as to time of bringing suit no evidence at all. Upon its facts, the decision is in line with the others already cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">I have, of course, discussed the case entirely from the plaintiff\u2019s point of view of the facts. The truth of plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, of Crawford\u2019s contradiction of it, of the latter\u2019s knowledge of the encumbrances before his demand for appraisement, the extent of his authority, and how far his knowledge is that of the company, and other like questions, are for the jury on the weight of the evidence. The omission of notice of encumbrances is not, however, a mere formal defect, but a breach of a substantial condition of the insurance; and, in view of this fact, and of the express stipulation in the policy that nothing should amount to a waiver unless specifically agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to and indorsed on the policy, it will be the duty of the plaintiff to establish the parol waiver by a clear preponderance of evidence. But where a case is taken from the jury, and decided as a matter of law upon the sufficiency of the evidence, we must (as in cases of nonsuit, Elkins v. Insurance Co., 113 Pa. 386,) treat the plaintiff\u2019s case as though the jury had found it to be true. Upon the actual facts or the weight of the evidence we indicate no opinion; indeed, we have none.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Judgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
