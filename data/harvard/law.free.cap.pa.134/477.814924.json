Michael Fleming was employed by Bailey &amp; Nelson, as a laborer, and on September 20,1887, he was set to work wheeling bricks from the pile near the station to the place where they were to be used \"at the culvert. As the most direct way, the bricks were wheeled upon planks laid between the railroad tracks carried over a temporary trestle at the culvert. The planks were so used with the knowledge of the track-men of the company. On the morning of September 21st, which was foggy, Fleming went to work about seven o\u2019clock, and shortly before eight o\u2019clock, just as he had dropped a load of brick between the tracks on the trestle and was turning to go back for another, he was struck by a train approaching at about thirty miles an hour, and killed.
