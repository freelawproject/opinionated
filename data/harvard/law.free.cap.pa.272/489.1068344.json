Equity has jurisdiction of a bill in equity for a reconveyance of real estate, and cancellation of a mortgage thereon, where it appears that, under a judgment against plaintiff, a sheriff\u2019s inquisition found that the rents, issues and profits of the premises, were of a yearly value to satisfy the debt, interest and costs, in seven years, and that, notwithstanding the return, the property was sold and conveyed by the sheriff to one of the defendants, who conveyed to another of the defendants, the latter giving a mortgage for part of the purchase money.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b513-14\">7.

Guglielmo Carlini \u2014 \u25a0 who, with Mannino, Stephen H. Huselton and Clara A. Rodgers, were named as defendants in the bill \u2014 brought an action of ejectment against Onorato for part of the property, which resulted in a judgment by default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>against that defendant, for the land described in the writ and 6% cents damages. Huselton was Carlini\u2019s attorney, and Clara A. Rodgers was the former\u2019s sister-in-law. The bill charges a conspiracy by the defendants to defraud plaintiff of his property through the medium of a sheriff\u2019s sale; while the court held this charge not established, it sustained the bill on other grounds, and awarded the relief prayed for. The defendant Mannino alone appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The record discloses facts somewhat out of the ordinary. Carlini having procured the judgment for 6% cents damages against Onorato, who resided in Ohio, paid the costs amounting to $12.60, and, through his attorney, Huselton, issued a fieri facias on the judgment, for the collection of the damages and costs. On the appearance docket in the ejectment proceedings, the following entry was made: \u201cA. Bertolett, \u00cdFr.j Bill, $1545.\u201d This was also endorsed on the fieri fac\u00edas-. \u00a1The court found this was a fictitious claim, enteTfedp'br \"procured to be entered, by Huselton. '\u2022\u2022\u00a1onpm .</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The sheriff, in pursuance of the writ, levied oh'the property of Onorato, and, on the condemnation, the sheriff\u2019s jury made return that the rents, issues and profits of the premises, were of a clear yearly value sufficient to satisfy the debt, interest and costs in seven years; which return was in conformity with the facts, as the property was renting for thirty-three dollars a month. Notwithstanding this return, a venditioni ex-ponas was issued and the property sold, the purchaser being Huselton, and the sheriff\u2019s deed was made by his direction to Clara A. Rodgers, who conveyed to Mannino for a consideration of $4,000, $700 of which was paid in cash and $3,300 was represented by Mannino\u2019s purchase-money mortgage. Onorato had no actual knowledge of any of the proceedings; as before stated, Mannino was his tenant and occupying the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">To the court\u2019s findings that Mannino was not a bona fide purchaser, and was guilty of what amounts to fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>error is not assigned. The only question raised for our determination is, whether equity has jurisdiction, the argument being that the bill is an ejectment bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Although the court below does not specifically find that Mannino practiced a fraud on his landlord, Onorato, in acquiring the property, we think such a specific finding might have been made; certain it is, Mannino must have had knowledge of the sheriff\u2019s sale, yet he did not inform Onorato of what was going on, and took the deed for the property without disclosing his purchase. No title passed by the sheriff\u2019s deed to Clara A. Rodgers. The Act of June 16,1836, P. L. 772, 2 Stewart\u2019s Purdon 1567, provides: \u201cIf the inquest shall find that the clear profits of any real estate levied as aforesaid will not be sufficient to satisfy within seven years, the debt or damages in such execution, and the same shall be approved of by the court, the plaintiff in such writ may have a writ of venditioni exponas to sell such real estate for and towards the satisfaction of his judgment.\u201d The inquest having found that the rents, issues and profits were of a value, sufficient within seven years to satisfy the debt, interest and costs, no writ of venditioni exponas could be issued. Its issuance, after this return, was unlawful, and nothing could be sold by it. The deed of the sheriff in pursuance of it was a nullity, the only effect of which was to put a cloud on plaintiff\u2019s title. \u201cA cloud on title is a title or encumbrance apparently valid but in fact invalid.\u201d Octoraro Water Co. v. Garrison, 271 Pa. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">As the only question raised by the record is that of equitable jurisdiction, its resolution must be in appellee\u2019s favor. \u201cEquity has jurisdiction to remove clouds from title, and, in a proper ease, it will direct the instrument casting the cloud on the title to be delivered up and cancelled.\u201d Octoraro Water Co. v. Garrison, supra. Whilst it is true, plaintiff does not denominate his bill one to remove a cloud on title, yet, that is its purpose and effect, and that is the result of the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>prayed for and granted. In no sense was it an ejectment bill; appellant acquired no title whatever by his deed; not only was the deed from the sheriff a cloud on plaintiff\u2019s title, but so was the deed to appellant and the mortgage made by him, because the grantor in the one and the mortgagor in the other had no title to convey or pledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Furthermore, the record discloses that, while by demurrer appellant attempted to raise the question of the legality of the remedy sought by plaintiff, yet, at the same time, he also answered the bill. A defendant may not answer and demur to the whole bill: Stegmaier v. Keystone Coal Co., <em>232 </em>Pa. 140. An objection to the jurisdiction of a court of equity, must be taken, either by demurrer or plea, before answer: Margarge v. Ziegler, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 438; People\u2019s National Bank v. Loeffert, 184 Pa. 164. By demurring and answering, defendant waived the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Had an action of ejectment been brought at law, what would have been the necessary outcome? Under the facts as established, the court would have been required to give binding instructions for plaintiff. Where, in a proceeding in equity, plaintiff\u2019s title is clear and all the evidence relating to it is of such a character that a judge in a trial at law, upon the same evidence, would not be at liberty to submit the question to the jury, equity will grant relief: Richmond v. Bennett, 205 Pa. 470; Wilson v. Cather, 214 Pa. 3, 7. In addition to this, had plaintiff brought his action at law, the mortgagee in the mortgage given by defendant, would not have been bound by the judgment, and therefore plaintiff\u2019s remedy on the law side of the court would not be complete and adequate. We entertain no doubt as to the jurisdiction in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The decree is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
