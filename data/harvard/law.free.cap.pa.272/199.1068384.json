Defendants, \u2014 asserting the language is ambiguous and of doubtful import, \u2014 urge that its meaning was for the jury, not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We are constrained to the conclusion that the language is of doubtful meaning; it is not such as where \u201cStanding alone the common understanding of mankind takes hold of the published words, and at once, without difficulty or doubt, applies a libelous meaning to them\u201d; it is only when this is the case that \u201cthey are to be so construed as a matter of law\u201d: Mengel v. Reading Eagle, 241 Pa. 367, 370. Long ago we said: \u201cIt is the province of the jury, and not of the court, to construe words of dubious import\u201d: Per Gibson, C. J., in Hays v. Brierly, 4 Watts 392. \u201cWhere the words used are ambiguous in their import, or may permit, \u2014 in their construction, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>nection or application, \u2014 a doubtful, or more than one, interpretation, and in some sense be defamatory, the question whether they are such is for the jury under proper instructions from the court\u201d: 17 Ruling Case Law, title Libel and Slander, section 184. \u201cIt is true, the question, as to the sense in which the words are used, is generally for the jury, but that question like all others which fall within the cognizance of a jury, is one of fact and must be determined upon proper proof; if words are reasonably capable of two meanings, one of which is actionable and the other innocent, it is for the jury to say in which sense the words were uttered or understood\u201d : Pittsburgh, Allegheny &amp; Manchester Passenger Ry. Co. v. McCurdy, 114 Pa. 554, 558. The Supreme Court of the United States, in Baker v. Warner, 231 U. S. 588, 594, thus stated the principle: \u201cIt was for the jury and not for the court to determine the meaning of ambiguous language in the published article. Where words are libelous per se the judge can so instruct the jury, leaving to them only the determination of the amount of damages......The meaning of the words was in dispute, and as that issue of fact was not submitted to the triers of fact, a new trial must be ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We are not to be understood as saying that the jury, under proper instructions, may not interpret the letter as the court in its charge did; all we decide is that the meaning of the words, because of their ambiguity, is for the jury, not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The assignments of error are sustained and judgment is reversed with a new venire.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
