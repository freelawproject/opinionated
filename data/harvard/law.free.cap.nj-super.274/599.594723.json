The facts are essentially undisputed. NJHA operates and maintains the Garden State Parkway. Local 193 represents toll supervisors (those empowered to supervise toll plazas). The parties entered into a public sector collective negotiation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Adamczyk, a Local 193 union member, was a supervisor at the Cape May Toll Plaza. His duties included the securing of monies collected from automatic toll machines and placing those funds in a vault located at the toll plaza. In March 1992, the Internal Audit Division for NJHA informed security at the plaza of shortages totaling approximately $541. An investigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">On April. 3, 1992, security agents witnessed Adamczyk take a bag of coins and tokens from the-vault building and place it in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Security then notified the New Jersey State Police, which sent two police officers to the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Upon arrival, an officer approached Adamczyk and identified himself, whereupon Adamczyk said that \u201che had made a mistake and ... [the police officer] could go in his vehicle to obtain the coins he had taken[,]\u201d according to the officer\u2019s police report. After reading Adamczyk his Miranda rights and preparing a consent to search form that he signed, the police recovered the plastic bag, which contained about $111 in coins and tokens, from the vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The police then arrested him, took him to the police station, and charged him with theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In response to an officer asking him to explain what he knew regarding the theft, Adamczyk stated: \u201cPlain English, I took the money.\u201d He specifically said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">When I was changing the vaults [containers used to transfer tokens and coins] I found a vault from lane four have an un-seeure lid. When I was placing the same vault on the pallet in the vault building some money fell out. I opened the lid, took a few handfuls out and put the coins in a plastic bag. I proceeded to put the seals on the rest of the vaults, started to take the damaged vault into the building to count it as per proper procedure. Changed my mind threw it back in the stack on the pallet put the safety lid or security lid on it then put the seal on it. Went to the car took off the glove I wear on my left hand and put the bag of money under the front seat of the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Adamczyk hastened to add: \u201cBut I never pried this or any other vault open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Adamczyk also admitted to incidents of thievery when he provided the following responses to questions asked by the State police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">Q. Have you ever taken any money before, money that you should have turned in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Q, Would you tell me when and how you did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">A I can\u2019t tell you when an[ ] how, occasionally out of a vault that wasn\u2019t locked. Occasionally I found a vault that wasn\u2019t locked, I reached in and took a handful of change out. I put it in my pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">Q. About how many times did you do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">A I can\u2019t give you an exact number, maybe a dozen over a couple of years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">Q. Approximately how much money was involved when you did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">A I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t count it Rick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">Q. Do you remember when you did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">A One day last week. Before that it had to be approximately a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">Q. Have you ever taken any money from the toll lanes and not turned it in when you should have, money that was lying on the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-16\">A Yeah a couple of coins once in a while.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">NJHA immediately suspended Adamczyk and, on April 10,1992, formally charged him \u201cwith improper performance of duty and failure to perform as required in [his] job description.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> NJHA charged Adamczyk with unlawfully removing about $111 on April 3 and unlawfully removing \u201cvarying amounts of coins and tokens from property of the New Jersey Highway Authority ... for [his] personal gain\u201d between January and April 1992. The written notice indicated a disciplinary hearing would be held on April 20. The hearing, however, was adjourned on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">In the interim, on May 12, Adamczyk tendered a letter of \u2022 resignation, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-19\">I am writing to ask that the New Jersey Highway Authority accept my resignation effective immediately. As you are aware on April 3,1992 I was placed upon a leave without pay. Subsequent to that time I have involved myself with a therapist under the Resolve Program. It is my decision after conferring with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>therapist that I am unable to continue working in my present capacity because I am unable to carry out the duties of a supervisor and would therefore request that you accept my resignation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">NJHA rejected Adamczyk\u2019s resignation in a May 15 letter, which stated: \u201cPlease be advised that your letter of resignation ... is not acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">On June 1, NJHA held a hearing and, on June 4, found Adamezyk guilty as charged and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">I hold that you should be terminated on each of the accounts for which you have been found guilty effective April 3, 1992. I further conclude that on the basis of these findings, that you receive no sick leave, vacation pay, or any other benefits which would have been due you in the absence of this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Adamezyk did not challenge his termination. Local 193, however, filed a grievance on his behalf, contending that NJHA \u201cviolated his rights under the Collective Bargaining Agreement by refusing to accept his resignation and by denying him payment for unused accrued sick leave, vacation, compensatory time and any other benefits which were due to him prior to his suspension on or about April 3,1992.\u201d NJHA rejected that claim. The parties exhausted the grievance procedures outlined in their contract and then selected an arbitrator to hear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In the arbitration the parties agreed that Adamezyk sought three types of benefits: (1) unused sick leave, which equalled $16,182 (762.96 hours); (2) accrued vacation time in the amount of $1,102.71 (51.99 hours); and (3) compensation time, which Adam-ezyk admittedly owed NJHA $254.52. In total, Adamezyk sought about $17,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">With respect to unused sick time, section XXII, paragraph two, of the contract states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">Sick Leave is cumulative. An employee who retires or dies (to the estate) and who has completed at least one (1) year of service will receive payment of 100% of his/her unused Sick Leave entitlement based on a maximum of 300 days; those employees who resign with at least five (5) years and up to 10 years of service will receive a payment of 50% of their unused Sick Leave entitlement based on a maximum of 300 days; those employees who resign after ten (10) years of service will receive a payment of 100% of their unused Sick Leave entitlement based on a maximum of 300 days. <em>The aforementioned payments of accumulated unused Sick </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Leave may not be payable to an employee who had been terminated as a result of a disciplinary action subject to the Grievance Procedure, </em>[emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In regard to accrued vacation benefits, section X, paragraph eight, of the agreement provides that \u201c[a]ny employee who resigns, or is separated, will receive pay in lieu of vacation on a prorated basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Additionally, section XI, paragraph six, of the subject agreement contains a resignation clause, which provides: \u201cA Supervisor may resign at any time with all benefits to which he/she is entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The agreement between the parties also contains a final and binding arbitration provision and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">The award of an arbitrator upon any grievance subject to arbitration as herein provided shall be final and binding upon all parties to this Agreement, provided that no arbitrator shall have any authority or jurisdiction to add to, detract from, or in any way, alter the provisions of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Based upon these provisions, particularly the resignation clause, Adamczyk argued before the arbitrator that he had (1) an absolute right to resign on May 12, 1992; and (2) resigned prior to his termination by NJHA and, hence, was entitled to all his benefits. He pointed out that the contract \u201cdoes not even indicate that the supervisor must be \u2018in good standing1 to receive all the benefits to which he is entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">NJHA, on the other hand, argued that it had terminated Adamczyk \u201cas a result of a disciplinary action\u201d and, thus, section XXII, paragraph two, prohibited the payment of unused sick time. In addition, NJHA argued that Adamczyk submitted his resignation \u201cwith the intent of circumventing the disciplinary proceedings and escaping with additional benefits he would otherwise forfeit as a result of his long history of theft\u201d and \u201chad no intention of resigning prior to having his criminal activity exposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">On November 23, 1992, the arbitrator rendered his decision in favor of Adamczyk, essentially reasoning that the \u201cvery broad statement\u201d contained within the agreement permitting a supervisor to \u201cresign at any time with all benefits to which he/she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>entitled\u201d precluded NJHA from denying Adamczyk accrued sick and vacation time. The arbitrator also stated that the parties clearly intended to limit section XXII, paragraph 2, to those \u201cindividuals who had already been terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">NJHA filed a complaint on March 1, 1993, challenging the arbitration award and asserting that the arbitrator rendered his decision by undue means and exceeded the scope of his authority. On May 17, 1993, the return date of the order to show cause, the Law Division Judge denied the relief sought by NJHA and confirmed the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">On appeal, NJHA argues: (1) the arbitrator rendered his decision by undue means, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:24-8(a); (2) the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:24-8(d); and (3) the arbitration award violates public policy and, thus, the arbitrator should have required Adamczyk to forfeit his employment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">It is axiomatic that courts favorably view arbitration of labor-management disputes. <em>See County College of Morris Staff Ass\u2019n v. County College of Morris, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>383, 390, 495 A.2d 865 (1985); <em>Barcon Associates, Inc. v.

There is, however, a distinction between public and private sector arbitration. <em>See Tretina Printing, Inc. v.

Arbitration is designed to provide a speedy, expeditious, and economic resolution of disputes and, whenever possible, should spell the conclusion to litigation rather than the beginning of it. <em>County College, supra </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 390, 495 A.2d 865; <em>Barcon, supra </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 430 A.2d 214.

The scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority depends on the terms and conditions contained within the agreement between the parties and, properly, the arbitrator cannot disregard the terms contained therein nor can he or she rewrite the contract for the parties. <em>PBA Local 160, supra, </em>640 A2d at 344. As succinctly stated by our Supreme Court: \u201cwhere an arbitration award does not draw its essence from the bargaining agreement, it will not be enforced by the courts.\u201d <em>County College, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 392, 495 A.2d 865 (citation omitted); <em>PBA Local 160, supra, </em>640 A.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Here, the arbitrator acted contrary to pertinent statutory criteria, as well as the public interest and welfare, inherent in his guidelines when he permitted Adamczyk to receive about $17,000 in employment benefits after internal agents caught him stealing tokens and money from NJHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In determining NJHA terminated Adamczyk on June 4, the arbitrator failed to recognize the purpose and effect of Adamczyk\u2019s suspension without pay pending a disciplinary hearing. The whole point of the suspension was to determine whether Adamczyk was guilty on April 3, 1992 of the charges brought against him and, if so, any disciplinary action taken by NJHA would take effect as of the date of the incident. It is logical to consider and utilize the April 3 date as the effective date from which to measure the impact of the disciplinary hearing proceeding, even though the hearing took place two months later because of contract and due process considerations, including the adjournments. Had NJHA not been able to establish that Adamczyk had stolen funds or if it turned out that it had mistakenly suspended Adamczyk for stealing he clearly would have been entitled to back pay from April 3. As NJHA would have been required to use that date to determine back pay and, in view of the public interest involved because a public agency and trust is involved, that date should be considered the applicable date from which disciplinary action flowed, including the effective date of termination at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Thus, the arbitrator should have retroactively applied Adam-czyk\u2019s termination to April 3, the day NJHA witnessed him taking a \u201cfew handfuls\u201d of coins and tokens out of the vault, instead of using the June 4 date. Stated differently, the June 4 disciplinary hearing should have had the efficacy of confirming the April 3 suspension and converting it into a termination as of the date of the suspension. NJHA, therefore, does not have an obligation to compensate Adamczyk for unused sick leave pursuant to section XXII, paragraph two, of the collective negotiation agreement, nor reimburse him for vacation time. By applying the April 3 date, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Adamczyk obviously cannot recover Ms benefits because NJHA terminated him prior to the date he \u201cresigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Even if we were to conclude that NJHA\u2019s termination of Adamczyk took effect on June 4, the award could still not stand because it was procured by \u201cundue means,\u201d contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8(a), and the arbitrator \u201cimperfectly executed\u201d his authority, as proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8(d). In the language of the exclusionary clause, Adamczyk \u201chad been terminated as a result of a disciplinary action____\u201d In modifying this exclusionary clause by limiting it only to those \u201cindividuals who had <em>already </em>been terminated[,]\u201d the arbitrator ignored the contractual provision contained in the contract that prohibited him from adding to, detracting from, or in any way altering the provisions of the agreement. He in essence negated the contractual provision for any instance where an employee facing serious disciplinary charges submits a resignation prior to conclusion of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Even if we also rejected a relation back approach and ignored the contract language as to sick leave, we would nonetheless set aside the arbitration award as it contravenes public policy. A public employee entrusted with public monies who is caught stealing those funds should not be able to receive employee benefits based upon a procedural hiatus, <em>i.e., </em>the time between when he is caught and his hearing, particularly in light of the blatant criminality involved here. To allow this to happen would erode the already tarnished reputation and image of state government, foster ill will amongst honest state employees, and further fuel cynicism and mistrust towards government.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Furthermore, in awarding sick benefits, the arbitrator in essence granted Adamczyk a two month cushion to put his affairs in order prior to bearing any responsibility for his breach of the public trust. The effect was to allow a race to resignation before the grievance macMnery could conclude. To put the point differently, the arbitration award condoned a \u201cbeat the clock\u201d mentality, <em>i.e., </em>could NJHA have afforded Adamczyk a full and fair hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>before he sought to vest his benefits and before imposition of any penalties or exclusionary provisions contained in the contract. In our view such action cannot allow a defalcating public employee to betray the public trust by stealing public funds and avoid any impact with regard to his benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Public policy militates against such a- result.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In addition, applying the actual hearing date as the point of termination in the public'sector, instead of the suspension date, may hamper the ability of government authorities to investigate and, most likely, will provide those public employees charged with a violation of the criminal law with a method to add insult to injury by collecting some funds from the public agency. Moreover, where a crime is involved, invocation of Fifth Amendment rights could well force further delays of administrative hearings. Had NJHA terminated Adamczyk prior to any grievance hearing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or had a hearing shortly after his suspension, Adamczyk would most likely complain on appeal of a violation of his contract rights or that he was denied due process because he did not have time to prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Although cognizant of the argument that Adamczyk should be entitled to his benefits irrespective of the reason NJHA discharged him because he had \u201cearned\u201d those benefits, it can fairly be said that public sector and public interest considerations clearly outweigh this lone factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In sum, the arbitration award fails to draw its essence from the collective negotiations of the parties, and because the arbitrator exceeded his authority and disregarded the contractual exclusion denying benefits, particularly unused sick days, to employees who had been terminated as a result of a disciplinary action, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the public policy interests involved, we vacate the order confirming the arbitration award and, accordingly, also vacate the award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> According to the police report, security agents at the toll plaza observed Adamczyk from the woods behind the vault building using binoculars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\"> Although not included within the \u201ctotal value stolen\" figure listed in the police report, the report also indicates that the officers seized $2 worth of nickels and $105 worth of tokens.
