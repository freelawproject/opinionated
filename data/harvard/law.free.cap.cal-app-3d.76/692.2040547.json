(Pen. Code, \u00a7 245.) Over a period of about 48 hours, responding to psychotic delusions, he appears to have shot three young college students. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity according to the procedures of Penal Code section 1026, and he was thereafter committed to a state hospital. After more than 90 days of such hospitalization, at a time when he had <em>not </em>recovered his sanity, proceedings were commenced on his behalf for parole into the public community, as conditionally permitted by Welfare and Institutions Code section 7375.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">As relevant, Welfare and Institutions Code section 7375 provides: \u201cWhenever any such person has been confined in a state hospital... for 90 days or more .. . and the medical director of the hospital... is of the opinion that the person has improved to such an extent that <em>he is no longer a danger to the health and safety of others </em>and that the person will receive benefit from parole, the medical director may certify said opinion to the committing court .... Within 30 days after the receipt of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>certification . . . the court shall, after a hearing in open court, approve or disapprove such recommendation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Following the required hearing the superior court disapproved the recommendation for Duckett\u2019s parole, and these proceedings in habeas corpus followed. Duckett seeks thereby an order \u201cdirecting the trial court to grant said request for outpatient parole.\u201d The prayer will be denied for the reasons which we now state.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is appropriate first to consider the public interest, in proceedings under Penal Code section 1026 and Welfare and Institutions Code section 7375.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In discussing the class of persons committed to a state hospital upon a Penal Code section 1026 finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, the state\u2019s high court in <em>In re Franklin, 1 </em>Cal.3d 126, 147 [101 Cal.Rptr. 553, 496 P.2d 465], stated: \u201c[W]e agree ... that \u2018The special interest which the public has acquired in the confinement and release of people in this exceptional class results from the fact that there has been a judicial determination that they have already endangered the public safety and their own as a result of their mental conditions as distinguished from people civilly committed because of only potential danger.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In the enactment of Welfare and Institutions Code section 7375 the Legislature has considered this special interest of the public. It has provided that there shall be no parole into the community, of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity and <em>who have not recovered their sanity, </em>except upon approval of the committing court, after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Thus the principal, if not the only, issue of the judicial hearing required by section 7375 is whether the subject of the hearing \u201chas improved to such an extent that he is no longer a danger to the health and safety of others . . . .\u201d The ultimate responsibility for this grave determination is conferred upon the committing court, not upon the state hospital\u2019s medical director, or its staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">At Duckett\u2019s superior court hearing the following factual context was developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Duckett\u2019s continuing mental illness was diagnosed as \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type.\u201d In \u201chis case psychosis carries with it a definite danger of violent acting out of his delusions.\u201d He had an extensive juvenile history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of \u201cexperimenting with drugs and getting into a delinquent crowd,\u201d and doing \u201ctime at Juvenile Hall for burglaries . . . The episode leading to his instant commitment was, as we have indicated, the shooting of several college students; the shootings resulted from his psychotic delusions or hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Medical experts from the state hospital first testified that Duckett \u201cwas no longer a danger to the health and safety of others.\u201d But on cross-examination, and from other evidence, it was established that he posed no danger to others \u201cat this time.\u201d The reason was that \u201cat this time\u201d he was on \u201clarge doses\u201d of \u201cantipsychotic\u201d medication. If the medication were to be stopped, \u201cThere\u2019s a strong indication\u201d (from the hospital records) that the \u201cdelusions and hallucinations [which] caused the original offense\u201d would return. When for some reason the medication had been interrupted at the hospital he \u201cagain developed [the] delusions and hallucinations.\u201d \u201cBut for this medication he would probably still be psychotic and in his case psychosis carries with it a definite danger of violent acting out of his delusions.\u201d \u201c[Without medication on two occasions [the hospital staff had] seen a reversion to thought processes similar to that at the time of the alleged crime.\u201d In recent conversations with Duckett one of the medical witnesses had observed no adverse \u201cthought disorder,\u201d but he \u201ccould not state unequivocally that there is no evidence of the thought disorder\u201d; at least there were \u201cno strong indications of a thought disorder....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Duckett had signed a written agreement wherein he promised while on parole to keep weekly appointments with a designated \u201cPenal Code Coordinator,\u201d to \u201ccontinue receiving antipsychotic medication,\u201d and that \u201che will not keep firearms, that he will not use alcohol to excess, and that he will avoid the use of illicit drugs.\u201d Other evidence indicated that most psychotics such as Duckett, when left on their own, \u201cstop their antipsychotic regimens\u201d within a short time and that when they do \u201cthe symptoms may recur . . . .\u201d Indeed, one medical witness said: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong indication from our records\u201d that if he (Duckett) stopped his medication a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d existed of a resumption on the \u201cdelusions and hallucinations [which] caused the original offense ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The \u201cmonitoring\u201d of Duckett\u2019s required medication, as indicated, would be through his weekly visits to a \u201cPenal Code Coordinator.\u201d A medical witness agreed that in his letter outlining the proposed parole arrangements, \u201cthere\u2019s no indication of anybody making sure that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Duckett takes his Artane\u201d (i.e., one of the required medications). The witness \u201cassumed\u201d that Duckett would continue with his medication while on parole; he was \u201ctheorizing that he\u2019ll go to Highland [Hospital] to take his medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Duckett himself, although present, did not testify at the superior court hearing. Toward its close the following proceedings, among others, took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cMr. Chasan [Duckett\u2019s attorney]: Those are all the witnesses I have, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201cThe Court: Thank you. Mr. Quatman, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">\u201cMr. Quatman [district attorney]: We have no witnesses, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Duckett, would you come forward and be sworn, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">\u201cMr. Chasan: Your Honor, are you calling Mr. Duckett as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking him to be sworn, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">\u201cMr. Chasan: I do believe he has a Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-13\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s not a criminal proceeding, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-14\">\u201cMr. Chasan: If that\u2019s the way you want to rule\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-15\">\u201cThe Court: Don\u2019t give me that stuff now. We\u2019re just talking it over. If you want to convince me otherwise, but it\u2019s even conceded that it isn\u2019t a 1026, it\u2019s down here to see whether he should be released. And if you\u2019re raising some issue now that he\u2019s got a Fifth Amendment privilege and you could be right. You want to tell me why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-16\">\u201cMr. Chasan: Well, I think in any proceeding where Mr. Duckett is facing a continued further deprivation of his liberty, whether it\u2019s denominated civil or criminal, that the rights normally applicable in a criminal proceeding, including the Fifth Amendment, would apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-17\">\u201cThe Court: Is that the issue you raise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201cMr. Chasan: Well, I\u2019m raising it by way of an objection to his testifying. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">\u201cThe Court: Fine, you may be seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\u201cMr. Chasan: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201cThe Court: Anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">\u201cMr. Quatman: Nothing further, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cThe Court: Anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">\u201cMr. Chasan: Nothing further, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">\u201cThe Court: The request will be denied. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">\u201cMr. Chasan: May I be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ve ruled. You certainly put on your evidence. I wanted to hear more. I heard the evidence. I wanted to hear more evidence. I don\u2019t want to hear any further argument, no. That\u2019s all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">We now consider Duckett\u2019s contention that he had a Fifth Amendment right not to be called as a witness at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">\u201c The [Fifth Amend.] privilege can be claimed in <em>any proceeding, </em>be it criminal or civil, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory____\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 47 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 557, 87 S.Ct. 1428].) But the Supreme Court \u201chas always broadly construed its protection to assure that an individual is not compelled to produce evidence which later may be used against him as an accused in a criminal action.\u201d <em>(Maness </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>419 U.S. 449, 461 [42 L.Ed.2d 574, 584-585, 95 S.Ct. 584].) \u201c \u2018[I]t protects <em>any disclosures </em>which the witness may reasonably apprehend <em>could be used in a criminal prosecution or which' could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(In re Gault, supra, </em>pp. 47-48 [18 L.Ed.2d pp. 557-558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-19\">Here Duckett had been found not guilty of the criminal charges which resulted in his state hospital commitment. Under our law he could never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>again be prosecuted for those offenses. The judicial inquiry, as noted, was whether the state of his psychosis was such that, consistent with the public safety, he might be released from hospitalization into the community on parole. Duckett could not reasonably apprehend that such testimony as he might be called upon to give \u201c \u2018could be used in a criminal prosecution or ... could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. 1, 48 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 557-558].) He accordingly had no Fifth Amendment right to refuse to take the witness stand. And if perchance while on the witness stand he were to be asked questions having a reasonable tendency to so incriminate himself, his right to then decline to answer was in no way abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The instant contention is patently invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">It is also argued by Duckett that the \u201ctrial court\u2019s stated reason for denying parole demonstrates that petitioner was denied due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The criticized \u201cstated reason\u201d appears in the trial court\u2019s \u201cMemorandum to the File\u201d which, as relevant to our discussion, stated: \u201cIt had been my hopes to talk to the defendant in this case. Because of the absence of so doing, I didn\u2019t feel that I could grant him his parole under 7375(c). During the hearing he sat completely passive, staring off into space, was detached and did not appear to be cognizant of what was going on and appeared to have little or no interest. I felt if I could talk to him, I would see what reactions he did have; and if he did in fact impress me favorably, despite the inconclusive nature of the testimony, I would have released him with some fatherly words of encouragement. I didn\u2019t feel that I should release him without this opportunity for personal contact because I was not impressed with his conduct in the courtroom. I also wanted to see how he acted under the pressure as a witness. When the attorney objected I did not want to force the issue because of the defendant\u2019s unstable background.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AilK\">The burden of proof on the issue whether Duckett could, consistent with the public safety, be paroled into the community where his offenses had been committed rested upon Duckett, or the proponents of his parole. The state\u2019s high court in <em>In re Franklin, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 126, 148, held that \u201cpersons committed under section 1026 may obtain their release by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>no longer a danger to the health and safety of themselves or others.\u201d Although this holding applies to persons who, unlike Duckett, contend that they have recovered their sanity, its rationale applies with equal, if not greater, force to those whose violence-prone psychoses concededly continue. (See <em>In re Jones, </em>260 Cal.App.2d 906, 911-912, fn. 4 [68 Cal.Rptr. 32].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The superior court, from the evidence we have related, could reasonably have concluded and presumably did so conclude, that the proponents of Duckett\u2019s parole had not met the burden of proof imposed upon them by law. The evidence instead was found \u201cinconclusive.\u201d It was reasonable that the court should wish to observe the demeanor of Duckett on the witness stand, and particularly his responses to questions which would probably relate to his promised good behavior and medication. Upon Duckett\u2019s refusal to take the witness stand the court reasonably found a failure of proof, and disapproved the recommendation for his parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A related contention is that the trial court abused its discretion in disapproving the recommendation for outpatient parole in the face of \u201cunanimous expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">There was of course such unanimity on Welfare and Institutions Code section 7375\u2019s requirement that Duckett would probably \u201creceive benefit from parole, . . .\u201d But as we have pointed out, the superior court could reasonably have concluded that there had been a failure of proof, by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d that Duckett no longer posed a substantial threat to the lives and safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">A further contention results from what Duckett describes as: \u201cDenial of an opportunity to make a closing statement....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">From the related proceedings, as quoted <em>ante, </em>we are of the opinion that the trial court\u2019s question of counsel, \u201cAnything further?\u201d might reasonably have been interpreted, as claimed by Duckett\u2019s attorney, as referring to further testimony or other evidence. Under the circumstances the court should have permitted argument, as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>But we note that, \u201csix months hav[ing] elapsed from the date of the last preceding recommendation,\u201d Duckett is again eligible for parole recommendation according to Welfare and Institutions Code section 7375, subdivision (c). It would, we opine, not be in the public, or in Duckett\u2019s, interest to reverse and remand the instant cause for further proceedings. Instead, the state hospital\u2019s medical director, upon an evaluation of Duckett\u2019s <em>present </em>condition, may reinstitute proceedings for his parole according to law. In such event the hearing will be conducted in the manner provided by section 7375, and in accordance with the views we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The petition for habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Racanelli, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 9, 1978, and petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 9, 1978. Newman, J., was of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
