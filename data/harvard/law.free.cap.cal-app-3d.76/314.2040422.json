Covino appeals from an adverse judgment rendered in an action brought for mandamus, declaratory and injunctive relief. The facts leading to the dispute are virtually undisputed, and may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Covino was hired by respondent (hereafter District) on September 17, 1975, as a certificated employee to teach in the English Department of Diablo Valley College. He was employed as a full-time <em>temporary </em>teacher for the period of September 2, 1975 through June 11, 1976, for the purpose of filling the position of a teacher on sabbatical leave. Prior to his employment, by a letter dated July 14, 1975, Covino was advised by the District that he would be hired pursuant to section 13337.5 of the Education Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the District is prohibited from hiring a temporary employee for more than two semesters within three consecutive years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 7, 1976, Covino informed the District that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>wished to be considered as an English instructor for the additional school year of 1976-1977. It is undisputed that sabbatical replacement openings existed in the English Department of Diablo Valley College for that school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In response to his request, on April 29, 1976, Covino was advised that respondent would not reemploy for another year those teachers who had been full-time employees for the current school year. The District admitted that appellant was well qualified and would be acceptable for temporary positions in the English Department for the 1976-1977 school year as a sabbatical replacement but for the District\u2019s inability to hire him for another term as a temporary employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to qualify as a temporary teacher, appellant waived all his potential rights to becoming a probationary (contract) or permanent employee under the statute by virtue of his reemployment for an additional school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">After reconsidering its initial memorandum decision, the trial court, in essence, found that Covino was hired by respondent as a full-time temporary certificated employee for the 1975-1976 school year, and if rehired for 1976-1977 would qualify as a second-year contract (probationary) employee under sections 13336, 13337.5 and 13345.10; that section 13337.3, on which appellant relied, was inapplicable to community college teachers; and that Covino\u2019s purported waiver of his potential tenure rights would be null and void by virtue of section 13338.1. Accordingly, the trial court denied Covino\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate and discharged the alternative writ of mandate previously issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">As the parties agree, the primary issues on appeal are (1) whether respondent, a community college district, may employ Covino as a full-time temporary teacher for an additional school year without granting him the status of a second-year contract (probationary) employee (\u00a7 13345.10;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see also \u00a7\u00a7 13336, 13337.3 and 13337.5), and (2) if probationary status follows as a matter of statute, whether Covino may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>waive his tenure rights under the Education Code in order to facilitate his continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Since the determination of the first issue calls for interpretation of several sections of the Education Code, as a threshold matter we set out. the basic principles governing the construction of statutes. We begin with the fundamental rule that in construing a statute, the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In ascertaining the legislative intent, we turn first to the words used in the statute itself. The words, however, may not be read in isolation, but rather in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute. A corollary to this rule is that the various parts of the statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular phrase, clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672]; see also <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; <em>California Sch. Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Coachella Valley Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 913, 919 [135 Cal.Rptr. 630]; <em>Prunty </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 430, 436 [112 Cal.Rptr. 370]).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">As an additional preliminary matter, we also observe that in resolving the issues before us we must consider and interpret the pertinent statutory provisions as they stood at the time of the present controversy. The newly enacted, reorganized or amended provisions of the Education Code (Stats. 1976, chs. 1010-1011) effective April 30, 1977, will be regarded only to the extent that they have some relevance to the determination of the issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Addressing the merits of the case, we are persuaded that the language of section 13337.5 (now \u00a7 87482) either alone or in combination with section 13336 (now \u00a7 87478) is dispositive of the central issue before us. While section 13337.5 (as much as new \u00a7 87482) empowers the District to hire certificated teachers as temporary employees under certain conditions for a complete school year (but not less than one full semester or quarter), it does contain specific language that flatly and unconditionally prohibits a rehiring of such employees for another school year within a time span of three consecutive years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Although the cited language of section 13337.5 is clear and unambiguous, and thus not subject ,to interpretation (cf. <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 353-354 [139 P.2d 908]; <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 428, 430 [48 Cal.Rptr. 832]), its meaning becomes even clearer when read together with section 13336 and viewed in light of the pertinent case law. Thus, section 13336 further underlines that in case of reemployment for another school year the certificated temporary teacher must be classified as a probationary employee (or under the new terminology, \u201ca contract employee\u201d; see \u00a7 87478).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The cases interpreting the foregoing provisions explain that the third paragraph of section 13337.5 contains a built-in limitation to prevent a school district from employing and reemploying indefinitely a teacher as a temporary employee <em>(Ferner </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 363, 372 [119 Cal.Rptr. 385]; <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 279, 291 [135 Cal.Rptr. 881]), and specifically limits the classification <em>of </em>temporary teacher to persons employed for not more than two semesters or quarters within any period of three consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>years <em>(Balen </em>v. <em>Peralta Junior College Dist. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 821, 829 [114 Cal.Rptr. 589, 523 P.2d 629]). In elaborating on the meaning of the last paragraph of section 13336, the Court of Appeal has made the observation that \u201cIt manifests an intention that when a certificated employee has been employed for one complete school year as a temporary employee, and that person is employed for the following school year in a position requiring certification qualifications, he shall be classified by the governing board as a probationary (here contract) employee.\u201d <em>(Coffey </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>at p. 293.) Since Covino was employed as a temporaiy teacher for two full semesters in the 1975-1976 school year in a position requiring certification qualifications, he may not be reemployed as a temporaiy teacher for another school year within a period of three consecutive years.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Despite the unequivocal language of the statute and the judicial interpretation pertaining thereto, appellant insists that he could be classified as a temporaiy teacher if rehired for another school year or years. Appellant\u2019s main reliance is placed on section 13337.3, which contains language to the effect that the granting of probationary status to a temporary teacher rehired for another school year is mandatory only if the temporaiy teacher is rehired for a <em>vacant </em>position. The position filled by a permanent or probationary teacher who is on leave, argues appellant, is not a vacant position within the meaning of section 13337.3,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and consequently the District is legally authorized to reemploy him as a temporary teacher filling the position left open by tenured teachers on leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Appellant\u2019s argument, ingenious as it may seem, must fail for the simple reason that section 13337.3 is a general statute dealing with school districts in general, while section 13337.5 is a special statute addressing itself to the specific issue before us, i.e., the hiring of a college teacher by a school district maintaining a community college. This important distinction is reflected by the language of section 13337.3, which uses the phrase \u201cthe governing board of <em>a school </em>district\u201d (italics added) without any further specification (see fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>while section 13337.5 speaks about the concrete instance of hiring teachers by a \u201cgoverning board of <em>a school district maintaining a community </em>college\u201d (italics added; see fn. 5, <em>ante). </em>It is, of course, axiomatic that as a matter of statutory interpretation a special statute takes precedence over a general one whether it was passed before or after the adoption of the general enactment <em>(In re Williamson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 651, 654 [276 P.2d 593]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 479 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580]). As spelled out in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 713, 723-724 [123 P.2d 505]: \u201cIt is well settled, also, that a general provision is controlled by one that is special, the latter being treated as an exception to the former. <em>A specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject, as against a general provision, although the latter, standing alone, would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision </em>relates.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Our conclusion that section 13337.3 does not obtain to college teachers is further fortified by the circumstance that while section 13336 is applicable to temporary teachers under section 13337.5, it is clearly inapposite to temporary employees under section 13337.3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, former section 13346.40, which existed as a part of article 3.5 regulating the employment of community college teachers, made specific reference to the employment of temporary college teachers under section 13337.5, but none whatsoever to section 13337,3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We attach no significance to appellant\u2019s assertion that section 87481, the revised form of section 13337.3, now contains the same language as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>section 13337.5 (now \u00a7 87482) insofar as the designation of the school district is concerned. As pointed out earlier, in determining the issues before us we rely primarily on the statutory provisions which existed at the time of the dispute. Furthermore, although section 3 of the revised code provides that \u201cThe provisions of this code, insofar as they are substantially the same as existing statutory provisions relating to the same subject matter, shall be construed as restatements and continuations, and not as new enactments,\u201d it is obvious the new language in section 87481 constitutes a substantial change, and as a consequence is not a proper guide to an eventual interpretation of the earlier provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Appellant\u2019s alternative argument with respect to the issue of waiver requires but a relatively short discussion. Section 13338.1 (now \u00a7 87485) expressly prohibits the waiver of tenure rights by setting forth in part that \u201cExcept as provided in Sections 13406 and 13448, any contract or agreement, express or implied, made by any employee to waive the benefits of this chapter or any part thereof is null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that despite the provisions of the code he should be permitted to waive his right to the probationary status may not be accepted for two major reasons. One, while as a general rule anyone may waive the advantage of law intended solely for his benefit, a law established for a public reason cannot be waived or circumvented by a private act or agreement (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3513; <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 126, 130-131 [71 Cal.Rptr. 322]; 51 Cal.Jur.2d, Waiver, \u00a7 5, p. 313). Teachers are public employees and their tenure rights elaborately regulated by the Education Code reflect the public policy of the state. As stated in <em>De Haviland </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Pictures </em>(1944) 67 Cal.App.2d 225, 235 [153 P.2d 983]: \u201cLegislation which is enacted with the object of promoting the welfare of large classes of workers whose personal services constitute their means of livelihood and which is calculated to confer direct or indirect benefits upon the people as a whole must be presumed to have been enacted for a public reason and as an expression of public policy in the field to which the legislation relates.\u201d Two, appellant\u2019s argument, that the code prohibition should not apply to the instant case because the waiver at issue was made in open court and not effected by way of an agreement as provided by the code, does not have any merit either. Without engaging in a lengthy discussion, suffice to say that the validity of a waiver of/rights which were enacted for a public reason should not depend on the happenstance whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>waiver was incorporated in an agreement or pronounced in the course of a judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Taylor, P. J., and Rouse, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">njnless otherwise indicated, all references will be made to the Education Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The pertinent part of the July 14, 1975 letter reads as follows: \u201cWe are pleased to tentatively offer you employment as a full-time Instructor at Diablo Valley College for the 1975-76 school year. . . .
