Pursuant to the stipulation, he seeks review of an order of the trial court which granted the developer\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the provisions of the federal act require a showing of malice before punitive damages may be awarded, and that, in any event, the record before the court, at the time it made its order for partial summary judgment, demonstrated that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the developer acted with oppression, fraud or malice, express or implied, as prescribed by state law. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294.) In resolving these issues we are faced with differences of opinion voiced by the parties concerning the effect of the stipulated judgment, with respect to this court\u2019s scope of review of an order for partial summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and with respect to the interpretation of federal law, and the state law of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">We conclude that the stipulated judgment neither adds nor detracts from the validity of the trial court\u2019s order for partial summary judgment. It must stand on the record made at that time; that the federal act must be interpreted under federal, not state, law; that the plaintiff failed to produce any facts which would give rise to punitive damages for invasion of privacy, or for punitive damages under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. The court properly ordered partial summary judgment, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Defendant developer subscribed to a credit bureau in 1970. In March 1971 it received from the credit bureau a copy of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act which was to become effective April 26, 1971. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681-1681t.) The act requires in respect to \u201cCompliance Procedure\u201d \u201c. . . These procedures shall require that prospective users of the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1681e.) A covering letter advised the customer of the legal requirements of the act, and instructions were given concerning the use of security digits to obtain credit information.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The \u201cPermissible Purposes of Reports\u201d are listed in section 1681b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was in effect stipulated that none of the purposes other than an alleged \u201clegitimate business need,\u201d were involved in the defendant\u2019s subsequent inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In the spring of 1974 the developer, through a subsidiary, was developing a project for single family residences in San Jose. The plaintiff owned a residence on Nancarrow Way and was president of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>local homeowners\u2019 association in the area behind which the development was being constructed. In plaintiff\u2019s area development had been pursued on 8,000-square-foot lots as required by existing zoning regulations. The developer, however, had taken advantage of a low density cluster procedure, which permitted, without public hearing, a reduction of lot size, in this case to 6,000 square feet, in return for additional public open space, here dedication of certain land for a park. The plaintiff was concerned that the reduction of lot sizes would reduce property values in his area and would result in buildings so close to his rear property line as to compromise his privacy. He and his neighbors were also concerned about the height of the structures to be erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s first contact with the developer was a short conversation with the superintendent on the job concerning a drainage ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">On April 29, 1974, as president of the homeowners\u2019 association, he wrote a letter to the division manager of the developer expressing his concern about the development to the rear of his property and requesting a meeting to resolve the areas of controversy. The letter threatened legal action if satisfactory arrangements were not effected. In response the manager on May 1, 1974, asked the company engineer to arrange a meeting with the plaintiff and the city planning commission to explain the circumstances resulting in reduced lot sizes to plaintiff. During the ensuing period the plaintiff telephoned the manager on perhaps six occasions for the purpose of discussing the proposed meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The meeting took place on May 9, 1974, and was attended by plaintiff and two friends, the developer\u2019s engineer, and two members of the staff of the planning department. Plaintiff denied that he at any time accused anyone of blackmail, bribery or anything of that nature. The depositions of the six other participants were taken, but they leave it uncertain as to the express terminology employed by plaintiff in attacking the grant of the reduced lot size. It is clear that plaintiff complained of a transaction whereby the developer secured smaller, and therefore more, building sites, by donating what was termed a rock pile to the city. It did appear that the city itself had suggested low density cluster zoning in exchange for dedication for the park land. The witnesses\u2019 testimony as a whole leaves it unclear but suggests, that plaintiff was claiming an impropriety on behalf of the city or the developer or both. In any event, the engineer reported in a letter to the manager that the homeowner\u2019s president <em>\u201csaid </em>he thought [the developer\u2019s subsidiary] had blackmailed <em>the City by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>giving them the useless rockpile for a park in order to get reduced lot sizes.\u201d He also noted that the plaintiff again threatened legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Upon receipt of this letter the manager deemed it prudent to know more about the plaintiff in order to protect the developer\u2019s business interests, which he considered threatened by an attack on its reputation. In his deposition he stated, \u201cSometimes, when I get characters like [plaintiff] calling me and harassing me, I like to find out who he is. . . . You get a flaky letter like that, you want to know who you\u2019re dealing with, I just want to know who he is. I want to know whether he lives near the property. I want to know what valid reason he has for writing me a letter like this.\u201d His secretary also volunteered that perhaps the manager wanted to find out whether the homeowner\u2019s president had any \u201cpolitical pull\u201d since housing projects of that nature were their \u201cbread and butter.\u201d Accordingly, the manager directed the secretary to call the credit bureau and find out by whom the plaintiff was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On May 16, 1974, the secretary telephoned, and gave appropriate code numbers to the operator at the credit bureau. She asked for a verbal report on the plaintiff. At that time the secretary was advised that the file on plaintiff\u2019s name was a mixed file containing information on two persons of the same name; that he was either a jewelry representative or a city administrator, and no accurate information could be given. The secretary relayed this information to the manager and he instructed her to drop the matter and not seek any more information.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">On June 11, 1974, the plaintiff had occasion to visit the credit bureau in order to straighten out his file. At that time he learned of the developer\u2019s inquiry of May 16. A representative of the credit bureau phoned the developer\u2019s office and received confirmation from the manager\u2019s secretary that such an inquiry had been made. At the same <em>time </em>plaintiff secured a letter from the credit bureau manager verifying that the May 16 inquiry had been made. The letter indicated that as a matter of course a corrected report based upon the revised file would be sent <em>to </em>the developer. Plaintiff interposed no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence reflected that he in fact is a jewelry salesman, and for various reasons including, presumably, his physical well being as a target of robbery, his employment and occupation are very personal to him. When, on June 11, he found out that the developer had made the inquiry of the credit bureau, he became frustrated and could not believe it. <em>It </em>was reflected in his work immediately. He could not think of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>anything else, and his sales went down. He could hot sleep at night and he was very upset. His business trip after ascertaining that inquiiy had been made was disastrous; he had his mind on the inquiry during that time and was not functioning properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">On June 27, 1974, plaintiff filed the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Thereafter in the ordinary course of business, without further request from the developer, and there having been no objection interposed by plaintiff, despite his notification that the credit bureau intended to do so, a full credit report was forwarded to the developer and received by it July 15, 1974. The written report included plaintiff\u2019s employment, his wife\u2019s employment, a list of his charge accounts, the balances, his credit rating by eight different stores and commercial enterprises, and other information. Since suit had been filed it was foiwarded to the developer\u2019s attorneys without being examined by the manager or his secretary. The developer, believing itself obligated to do so, paid for the credit report. Meanwhile, on July 12, 1974, the developer was suspended from membership in the credit bureau because of the litigation involving its inquiiy of May 16, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The foregoing facts are found in declarations submitted by the parties in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for partial summary judgment, and in plaintiff\u2019s response thereto and his motion for summary judgment. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201con all factual issues raised by Plaintiff relating to punitive damages, there being no triable issue of fact on said issues\u201d; and it denied the remainder of the relief sought by the parties\u2019 motions. Following the entry of an order for partial summary judgment, the parties stipulated for judgment as outlined above (see fn. 1), and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The stipulation recites, \u201cJudgment in this action may be entered in favor of plaintiff . . . and against defendant ... in the amount of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) as to all issues raised in the first amended complaint and as to all issues, raised in the pretrial conference order, upon the following additional terms and conditions . . . .\u201d (See fn. 1.) Plaintiff construes this as a judgment in his favor as to each issue raised in the first amended complaint and in the pretrial conference order, excepting, however, the issue of punitive damages, which concededly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>had been disposed of by the court\u2019s order for partial summary judgment, and was expressly reserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">On the other hand, the defendant asserts that the principal and only purpose of the stipulated judgment was to dispose of the other issues, so that there would be an appealable judgment to secure review of the court\u2019s earlier ruling. The stipulation waiving findings of fact and conclusions of law leaves the matter undetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The issue is important because punitive damages are not awarded as a matter of course for every violation of the federal act. Sections 168In and 168lo distinguish between the civil liability of user of information which \u201cwillfully fails\u201d to comply with any requirement imposed under the act, and a user which \u201cis negligent in failing\u201d to so comply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concededly the issues raised in the first amended complaint and in the pretrial conference order were (1) willful noncompliance with the federal act, (2) negligent noncompliance with the federal act, and (3) common law invasion of privacy. When the defendant confessed judgment in the sum of $100 in satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s right to compensatory damages under each and all of those claims it did not of necessity concede the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claims on each issue. In other words, at this stage of the proceedings the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the evidence before the trial court revealed facts, which if believed, would bring the case within section 168In.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In granting the motion for partial summary judgment the trial court stated, \u201cWell, I think that a recovery of punitive damages would have to involve the elements that are normally required in California for punitive damages, and I don\u2019t think on the evidence that we have to rule on in this motion that there is evidence of that intent to vex, injure, annoy the Plaintiff.\u201d Insofar as this statement implies an intent to engraft the provisions of California Civil Code section 3294 onto federal law, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>erroneous. The act confers jurisdiction to enforce civil liabilities under the act in a United States District Court or \u201cin any other Court of competent jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 168lp.) This grant of concurrent jurisdiction is not intended to create rights subject to 50 different rules of interpretation, but merely creates a more convenient forum for those individuals who have been injured by noncompliance with the act. It is basic that the substantive rights created by federal law are controlled by that law. It is only in matters of procedure and practice that the states, given concurrent jurisdiction over actions created by federal law, may assert their local law. (See <em>Free </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 663, 666 [8 L.Ed.2d 180, 183, 82 S.Ct. 1089]; <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Pacific Far East Lines </em>(1973) 29 Cal.App.3d 883, 886-889 [105 Cal.Rptr. 885]; and <em>Ackerley </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau of Sheridan, Inc. </em>(D.C. Wyo. 1974) 385 F.Supp. 658, 661.) In the case last cited the court stated: \u201cThe remedies provided by the Act are of a federal statutory nature, and thus defendant\u2019s contention that any right to relief in the form of damages is to be determined by state court decisions is ill-taken.\u201d (385 F.Supp. at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">On the Other hand the trial court, in an attempt to construe the federal statute\u2019s distinction between a willful failure to comply, and a negligent failure to comply with the provisions of the act, may have been drawing an analogy from California law between Cases of ordinary negligence where no punitive damages are recoverable (see <em>Gombos </em>v. <em>Ashe </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 517, 526-530 [322 P.2d 933]) and the cases under Civil Code section 3294 where the defendant has been guilty of such oppression, fraud or malice, express or implied, as will justify punitive damages. In the latter case he was attempting to construe federal law. The propriety of that interpretation is reviewed below. (Part III, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In any event we cannot determine whether the court in denying all of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment believed that plaintiff\u2019s right to go to trial on the issue of compensatory damages rested on a right to recover for negligent noncompliance with the federal act, on an alleged erroneous limitation on the right to recover for willful noncompliance with the act, or on a basic invasion of privacy without malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Plaintiff contends that discussions at the time of entry of judgment establish that inherent in the judgment is a finding that there was a willful failure to comply with the act. On inquiry by defense counsel, the court indicated that there were purposes for the stipulated judgment other than merely to provide a final judgment from which an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>could be taken as to the partial summary judgment part, and counsel acquiesced.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the same time the court asked the plaintiff personally if he concurred in the agreement embodied in the stipulation. The plaintiff advised the court, \u201cI have a question, Your Honor, ... on my mind. Does this judgment in layman\u2019s language, admit that [the developer] has invaded my privacy?\u201d The court replied, \u201cYou felt that they have, and based on that feeling you brought a complaint against them saying that they have, seeking damages. Now they have agreed that judgment may be rendered in your favor on that complaint, awarding damages.\u201d At the court\u2019s request counsel for defendant indicated his agreement with that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Neither of these admissions by the defendant indicates that it had conceded that, nor that the judgment established that, a willful noncompliance with the federal act, as contemplated by section 168 In entitling the plaintiff to punitive damages, had occurred. All we can gather from the four corners of the stipulation and judgment is that the plaintiff surrendered his rights to compensatory damages under the various theories advanced, in return for the $100 judgment, reserving the right to appeal and further litigate the issue of his right to punitive damages. The question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to punitive damages must be determined from the record made in connection with the motions, without any aid from the stipulation or the judgment entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Plaintiff, in support of his cause of action for violation of his right of privacy and the right to recover punitive damages because of the developer\u2019s invasion of that right, relies upon the provisions added to section 1 of article I of the California Constitution in 1972, and reiterated in the revision of the article in 1974. It now reads, \u201cAll people are by nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.\u201d In <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>533 P.2d 222], the court reviewed the purpose of the 1972 amendment in the light of the statement drafted by the proponents of the provision and included in the election brochure. It concluded: \u201cSeveral important points emerge from this election brochure \u2018argument,\u2019 a statement which represents, in essence, the only \u2018legislative history\u2019 of the constitutional amendment available to us. First, the statement identifies the principal \u2018mischiefs\u2019 at which the amendment is directed: (1) \u2018government snooping\u2019 and the secret gathering of personal information; (2) the overbroad collection and retention of unnecessary personal information by government and business interests; (3) the improper use of information properly obtained for a specific purpose, for example, the use of it for another purpose or the disclosure of it to some third party; and (4) the lack of a reasonable check on the accuracy of existing records. Second, the statement makes clear that the amendment does not purport to prohibit all incursion into individual privacy but rather that any such intervention must be justified by a compelling interest. Third, the statement indicates that the amendment is intended to be self-executing, i.e., that the constitutional provision, in. itself, \u2018creates a legal and enforceable right of privacy for every Californian.\u2019 \u201d (13 Cal.3d at p. 775, fn. omitted. See also <em>Porten </em>v. <em>University of San Francisco </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 825, 832 [134 Cal.Rptr. 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Here the plaintiff recognizes the necessity for the legitimate collection of information bearing on his credit by the credit agency. He complains, however, that information, properly collected for that purpose, was improperly secured by the developer for the sinister purpose of silencing him as an individual, disparaging him in the community, and attacking him as president of the homeowners\u2019 association, so that the association and its opposition to the development could be buried forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">There is nothing in the record to sustain the foregoing charges. All that appears is that the developer sought to ascertain something concerning the identity of a person who appeared to be questioning the probity of the proceedings which. had resulted in the approval of its planned development, and who was threatening to sue it. This case bears no resemblance to the reported activities of our largest domestic automobile manufacturer in investigating and harassing its most persistent critic. There is no evidence to show that the developer sought to develop further information concerning plaintiff, whether derogatory or favorable, or that it ever disseminated or otherwise used any information concerning plaintiff for any purpose whatsoever. Under those circumstances it is questionable whether the award of nominal compensatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>damages, if appealable, could have been sustained, much less an award of punitive damages. (Cf., however, <em>Porten </em>v. <em>University of San Francisco, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 825, 832.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">We recognize that an unreasonably intrusive investigation is a tort for which damages are recoverable. (See <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 654, 659-660 [109 Cal.Rptr. 269, 73 A.L.R.3d 1164].) The test is what is objectionable or offensive to the reasonable man. <em>(Id.) </em> Here the plaintiff, by his argument that the developer should have telephoned and asked him his occupation, has in effect admitted that it is not objectionable or offensive to seek to determine the identity and occupation of a potential legal adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Since there was no general disclosure in this case there was no violation of the so-called \u201cpublic disclosure of private facts\u201d branch of the tort of invasion of privacy. (See <em>Porten </em>v. <em>University of San Francisco, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 825, 828-829; <em>Timperley </em>v. <em>Chase Collection Service </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 697, 700-701 [77 Cal.Rptr. 782]; and <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 694, 698-699 [50 Cal.Rptr. 808, 19 A.L.R.3d 1310], Cf. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Hearst Publishing Co. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 224, 228-229 [253 P.2d 441]; <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 273, 276-280 [239 P.2d 630]; <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>American Photocopy etc. Co. </em>(1955) 138 Cal.App.2d 82, 85-87 [291 P.2d 194]; and Civ. Code, \u00a7 43.) In the cases last cited the test is whether the offending party\u2019s conduct is such that he should have realized that it would be offensive to persons of ordinary sensibilities. <em>(Gill </em>v. <em>Hearst Publishing Co., supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 224, 229; and <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Curtis Publishing Co., supra, </em>38 Cal.2d 273, 280.)  The developer cannot be charged with offending the plaintiff\u2019s sensibilities because it instituted an inquiry into his occupation, when plaintiff, himself, indicates he would have divulged that information in a phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">We further note that even under the doctrine last discussed, a person by his own activities or by force of circumstances, may become a public personage, and thereby relinquish a part of his right of privacy to the extent that the public has a legitimate interest in his doings, affairs or character. (See <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Fawcett Publications, Inc. </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 733, 747 [20 Cal.Rptr. 405]; and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 807, 811-812 [292 P.2d 600].)  So here, by taking up the cudgels for his neighbors, by undertaking to influence public officials in their favor, and by threatening to sue the developer, the plaintiff made himself a public figure in a sense. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the arena was small, but the interest in his character and the nature of his employment certainly extended to those members of the public which included the developer he was attacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In the same view we note that the court in <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 757, recognized: \u201c. . . the statement makes clear that the amendment does not purport to prohibit all incursion into individual privacy but rather that any such intervention must be justified by a compelling interest.\u201d (13 Cal.3d at p. 775. See also <em>Loder </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 859, 864 [132 Cal.Rptr. 464, 553 P.2d 624] [cert, den.]; and <em>Porten </em>v. <em>University of San Francisco, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 825, 832.) Application of such an exception involves a balancing of interests. The plaintiff\u2019s alleged invasion here presumes that he can adopt the public posture noted above without exposing himself to some invasion of privacy. Such is not the case. (See <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662, 670-672 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">There is broad language in <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>American Photocopy etc. Co., supra, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 82, which appears to furnish some support to plaintiff. The court stated: \u201cThe motives of a person charged with invading the right [of privacy] are not material with respect to the determination whether there is a right of action, and malice is not an essential element of a violation of the right.\u201d (138 Cal.App.2d at p. 87.) It added, \u201cPlaintiff is entitled to compensation for injury to his peace of mind and to his feelings. The recoverable compensation for these items is difficult to determine since they afford no definite criteria for the ascertainment of damages. In a case of this character there can be no direct evidence of the amount of damages sustained, nor the amount of money which will compensate for the injury. The measure of damages therefore is for the trier of fact, and in assessing such damages he is accorded a wide and elastic discretion.\u201d <em>{Id, </em>p. 88.) The foregoing statements must be read in connection with the facts of that case, which are stated as follows: \u201cDefendant, without plaintiff\u2019s consent, advertised far and wide that plaintiff was a satisfied user of the machine. Plaintiff was not a satisfied user. The representation was false. The record warrants the inference that when defendant circulated the advertisement it knew plaintiff was not a satisfied user. The advertisement amounted to a pretended endorsement or recommendation of defendant\u2019s product. It was an unauthorized and unwarranted appropriation of plaintiff\u2019s personality as a lawyer for pecuniary gain and profit. The advertising use of plaintiff\u2019s name, without his consent, is comprehended within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>narrowest definition of the right of privacy.\u201d (138 Cal.App.2d at p. 87.) Here no such charges were alleged and proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The alleged damages in this case were not occasioned by any publicity given to plaintiff\u2019s occupation by the developer. As we have noted there is not a scintilla of evidence to reflect any harassment of plaintiff by that defendant. His paranoiac concern with the revelation of his occupation was not warranted by anything that is in the record. He cannot claim that the developer was seeking information to turn a robbery ring against him. His fears cannot be justified as ordinary sensibilities to the slight revelation that was effected in this case. In <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Fawcett Publications, Inc., supra, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 733, the court concluded: \u201cWhile plaintiff is entitled to a sympathetic understanding of his desire not to have publicized the details of his early marriage, we must hold, for the reasons stated, that he has no cause of action for an invasion of his right of privacy. As is said in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>General Finance &amp; Thrift Corp., </em>80 Ga.App. 708 [57 S.E.2d 225, 227]: \u2018. .. the protection afforded by the law to the right of privacy must be restricted to \u201cordinary sensibilities\u201d and not to supersensitiveness or agoraphobia. (41 Am.Jur., \u00a7 12, pp. 934-935.) There are some shocks, inconveniences and annoyancies [sic] which members of society in the nature of things must absorb without the right of redress.\u2019 \u201d (201 Cal.App.2d at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">From the foregoing we can but conclude that plaintiff has recovered at best more than he was entitled to for any alleged invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">If we were to assume, contrary to our conclusion (part I above) that the stipulated judgment established that there was an invasion of privacy, we still find a paucity of proof to establish punitive damages on that cause of action. <em> </em>It is true that exemplary damages are awarded to serve as an example or warning to others not to engage in conduct found to be proscribed by Civil Code section 3294. <em>(Wetherbee </em>v. <em>United Ins. Co. of America </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 266, 270 [95 Cal.Rptr. 678].) The amount of such damages is a matter generally within the discretion of the jury. <em>(Ferraro </em>v. <em>Pacific Fin. Co. </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 339, 350-352 [87 Cal.Rptr. 226].) \u201cIn order to justify an award of exemplary damages, the defendant must be guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294.) He must act with the intent to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. [Citations.] While we have concluded that defendant violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing, this alone does not necessarily establish that defendant acted with the requisite intent to injure plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>California Life Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 452, 462-463 [113 Cal.Rptr. 711, 521 P.2d 1103], Cf. <em>Toole </em>v. <em>Richardson-Merrell, Inc. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 689, 711-717 [60 Cal.Rptr. 398, 29 A.L.R.3d 988].)  We reiterate, the record fails to sustain plaintiff\u2019s conclusion that the developer\u2019s inquiry was designed to come within the requirements last set forth. No other conduct has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on cases involving abuse of process (see <em>Spellens </em>v. <em>Spellens </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 210, 230-233 [317 P.2d 613]; and <em>Tranchina </em>v. <em>Arcinas </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 522, 524-527 [178 P.2d 65]), similarly fails for lack of supporting evidence to show that the developer used the muddled information which it received for any improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">There was no error in granting summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for punitive damages for invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">We return to examine the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.

In determining whether a defendant may take advantage of the privilege, it has been held that malice may be inferred if the defendant does not have reasonable or probable cause to believe his statement to be true.

Likewise, Congress had authority to fix liability, including punitive damages and attorney fees, for willful violations of those requirements. O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the Act is, we submit, without merit.\u201d <em>(Millstone </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hanlon Reports, Inc. </em>(8th Cir. 1976) 528 F.2d 829, 833.) Principal emphasis has been on the protection of consumers from inaccurate or arbitrary information in a consumer report which is used as a factor in determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for credit, insurance or employment. (See <em>Ley </em>v. <em>Boron Oil Co. </em>(W.D.Pa. 1976) 419 F.Supp. 1240, 1242-1243; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Retail Credit Co. </em>(E.D. Mich. 1976) 410 F.Supp. 924, 931-932; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(D.C.Idaho 1976) 405 F.Supp. 1318, 1319-1320; <em>Belshaw v.

It is generally recognized that the act does not apply to commercial credit reports issued for purposes other than \u201cestablishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) employment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under section 1681b of [the act].\u201d (See fn. 2 above.) (\u00a7 1681a(d); <em>Wrigley </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ga. 1974) 375 F.Supp. 969, 970; <em>Sizemore </em>v. <em>Bambi Leasing Corporation </em>(N.D.Ga. 1973) 360 F.Supp. 252, 253-254; and <em>Krumholz </em>v. <em>TRW, Inc., supra, </em>142 N.J.Super. 80, 84 [360 A.2d 413, 415].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In <em>Ley </em>v. <em>Boron Oil Co., supra, </em>419 F.Supp. 1240, the defendant, as was the developer in this case, was threatened with litigation. It requested its credit manager to find out who the writer of a letter was, and the credit manager ordered a credit report from a commercial credit agency. The plaintiff was interviewed and declined all information. He then brought suit for violation of the federal act. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court concluded that the report which formed the basis for the suit was not an investigative consumer report within the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>section 1681a(d). It stated, \u201cWhether a report by a consumer reporting agency on a consumer is a \u2018consumer report\u2019 under the Act depends, therefore, on the contents of the report and the purpose of the report.. .. [If] The very purpose of the present inquiry and the information contained in the report in question does not relate to consumer credit as outlined in the statement of purpose of the statute. The report indicates that plaintiff is an attorney who maintains a private law office, but he is employed by the United States Steel Company. It recites his residence, marital status, age and absence of any civil or criminal court records concerning him. Thus the report was not sought for credit purposes and gives no credit information, but rather was sought to establish the identity of the person writing the letter in the capacity of an attorney-at-law, representing parties who threatened a lawsuit against Boron Oil Company. Because the recipient of the letter, Boron Oil Company, had known another attorney as representing the claimants and could not find the writer of the letter listed as an attorney under the listings in the Pittsburgh Telephone Directory, it instituted an inquiry to learn of his identity. The report does not relate to the extension of credit or other benefits to the plaintiff as a consumer. It is thus not a \u2018consumer report\u2019 under the statute.\u201d (419 F.Supp. at p. 1242.) The court also reviewed the legislative history of the act and the interpretation given it by the Federal Trade Commission, and concluded: \u201cIt is clear that the statute regulates the reporting of credit matters involving individuals as consumers, and was not meant to cover business credit reports pertaining to the business activities of the person reported on. It is also clear from the evidentiary material supplied by the parties on both sides here that it was the business or professional standing of an attorney who threatened suit and invited negotiations which was the subject matter of the inquiry and the report.\u201d (419 F.Supp. at p. 1243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Similarly, a report prepared in connection with a mother\u2019s attempt to secure increased child support and medical expenses from the child\u2019s father has been held to not be a \u201cconsumer report\u201d within the terms of the federal act. <em>(Gardner </em>v. <em>Investigators, Inc. </em>(M.D.Fla. 1976) 413 F.Supp. 780, 781-782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>405 F.Supp. 1318, a candidate, successful in securing election to Congress, found that a credit report secured by the defendant jewelers and delivered to his primary election opponent, had found its way into the hands of a House Committee investigating the congressman\u2019s campaign financing. It was alleged that the jewelers had willfully and negligently failed to comply with the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>federal act. The court rendered summary judgment for the defendants. It analyzed the statute as follows: \u201cSection 1681 states the congressional findings and purpose. Section 1681a is a definition section. Section 1681b relates solely to consumer reporting agencies, and not to users, as the defendants here were. The same is true of section 1681c. Section 168 Id refers solely to investigative reports. The report here involved is not an investigative report. Sections 168le, f, and g relate solely to consumer reporting agencies, as do subsections 1681h(a), (b), (c), and (d). Subsection 168 lh(e) will be considered more fully in answer to the claim on which plaintiffs most strongly rely. Sections 1681i, j, k, and <em>l </em>relate to consumer reporting agencies. Section 1681m does impose duties on the user but only in those cases where, as a result Of information received from a credit reporting agency, or others, credit has been denied or the charge for it increased. No credit was involved here. Defendants did not violate any of the sections or subsections of Section 1681 imposing duties.\u201d (405 F.Supp. at p. 1319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Section 1681h, subdivision (e), provides: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 1681n and 1681\u00bb of this title, no consumer may bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation, invasion of privacy, or negligence with respect to the reporting of information against any consumer reporting agency, any user of information, or any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency, based on information disclosed pursuant to section 1681g, 168 lh, or 1681m of this title, except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.\u201d The court continued: \u201cAs indicated, the Act does impose upon consumer reporting agencies, and upon the users of consumer reports, certain duties. Sections 168 In and <em>o </em>provide remedies conditioned upon either wilful or negligent failures to comply with the imposed duties. However, in the absence of a violation of some other section of the Act, there is no liability under Sections 1681n and o. If it was the congressional intent that Subsection 168 lh(e) should extend the liability imposed by Sections 168 In and <em>o, </em>then the extension goes no further than to create a right where false information is furnished with malice or wilful intent to injure.\u201d (405 F.Supp. at pp. 1319-1320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><em>Belshaw </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau of Prescott, supra, </em>392 F.Supp. 1356, involved an action against a credit bureau and a law. firm charging that defendants caused investigative consumer reports and/or consumer reports to be made about plaintiff without complying with the act, and that the practices utilized in making and using these reports invaded his privacy. In examining the claim against the credit bureau the court rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>contention that the act was inapplicable because the user, the defendant law firm, did not intend to use the report for any of the purposes enumerated in part (3) of section 1681b. (See fn. 2 above.) The court observed, \u201cCongress\u2019 concern was to protect consumers from the misuse of information acquired by credit reporting agencies. The Act cannot be interpreted as applicable to the activities of credit reporting agencies only when the consumer applies for credit, insurance, or employment, leaving them otherwise free to continue the very practices the Act was designed to prohibit. The Act would afford little protection for the privacy of a consumer if it only regulated credit reporting agencies in the area of their legitimate business activities but left them free to continue their clandestine activities in other areas.\u201d (392 F.Supp. at p. 1359.) It concluded: \u201cIn order for \u00a7 168 lb(3) to be meaningful, \u2018consumer report\u2019 must be interpreted to mean any report made by a credit reporting agency of information <em>that could be used </em>for one of the purposes enumerated in \u00a7 1681a. Only then can \u00a7 1681b be given the meaning Congress intended. Section 1681b states the purposes for which such reports legitimately may be used. Its clear implication is that there are some purposes for which consumer reports may <em>not </em>be furnished. [If] If the Act is read in this manner, plaintiff\u2019s first claim presents the issue whether defendant Credit Bureau violated \u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681e, 1681g, I681n, and 1681o of the Act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 1359-1360.) The credit bureau\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The court did dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the law firm. It stated, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s second claim for relief alleges that defendant Favour &amp; Quail violated \u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681d, 1681e and 1681g of the Act. Section 168Id requires the procurer of an investigative consumer report to disclose to the consumer that a report on him may be made. However, counsel for plaintiff conceded that there was only one consumer report prepared. Since no investigative consumer report was procured, \u00a7 168Id of the Act could not have been violated. Defendant Favour &amp; Quail cannot have violated \u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681e or 1681g, because it is not a consumer reporting agency as defined by \u00a7 1681a(f) of the Act. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s second claim must be dismissed against defendant Favour &amp; Quail.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 1361. Cf. <em>Beresh v. Retail Credit Co., Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1973) 358 F.Supp. 260, 261-262.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The foregoing precedents indicate that the plaintiff secured more relief than he was entitled to under the federal act, when he recovered the $100 stipulated judgment. It must be borne in mind that at the time the plaintiff discovered that inquiry had been made of the credit bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>no definite information was available. Having been advised of the inquiry, and of the credit bureau\u2019s intention to furnish a credit report, the plaintiff could not sit idly by without protest and then claim his rights were violated by an act done with his implied consent. The law will not permit one to so manufacture a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We are mindful that the Federal Trade Commission in the exercise of its jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the act (\u00a7 1681s) has published a pamphlet \u201cCompliance With The Fair Credit Reporting Act.\u201d (See 2d ed. 1973, as promulgated by Division of Consumer Credit and Special Programs, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Fed. Trade Com., as reported 5 C.C.H. Consumer Credit Guide, p. 59781 et seq., H 11301 et seq.) Part IV of the pamphlet deals with the compliance obligations on the reporting industry. Part A deals with the subject of consumer reports, and subdivision (3) reviews the purposes authorized under Public Law No. 9031, title VI, section 604 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b). The commission states: \u201c(c) Reports may be issued to a person who has a legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction for personal, family, or household purposes involving the consumer. The legitimate business need category does not include purposes such as marketing research, an attorney investigating prospective jurors, \u2018protective bulletins\u2019 and blacklists. . . .\u201d As has been noted above, the obligation of compliance is one imposed on the credit bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Section 1681q does provide: \u201cAny person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, of both.\u201d The.record here does not support a finding that the defendant knowingly and willfully obtained the confused information concerning the nature of the occupation of the persons bearing the plaintiff\u2019s name by making any false representation to the agency. Even if it did, there would be no right of action in the plaintiff unless false information were developed, and adverse action were taken thereon by the user, or unless the user caused a new consumer investigation report to be made without the consent of or notice to the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">We conclude that there was no error in the trial court\u2019s order granting the developer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether any triable issue was raised concerning the recovery of punitive damages under the provisions of section 168 In of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The foregoing conclusions render it unnecessary to explore further any differences of opinion among the parties concerning the scope of review of the order granting the motion for summary judgment. The principles are clearly set forth in that portion of section 437c set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case there is a voluminous record of interrogatories, depositions, and declarations. The trial court was entitled to and compelled to review all this material. <em>(See Estate of Kerner </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 785, 788-790 [80 Cal.Rptr. 289].) Here the record fails to show any triable issues of fact for punitive damages under either the common law or under the federal act. Plaintiff\u2019s surmise and conjecture as to what the developer may possibly have intended to do does not rise to the stature of proof. The trial court properly granted the motion for partial summary judgment. (See <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 284-285 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206]; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 671, 674 [123 Cal.Rptr. 525]; <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 405, 410-411 [93 Cal.Rptr. 338]; <em>Estate of Kerner, supra, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 785, 789.
