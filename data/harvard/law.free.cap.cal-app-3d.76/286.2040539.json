J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\">Appelant appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his petition for a writ of mandate directing respondent to set aside and vacate its order that appellant desist and refrain from performing certain activities<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without first obt\u00e1ining a real estate license. The issues framed by the pleadings were tried below upon the administrative record and the briefs filed, by the parties. Following the hearing the trial court rendered its findings of fact and conclusions of law, reproduced in pertinent part in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant neither objected to the proposed findings nor submitted counterfindings.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Appellant\u2019s contentions present questions concerning (1) the sufficiency and propriety of the findings; and (2) whether the real estate licensing statutes and regulations may be validly applied to appellant\u2019s business activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Appellant initially complains that the trial court failed to exercise its independent judgment in making necessaiy findings and conclusions on the material issues presented. In essence, he contends that the similarity between the findings of the court and those upon which respondent based its administrative decision suggests an absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>independent exercise of judicial discretion. Such complaint is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">As previously stated, the record does not indicate that appellant either objected to the findings, proposed counterfindings and conclusions, or otherwise manifested that an \u201comission, ambiguity or conflict [in the findings] was brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 634.) Under such circumstances, a reviewing court must assume the existence of any findings and conclusions favorable to respondent in support of the judgment. (Code Civ. Proc.; \u00a7 634; <em>In re Marriage of Dawley </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 342, 354 [131 Cal.Rptr. 3, 551 P.2d 323]; <em>Banville </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 92, 102 [112 Cal.Rptr. 126]; <em>Associated Creditors\u2019 Agency </em>v. <em>Dunning Floor Covering, Inc. </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 558, 559 [71 Cal.Rptr. 494]; <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Meacham </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 248, 253 [68 Cal.Rptr. 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In interpreting the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 634, it has been held that a failure to file objections or counterfindings, or to request special findings as therein provided, constitutes a waiver of any claim that such findings are not sufficiently specific. <em>(Shanahan </em>v. <em>Macco Constr. Co. </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 327, 333 [36 Cal.Rptr. 584].) Appellant\u2019s companion claim of error in the court\u2019s failure to specifically find whether respondent exceeded its jurisdiction in not proceeding in the manner required by law, and whether the administrative decision was supported by the findings and evidence, actually relate to conclusions of law rather than factual determinations.  The conclusions of law, in and of themselves, are of no legal consequence and \u201cdespite their mention in C.C.P. 632, ... are a relatively useless appendage. The important conclusion of law is the <em>judgment. </em>If the findings support the judgment [as here] it will be affirmed, regardless of whether the findings support the conclusions, or whether the conclusions of law are consistent or properly stated, or even if the conclusions are omitted entirely.\u201d (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 304, p. 3113; see also <em>Estate of Grimble </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 741, 750 [117 Cal.Rptr. 125], citing the text.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Assuming, arguendo, that the proper standard of review of the evidence required the application of the independent judgment test (see <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c)), the record clearly demonstrates that the trial court \u201cexercised its independent judgment on the evidence\u201d in reaching its decision. Appellant\u2019s implied assertion, without supporting authority, that the superficial similarity between the judicial and administrative findings somehow casts doubt upon the validity of the former is specious and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Appellant\u2019s remaining claim of insufficiency of the evidence regarding application of the licensing statutes and regulations to his activities is discussed hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Appellant argues that respondent has no jurisdiction to regulate the business activities in question. This argument is broadly premised on three theories: (1) that the provisions of the California Real Estate Law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are inapplicable in the absence of substantial evidence supporting a factual determination of the requisite licensee status; (2) his acts fall within the \u201cfinder\u2019s\u201d exception to the licensing requirements; (3) the licensing statutes, as applied, are unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>Licensee Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Appellant challenges the findings and conclusions of the court that his activities are circumscribed by the licensing statutes and regulations governing real estate licensees (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10130-10132<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) and \u201cadvance fee\u201d rental agents (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>10, art. 17, \u00a7 2850<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>). He argues that these provisions apply only to conduct of <em>licensed </em>brokers or salesmen (it was stipulated that appellant was not so licensed) and that there was no evidence he acted in the capacity of a licensee. Neither argument is supported in reason or the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The evidence considered below discloses that appellant owns and operates a property rental data service initially under the name of \u201cRental Data Systems\u201d and thereafter as \u201cConsumer Data Systems\u201d (CDS) providing rental information to prospective tenants. The service consists of a printed pamphlet furnished to subscribers upon payment in advance of a $15 fee, containing descriptions and terms of available rentals; the \u201cavailability list\u201d or pamphlet is produced in a typical classified-advertisement format and lists the address of the rental and telephone number of the advertiser. Appellant provides his advertising service to rental advertisers free of charge; his major source of advertisers consists of landlords or agents familiar with his \u201cfree advertising\u201d service, and other listings obtained through direct solicitation of advertisers culled from the classified section of local newspapers of general circulation. Appellant solicits potential subscribers to his service by publishing many of his advertisers\u2019 rentals in such newspapers, generally describing the rental unit and cost but without identifying data. These \u201cads\u201d are internally coded and provide appellant\u2019s business address and telephone number, e.g., finding number 1. (Fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>Prospective tenants inquiring about advertised rentals are informed that the listed rentals are currently available and, upon advance payment of the subscription fee, are furnished a copy of a completed pamphlet containing the address and telephone number for each described rental. The subscription includes the privilege to \u201ccall-in\u201d daily for a period of 30 days to receive up-dated matching rental information;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the call-in service was renewable for an additional 30 days at the rate of $5 per renewal. The subscription fee was not automatically refunded in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>event a rental was not obtained by the subscriber. While CDS did not directly participate in rental negotiations between an advertiser and prospective tenant, CDS would routinely solicit information relating to specific lease terms and conditions and would frequently inquire of both advertiser and subscriber whether they would negotiate certain terms (mainly allowance of pets and children); occasionally, it would offer opinions concerning average rental prices in a given area.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The record amply supports the court\u2019s findings that appellant, without being validly licensed, solicited listings of nonowned rentals and prospective tenants for \u201ca compensation or in expectation of a compensation.\u201d (\u00a7 10131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In a factually similar case interpreting an earlier version of section 10131, where the licensee urged a similar defense of being engaged solely in the sale of information (lists of names and descriptions of available rentals), it was held that such conduct constituted the placing of real estate for rent within the meaning of the licensing statute. <em>(Dyer </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 84, 88-89 [262 P.2d 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Additionally, the record demonstrates that appellant was regularly engaged in the business of furnishing rental information to prospective tenants for a $15 nonrefundable advance fee, conduct constituting regulable activities as an \u201cAdvance fee rental agent\u201d within the meaning of section 2850 of the Administrative Code. The trial court\u2019s findings, supported by substantial evidence, as here, may not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(Green Trees Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 782, 784 [59 Cal.Rptr. 141, 427 P.2d 805].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the subject licensing statutes and regulations cannot apply by reason of his nonlicensed status is illusory. A similar claim was made and rejected in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Savage </em>v. <em>L. A. Trust Deed etc. Exchange </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 66, 74 [12 Cal.Rptr. 144], where the court stated: \u201cAs to the status of appellant salesmen, it was contended below ... that by legal definition a real estate salesman is one who works for a licensed real estate broker (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10132.1); therefore, since Exchange was not licensed, its salesmen could not be real estate salesmen. The point is a tenuous one and is answered by the equitable maxim, \u2018That which ought to have been done is to be regarded as done . . .\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3529). Appellant salesmen were performing acts defined as duties of real estate salesmen [citation]; they were properly so regarded, and enjoined, by the trial court.\u201d Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>business activities of appellant required a valid real estate license, his claim of immunity in having failed to be so licensed is hardly persuasive. Such unlicensed activities were in direct violation of section 10130 and subject to restraint by administrative action of respondent agency. (See \u00a7 10086.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\n<em>Finder\u2019s Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Appellant next contends, relying upon <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 1 [106 Cal.Rptr. 761, 507 P.2d 65], that his activities fall within the long established \u201cfinder\u2019s\u201d exception to the licensing laws. That doctrine, first announced in <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Beinhorn </em>(1923) 190 Cal. 569, 573-574 [213 P. 960], holds that where one simply acts as an intermediary or middleman in finding and introducing two parties to a real estate transaction, he merely acts as a finder and not as a broker within the meaning of the real estate licensing laws. <em>(Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>at p. 12.) This contention is likewise unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Before the finder\u2019s exception may apply, it must appear that the \u201cactivity is limited to arranging an introduction [between the parties]...\u201d <em>(Spielberg </em>v. <em>Granz </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 283, 290-291 [8 Cal.Rptr. 190]), and the services performed in bringing the parties together cannot involve any role \u201c \u2018in negotiating the price or any of the other terms of the transaction. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Riverside Internat. Raceway </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 666, 676 [47 Cal.Rptr. 187].) If the broker takes any part in the negotiations, no matter how slight, he is not a middleman but a broker. <em>(Rhode </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 272, 280 [210 P.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Appellant steadfastly maintains his activity is simply that of a publisher of a \u201cspecialized consumer information medium.\u201d But appellant\u2019s legal status is not to be determined by a mere labelling process. As explained in <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Strehlow </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 662, 670 [68 Cal.Rptr. 589, 441 P.2d 101]: \u201cIn scrutinizing the record, we assess his function in the transaction by the role he played as well as by his description in the cast; we consider what he did, as well as what he was called.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Clearly, CDS engaged in activity beyond merely introducing landlords and tenants. It actively solicited some of its advertising landlords and most of its subscriber-renters. The listings compiled in its pamphlet provided additional data concerning the date the rental was available, the nature and terms of the leasehold, description of eligible tenants, and whether certain terms were negotiable. For an additional fee, it provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>updated rental information suitable to the prospective tenant\u2019s requirements. In addition, CDS volunteered advice to landlord and prospective tenant alike concerning average rental prices each could reasonably expect to charge or pay. Manifestly, CDS routinely engaged in a number of related business activities beyond merely locating, finding and introducing the parties, and\u2014at times\u2014played a direct role in negotiations between the principals. (See <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>9 Cal.3d 1, 12; see also 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed.) \u00a7 238, p. 824.) The record supports the implied finding that appellant\u2019s activities did not fall within the finder\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Further respondent contends that the finder\u2019s exception cannot be invoked on the facts shown, having been effectively eliminated through legislative enactments (Stats. 1965, ch. 172, operative Jan. 2, 1966). By amending the statute defining real estate brokers to include solicitations for rentals <em>or </em>prospective tenants (see italicized part of \u00a7 10131, subd. (b), fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>it is argued, the Legislature expressly intended to regulate business activities involving compensable solicitations of prospective tenants as well as rental listings. Neither party has cited, nor have we found, any authority interpreting the added classification.  The legislative history,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while sparse, clarifies that the furnishing of lists of rental vacancies to prospective tenants for compensation is an act for which a real estate license is required. (See Review of Selected 1965 Code Legislation (Cont.Ed.Bar) p. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Appellant counters, citing <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>that the interpretation of the term \u201csolicits\u201d within the context of subdivision (d) of section 10131<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as not being intended to eliminate the finder\u2019s exception applies with analogous force to the same term as used in subdivision (b). Appellant misconstrues the holding in <em>Tyrone. </em>In discussing the legislative purpose of the 1959 amendments, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIn one sense of the quoted word all finders must solicit a prospective borrower or lender. ... To hold that any act of solicitation of a borrower or lender would preclude a determination that a person was a finder would in effect eliminate the finder\u2019s exception to the licensing law. [U] It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>is clear that the Legislature did not intend by the 1959 amendment to section 10131 to eliminate <em>entirely </em>the finder\u2019s exception but rather <em>intended to limit it </em>in one respect not relevant here. The . . . amendment . . . was made by . .. chapter 2117 of the 1959 statutes. Section 14 of that chapter makes clear that the purpose of the enactment . . . was the licensing of \u2018advance fee\u2019 operators who had \u2018sought to shield their activities under the guise of operating as mere finders or locators. . . .\u2019 The legislative statement of purpose in the section shows that the Legislature did not intend a departure from established principles relating to brokers and finders except as to the \u2018advance fee\u2019 operators, and the reference in the section to \u2018finders\u2019 reflects a legislative recognition that the finder\u2019s exception to the licensing law was recognized and continued with the exception of the \u2018advance fee\u2019 operators.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 1, 9; see also fn. 6, pp. 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In concluding that the legislative purpose was directed to the then rampant abuses of the \u201cadvance fee\u201d operator, the court expressly acknowledged the limitation placed upon the finder\u2019s exception in that particular activity. (See \u00a7 10026 defining \u201cadvance fee\u201d transactions.)  However, the court was not concerned with nor did it consider the intent or effect of the 1965 amendments to subdivision (b). In enacting the several amendments, the Legislature plainly expressed its intent to specifically regulate certain activities including the active solicitation of rental listings or prospective tenants in expectation of compensation. By so providing, the Legislature specifically excluded those activities from nonlicensed status and to that extent effectively terminated the finder\u2019s exception. (See <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 1, 12.) To hold otherwise would frustrate the clear legislative purpose and \u201cstrip the statute of much of the protection of the public interest it was designed to provide.\u201d <em>(Wickersham </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(10th Cir. 1963) 313 F.2d 468, 472; 5 U.C.Davis L.Rev. 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Moreover, as found by the court below, appellant\u2019s activities in furnishing rental information to a prospective tenant for a fee payable in advance of services, falls within the separate licensee classification of \u201cadvance fee rental agent\" as defined in section 2850, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> title 10 of the California Administrative Code (fn. 6, <em>ante). </em>Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>legislative history concerning past abuses associated with advance fee operators <em>(Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 1, 9-10, fn. 6), it seems equally clear that the intendment of the regulation was to specifically supervise advance fee rental commerce in order to protect the public from similar reprehensible practices of unlicensed operators that once plagued the real estate lenders\u2019 and sellers\u2019 market.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Finally, chiefly in reliance on the early holding of <em>Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Emerson </em>(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 263 [115 P.2d 892], appellant contends that the licensing statutes as applied to his activities are overbroad and violate the Fifth<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. While conceding the validity of the licensing statutes, he argues there is no reasonable relationship between the skills required in the conduct of his business and those subject to regulation under the real estate licensing laws. Focusing upon certain statutory qualifications<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for a real estate license, he argues that to impose such irrelevant requirements upon him is arbitrary and unduly burdensome and tantamount to an unlawful taking of his property without due process and a denial of equal protection of the law. For reasons we explain, this claim is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\"><em>Whitcomb </em>(decided over three decades ago), in somewhat colorful prose found constitutional infirmity in a statute requiring a face masseuse to obtain a license in cosmetology. That holding was appropriately characterized in <em>Varanelli </em>v. <em>Structural Pest Control Board </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 217 [81 Cal.Rptr. 492], as a product of an \u201cera less receptive to economic legislation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In <em>Naismith Dental Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 253 [137 Cal.Rptr. 133], involving a similar \u201cdue process\u201d challenge, we pointed out that \u201cIn determining whether legislation is violative of due process, courts \u2018exercise an extraordinary power over a coordinate branch of government and perform a correspondingly narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>function: we simply determine whether the statute reasonably relates to a legitimate governmental purpose.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The doctrine ...\u2014that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely\u2014has long since been discarded.\u2019 [Citation.] Before a court may declare an act of the Legislature invalid because of due process or other constitutional conflict, \u2018such conflict must be clear, positive, and unquestionable.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (At p. 259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Moreover, \u201cThe current doctrine of judicial review of the reasonableness of regulatory legislation is that judicial examination of a statute under economic due process attack is completed when any fact or facts appear, or may be hypothesized, which the Legislature might rationally have accepted as the basis for a finding of public interest.\u201d <em>(Varanelli </em>v. <em>Structural Pest Control Board, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 217, 222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Herein, we may logically infer a legitimate public p\u00farpose that those engaged in the business of soliciting the general public as prospective tenants in anticipation of a compensation be required to meet minimum licensing requirements in order to regulate such conduct. The subject licensing scheme may be rationally hypothesized as an effort to protect prospective renters of real property from the actions of unprincipled or unqualified individuals. Similarly, the legislative history concerning \u201cadvance fee\u201d activities in general evidences a valid legislative purpose, as interpreted by the administrative agency charged with enforcement of the licensing statutes in adopting section 2850 of the California Administrative Code, to oversee and. regulate conduct involving the furnishing of rental information to prospective tenants upon payment of a nonrefundable advance fee. Accordingly, we do not find any due process violation by reason of the legislative amendments or the administrative regulations adopted to implement such purposes. Appellant has failed to sustain his burden of establishing an absence of a valid public purpose in the questioned enactments. (See <em>Naismith Dental Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 253, 260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Nor can it be successfully argued that the licensing statutes, as applied, deprive appellant of equal protection under the law. Although appellant argues, without benefit of authority, that \u201cno compelling state interest\u201d appears justifying application of the statutes to his business activities, it is settled that a \u201ccognizable \u2018fundamental interest\u2019 in the right to pursue employment ... is clearly limited in scope to \u2018the common occupations of the community\u2019 and should not be applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>professions whose technical complexity and intimate relationship to the public interest and welfare counsel greater deference to the legislative judgment.\u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>11 Cal.3d 1, 18 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In commenting upon the test of rational relationship applicable to economic legislation, the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>court stated: \u201cThe first [test] is the basic and conventional standard for reviewing economic and social welfare legislation in which there is a \u2018discrimination\u2019 or differentiation of treatment between classes or individuals. It manifests restraint by the judiciary in relation to the discretionary act of a co-equal branch of government; in so doing it invests legislation involving such differentiated treatment with a presumption of constitutionality and \u2018requires] merely that distinctions drawn by a challenged statute bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose.\u2019 <em>(Westbrook </em>v. <em>Mihaly </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 765, 784 [87 Cal.Rptr. 839, 471 P.2d 487].) \u2018So long as such a classification \u201cdoes not permit one to exercise the privilege while refusing it to another of like qualifications, under like conditions and circumstances, it is unobjectionable upon this ground.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Whittaker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 357, 367-368 [66 Cal.Rptr. 710, 438 P.2d 358].)
