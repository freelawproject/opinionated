Code, \u00a7\u00a7 602, 726) upon the finding that he committed a violation of Penal Code section 242 (battery), a misdemeanor. He was placed on home probation in the custody of his parents, subject to certain terms and conditions. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Between 11:30 and 11:40 a.m. on October 15, 1976, appellant, a student at Polytechnic High, walked towards Scott Kasop, another student, in a threatening manner, saying, \u201cYou white boys come after me, then I\u2019m going to back it up.\u201d He then ran towards Scott. As appellant started swinging punches, Scott defended himself by kicking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>appellant in the side. Soon thereafter the fight was broken up by a school security guard. As Mr. Baldwin, a teacher in charge of discipline for 10th graders, was escorting Scott to the office, appellant hit Scott on the side of his head. Scott fell down, apparently unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Appellant contends that the court erroneously refused to exercise its discretion under section 725, subdivision (a) of the Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to place appellant on probation without declaring him a ward of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for disposition under section 725, subdivision (a), the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">\u201cMr. Yamada: Your Honor, I urge the <em>Court not to </em>declare the minor a ward under 602.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">\u201cI ask the Court to consider placing the minor under a six-month program pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 725(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u201cThe Court: You realize under 725(a), you can\u2019t impose conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">\u201cMr. Yamada: Your Honor, I believe that the Court can make certain orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-10\">\u201cThe Court: You cannot put any conditions on 725(a), none at all. It\u2019s illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-11\">\u201cMr. Yamada: I believe that the Court can make certain orders that is enforceable by way of contempt proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-12\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s an absolute fact that you cannot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-13\">\u201cMr. Yamada: The Court cannot make it a lawful order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-14\">\u201cThe Court: No. There is no lawful order of 725(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-15\">\u201cMr. Yamada: I would urge the Court to consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Because he\u2019s not a ward of the court is the reason why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201cMr. Yamada: I would urge the Court to have the minor placed under 725(a), regardless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201cThe Court: I understand what you\u2019re saying, and I simply don\u2019t agree with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">\u201cNo. I think that the minor needs conditions of probation and he\u2019ll do 80 hours in the Department of Parks and Recreation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">However, under <em>In re Bacon, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 34, 59-60 [49 Cal.Rptr. 322], the court stated, \u201c[R]eading sections 725 and 726 in relation to each other, we conclude that where a minor is not made a ward of the court in cases where he is found to be a person described by sections 601 or 602, the court is limited, under the provisions of section 725, subdivision (a), to an order placing the minor on probation, under the supervision of the probation officer, for a period not to exceed six months. In placing a minor on probation under the supervision of the probation officer, \u2018a court undoubtedly may impose such <em>terms </em>as will bring home to the minor a realization of the seriousness of his delinquency.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">From the record it appears that the trial court was under an erroneous belief that it could not impose conditions upon probation unless appellant was declared a ward of the court under section 726. Thus, the exercise of judicial discretion to which appellant is entitled has not yet been exercised. Respondent, in his brief on appeal, agrees. This matter must, therefore, be remanded so that the court may determine, in light of <em>In re Bacon, </em>whether to impose judgment under section 725, subdivision (a), or whether once again to impose judgment under section 726, thereby making appellant a ward of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">The disposition order of March 28, 1977, is reversed and the matter is remanded for another disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Kaus, P. J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-16\"> Section 725, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A01\">\u201cAfter receiving and considering the evidence on the proper disposition of the case, the court may enter judgment as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD0\">\u201c(a) If the court has found that the minor is a person described by Section 601 or 602, it may, without adjudging such minor a ward of the court, place the minor on probation, under the supervision of the probation officer, for a period not to exceed six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
