Appellants raised affirmative defenses of defective goods and out-of-court rescission and also cross-complained for damages of $159,739. Under a settlement reached on 2 December 1975 appellants agreed to pay respondent $72,000 in 12 equal monthly installments with interest on the unpaid balance at 10 percent, with the proviso that if appellants should default on any payment, then, after 10 days notice of default and opportunity to cure, stipulated judgment for $100,000 could be entered in respondent\u2019s favor. After paying $42,000 appellants became delinquent, and on proper notice, respondent on 24 August 1976 obtained a stipulated judgment for $100,000. On 15 October 1976 appellants offered to pay with interest the delinquent installments owing on the agreed $72,000, an offer which respondent rejected. Thereafter on October 26 appellants moved to set aside the judgment, claiming surprise and excusable neglect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and requesting equitable relief from forfeiture under Civil Code section 3275.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion was denied. On appeal appellants principally contend that the $28,000 differential between the installment obligation of $72,000 and the stipulated judgment of $ 100,000 constitutes an unenforceable penalty and forfeiture imposed on them for nonpayment of $30,000. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1670, 1671, 3275.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Appellants\u2019 installment payments under the December 1975 agreement were late five times. The installment due 3 March 1976 was not paid until March 24. The May 3 installment became delinquent, and was not paid until after May 28. Finally, the June and July installments were both missed, and on July 9 respondent demanded payment and gave formal notice of default under the agreement. On July 13 and 19 appellants submitted two checks in payment of the delinquent installments but one of these checks was returned on August 3 for insufficient funds. The August installment likewise remained unpaid. Respondent thereupon obtained the $100,000 stipulated judgment. In appellants\u2019 motion to set aside the judgment, they asserted their bank mistakenly returned their check for insufficient funds, because although there were insufficient funds in the account on which the check was drawn, appellants had authorized the bank to use funds from other accounts to cover checks drawn on this account. The trial court rejected this excuse as unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">1. The decision to set aside a judgment for surprise or excusable neglect under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 rests in the sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>discretion of the trial court, and in the absence of clear abuse that decision will not be disturbed. We find no abuse of discretion here. (E.g., <em>Price </em>v. <em>Hibbs </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 209 [37 Cal.Rptr. 270].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">2. This cause, however, additionally involves the more difficult problem of the enforceability of an agreed contract containing ostensibly penal provisions.  Under California law liquidated damages not reasonably related to actual damages are unenforceable and void as penalties. An exception exists where damages cannot readily be ascertained (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1670, 1671, <em>supra, </em>fn. 2), but since damages for the withholding of money are easily determinable\u2014i.e., interest at prevailing rates\u2014penal provisions for mere delay in the payment of money are not ordinarily enforceable. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3302; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1920) 183 Cal. 354, 357 [191 P. 531].) Although provisions for liquidated damages for late payments can be characterized as provisions for alternative performance rather than penalties, and were once enforced as such (see <em>Hellbaum </em>v. <em>Lytton Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 456 [79 Cal.Rptr. 9]), it is now clear that when such \u201clate charges\u201d bear no relation to actual damages for delay, they are void. <em>(Garrett </em>v. <em>Coast &amp; Southern Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 731, 740 [108 Cal.Rptr. 845, 511 P.2d 1197, 63 A.L.R.3d 39].) Furthermore, the burden falls on the party seeking to enforce liquidated damages to establish that damages for delay were impracticable to ascertain at the time the contract specifying liquidated damages was executed. <em>(Lowe </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 718, 734 [127 Cal.Rptr. 23].)  And, finally, the substance of the transaction governs, rather than the parties\u2019 characterization of the form in which it has been cast. <em>{Garrett, supra, </em>pp. 735-737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\"><em>Garrett </em>expressly held that late charges assessed under savings and loan installment notes are void when not based on attempts to estimate \u201ca fair compensation for a loss which would be sustained on the default of an installment payment.\u201d (9 Cal.3d at p. 740.) Damages for wrongful withholding of money are fixed by law, said the court, and other damages resulting from a borrower\u2019s default, such as administrative and accounting costs, \u201cwould not appear to present extreme difficulty in prospective fixing.\u201d (P. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Subsequent to <em>Garrett </em>several cases have considered contract provisions challenged as penal under Civil Code sections 1670 and 1671. In <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 718, 728, 732-733 [127 Cal.Rptr. 23], the court upheld retention of a 2 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>stand-by deposit to secure a real estate loan commitment, in that the deposit (1) was in the nature of an option that gave the borrower further time to shop around, and (2) was reasonable in amount. In <em>Western Camps, Inc. </em>v. <em>Riverway Ranch Enterprises </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 714, 725-727 [138 Cal.Rptr. 918], 71 Cal.App.3d 802g, the court upheld a lump-sum payment for termination of a sublease as a valid alternative performance provision. In <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Borden </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 963, 970,-971-972 [115 Cal.Rptr. 31, 524 P.2d 127], the court upheld the withdrawal-from-sale provision of an exclusive authorization to sell real estate, concluding that such provision was neither a penalty nor a claim for liquidated damages, but rather a claim of indebtedness under contract provisions which presented a true alternative choice of performance. The court in <em>Blank </em>quoted a passage from McCormick on Damages which helps clarify the distinction between alternative performance and penalty: \u201c[I]n ... an alternative contract the promise to pay may be a penalty, and void as such. If a contract provides that A will either convey land then worth about $10,000 within six months at a price of $10,000 or will pay $250, it is quite clear that a reasonable man might look forward to either choice as a reasonable possibility, and there is no reason for hesitating to enforce the promise to pay if the land is not conveyed. If, on the other hand, A\u2019s promise provides that he shall either pay $100 on January 1st or $200 on demand thereafter, a different situation is presented. No reasonable man would, when the contract was made, consider that there was any rational choice involved (conceding the ability to pay either sum) in determining which course to pursue. If he can do so, he will pay the lesser sum, and the agreement necessarily is founded on this assumption, and the only purpose and effect of the formal alternative is to hold over him the larger liability as a threat to induce prompt payment of the lesser sum. Consequently, while an alternative promise to pay money when it presents a conceivable choice is valid, yet, if a contract is made by which a party engages himself either to do a certain act or to pay some amount which at the time of the contract no one would have considered an eligible alternative, the alternative promise to pay is unenforceable as a penalty.\u201d (McCormick, Damages (1935) \u00a7 154, pp. 617-618.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">In contrast to the foregoing cases a provision for retention of a $25,000 liquidated damages deposit for failure of the buyers to purchase real property was held invalid as a penalty clause in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>King Manor and Convalescent Hospital </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 782, 792 [115 Cal.Rptr. 471]. The court found no evidence that damages were difficult or impossible to ascertain and declared that the language used by the parties was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>controlling, in that parties may not circumvent the public policy of sections 1670 and 1671 by characterizing penalties as something else.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Two other cases are factually close to that at bench and relevant to the issue of <em>stipulation\u2014Chambreau </em>v. <em>Coughlan </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 712 [69 Cal.Rptr. 783], and <em>L. A. City Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Landier Inv. Co. </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 744 [2 Cal.Rptr. 662]. In <em>Chambreau, </em>the parties stipulated to judgment for $8,025, but agreed to stay execution provided defendant paid the lesser sum of $5,500 in regular monthly installments. On default, the larger judgment would become effective. Defendant paid the full $5,500 but was late in paying one installment. The court disallowed plaintiff\u2019s attempt almost two years later to execute on the greater judgment, concluding that defendant was entitled to equitable relief from forfeiture under Civil Code section 3275. In <em>Landier, </em>the parties stipulated that defendant would pay plaintiff a certain sum in 8 annual installments without interest; but if a 30-day default occurred followed by a 30-day period without cure, then judgment could be entered against defendant for .twice the unpaid balance. The parties themselves characterized this provision as an \u201ceconomic sanction\u201d for failure to pay. Four years after executing the stipulation and making payments thereunder, defendant sought to have the provision declared unenforceable as a penalty. Relief was denied as untimely, but in dictum the court noted that the provision for double payment constituted a penalty. (P. 754.) <em>Landier </em>thus casts added doubt on the ability of parties with equal bargaining power to enter into a stipulation of the type now before us. (See Sweet, <em>Liquidated Damages in California </em>(1972) 60 \u2022 Cal.L.Rev. 84, 128-129, and Crane, <em>Recent Decisions on Damages </em>(1960) 12 Hastings L.J., 109, 119-120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">At bench the trial court declined to relieve appellants from the consequences of their stipulation for judgment. This exercise of discretion might have been based, as in <em>Landier, </em>on evidence of lack of equity on appellants\u2019 part: e.g., their delay in attacking the agreement; their history of repeated delinquencies, which made collection difficult; and their responsibility for errors of their own bank. Yet overall, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>failings were relatively minor. The trial court chose to deny relief on the ground that damages would have been difficult to fix, and therefore the provision for liquidated damages was valid. That decision failed to take into account the need for proportion in damages\u2014the critical item in evaluating penalty and forfeiture. The provision for judgment here appears considerably harsher than the arrangement characterized as penal in <em>Garrett. (Garrett </em>v. <em>Coast &amp; Southern Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 731 [108 Cal.Rptr. 845, 511 P.2d 1197, 63 A.L.R.3d 39].) And because we are dealing with a singular transaction, less justification exists for use of an arbitrary formula to ascertain damages than in the instance of savings and loan associations, which with their many identical installment obligations have an obvious stake in routinizing collection of damages for delayed payment. We think the penalty at bench bears no reasonable relationship to actual damages suffered by respondent as the result of delay but to the contrary appears grossly disproportionate in amount. Certainly there is paperwork and time involved in the collection of an installment obligation. The creditor is entitled to bargain that if the installment debtor imposes upon the creditor by a continuing course of dilatory payment the creditor may accelerate and collect the entire obligation, plus a reasonable amount to compensate for delay. On the other hand, the equitable powers of the court exist to insure that the ultimate obligation imposed on the debtor is not unreasonable <em>in proportion </em>to the original obligation and the seriousness of the default. The Uniform Commercial Code adopts the position that liquidated damages clauses may be enforced if the amount is reasonable but \u201ca term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty\u201d (see Cal.U.Com. Code, \u00a7 2718). At bench, enforcement of the default provisions under the 1975 agreement would result in a $28,000 penalty for delay in payment of $30,000, a penalty which bears no rational relationship to the amount of actual damages suffered by respondent. Such an agreement is unenforceable. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1670, 1671, 3275; <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Coast &amp; Southern Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 731 [108 Cal.Rptr. 845, 511 P.2d 1197, 63 A.L.R.3d 39]; <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>The Rector </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 16, 21-22 [230 P.2d 629, 31 A.L.R.2d 1]; <em>Barkis </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 116, 123 [208 P.2d 367]; <em>Ebbert </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust Co. </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 496, 499 [2 P.2d 776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to reduce the stipulated judgment to $72,000, plus interest, attorneys fees, and costs. Respondent shall be afforded an opportunity under the agreement of the parties (art. 5) to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees attributable to appellants\u2019 unwarranted delays in payment.
