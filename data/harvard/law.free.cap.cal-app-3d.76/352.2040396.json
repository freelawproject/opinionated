Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 211a). He was sentenced to state prison and appeals contending, in essence, that he was erroneously deprived of his constitutional right of self-representation <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525], hereinafter <em>Faretta), </em>and as a result a reversal of his conviction is mandated. We have concluded that the contention is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>On January 21, 1977, appellant\u2019s matter was called for jury trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to impanelment of the jury, appellant expressed his displeasure regarding the quality of representation being provided by the deputy public defender. Appellant told the court, inter alia, that: (1) he wanted to \u201cdismiss counsel,\u201d (2) he wanted to represent himself, (3) he was aware that he was facing \u201cten years to life,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (4) <em>he was ready to proceed forthwith. </em>He also indicated that his theory of defense was \u201cmistaken identification\u201d and that he was <em>ready </em>to cross-examine adverse witnesses and had prepared \u201cfifty questions in which to cross-examine the witnesses.\u201d After listening to appellant, the court denied his request to \u201cdismiss\u201d the deputy public defender and to represent himself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary to the attorney general\u2019s position, at no time did appellant seek to have a new attorney appointed to represent him. Therefore, the discussion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44], and its progeny are inapposite to the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The matter proceeded to jury trial and the People introduced evidence, credited by the jury, that appellant committed a robbery at the box office of the Park Theatre. Appellant was positively identified by the victim of the robbery, Ms. Luz Gutierrez. Appellant testified in his own behalf, admitted being near the Park Theatre at the subject time, but asserted that he was merely window-shopping and patronizing bars in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u201c[I]n order to invoke the constitutionally mandated unconditional right of self-representation a defendant in a criminal trial should make an unequivocal assertion of that right within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of trial. Accordingly, when a motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>is timely interposed, a trial court must permit a defendant to represent himself . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Windham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 121, 127-128 [137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187], fn. omitted.) In amplicification of the foregoing, our Supreme-Court said,. \u201cOur imposition of a \u2018reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>time\u2019 requirement should not be and, indeed, must not be used as a means of limiting a defendant\u2019s <em>constitutional </em>right of self-representation. We intend only that a defendant should not be allowed to misuse the <em>Faretta </em>mandate as a means to unjustifiably delay a scheduled trial or to obstruct the orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Windham, supra, </em>at p. 128, fn. 5; italics in the original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">We recognize that the motion for self-representation in the instant case preceded our Supreme Court\u2019s filing of its decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Windham, supra. </em>Nevertheless, since it is undisputable that appellant\u2019s motion for self-representation was made prior' to trial and was not accompanied by any request for a continuance, its grant would not have obstructed the orderly administration of justice. Therefore, we can only conclude appellant was denied his otherwise unconditional constitutional right of self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The question remains \u201cwhat standard of reversible error\u201d should be applied when a trial court erroneously denies a timely self-representation motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even before the constitutional dimension of the right of self-representation was recognized in <em>Faretta, </em>it was held that deprivation of the right of self-representation at trial was reversible per se. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 216, 226-228 [69 Cal.Rptr. 473].) This holding was recognized and reiterated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 [91 Cal.Rptr. 203], but as that case concerned the right to self-representation at a preliminary hearing rather than at trial the court instead adopted a \u201charmless error\u201d test. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 5.) Since it had been held that the federal constitutional harmless error doctrine applies to the right to counsel at preliminary hearings (see <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 1, 10-11; 18 [26 L.Ed.2d 387, 397-398, 401, 90 S.Ct. 1999]) it was reasoned that the right to self-representation there should be governed by the same standard of review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at pp. 4-5.) On the other hand, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 448 [103 Cal.Rptr. 233, 499 P.2d 489], which was overruled in <em>Faretta, </em>our Supreme Court held that where an accused had made a less than compelling showing of his competence to represent himself, the deprivation of that then non constitutional right was to be reviewed under the lesser standard of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 462-463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The <em>Faretta </em>court, without discussing the appropriate standard of reversible error, ordered the judgment vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. <em>(Faretta, supra, </em>422 U.S. at p. 836 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 582].) The erroneous denial of a timely motion for self-representation, however, simply does not lend itself to review by any standard short of per se reversal. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Gainer </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 835, 854-855 [139 Cal.Rptr. 861, 566 P.2d 997]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rist </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 211, 223 [127 Cal.Rptr. 457, 545 P.2d 833]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 768-769 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1].) The rationale in the <em>Faretta </em>decision that criminal defendants have a right to self-representation \u201cis that the state may not constitutionally prevent a defendant charged with commission of a criminal offense from controlling his own fate by forcing on him counsel who may present a case which is not consistent with the actual wishes of the defendant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Windham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The evidence presented when an attorney rather than the defendant has control over the court proceedings and the exclusive authority to make decisions as to matters of trial tactics (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) Cal.3d 894, 905 [88 Cal.Rptr. 208, 471 P.2d 1008]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 307, 315-317 [8 Cal.Rptr. 849]/will inevitably be at a variance with that adduced when the defendant is self-represented. While we could easily speculate that the evidentiary picture would almost certainly be worse when a defendant represents himself, such is not necessarily so. Nor do we discount the fact that the jury might be favorably impressed by listening to the voir dire, opening statement and closing argument by a <em>Faretta </em>defendant. Adoption of any other standard would tend to eviscerate the <em>Faretta </em>holding. We, therefore, hold that erroneous deprivation of the timely asserted unconditional right of self-representation in-a criminal trial is reversible error per se <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 23, 1978.
