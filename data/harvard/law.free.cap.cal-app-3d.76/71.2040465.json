J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">Defendant Roy Joseph Broce was convicted by a jury of violating Penal Code section 137, in that by force or threat of force he attempted to induce a person about to be called as a witness to give false testimony or withhold true testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">In January 1976, Carol Weinald and her boyfriend were sitting in a parked car in front of Carol\u2019s house. She saw a 1965 orange or gold colored Chevy drive by twice at about 15 or 20 miles per hour within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>5-minute period. The vehicle then came down the street a third time, and the driver parked about four houses away from where Weinald and her friend were watching. Weinald contacted the sheriff\u2019s department.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">A deputy sheriff arrived. The driver, defendant, started to leave, but was prevented by two sheriffs\u2019 vehicles which blocked his path. Defendant was alone in the car. The deputies asked him to get out and asked him for his identification. One deputy observed a portion of a revolver near the front seat. He retrieved the weapon, found that it was loaded, and arrested defendant. Weinald was later told what had been recovered from defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Two days after the incident, defendant came to Weinald\u2019s home. Her brother answered the door. Defendant asked him if he knew anyone who owned a blue 1956 Chevy pickup truck and whether he had a sister. Weinald came to the door. Defendant said, \u201cYou\u2019re the one that called the police,\u201d or \u201cYou are the one that called the cops.\u201d Defendant asked Weinald to call the sheriff\u2019s department and tell them she had not seen defendant drive around the block two or three times, because he was \u201cgoing to try to get them [the officers] for illegal search and seizure.\u201d Weinald did not respond. Defendant said that he would \u201chate to mark the house,\u201d and that he had a \u201cloaded .38.\u201d He said that he had been a machine gunner in Vietnam and had \u201ckilled over 239 gooks.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cAren\u2019t you scared that I was going to come back and do anything to you?\u201d Although Weinald was frightened, she said, \u201cNo.\u201d Weinald\u2019s brother also felt that what he heard was a threat, and that defendant wanted Weinald to change her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Defendant testified that he had gone to Weinald\u2019s residence solely to locate a witness to his arrest. When he had been arrested, he had seen two persons sitting in a blue 1956 Chevy. Defendant believed that he was illegally arrested and wanted to find some witnesses to substantiate his belief. He admitted that he related some \u201cwar stories\u201d to Weinald, but he did not threaten her in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">1. <em>Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">After defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing, he was held to answer under Penal Code section 136, subdivision (b), which makes it unlawful to prevent or dissuade by means of force or threats of injury any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>who is or may become a witness from attending any trial or proceeding. Before trial, the People were permitted to amend the information to allege a violation of Penal Code section 137 as to count 2 and to dismiss count 1 which charged a violation under section 136. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Defendant, conceding that the People were entitled to amend the information to charge an offense shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing, contends that the evidence presented at that hearing was insufficient to hold him to answer under section 137. The contention is without merit. Carol Weinald\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing was substantially that given at the trial. She observed defendant\u2019s vehicle; she telephoned the police; two days later, defendant came to her house and made the statements quoted above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant\u2014a matter discussed below\u2014it was sufficient to hold him to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Defendant contends that he did not violate Penal Code section 137. He points out that Weinald was neither a witness nor a possible witness with respect to the weapons possession charge pending against defendant. This is true, but irrelevant. Weinald\u2019s observations were material to the legality of defendant\u2019s arrest\u2014whether he planned to raise its illegality as a defense to the criminal charges or, affirmatively, in an action for false arrest. Nor does it matter that no such action was pending at the time of the threat. Section 137 contains no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u201c[T]his is a law primarily to prevent the corrupt interference with the administration of justice. Its purpose is to go back as far as necessary and say in effect that any attempt to so influence prospective witnesses that the truth will not be presented in anticipated litigation is felonious. ... It is the intent of the person interested and his purpose and design that is decisive of that question. True, a person cannot be a witness unless there is an action pending, but a person may be about to be called as a witness even though no action is pending.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McAllister </em>(1929) 99 Cal.App. 37, 40-41 [277 P. 1082].)</p>\n<p id=\"AlE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cNo reason is suggested nor is one apparent why it should be unlawful to attempt to bribe or otherwise persuade someone to later defraud the court as a witness if the attempt be made while an action is pending, but if the same effort to obstruct justice were used just before the action were begun it should be exempt from condemnation. . .. The term \u2018or person about to be called as a witness\u2019 in the first part of the section, . . . was used with the legislative intent of including within its denouncement all offers of bribes to any person in contemplation of his becoming a witness. Such anticipation is not affected ... by the fact, . . . that the proceeding in which influenced testimony is to be given or withheld has not yet been filed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 41.) (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1931) 114 Cal.App. 392, 394-395 [300 P. 130]; see <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 187, 189 [214 P.2d 579] [Pen. Code, \u00a7 138].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Defendant contends that, in any event, he did not try to induce \u201ctestimony.\u201d Rather, Weinald testified that defendant asked her if she \u201cwould call and ask or tell them that I didn\u2019t see him drive around two or three times. . . .\u201d Similarly, her brother testified that defendant \u201cwas talking about how he\u2019d like to have my sister change her story to the police. . . .\u201d The evidence should not be viewed piecemeal. While expressly defendant only asked Weinald to contact the deputies and change her story, the jury could reasonably infer that he intended that Weinald testify either on a motion to suppress the fruits of his arrest or in any planned action against the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Nor is it material that in either case the police could prove a prima facie case of probable cause to arrest without calling the citizen informant on whose information they acted (cf., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 757 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1]), and that the legality of defendant\u2019s arrest did not really depend on what Weinald observed, but on what she told the police. We know of no authority holding that the \u201cfalse testimony\u201d to which section 137 refers must be proved to be material in the light of the issues framed or to be framed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Lichens </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 573 [5 Cal.Rptr. 539], is misplaced. There the defendant was charged with a violation of Penal Code section 1361/2, which, as relevant, at the time,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made unlawful offering a bribe to a witness or a person about to be called as a witness, to dissuade that person from \u201cattending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>upon any trial. . . .\u2019\u2019In <em>Lichens, </em>the defendant, charged with attempted rape, tried on four occasions to induce the victim to have the case \u201cdropped\u201d in exchange for a total of $1,000. (181 Cal.App.2d pp. 574-575.) The court held that the defendant\u2019s actions did not constitute a violation of section 136\u00bd The court found nothing in section 136Vi \u201cthat makes it unlawful \u2018to drop a charge.\u2019 The essential elements of the bribery defined is an \u2018understanding or agreement,\u2019 that the person about to be called as a witness, <em>\u2018shall not attend upon any trial.\u2019 \u201d (Id., </em>p. 576, italics added.) Even if <em>Lichens </em>is good law, it is simply not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In short, the evidence was sufficient to establish a violation by defendant of Penal Code section 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">3. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The jury was instructed, at the People\u2019s request, that every \u201cperson who attempts by force or threat of force or by any other means fraudulently to induce any <em>person </em>to give false or withhold true testimony is guilty of a felony.\u201d The jury was then instructed, at defendant\u2019s request, that to find him guilty of violating section 137, the jury \u201cmust find he made the attempt by force or threat of force or by any other means fraudulently to induce <em>any person about to be called as a witness </em>to give false or withhold true testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Defendant contends that the instructions were conflicting in that the instruction requested by the People referred only to every \u201cperson,\u201d while the instruction referred to by defendant referred to \u201cany person about to be called as a witness....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We disagree. Although no model of precision, the instructions taken together are, at worst, somewhat repetitious. The jury was instructed that the \u201cperson\u201d was one \u201cabout to be called as a witness....\"</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The Attorney General also contends that defendant was not entitled to an instruction that the person was one \u201cabout to be called as a witness.\u201d Were we not bound by a precedent, we would be inclined to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Section 137 combines two offenses and reads, as relevant: \u201cEvery person who gives ... to any witness, or person about to be called as a witness, any bribe, ... or who attempts by force or threat of force ... to induce any person to give false or withhold true testimony, . . . .\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>second offense\u2014using force or threats\u2014refers, not to \u201cwitness,\u201d but to \u201cany person . . . The failure to qualify the word \u201cperson\u201d by a \u201csuch\u201d\u2014does not appear to be inadvertent. Section <em>\\36Vt, </em>which also encompasses two offenses in one paragraph, prohibits a bribe to any \u201cwitness or person about to be called as a witness\u201d based on an understanding or agreement, or a bribe \u201cto dissuade any <em>such </em>person from attending. . . .\u201d By qualifying the reference\u2014\u201csuch person\u201d\u2014the Legislature made clear that the person must be one who is a witness or about to be called as a witness. The absence of parallel language in section 137, which follows, and which was last amended in 1970 suggests that the Legislature did not intend that the person subjected to \u201cforce or threat of force\u201d must be one \u201cabout to be called as a witness.\u201d On the other hand, the 1970 amendment was passed over 40 years after <em>People </em>v. <em>McAllister, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App. 37 where the court, in construing the meaning of the term \u201cperson about to be called as a witness,\u201d stated: \u201cIt seems equally clear that the term \u2018any person\u2019 used in the last phrase is intended to include both any witness and any person about to be called as a witness as denominated in the first part of the statute.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Nevertheless, whether the second \u201cperson\u201d in section 137 is \u201cany person\u201d or any \u201cperson about to be called as a witness\u201d may be academic, since <em>McAllister, </em>and <em>Martin </em>and <em>Evans, </em>which followed <em>McAllister, </em>make clear that there need be no more than a person who can offer testimony contrary to the interests of the person offering the bribe or making the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Stephens, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> Actually, Weinald\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing was stronger. She testified that defendant said: \u201cIf you say anything or testify I am going to have to mark this house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\"> Section 1361/2 was amended in 1963 (Stats. 1963, ch. 1939, \u00a7 1, p. 3993) to add \u201cor other judicial proceeding,...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
