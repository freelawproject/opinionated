Code, \u00a7 4600) and conspiracy to destroy prison property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182). We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">At the preliminary hearing the prosecution presented evidence that respondent, an inmate at the state prison at Soledad, smashed the state-owned television set with which his cell was furnished. There was evidence also that respondent acted in concert with other inmates who smashed their television sets, as an act of protest and defiance connected with the discipline of another inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Penal Code section 4600 provides felony punishment for a person who \u201cbreaks down, pulls down, or otherwise destroys or injures any jail or prison, . . \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In granting the motion to set aside the information, the trial court declared that \u201cWe have a rule of strict construction dealing with penal statutes . . . .\u201d  There is no such rule in California; penal statutes \u201care to be construed according to the fair import of their terms, ... to effect [their] objects and to promote justice\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4; 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, \u00a7 10, pp. 12-13).  No statutory definition of the term \u201cprison\u201d has been found, but in common usage the term refers to \u201cA public building or other place for the confinement or safe custody of persons, ... in the course of the administration of justice\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (4th ed. 1968) p. 1358, col. 1).  Under that usage, the statute would apply to damage done to the grounds and structure (including fixtures) of a prison, but not to furniture or equipment such as a television set. Damage to state-owned furniture or equipment located in a prison would be punishable as malicious mischief, a misdemeanor (Pen. Code, \u00a7 594) but not as the</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>felony offense of destroying or damaging the prison itself. The court acted correctly in setting aside the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Caldecott, P. J., and Ragan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\"> The statute provides a misdemeanor penalty for damage of $200 or less to any \u201ccity, city and county or county jail property----\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
