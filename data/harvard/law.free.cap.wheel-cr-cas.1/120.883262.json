You, gentlemen of the jury, are to decide whether \u201c the story told by the prisoner, in her examination, is a \u201c fabrication or not. The law has allowed the prosecu- \u201c tor to he a witness, and the law has also allowed the \u201c examinations of prisoners to be read in evidence in certain \u201c cases. The court will not decide which party is entitled \u201c to the greatest weight: because that depends upon the \u201cparticular circumstances of each case. The jury are \u201c the proper judges of the credibility of witnesses. If \u201c you are satisfied that it is not an invention of the pris- \u201c oner, but, on the contrary, that the facts actually took' \u201c place, as she detailed them, in her examination, you \u201c ought to acquit; if you think they are the mere inven- \u201c tion of guilt to evade justice, you ought to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u201c The prosecutor swears that the watch is worth $30 \u201c you have a right,-\u00bfto wever, if you should think it of less \u201cvalue than $25, to find her guilty of petit larceny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The jury found her guilty of petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Note.\u2014See the case of Deborah Smith, ante, and the note thereto.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
