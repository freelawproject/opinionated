He asked Mr. Griswold if his brother, one of the' Elmore\u2019s, had purchased any goods of him; having previously informed Mr. Griswold that he was one of the 0f j rp_ ^ g_ Elmore. Mr. Griswold informed him could not recollect. He then inquired if Mr. Griswold s\u00b0ld goods oniia credit, and was answered that he did ; and then informed him that he wanted to purchase a quantity, of goods, for which he would, give a note of the firm, at four months, and offered Mr. Griswold a reference as to the standing of the house of <em>j </em>qp &lt;%, g, Elmore at Esopus, of which house, he alleged, he was one of the partners. He mentioned the names of the Messrs. Haights of this City, who knew the house, and who would be able to answer any inquiries in relation to it. Mr. Griswold called upon the Messrs. Haights, and ascertained the standing of the house of J. T. &amp; S. Elmore 'to be good, and then told the prisoner he might select the goods, and give the note of the firm at four months. The goods were selected, and the note given. They were put up, and sent on board the Kingston Packet, in the usual manner.

T. &amp; S. Elmore, and purchased goods to the amount of $729 54, on a credit. The prisoner referred to the Messrs. Waites.Shortly after the goods were obtained, the fraud was discovered by Mr. Wood. It was found that the prisoner was-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>not one of the firm of J. T. &amp; S. Elmore, hut that his real name was Joshua De Graff, who kept a store at Esopus, a short distance from the store kept hy J. T. &amp; S. Elmore. Mr. Wood pursued the prisoner to Esopus, and obtained the greater part of his goods, by a writ of replevin. packages that contained the goods purchased of Mr. Gris-wold, had his initials marked on the cover, and by that means led to the discovery that De Graff had purchased goods of Mr. Griswold. Information was given, and De Graff was arrested an'd brought to the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-7\">It was proved, on the trial, that De Graff had heretofore sustained a good character; that he had for a number of years, kept a retail store in Esopus, and had a family of eight children, and that he was a man of some property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-8\">The fact of forging the names of J.

And the Court decided the question was illegal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-11\"><em>Griffin </em>and <em>Price, </em>for the prisoner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXi9\">rested their defence on his alleged insanity. They offered the testimony of Mr. Benjamin Dickinson, Caleb Burrell, and Henry Hammond, who testified, that they had been acquainted with the prisoner for a considerable length of time <em>; </em>that he had for the last six months, acted as if he was <em>\u201c </em>shattered,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>and conducted himself very \u201cstrange\u201d that he was differ- <em>, ent </em>from what he used to be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\">Being questioned by Maxwell, <em>District Attorney, </em>upon what facts they supposed him deranged, replied,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">1st. That\u2018he had of late been careless about his business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_0\">2d. That he was not strict and regular in his religious conduct. . .</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">3d. That lately he had been in the habit of using profane language.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">4th. That one of the witnesses had met him in a wagon, and he took no notice of him, although they had formerly been in the habit of speaking,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_32\">oth. That they thought his general conduct \u201c strange.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVt\">It was proved by'Mr. Griswold, that he selected the goods with great judgment and acuteness, and showed great management and art in his whole manner of obtaining them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-11\">The case was summed up by <em>Price </em>and <em>Griffin, </em>for the prisoner. They contended that, from all the circumstances of this case, it was apparent that the prisoner was insane. He lived in the same town with the prosecutor ; was well acquainted with him\u2014must have known, if he was sane, the forgery would have been detected : he conducted himself openly, there was no secrecy about the goods, in putting them on board the packet, &amp;c.&gt; He had, heretofore, \u2022borne an \u2022 excellent character in the neighborhood in which he lived. He was also a member of the church and argued, from the greatness of the crime, that it was extremely improbable a man in his situation would voluntarily plunge himself into such a debt of guilt. They contended, that the law in relation to insanity, as laid down by able judges and writers, would include the case now before the Court, and cited the case of James Had-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>field, and the authorities there referred to, (see Erskine\u2019s speeches,) where the law on this subject was ably considered, and allowed by the Court. They also cited 1 Hale, 33., and argued that it was often impossible, to detect a species of delusion the mind of man was subject to ; that it was so fleeting and volatile, as the cases referred to plainly proved, as often to baffle the most learned, and to confound the most preserving and intrepid ; that he had proved, by the testimony of a number of his neighbors, that his conduct for sometime past had been \u201c strange that they were unanimous in the opinion that he was \u201c crazythat, independent of the testimony of witnesses, the presumption of his insanity might fairly be inferred from the intrinsic circumstances of the case ; that, although he might not have made out his defence to the satisfaction of the Court, yet if there was but a doubt of his insanity, that doubt ought to be put in the scale of mercy\u2014it ought to secure,his acquittal, &amp;c.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-8\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amc\">replied, by observing that it was an undoubted rule of law, that when a man sets up an exemption to answering for a crime, either by plea of insanity or otherwise, it. lies upon him to prove it.\u2014 And that it had always been held that a defence of this kind was to be received with great caution. It was the duty of the prisoner to lay such a case before the Court and jury, as to afford a probable and reasonable ground for his defence. It was a defence extremely uncertain, easily made, and sometimes difficult to' be disproved. That he was compelled to say this kind of defence had become too common. That Hadfield\u2019s case, cited by the counsel, had no application to the one now before the Court; that there, the case was totally different. Hadfield had been known for sometime to be deranged ; his derangement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>could be traced to the wounds he received in the wars on continentj it was apparent for some years before the act f\u00b0r which he was tried was committed; that Hadfield had received severe contusions about the head, and that . his brain was affected by them: that no analogy could possibly exist between them and the case now before the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AK\">In this case no satisfactory evidence whatever had been laid before the court, to show the derangement of'De Graff. It was true, these witnesses had been introduced to show him insane, but how had they done it ? They testify, that, for the last six months, his conduct has been \u201cstrange that he has neglected his business\u2014that he is 'not regular in his religious conduct\u2014that he uses profane language : that he took no notice of one of the witnesses as he passed him in a wagon, &amp;c. These are the circumstances relied on by the counsel for the prisoner ; that they were insufficient, was apparent to every person. It appeared by the testimony of Mr. Griswojd, that he saw no indication of a defective mind ; he selected the goods with great judgment, and his whole demeanor was shrewd and acute. ^His conduct from the beginning to the end, was indicative of his criminal intent, and not of an unsound mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The court observed to the jury, that the law was as stated by the District Attorney, that they were to judge from all the facts of the case, whether the prisoner was insane or not; for it appeared to be admitted by the learned counsel for the prisoner, that he committed the crime as charged in the indictment, but they alleged that he was insane at the time ; that pleas of insanit}7 were to be examined with care and caution\u2014they are easily made, and often were made by prisoners as a last resort, when every other hope of defence had failed; and concluded by observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that there were some circumstances to which they would . . direct their attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">1st. He represented himself to be Samuel Elmore. He must have thought at the time that he would have been detected.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">2d. He returned to Esopus, to his family, in the same, neighborhood with the Messrs. Elmores.</p>\n<p id=\"Anr_\">3d. He denied to Mr. Wood that he purchased of him or any other person, but in his own name\u2014saying he had often bought of him before. ,</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">4th.

His former good character, being a member of the church, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak07\">There were other circumstances in the case, that were in favor of his being in a sound state of mind,</p>\n<p id=\"AQm\">1st. He gave Mr. Griswold a reference to Mr. Waite, and Mr. Wood, a reference to Mr. Haight. An act of great caution and acuteness; for had he referred both gentlemen to the same house, it is probable he would have been discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">2d. He selected the goods with uncommon discretion and care ; and obtained a long credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">3d. He designates the vessel by which the goods were to be sent\u2014where she laid\u2014her name, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">4th. He objects to Mr. Griswold to give an acceptance in the city\u2014knowing it would lead to his detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">5th. He goes home in the Steamboat, and tells Burrell he would settle his account, and did not seem deranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">6th.

Why are not his relations and physicians produced the trial ?</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The case was given to the jury under the above charge, and they returned a verdict of guilty, against the prisoner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Note.-\u2014Forgery is defined to be a false making or alteration of such writings as either at common law or by statute are its objects, with intent to defraud another. 2 East. p. 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">A short and comprehensive view of the law relating to this subject will be considered in the following manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Forgery at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"Ata\">Forgery at common law was only a species of fraud, and punishable as a misdemeanor. It was often intermingled with false personating to which it seems very closely allied. It was at one time doubted whether forgery could be of any other writings but those of a public kind. In Ward\u2019s case, 2 Ld. Raym. 1461, it was decided that forgery at common law might be committed of any writing whatever, by which another might be defrauded; and this case has been decided to be good law in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"Asg\">Ghitty, vol. 3, p. 780. 2 853 \u2019 4 Blac\" Comm, p.248. 2 Leach,. 910,</p>\n<p id=\"b218-20\">By Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ARu\">\u201e , b66 tne statutes, and the decisions un<em>q </em>ggi/ \u25a0to 965.</p>\n<p id=\"A3z\">In England, a great number of very penal statutes have been enacted by Parliament, defining the crime and declaring the punishment, and prosecutions in that country are always brought under one of those statutes: they have made the crime of forgery in almost every case capital. In New York, we have a statute, declaring what shall be forgery, and also fixing the punishment. Rev. L. vol. 1. p. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-28\">Under these statutes, some of the leading principles that govern cases of forgery will be given. '</p>\n<p id=\"b218-29\">With what intent the act must be done.</p>\n<p id=\"AbqI\">The very essence of the offence is the intent to defraud. But it is perfectly immaterial whether any person is actually defrauded or not. Jf the forgery, appears to have been done with a view of gaining any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>advantages to the party himself, or prejudicing a third person, it is sufficient. And in Briggs\u2019 case, 3 P. Wms. 119, it was held no ohjection that the forgery was found, by a special verdict, not to have committed for the' sake of lucre or to defraud the party. 1 Campb. 324. 2 Leach, 983. 1 New Rep. 92. Chitty, C. L. vol. 1. p. 387. 2Stra. 747. 2 Ld.Raym.1461. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AGI\">In Simeon Van Houten\u2019s case, the court decided that evidence of a large sum of money being found in the trunk of the prisoner, was proper to go to the jury to show that he knew, the bills charged in the indictment to be forgeries. City Hall Rec. vol. 2. p. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"AK7\">In William A. Coffey\u2019s case, on a trial for forging and uttering a counterfeit check, the intent was permitted to be shown by evidence, that the person had previously passed a check, not laid in the indictment,acknowledged to be counterfeit. Ibid. vol. iv. p. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"AQEW\">What false making or al*eratlons a\" mounts to forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"A5X\">The making or alteration of an instrument, with a fraudulent intent, and without authority, completes the offence, before any injury is sustained by any person. Nor is it necessary the whole instrument should be made fictitious: making an alteration, or erasure, in any material part of a true instrument, whereby another may be defrauded, is a forgery : a false signature to a true.instrument, or a real signature to a false one, are forgeries. The alteration of the date of a .bill of exchange after acceptance, by which payment may be accelerated, is a forgery, 4 T. R. 320. But the instrument must be false in itself; for if a man pass for another who is the maker or indorser of a true instrument, it is not a forgery, although he may be punished under the statute of false pretences, Chitty, C. L. vol. 3. p. 465. The instrument must bear a resemblance to that which it is intended to represent, but it is not necessary that it should be pecfect, or even a correct copy, it is sufficient if it bears such a resemblance as to impose upon mankind, although an individual skilled in that kind of writing would detect its fallacy. 2 East. P. C. 950. 1 Leach, 229.</p>\n<p id=\"A3zh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The forgery of any writing, which may be prejudicial to another, is indictable at common law. Addis, p. 33, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Forgery of a name to an assignment of a bond is indictable, although there be no seal to the forged instrument; as it gives a possibility to defraud. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">A co-obligor may be guilty of forgery, in signing a bill given, by himself and another. But his having it in his possession, may be evidence of authority over it; and if there be no intention to defraud, it is not forgery. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">If a merchant writes hisname on blank pieces of paper, and entrust them with his clerk, for the purpose of having notes written upon them, and by false pretences obtain them of the clerk, and make upon them notes other than those for which they were intended, such fraudulent use of them is not forgery. Mass. Rep. vol. 4. p. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Evidence that a party, in whose favor an instrument is forged, was knowing and assenting to the forgery, will justify the jury in inferring that he procured it to be done, and be sufficient to charge him with forgery. Ibid. vol. 10, p. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">A forged promissory no.te, with a forged indorsement, will support an indictment for forging the note merely. Ibid. vol. 2, p. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"A-N\">It is perfectly immaterial whether the counterfeited instrument be such as, if real, would be effectual to the purpose it intends. If there is only a resemblance sufficient to impose upon those to whom it is uttered, or to the public generally, it is sufficient, whether the fraud be effected on the part to whom an instrument is addressed, or whose writing is counterfeited, or upon some third person who takes it upon the credit it ass\\imes,is perfectly immaterial. Chit. vol. 3, p. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">How far is it necessary the thing forg ed should be a valid instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"AMR\">And it was decided, upon solemn argument, that a forgery in the name of a person who has no existence, is as criminal, and as much a forgery within the statutes, as if there was intent to defraud the indi-' vidual whose hand writing is counterfeited, 1 Leach, 83. The cases are explicit and satisfactory upon this point. To put a false and fictitious name on a bill indorsed in blank, in\u2019order to circulate it with secrecy, is a forgery, 1 Leach, 215. To counterfeit a power of attorney, purporting to be by the administratrix and daughter of a seaman who had no child at his death, is a capital forgery. The forgery of ,an instrument purporting to be a last will, is taken as within the statutes, although the supposed testator is living, 1 Leach, 449. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>fabrication of an order for payment of a sailors prize-money is forgery, though it is invalid as wanting the requisites required by statute. 2 Leach, 883. Forgery of a protection in the name of a member of parliament, who was not so, is indictable. Sid. 142.- So it has been adjudged a felony within 5 Eliz. C. 14, to counterfeit a conveyance with a wrong name, although the conveyance would have been void if it was genuine, 1 Keb. 803. 3 ICeb. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">But notwithstanding the validity of the instrument, if real, is immaterial, it must not appear on its face, so that no one of common understanding would give it credit. Thus, it will not be a forgery to fabricate a will of land, as attested by only two witnesses. 2 East T. C. 953.</p>\n<p id=\"AFf\">The greater resemblance there is between counterfeit and true bills, the greater the crime of passing and counterfeiting them. City Hall Rec. vol. 1, p. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"Af-\">An instrument in writing, directing or requesting the payment of a specific sum in the bills of an individual, are not the subject of forgery under the statute. Ibid, vol. 2. p. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"AzG\">An instrument forged to fall within the statute, must be such, that an action might be sustained thereon, without recurring to extrinsic testimony. And an instrument upon which an indictment is predicated, if created by statute, must be conformable to its provisions Vol. 3, p. 59\u201465.</p>\n<p id=\"A8B\">A paper, purporting to be a power of attorney, authorizing a receipt of a pension due from the government to a wounded seaman, not under seal, though forged, is not an instrument upon which an indictment for forgery, under the statute, can be predicated. Vol. 4, p. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">To constitute forgery, it is not-necessary that the name of any person in existence should be forged. Vol. 5, p. 87, vol. 6. p. 25,</p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">The person, whose name to an order for the delivery of goods, is forged, should have a right to order their delivery ; for it seems a mere request in writing, to deliver an article, over which the drawer has no control, is not an order for the delivery of goods, and to make such instrumedt falsely, is not a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"AUR\">Forgery, under the act, cannot be committed, unless the note is payable in money. Jbid, vol. 1, p. 159. vol. 2, p. 155,</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>common law, forgery seemed more immediately confined to the falsification of records, and other instruments of a public nature, and also of private deeds and instruments under seal. By the decision in Ward\u2019s case, 2 Ld. Raym. 1461. It was held, after solemn argument, that forgery might be in respect of any writing whatever, by which ( another might be defrauded Chitty C.
