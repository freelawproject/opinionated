They were brought to the police office and committed for trial. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>part of the goods stolen from Haggerty &amp; Austin, and identified by them, were found in the house, concealed in a trunk. Part of these goods had been sent to a Mr. Cochrane, who keeps a retail dry good store in Greenwich street, to sell upon commission ; under suspicious stances, and who was tried on a charge for receiving knowing they were stolen.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-8\">Maxwell, <em>District </em>Attorney,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXY\">now offered to read the examination of Ferris, taken by the committing magistrate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-9\"><em>Price </em>and Anthon, counsel for the prisoners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHxR\">objected, and offered Mr.- Hays to prove that promises of favor was held out by Mr. Hedden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq8N\">He testified, that justice Hedden called Ferris\u2019s wife into a room, and told her, that \u201cif what she told him was true, it was better for her husband to confess.\u201d That Mrs. Ferris came to deponent and asked him, \u201c can we put confidence in him,\u201d or, \u201ccan we confide in him.\u201d Hays answered her, \u201cyes, you may confide in Justice Hedden.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-11\"><em>Maxwell, </em>then called Justice Hedden to disprove Hays : he testified that he had told tirewoman, \u201c if what she said to him was true, her husband had better confess :\u201d but testified that he had never held out any inducement to fear, or favor ; but, on the contrary, the next day, when the examination was taken, told him, that nothing he had said before, should induce him to expect any favor ; but that he had all the facts, and it would be better to tell them truly, 'for if he did not, he would detect him in a falsehood. He then examined him in the usual manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-14\"><em>Maxwell </em>argued the question at some length. He contended there was no hope of favor held out to the prisoner ; that telling his wife, \u201c if what she said to him was \u201c true, it would be better for her husband to confess,\u201d could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>not be construed into an offer of favor : here was no offer whatever made, nothing was promised, either directly or indirectly, no threat or menace was used, or any undue whatever exercised. The examination was made next day, time enough to extinguish any spark of hope of favor he might have thought was held out <em>to </em>him. The conversation was with the wife, and not the husband : nothing directly was said to <em>Mm ; </em>that if any expectation of that kind was anticipated by the prisoner, he ought to have been satisfied the next morning that no favor was intended, when the conversation in relation to the arrest and examination took place with the magistrate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-14\">The counsel for the1 prisoner was about replying, when they were told by the court it was unnecessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b76-16\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A31\"><em>\u201c </em>It is necessary to make the examina- \u201c tion of a prisoner evidence upon his trial ; that it should \u201c be made without any menace or terror held out to him or any species of undue influence used ; it must be free \u201c and voluntary.

A number of officers, \u201cwith Justice Hedden, go to Ward\u2019s Island, they there ar- \u201c rest the prisoners, and all others they find in the house ; \u201c they put them in irons preparatory to taking them to the \u201ccity; a conversation between Justice Hedden and the \u201cwife of one of the prisoners takes place; in this contt versation he tells her, ! if what she has told him was \u201c true, it would be better for her husband to confess.\u2019 The \u201c *mPort \u00b0- this question to the understanding of Mrs. Fer- \u201c ris, can be understood, from what she said afterwards to \u00ae\u00aer. Hays ; she asks him if Justice Hedden could be \u201c confided in, and she received a reply, that he could. \u201c Now the court thinks this was holding out an expecta- \u201c tion of favor, inconsistent with the free and voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201c spirit in which a confession snould be made; we think \u201cthe mind of the prisoner was unduly influenced by \u201c was said to him ; nor do we think it alters the case, that <em>\u201c </em>the examination was not taken until the next morning , . \u201e . , . , , , . , 1 \u201c that influence continued to exist throughout the night, \u201c and cannot be fairly supposed removed, by what was \u201c said to him at that time. The court there decides, the 1 examination cannot be read.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\"><em>Maxwell </em>observed, upoi\\this decision,She had nofj'suAncient evidence to support the charge against Ferris, and would not trouble the court by offering any more; and would consent to an acquittal. The proof appearing positive against Robertson, he was found guilty, and Ferris acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Nora.\u2014The following important and appropriate remarks on this point, cannot be too carefully attended to : it is found in Grilb. Evid. by Loft, p. 137. Speaking of confession, he says, \u201c These rules reflecTthe- \u201c brightest lustre on the English law, which benignly considers, th^t \u201c the human mind, under the pressure of calamity, is easily seduced \u201c and liable, in the alarm of danger, to acknowledge indiscriminately \u201c a falsehood or a truth, as if different agitations may prevail; and, \u201c therefore a confession, whether made upon official examination or \u201c in discourse with private persons, which is obtained from a defen- \u201c dant by the impression of hope or fear, however slight the impres- \u201c sion may be implanted, is not admissible evidence; for the law will \u201c not suffer the prisoner to be made the deluded instrument of his \u201c own conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">The following are the leading authorities upon this <em>point:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\"><em>\u201c </em>Confession obtained in consequence of promises or threats, cannot be t? . \u201c given in evidence, but any facts resulting fron^such inadmissible <em>\u201c </em>confession may be received.\u201d But they must be given in evidence, \u201c without the aid of the confession. Warickshall\u2019s case, Leach\u2019s Cases, vol. 1. p. 298. 3d edit. And see Rex. v. Butler, Maidstone Summer Assizes, 1798.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">A confession induced by saying, \u201c unless you give me a more satisfactory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c account I will take you before a magistrateor by saying, \u201c tell <em>\u201cme </em>where the things are and I will be favorable to you,\u201d cannot be given in evidence. Ibid. vol. 1. p. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"AmB\">\u201c The confession of a prisoner made under the expectation of favor,when <em>\u201c </em>iea&lt;\u00fcnS t0 other facts, independent of such confession, such fact \u201c may be received in evidence.\u201d Contra, when made under the offer of favor. Jackson\u2019s case, City Hall Rec. vol. 1. p. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">On a confession, made under the influence of threats, which might have operated in the examination in the police, the jury will be justified in rejecting such confession.

He was advised by one of the officers of the Bank defrauded, to make a full disclosure against the others, and that he should be made state evi deuce: no threat being used, and the examinant himself acknowledged it was voluntarily made ; yet, it was held, the confession could not be read as evidence upon his trial..
