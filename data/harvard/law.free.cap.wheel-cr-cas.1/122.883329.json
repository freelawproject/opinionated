It is too late in this state of the \u201c case to examine witnesses, however important their tes- \u201c timony may be. There must be a rule, and that rule <em>\u201c </em>must be enforced ; if it should be departed from in this \u201c case, it would be urged as a precedent in others, perhaps \u201c with the same reason. The rule is, after the witnesses \u201c for the people have been examined, and also those on the \u201c part of the prisoner, and the counsel have commenced <em>\u201c </em>commenting upon the evidence to the jury, it is too late \u201c to offer additional testimony.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
