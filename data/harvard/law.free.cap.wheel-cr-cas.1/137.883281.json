He took hold of her arm and called Mr, M\u2019Kinney, a watchman, and ordered him to take care of the prisoner. Mr. M\u2019Kinney took her to the watch-house, where she was confined, and next morning discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Process was issued against Bush, and bail entered for his appearance at the sessions, to answer for an assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\"><em>Wilson </em>proved, upon the cross-examination of M\u2019Kinney and other witnesses, that Bush took hold of the prosecutor in a mild and gentle manner, that he used no harsh expression to her. He also offered to show that she was-a woman of bad character, and known to be such : that she was, but a moment before, seen by Mr. Bush/coming' out of a house of ill-fame : that she had separated herself from her husband, and was notoriously a bad woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\"><em>Maxwell </em>objected to the introduction of such testimony,, and contended that no officer had a right to arrest and detain the person of a citizen, however bad his character might be, who was guilty of no crime : that the liberty of the citizen was too precious to be violated with impunity by the power of any officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">The court overruled the evidence. They observed that it would not alter the case whether the prosecutor was a woman of good or bad character : that she had a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>sight to walk the streets unmolested\u2014provided she conimitted no breach of the peace, and gave no good ground to suspect her of felony : that ,the \"person of a citizen was sacred : they could not be arrested and thrown into prison at the whim or caprice of the watch or any other thority : that in this case it did not appear that any of-fence at all was committed; the prosecutor came up to the defendant and called him \u201c cousin this certainly cannot \u25a0be an offence to merit an imprisonment: besides, it appears by the evidence, that she really mistook the defendant for her cousin,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">'Note.\u2014Watchmen, by the common law, have authority to arrest, and detain in prison for examination, all persons walking the street at night, whom there is a reasonable ground to suspect guilty of felony, although there may be no proof of a felony having been committed.
