Mrs. Clark, on a charge of passing upon the defendant a $5 counterfeit note. It appeared the defendant saw them pass his store in the Bowery, and followed, and and compelled them to return to his house. They were very much frightened, and cried for help, and denied ever having passed any counterfeit money upon the deThey were, nevertheless, taken into the store of the defendant, where they remained about one hour,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aol\">The circumstance excited some attention in the neigh-^0r^00^&gt; and a considerable number of people were gathered before the door: among others was the prosecutor.\u2014 defendant offered to let the ladies go if they would pay him for the \u00a75 counterfeit note, which he alleged he had received from them, but told them if they did not he would send for an officer and take them to the police,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7QK\">Mr. Crawbeck expostulated vyith him, on his treatment of the ladies : he went into the house where they were confined,and some words between himself and the defendant ensued, which resulted in the assault and battery complained of. The prosecutor testified thas the defendant seized him by the throat, and used him violently.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-13\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8O\">examined the prosecutor, and before he turned him over to the defendants for cross examination, Wilson asked him a-question in explanation to what he had testified. He was stopped by the Co.urt. They observed the question was irregular, and had often observed it before; but that counsel would break through those rules in regard to examining witnesses so often explained, and so necessary to be enforced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-14\"><em>Sampson </em>and <em>D. Graham,, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5P\">They called witnesses to prove that Miss Johnson did pass the bill upon the defendant. For this purpose they called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Mr. Petrie, who testified that Miss Johnson came into his store in the Bowery, to purchase a ball of cotton, and offered him a $5 counterfeit note in payment; that she had on a straw bonnet and white spencer: he was certain he could not be mistaken. Miss Johnson was called to the witness\u2019s stand, that her countenance might be more distinctly seen. He presisted that she was the same woman: that he was certain, and could not be mistaken</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\"><em>Mr. Miller </em>was also called. He testified that he. was a store-keeper in the Bowery: that Miss Johnson came into his store and offered him the same note that was after-wards received by the defendant: that he was certain she was the same woman, and was certain it was the same note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">___ This;evidence was introduced to show that the conduct of the defendant to the ladies, did not require the interposition of the prosecutor in their favor, and to show that the prosecutor was the aggressor in coming in the defendant\u2019s house, and interfering as he did.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">It was proved bjr a number of respectable witnesses, that Miss Johnson was lately from Middletown, in the State of Connecticut, and was entirely unacquainted with the city: that she had no such dress as described by Petrie and Miller. It was also proved that she was a young woman of good character : and that the witnesses must have been mistaken in the identity of the person of Miss Johnson.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-10\"><em>By the </em>Court..</author>\n<p id=\"AaV\">\u201cAny person has a right to arrest a \u201c felon, and bring them before the proper authority. It is, \u201cindeed, the duty of the citizen to do so. But then this \u201c power cannot be trifled with, as it appears to have been \u201c in the present case. The defendant seized Miss Johnson \u201c in company with her sister, Mrs. Clark, by the arm, in \u201c the street, charging her with, a few days before, passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201c a counterfeit bill upon him. He took them into his house, \u201c and there confined them for the space of nearly an hour; <em>a </em>telling Miss Johnson if she would pay him in good mon- \u201c ey, the amount he alleged he received from her, he \u201c would let her go, if not, he would send for an officer, and <em>\u201c </em>take her to the Police Office. This mode of proceeding \u201c was clearly irregular. It was the duty of the defendant, \u201c if he believed the woman guilty, to take her immediately \u201c to the proper authority; or if that could not be done, to \u201csecure her in his own house or some other place, until \u201c he could send for an officer, or take her himself. But \u201c in this case it does not appear that public good was his \u201cobject, button the contrary, private interest. He offered \u201cto let her go if she would pay him five dollars for the \u201c bad bill. Now, it is certain he had no right to force her \u201c into his house and detain her there for the purpose of receiving five dollars for any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Note.\u2014The importance of the above case to the public, would seem to warrant an inquiry into the law relating to arrests on a criminal charge, There is, perhaps, no title of criminal jurisprudence less known, and more important to be known, than that relating to arrests.
