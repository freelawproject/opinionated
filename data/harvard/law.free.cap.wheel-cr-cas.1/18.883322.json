'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAzn\">The facts in evidence appeared by the testimony of Mrs. 1 M\u2019Intyre, the prosecutor, that Mary Williams came to live in the house of George M\u2019Intyre, her husband, at No. 14, Cross-street, on the 16th of August, 1822, and went away on the 19th of the same month, taking'the articles mentioned in the indictment along with her. She went to the pown-broker\u2019s office kept by Mrs. Willess, in Chathamstreet, and sold them. She was afterward\u2019taken; the articles identified ; and the prisoner committed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-16\"><em>Price, </em>counsel for the prisoner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcF\">submitted to the Court whether there was sufficient testimony against her: <em>The evidence not being the best the nature of the case admits of: </em>for \u201c perhaps the husband, whose testimony has not been \u201c introduced, gave the prisoner the articles\u201d\u2014\u201cperhaps he \u201c sold them to her the affirmative in either case would prove his client innocent: it was therefore important that the testimony of the husband to whom the articles b\u00e9longed, should be given to the Jury. No such testimony has been offered : the husband has not shown his face before the Court: the Jury therefore ought to acquit the prisoner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5D\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGV\">declined answering the objections made by Price.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-18\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ALR\"><em>\u201c </em>There is certainly no weight in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201c objections made by the prisoner\u2019s counsel: they cannot \u201c be sustained. What kind of articles are those enumera- \u201c ted in this indictment <em>1 </em>Are they not women\u2019s wearing \u201c'apparel <em>1 </em>And are they not more familiar to the wife \u201c than the husband ?- And would not she be the \u201c proper person to identify and prove them ? It is unreasonable to suppose in the absence of proof, that the hus- \u201c band should sell his wife\u2019s clothes ; and still more un- \u201c reasonable that he should give them away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The question was put to rest by the witness observing that her husband had been absent to Russia more than a year. It was therefore impossible as the Court observed, that he could have\u2019given or sold them to the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\"><em>Price </em>then attempted to show that George M\u2019lntyre was not the husband of the prosecutor: he proved, by answers elicited from her, that she had been several times married and had-passed under different names; but failed to show that she had not been lawfully married to her present husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The Jury found the prisoner guilty, and recommended her to the mercy of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
