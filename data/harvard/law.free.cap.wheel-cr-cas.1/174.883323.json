It appeared that some years since, the prosecutor had lived in Orange county, and the prisoner had stopped one or two days at his house, but had no other connexion or acquaintance but that derived from that circumstance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">He called over to the store of the prosecutor, and told him he was sorry to see him in such a small way, and intimated that he was in possession of large funds, and would assist him in his business ; telling him he thought they might become mutually serviceable to each other : he would go on to the southward and purchase goods, and consign them to the prosecutor, and telling him he had a draft drawn by a Mr. Edmondson in Charleston, payable in Boston ; that he had just been to Boston, but the house had failed, and the draft was protested for nonpayment : that he had borrowed $200 of a friend to come on to New York : that on the 4th of July, as he was walking among the crowd in the Park, his pocketbook, with the contents, was cut out of his coat pocket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">In consequence of this story, he prevailed upon the prosecutor to lend him, at sundry times, different sums of money. After working upon the credulity of the prosecutor by these artifices for some time, he told him he had a draft on Mr. Edward Thompson, of Philadelphia, for seven hundred and fifty dollars, which would be paid on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>presenting it in Philadelphia. He again prevailed upon the prosecutor to lend him more money for the purpose of going there. He also represented himself as an opulent merchant; asserting he had two ships at sea, one daily \u2022 expected into port.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">By these falsehoods and arts, he obtained about $167 from the prosecutor, but had left 14 barrels of flour in his possession, which reduced the amount to about $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">After the prisoner had got the last sum of money from the prosecutor, he went to Philadelphia, under a pretence of receiving the amount of the draft, and was seen again in three days in New York. The prosecutor heard no more of him until he learnt from the police-office of this city, he was in Norfolk gaol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">It was soon discovered he was no merchant ; that he owned no vessels ; that he followed no business ; that the drafts were forgeries ; that he was a gambler, and a man of notorious bad character.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-11\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_EM\">rested the prosecution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-12\"><em>Price, Fay, </em>and <em>Phoenix, </em>counsel for the prisoner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACtU\">made a number of exceptions, not only to the evidence, but also to the indictment<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Settled by the District Attorney, and on file in the Clerk\u2019s office\u2014 \u00abcarefully copied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-16\">The court observed that the ccfhnsel for the defendant should have the advantage of the several exceptions made on arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A2mB\">They are carefully noted, ana will be given in full in the report of the argument on the exceptions, if they take place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\">The court observed to the jury, that the evidence was of that positive nature as to admit of no doubt of the prisoner\u2019s guilt. And recommended to the jury to find him guilty. That the court were always willing to hear what could be alleged in favor of the prisoner, in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Note.\u2014At common law this offence was confined within very narrow limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">It was held that at common law no fraud by cheating or using false prev tences, could be punished by indictment, unless it affected the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The principles laid down by Lord Mansfield, in the Brewer\u2019s case, 3 r <em>r </em>. Burr. 1125 seems to have been respected and adopted by his successors. He decided on a prosecution for this species of crime, that \u201c an offence to be indictable must be such an one as affects the , , . , , and he pointed out,</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">1. Fraud by using false weights, Trem. P. G. 103. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">2. Fraud by using false measures, Cowper, 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">3. Fraud by using false tokens, Cro. Jac. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">4. Conspiracy to cheat, 2 Ld. Ray. 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">5. Frauds affecting the course of Justice, 4 East. Rep. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">The first and second offences, in order to make them indictable, must be committed in the common and ordinary course of dealing, 3 Term. Rep. p.. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">Chitty, in his 3 vol. C. L. p. 757. after enumerating the cases decided, concludes with the following summary : \u201c The cases in which fraud \u201c is indictable at common law, seemed confined to the use of false \u201c 'weights and measures ; the selling goods with counterfeit marks ; \u201cplaying with false dice; and frauds affecting the course of justice, \u201c and immediately injuring the interest of the public or the crown.\u201d And goes on to say : \u201c The first three of the above class of cases seem \u201c to come under the denomiation <em>offalse tokens, </em>often used in the old \u201c authorities. They seem to depend on the principle, that they be- \u201c token a general intent to defraud, and support the rule laid down, \u201c'that the injury must be to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">To reach the numerous and complicated cases of fraud' that were not indictable at common law, that statute 33 Hen. 8. O. 1. was passed. This statute made the fraud upon an individual, by using <em>false tokens, </em>punishable by indictment, whereas at common law the offence must ' be against the public, or in some measure affect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-23\">To supply the defects of the 33 Hen. 8. which it is said would not extend to a verbal representation, the 30 Geo. 2. was passed. In this act the word <em>false pretences </em>is used, and is said to include every extortion of money or goods with intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-24\">This statute was followed by the 52 Geo. 3. which extended the operation of former statutes to bonds, bills of exchange, bank notes, all securities and orders for the payment of money, or the transfer of goods, or any valuable thing whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-25\">For the construction of these statutes, see the following authorities : 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Ld. Ray. I46G. 2 East. P. C. 689. 6 Term. Rep. 565. 2 Burr. 1128 3 Campb.370 . 3 Term. Rep. 103. ibid. 98. East P. C. 830. 2 East, Rep-30- 2 Leach- 61^-</p>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">Our statute defining this offence is to be found 1 vol, R. L. p. 410 \u00a7 13. operative words afe:\u2014shall knowingly and designedly, by false pretence, obtain from any other person any money, goods or chattels, <em>or other effects </em>whatsoever; with intent to cheat or defraud any person or body politick or coporate, &amp;c. Itis copiedfvom 30 Geo. 2. C. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Upon this statute a great number of indictments have been prosecuted in the court of sessions for the city and county of New York. The fol- <em>t </em>lowing is a short summary of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">John Ring\u2019s case, City-Hall Rec. vol. 1. p. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Mordecai Lazarus\u2019s case, ibid, p. 89. It was decided in this case that an equitable right or interest is embraced within the words. \u201cor other effects whatsoever,\u201d contained in the statute. And that where divers pretences alleged to be false, are laid in the same count in the indictment, and either of them sufficient within itself, is substantially proved to be false on the trial, the indictment is sufficiently supported : nor is it necessary every of-fence so laid should be proved false.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">In the case of Henry Lanstaff and others, ibid p.|116 it was decided, that if a man by falsely representing himself to be in a particular situation, obtain thereby money or goods, which without such representations, he would have been unable to obtain, he is guilty of obtaining the money or goods by false pretences.</p>\n<p id=\"A8a\">George Lynch\u2019s case, ibid p. 438. there is in this case the following syllabus. It seems, where a man resorting to no artifice or false token, calculated to gain credit, beyond his own assertion or act founded on his own responsibility, obtains money or goods, should it appear such assertion was false, and such act fraudulent, the offence doth not fall within the provisions of the statute \u25a0 aforesaid, and the party so defrauded must resort to a civil action for redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-22\">See Dinah Perry\u2019s case, ibid 164. and vol. 3. p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">In Daniel K. Allen\u2019s case, ibid vol. 3. p. 118. it was decided, that to constitute a false pretence under the statute, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>necessary there should be a false allegation; and see also Eli B. Mott\u2019s case, p. 155. vol. 4. p. 53\u201461.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">See also James Conger\u2019s case, and the cases there collected, ibid p.
