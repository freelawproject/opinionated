He further testified that Mary Ann did not pay for the beer, and that he charged it to her father\u2014he made the entry in the store book himself\u2014that Mary Ann was in the store in the evening of the 28th, in company with him, making soda water\u2014that she again called on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Monday and purchased some articles out of the store, for which her father was credited. He was explicit in stating that Flinn was not. there between one and two o\u2019clock, and that Mary Ann was rude upon several occasions to Flinn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-3\">He was warmly cross-examined by Maxwell, but ted so little, if .any, from his examination in chief, that it is deemed unnecessary to insert it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-5\"><em>Frances Gallagky </em>was next called: she testified that She stopped in the prosecutor\u2019s house, and that in a conversation with her, she used the words, <em>c: </em>O ! the d\u2014d rascal : I will be revenged upon him ; I will put him in the State Prison and further, that she would \u201c spend the last, shilling and that the prosecutor swore a great deal. \" She further testified that she washed for Flinn, and that no marks of disease 'was ever seen by her, on his linen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">Mrs, <em>Palmer, </em>a respectable woman, was called, who testified that she was present when the alleged conversation was said to have taken place between Frances Gallaghy and Mrs. Jameison, and that the prosecutor used no such inflamatory language as that sworn to by the witness : that she was present all the time of the conversation, and that the prosecutor is not accustomed to use the words mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-8\"><em>Maxwell </em>now offered to prove that the prisoner had been examined, ' and also the issue of that examination, and offered Dr. Walker as a witness to prove it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-10\"><em>Anthon, </em>objected, he contended that it was first necessary to prove the fact that the girl was diseased, which had not yet been done. Suppose it was proved the prisoner had the disease, what does it amount to, if Mary-Ann was free from it ? it amounts to nothing, unless you suppose the girl infected by him. The contrary would be building presumption upon presumprion j it was beginning at the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>end-; prove the child diseased, and the evidence now offere\u00bf wjq pr0per-</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3t\"><em>Maxwell </em>replied that it was immaterial to him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AO7\">The ^ourt observed that to examine as to the state of the person, would prove nothing of itself; in order to make it evidence in this case, the examination should be made in reference to the act committed on the 28th of July, and how could that bo done without showing the situation of the person of Mary Ann, at and subsequent to that time; the contrary would be supposing her diseased, and that the prisoner infected her, which would clearly be building a presumption upon a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">Dr. <em>Brotan </em>was then called to show the situation of the girl ; he testified that he was called on the 15th of August to examine her, and that he found her laboring under the . disease before mentioned ; he was <em>inclined </em>to the opinion, and finally gave it as his <em>decided </em>opinion, that the disease was gonorrhoea. .</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Dr. <em>Walker </em>was now called, who proved the facts relating, to the examination of the prisoner in Bridewell, before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">In order to rebut this testimony, Dr. Mott was called for the prisoner. He testified that he was called upon to ex-aminp Mary Ann, and that from all the circumstances, he was uncertain whether it was the venereal or not, that it was impossible to tell at that age, and under the circumstances of this case. He further testified that he was called upon by the prisoner, two days after the examination made in Bridewell by Dr. Walker, and requested an examination of his person ; no marks of disease whatever could be found upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">Dr. <em>Walker </em>was again called, who proved that by using proper remedies, the most skillful physician might be de-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ceived by his patient: the disease might be so far removed as not to be visible, in two days\u2014in two hours\u2014by the administration of proper medicine : Dr. Mott concurred with \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The prisoners counsel called a great number of nesses, who proved that he was a steady young man ; was affable in his deportment, and regular in his attendance at public worship ; and that he was a young man of good character ; and here rested the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">The case was eloquently summed up by <em>D. Graham </em>and <em>Anthon </em>for the prisoner ; and <em>Price </em>on the part of the people. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">The case was then given to the jury in a comprehensive charge, in which the principal facts were recapitulated, and the law in relation to them explained by his Honor the Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">The jury retired, and in a short time returned with a verdict of guilty against the prisoner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
