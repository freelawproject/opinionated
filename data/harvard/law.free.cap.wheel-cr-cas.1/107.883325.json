He advertised them. Mr. \u00c1ngel Jacobs, who keeps a broker\u2019s office, bought the coffee-pot, and upon observing the advertisement, gave information to Mr. Clench that he had bought the coffee-pot of .a man who called himself William Johnson, and offered Mr. Clench to surrender the article, if he would give him the name of the person who sold it to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-22\">Mr. Clench was anxious to obtain his property, but seemed averse to give the name of his brother-in-law. Jacobs refused to deliver the article until he complied with his request. A suit was commenced against him for the value of the pot, by Mr. Clench, which was abandoned, and this prosecution resorted to, to obtain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-24\">The prisoner admitted in his examination, that he had taken the articles^and sold * them in the manner above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-25\">He was defended by <em>Dr. Graham </em>and <em>N. B. </em>Graham, who contended that the prosecutor and his wife had conspired with the prisoner, that.be should take articles out of the house and sell and pledge them for the use of the prosecutor, and then charge the prisoner with stealing them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>in order to get the goods back, or the price of them ; and offered to show the needy circumstances of the prosecutor at the time.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AkJ\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6g\">addressed the jury, and observed, the evidence was of such a nature as \u2018to be irresistable : that the confession of the prisoner was full and satisfactory : that no evidence had been offered tjiat could induce the court and jury to believe, that any improper connexion existed between the prisoner and the prosecutor: that it was unreasonable and absurd to suppose a conspiracy among these people, as stated by the counsel for the prisoner, in the absence of testimony.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-11\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AlTD\">\u201cThe prisoner is charged with stealing &lt;! a number of articles, some of them of very considerable \u201c value.- The evidence before us has been confined to one ' \u201c only, to wit, the silver coffee-pot. But by the examina- \u201c tion of the prisoner it appears he has confessed the lar- \u201c ceny of all the articles mentioned in the indictment. <em>\u201c </em>The law upon the subject of examinations is that a prisoner may be convicted upon that species of proof alone. It \u201c is, however, at all times advisable to have other testimony <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>if it can be procured. It is for the jury to say, under all <em>\u201c </em>the circumstances of the case, whether the prisoner is \u201c guilty of grand<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or petit larceny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">The jury found the prisoner guilty of grand larceny.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-17\">Note.\u2014It is of primary importance in the administration of criminal justice, that the laws be certain and defined, that as little power be - left to the discretion of the court and jury, as the nature of those laws will admit. It requires no stretch of skill to discover that in proportion to the certainty and fixed principles of a law in the same ratio will that law be respected and obeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">That a jury not only decide upon the law, but also determines the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>is a principle too well settled to be denied. It is however, an aggregate of power too important to be trifled with. With respect to their discretion in deciding the value of goods, on a charge of larceny, \u25a0\u2022whether the crime is petit or grand larceny, there can be no doubt that they are bound to those salutary rules adopted in other cases for the regulation of their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">And although a feeling of tenderness and mercy may, and should exist in the minds of virtuous jurors for the fate of a criminal, yet it should never extend to the length it has been intimated it has been extended, particularly as it relates to charges of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Sir Samuel Romilly, in his observations ori the criminal law of England, p. 65 and 66, with great learning and accuracy, says, \u201c The lat- \u201c itude which jurors allow themselves ip estimating the value of prop- \u201c erty stolen, with a view to the punishment which is to be the conse- \u201c quence of their verdict, is an evil of very great magnitude. Noth\u201cing can be more pernicious, than that jurymen should think lightly \u201c of the important duties they are called upon to discharge, or should \u201c acquire a habit of trifling with the solemn oaths they take. And \u201c yet ever since the passing of the acts which punish with death the \u25a0\u201c stealing in shops or houses, or on board ships, property of differ- \u201c ent values which are there mentioned, juries have, from motives of \u201c humanity, been in the habit of frequently finding, by their verdicts, \u201c that the things stolen were worth much less than was clearly prov- \u201c ed to be their value. It is held, indeed, by some of the judges, \u25a0\u201c (whether by all of them, and upon all occasions, I am not certain,) \u201c that juries in favor of life may fairly, in fixing the value of the pro- \u201c perty, take into their consideration the depreciation of money which \u201c has taken place since the statute passed ; or, in the words of Mr. <em>\u201c </em>Justice Blaclcstone, may reduce the present nominal value of money \u2022\u201c to its ancient standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\n<em>lie then goes on to specify a number of cases where this system has been acted upon, as follows :</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\"><em>s\u2018 </em>In the year 1731\u20142, which was onlyjhrity two years after the act of king William, and only sixteen after the act of Queen Ann, a period during \u201c which there had scarceely been any sensible diminution in the val-&lt;l ue of money ; it appears from the sessions\u2019 papers that, of thirty- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201c three persons indicted at the Old Bailey, for stealing privately in \u201c shops, warehouses, or stables, goods to the value of five shillings- \u201c and upwards, only one was convicted, twelve were acquitted, and \u201c twenty were found guilty of theft; but the things stolen were found \u201c to be worth less than five shillings. Of fifty-two persons tried in \u201c the same year at the Old Bailey, for stealing in dwelling-houses, \u201c money or other property, of the value of forty shillings, only six <em>\u201c </em>were convicted, twenty-three were acquitted of the -larceny, but 11 saved from capital punishment by the jury stating the stolen prop- \" erty to be of less value than forty shillings.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u201c In the following years, the number do not differ very materially from \u201c those in the year 1731. '</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Some of the causes which dccurred about this time, arc of such a kind, \u201c that it is difficult to imagine by what casuistry the jury could have \u201c been reconciled to their verdict. It may be proper to mention it \u201cfew of them. Elizabeth Hobbs was tried in September, 1732, for \u201c stealing in a dwelling house, one broad piece, two guineas, two \u201c half guineas, and forty shillings in money. She confessed the fact, \u201c and the jury found her guilty, but found that the money stolen was <em>\u201c </em>only worth thirty-nine shillings.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">11 Mary Bradley, in May, 1732. was indicted for stealing in a dwelling \u201c house, lace which she had offered to sell for twelve guineas, and ll for which she had refused to take eight guineas -; the jury, howev- \u201c er, who found her guilty, found the lace to be worth no more than \u201c thirty-nine shillings.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">William Sherrington, in October, <em>1733, was </em>indicted for stealing private- \u201c ly in a shop, goods which h'e had actually sold for \u00a31 5s. and the \u201c jury found that they were worth only 4s 10d.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u201cIn the case of Michael Allon, indicted in February, 1733, for privately \u201c stealing in a shop, forty three dozen pairs of stocking, value x3 \u201c 10s.; it was proved that the prisoner had sold them for a guinea and \u201c a half to a witness who was produced on the trial; and yet the jury \u201c found him guilty of stealing what was only the value of 4s. lOd.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u2022\u201c In another case, that of George Dawson and Joseph Hitch, also indict- \u201c ed in February, 1773, it appeared that the two prisoners, in com- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201c pany together at the same time, stole the same goods privately in a \u201c shop, and the jury found one guilty to the amount of 4s. lOd. and <em>\" </em>the otllcv to the amount of 5s ; that is, that the same goods were at 11 one and the same moment of different values. This monstrous *\u25a0 proceeding is accounted for by finding that Dawson,'who was capital- \u201c ly, had been tried before at the same sessions for a similar offence, \u201c and lmd been convicted of stealing to the amount only of 4s. lOd. <em>\u201c </em>The jury seem to have thought, that having had the benefit of their \u201c indulgence once, he was not entitled to it a second time : or in * \u00b0 ' \u2019 \u201c other words, that having oneu had a pardon at their hands he had \u201c no further claims upon their mercy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">These complaints it is feared, might be made with equal reason in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">The following cases among a host of others, have been selectej.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">John Williams\u2019s case, City-Elall Bee. vol. l.p. 5. Williams was indicted for grand larceny, for stealing a great coat and a pocket book containing seven or eight dollars. The jury found him guilty of petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">Thomas Smith\u2019s case, City-Hall Reo. vol. 1. p. 52. The prisoner was indicted in March term, 1816, for a grand larceny of half a piece of Florence silk, and two shawls, the property of David Ayres and Ezekiel Halstead, notwithstanding it was a flagrant case, and the property stolen of very considerable value, he was found guilty of petit larceny only.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">George Kelly\u2019s case, City-Hall Rec. vol. 3. p. 153. Kelly was indicted for grand larceny, October term, 1818, for stealing a watch of the value of forty dollars, the property of John Wescott. This was also a flagrant case ; yet the jury found him guilty of petit larceny.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
