The trunk was broken open, and the money carried away. It had been taken to the Jersey City Bank and exchanged for paper. The prisoner was soon after seen full of money, and refused to explain how he came in possession of it. He was examined, and committed for trial. . The identity of the money was proved upon the trial, and no doubt of his guilt existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">The averment in the indictment, charged that the defendant had feloniously taken and carried away \u201c one hun- \u201c dred and thirty Spanish dollars, of the current coin of \u201c this State.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-8\"><em>Price, </em>counsel for the prisoner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aehf\">took two exceptions to the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-9\">1. That this State has no current coin, the right of coining being reserved to the United States, by the express provision of the Constitution, and by the laws passed by Congress on the subject, a description therefore, describing \u201c the current coin of this State \u201d is inaccurate and insufficient. It should have been described as the current coin of the United States, or avered to be foreign coin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>2. That the Spanish dollar not being a legal tender in ^ jjnjte(} States, or in this State, has no legal value and that it was a well settled principle of law, that foreign coin must be avered to be so, and its value set forth in the indictment. No value being set forth, it does not appear to the Court that any loss has been sustained, and cited 1 Mass. Rep. 245. , ' '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-4\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL8\">replied, that the State of New York was one of the United States, and what was the current coin of the United States was also the current coin of the State of New York, and that he took the first exception, made by the counsel for the prisoner, to be untenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">With respect to the second objection, he took the law to be, where the coin was current in the country, and it had a well known and settled value, it was unnecessary to aver the value in the indictment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Court recommend that the points of law be reserved, and a verdict taken, subject to the opinion of the Court on the question^ of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The jury found the prisoner guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
