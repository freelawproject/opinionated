Osborn was indicted for committing a violent assault and battery upon John Stubbs, on the 29th of July, 1822.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-14\">It appeared, by the testimony of, Stubbs, that Osborn commanded a vessel called the Lady Washington, that plyed between New York and one of the southern ports that the prosecutor was a sailor on board the vessel. . ter the termination of the voyage and his engagement,&gt;the and while the vessel was lying at the wharf in the Bast <em>J \u00b0 </em>River, he went to the captain and demanded his wages for services performed on board her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-23\">The prosecutor testified he went into the cabin for the purpose of obtaining a settlement with Captain Osborn: that Osborn, apparently in the act of payment, fraudu- \u2019 rr <em>^ J </em>lently obtained a receipt for the money from the prosecu- , i , , tor. The prosecutor returned again to the vessel and demanded his money. The captain took up a billet of wood and struck him over the shoulders, and ordered him off . , . - his vessel. The prosecutor went away, and applied for a process against the Captain from the Marine Court, where a trial was had, and the result unfavorable to him. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Stubbs afterwards applied to the Police Office for a war-which was granted ; Osborn was taken and brought up, and bailed to answer the charge of assault and bat-telT- Another fact of this case was, although it was not to go to the jury, that the gran'd jury returned a bill against Osborn of petit larceny, for feloniously obtaining possession of the receipt, and for which, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered by the District Attorney. A great number of witnesses were called, who proved that the prosecutor was a man of bad character, not to be believed upon his oath. Others were called who gave him a good character.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-8\">Price, counsel for Osborn,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMc\">offered to prove to the jury, in order to show the malicious disposition of the prosecutor, that Stubbs had instituted a prosecution against his \u2022client for a petit larceny without good reason or probable cause. <em>i</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-9\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_lQ\">objected that it was foreign to the present inquiry, and could not be admitted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-10\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A6y\">\u201cThis cannot be done. The present \u201c inquiry is, is the defendant guilty of committing the as\u201csault and battery complained of in the indictment. The \u201c fact of a prosecution having been commenced by Stubbs \u201c of a different nature from the one now under inquiry, \u201c can have no bearing at all on the present question, and \u201c cannot make a part of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\"><em>Maxwell </em>called witnesses to the character of the prosecutor <em>; </em>they testified they .would believe him upon oath, &amp;c.</p>\n<author id=\"b106-12\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A-y\">\u201c A great number of witnesses have \u201c been called ; some testify that he is an honest and in- \u201c dustrious man, others that his character is bad, and that \u201c they would not believe him under oath. The credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>, \u201cof a witness is a proper subject for the consideration of \u201c a jury. They are to decide what degree of credit<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ought \u201c to attach to the testimony of any man. As to the law \u201cof the case,\u201d the court observed, \u201cthe prosecutor had a <em>\u201c </em>right to come on board the defendant\u2019s vessel for the \u201c purpose of demanding payment of his wages. And that \u201c the defendant also bad a right to order him off, allowing \u201c a proper time to demand his wages: that if he did not \u201c go, the defendant had a right to use a force sufficient to <em>\u201c </em>turn him off: hut in the amount and exercise of this force, \u201c he must take care that it w\u00e1s not more than was neees- \u201c sary to effect that object.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u201c In the first case he is justifiable, iu the second he is \u201c not.\u201d And the court left it to the jury to say, whether more force than was necessary was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The jury retired, and in a short time returned with a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Note.\u201411 The doctrine of evidence upon criminal prosecutions is, in \u201c most respects, the same as in civil actions. The rules of credibili- \u201c ty are evidently, in common re.ason, the same in both cases; and \u201c the chief distinction arises from that caution which always pre- <em>\u201c </em>vails when life is in question, and the anxiety of judges, to look on \u201c every circumstance with the most favorable eye for the defendant. \u201cIn one instance, indeed, the superior interest which the public have \u201cin the punishment of offenders, produces a striking difference; for \u201c the party agrieved is allowed to give evidence against the prisoner, \u201c though he is frequently permitted, by restoration of stolen goods, \u201c by rewards, by reimbursement of costs, or other means, to derive a \u201c benefit on his ^inviction : no injustice need, however, arise from ,1 this exception, which has been found essentially necessary for the \u201c purposes of public justice : because the credibility of the witness is \u201c still left to the jury, and.they are left to estimate the probable in- \u201c fluence of interest, or of revenge,' on the testimony which he deli- <em>\u201c </em>vers.\u201d Chit. vol. 1. p. 453.

Where a witness comes fairly before the jury, and who, from the circumstances of the case, is the best evidence the nature of the case will admit, e. i. was present-at the time &amp;c., his evidence should not be doubted, with the exception that\u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">1. His credibility is a subject for the consideration of the jury: and</p>\n<p id=\"AG2\">1st. His character. Black. Com. vol. 3. p. 395. Peak\u2019s Ev. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">2d. Being interested. I T. R. 300. Fortes. Rep. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">2. The manner of giving testimony: his evidence is to be doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">1. If he is hurried and confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">2. If he attempts to equivocate, palliate, or deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">3. If his character is shown to be bad either by his own conduct before the jury, or by the testimony of others. Ball N. P.284. 1 Vent. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">4. If his interest in the issue of the trial is such as to afford a reasonable ground of suspicion that he givesuhis testimony under the operation of that feeling. 1. T. R. 163. Roll. ab. 685. Rudd\u2019s Case : Leach 151.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">With respect to the <em>quantum </em>of testimony or number of witnesses, it is a settled rule of law that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">1. One good witness is sufficient to prove any fact before the jury, in all cases except treason and perjury. Chit. 456. Black, vol. 4. p. 357. Garth. 144. Black. Com. vol. 4. p. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-22\">2. The confession of the prisoner himself of any crime has always been held sufficient evidence of his guilt. Ibid.-j</p>\n<p id=\"b108-24\">Presumptive testimony. Of this species of testimony there are three kinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-25\">1. Violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-26\">2. Probable,</p>\n<p id=\"b108-27\">3. Ljght.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Violent presumption is a kind of circumstantial evidence amounting to positive proof. For example,</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">. 1. If A was seen coming out of a room, in which he had been with another, with a bloody sword. And if a man was found recently murdered in that room. And if A on being lenged showed marks of fear, it would amount to positive proof that A was the murderer. And</p>\n<p id=\"AqsO\">2. If a landlord sues for rent due at Michaelmas, 1754, and the tenant cannot prove the payment, but produces an acquittance for rent due at a subsequent time, in full of all demands, .this is a violent presumption of his having paid the former rent, and is equivalent to full proof; for though the actual payment is not proved,'yet the acquittance in full of all demands is proved, which could not be without such payment ; and it therefore induces so forcible a presumption, that no proof shall be admitted to the contrary. Co. Litt. 373. Gibb. Evid. 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">2. Probable presumption arising from such circumstances as usually attend the fact: for example,</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">1st. Suit for rent due in 1754. The tenant proves the payment of the rent due in 1755. This will also exonerate the tenant. Co. Litt. 373. On proof of payment in 1755, payment will be presumed in 1754. Jac. Law Die. vol, 2. p. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">3. Light presumptions move not at all.
