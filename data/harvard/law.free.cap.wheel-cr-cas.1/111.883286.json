According to the testimony of other witnesses, the horses did not refuse to draw, but that the load was heavy, and the whipping brutal and without cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-9\">It was, however satisfactorily proved that he struck them a very- great number of times over the head, neck, and shoulders, with the but-end of the whip.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVp\">Mr. Hone came up, while the defendant was in the act of beating them, and expostulated with him, and desired to know why he beat them, alleging the whipping was excessive and unlawful; a controversy took place between Mr. H\u00f3ne and the defendant, which terminated in a scuffle, in which the prisoner was cut in the face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-13\">The case was summed up to the jury by Mr. Fay for the defendant. \" *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-14\">He contended that the evidence was not satisfactory against the defendant: that it did not appear the horses were injured. He insisted it was proved, the horses were vicious, and would, not draw the load : that they had baulked two or three times coming into town with an empty wagon : that the tricks of a vicious horse were extremely \u2022calculated to inflame the passions of its owner : that he might, on such an occasion as the' one now before the \u25a0court, strike the horse ten or a dozen blows,- even with the but-end of a whip, without being answerable by indictment or otherwise. He contended that a parent had a right to correct and chastise his children ; that a schoolmaster has authority to correct his scholars, and a master his servant, and that it would be strange, and an anomaly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>in the law,-if a brute might not be corrected for its vicious \u2019 habits, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVP\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASC\">replied that the Almighty had given man dominion over the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, and the fishes of the sea. But must take care that his dominion be not abused; that like every other gift of the Deity, it might be and often was, abused. In such a case, the municipal laws of the country had stepped in to the aid of those of nature and religion, and would punish him for an infraction of their rules. That the evidence was conclusive against the defendant. It appeared (he said) by the testimony of Mr. Hone and Mr. Walker, and also by the brother of Mr. Hone, that the beating was outrageous, and without any justification. It was in the open street, in the most populous part of the city; showing an example unworthy of a man, in inflicting an unwarrantable injury upon a brute. And concluded by observing that several cases had occurred in this city and vicinity that had shocked the feelings of a number of citizens ; and that this case called loudly for example and punishment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Am3\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A_f\">\u201c It appears, by the evidence, that the \u201c prisoner was engaged in carting manure from the city, to \u201c a place in the country. The prisoner had got as far with \u201chis load as Broom street, in Broadway, when his \u201c horses either refused to draw or were unable to draw it <em>\u201c </em>any farther. It appears he commenced beating one of \u201c them very severely. He beat the horse over the head, \u201cneck, and shoulders, with the but-end of his whip. Mr. \u201c Hone, who was passing at the time humanely inter- \u201c fered. A scuffle ensued; the prisoner swearing he had \u201c a right to whip his horses without being called to ac- \u201c count. He struck them over the head, and not on those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>11 parts experienced horseman have recourse to. The tes11 timony in the opinion of the court, does not appear to \u201cexcuse or authorize the excessive violence of the beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u201c Mr. Hone\u2019s testimony is explicit and positive, that he \u201cbeat one of the horses over the head, with the but-end \u201c of his cart whip, ten or twelve blows, and is corroborated \u201cby his brother and Mr. Walker.' A clerk in the office of \u201c the Daily Advertiser, testified that he struck the horses \u201cforty or fifty blows, and thinks the beating was very \u201c violent and excessive. He declared that his feelings were \u201cso wounded by the transaction, that he was on the point \u201cofleaving the office for the purpose of arresting the vio- \u201c lent proceedings of the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201c It is true, by the testimony of Mr. Sherwood and Mr. \u201c Bruen, that the load was heavy, and that one of the \u201c horses was vicious, and sometimes refused to draw the \u201cload, yet it does not appear but that, by proper manage\u201cment, they might have been made to draw it. Yet, if \u201c they would not, the defendant had no right to beat them \u201c in the inhuman manner he did. The District Attorney \u201c has stated the law truly : a man may be punished for any \u201c abuse of this gift of power over the brute. If you think \u201c this power was abused, you will find the defendant guilty, \u201cbut if you think it was not abused; if you think the \u201c horses were vicious and refused to draw the load; or if \u201cyou think they were not overloaded, and that the but- \u201c end of a whip is a proper instrument, the defendant will \u201cbe entitled to your verdict of acquittal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The jury found the defendant guilty, and the court, in passing sentence upon him, observed, \u201cWe have heard of.' \u201c several cases of late, that have demanded the interposi- \u201c tion of courts of justice. Cruelty to a brute cannot be \u201cjustified. We have heard of instances, where the tongues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u201c of sucking calves have been tied for the purpose of pre- <em>\u201c </em>venting their dams being sucked; and also cases where <em>\u201c </em>they have been bled to death for the purpose of giving a \u201c colour to their flesh. In all such cases of wanton cruelty, \u201c brought before this court, they will not only notice, but \u201c punish the guilty offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Note.\u2014To treat a dumb beast with cruelty is a misdemeanor at common law..
