Mr. Good gave him money, and he went away and returned early in the evening ; went out again for a few minutes, and came in and went to bed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-16\">In a very short time after, the fire broke out in the stables ; the negro was waked up and assisted to put out the fire; they were successful in extinguishing it, and Mr. Good and his family retired to bed, leaving the negro in the barn, and requested the watchman who was stationed in the neighborhood to pay particular attention to the premises. In about one half an hour the barn was again discovered to be on fire, and was entirely consumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-NW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>It was proved by Mr Good and others that Charles was an jnc)uStnous boy, that during his service with him, he had behaved himself very well, had had no quarrel with Mr. Good, or with any of his family ; was temperate in ^.g an\u00bf or\u00bfer]y jQ bis Conduct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">It was also proved that at the first fire he carried water and assisted in putting it out; and that, after it was extinguished, he remained in the barn after the family had retired to bed, and until the barn was again on fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">It was also proved that after Mr. Good and the people thought they had extinguished the fire, it was found still burning under some bags of cut straw that lay in the barn, and this occurred two or three times before the fire was finally put out.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-7\"><em>E. Barns </em>and <em>J. D. Wheeler,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ait\">assigned by the Court counsel for the prisoner.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ASc\">The Court observed to the jury that the crime charged upon the prisoner was one of a very serious nature; the punishment was very penal by our statute, and required satisfactory proof. In this case the evidence was of that kind denominated in law presumptive evidence; and they intimated their opinion, that the circumstances were of too slight a nature to warrant a conviction, that in cases where the penalty was so very severe, the proof ought to be satisfactory. It may be probable that some third person threw combustible materials into the barn ; and that after Mr. Good and his people supposed they had put the fire out, there were some sparks left that shortly after lighted up into a flame. This is the most charitable conclusion. Inferences from facts are always to be taken in favor of the prisoner ; and in matters of doubt, presumptions of law and fact are to operate in his favor; and in this case they are violent; he had no quarrel with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Mr. Good, no difference with any of the family ; he. was not intemperate, or addicted to any vicious habits, &amp;c. In such cases, the absence of positive proof, or strong presumptive testimony, is material and indispensable.</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">The Jury returned a verdict of not guilty for the oner.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"ARb\">\u00abNote. Arson is defined to be \u201c the malicious and voluntary (or wilful) burning the house of another.\u201d 3 Inst, 66. 1 Hale, 566. East, C. L. p. 1015. 4 Blac. Comm. p. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"AJA0\">What is a malicious and )\"\u00b0^')ntary burning.</p>\n<p id=\"AI7s\">A malicious and voluntary burning must not be the effect of carelessness or negligence, for no malice is implied from those acts. 1 Hale, 569, 570, The 6 Ann, C. 31. makes it, however, a misdemeanor punishable by fine and imprisonment. Nor will the burning be con- \u25a0 sidered voluntary and malicious in the performance of an unlawful act, if accidental: as shooting at poultry or game, the property of a neighbor. But the words malicious and voluntary are not confined to the injury of a particular person or persons, but are construed to apply to all evil and mischievous acts, evincing a settled and general intentto the damage of individuals. 1 Hale, 569. If a man has a design to burn one house, and by accident the flames destroy another, instead of that against which his contrivance was directed, he will be guilty of maliciously burning the latter. Ibid. 3 Inst. 67. 1 Hawk. C. 39. And if one command another to burn the house of J. S., and he do so, and the fire thereof burn another house, the commander is accessary to the burning of such other house. Plo.wd. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">In East, C. L. p. 1031, it is said \u201c Hence it appears, that though the pri- \u201c mary intention of the party were only to burn his own house, yet \u201cif in fact others were burnt, being adjoining, and in such situation as \u201c that the fire must in all probability reach them, the intent being un - lawful and malicious, and the consequence immediately and neces- \u201c sarily flowing from the original act done, it is felony.\u201d See Isaac\u2019s case. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">In Breeme\u2019s case it was decided, after argument, that if a tenant set fire to the house of his landlord, before the tenancy expires, he is not guilty of Arson. 1 Leach, 209. To set fire to a quantity of p\u00e1per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>in a paper-mill, whereby the paper is wholly consumed and the mill not bUVnt, is not Arson. 1 Leach, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"AlSY\">statute of this State describes the offence to be \u201c <em>wilfully </em>burning . . . . \u201c any inhabited dwelling-house\u201d or <em>wilfully </em>burning any dwelling i10use uninhabited, or any house of public worship, or other public \u201c building, or any barn, or any grist mill. Rev. L. p. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">To set fire, designedly, to a house then inhabited as a dwelling house, so that it is completely ignited, is the <em>wilful </em>burning of an inhabited dwelling-house, within the meaning of the statute. 16 Johns. Rep. p. 203. City Hall Rec. vol. 4. p. 78, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">But it is not arson for a man to set fire to his own house and burn it, even in a populous city. But it is a great misdemeanor. Ibid. vol. 2. p. 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Setting fire to a prison by a prisoner, for the purpose of escape, does not amount to the crime of arson. 18 Johns. Rep. p. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"AXh\">Nor is it the <em>wilful burning of an inhabited dwelling-house. </em>Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">To constitute such burning <em>wilful, </em>the prisoner must set it on fire for the purpose of consuming the building. City Hall Rec. vol 6, p. 71. See Van Blarcum\u2019s case. 2 Johns. Rep. p. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">The word \u201c <em>wilfully </em>\u201d in the statute seems to imply, and is used in the Same sense as the words 11 voluntary \u201d and \u201c maliciously \u201d in the English statutes. The same evidence is required to convict. The same rules of construction prevail, The decisions in Great Britain are therefore authority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">What is the house of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">common law it was held, that not only the dwelling-house, but also out-houses, that are parcel of the dwelling-house, and within the curtilage, although not contiguous, were the subjects of arson. 1 Hale, 56. And it has always been held to be arson, to burn a barn filled with hay or corn, even where it stood a great distance from the house. 3 Inst. 69. To set fire to one\u2019s own house, whereby another is consumed, is arson. Cro. Car. 377, In the definition of arson, the mansion house is not only included, but it extends \u201c to the outset also, as \u201c barn, stable, cow house, sheep house, dairy house, mill house and a\u201c the like parcel of the mansion house.\u201d But they must be parcel of the mansion, although it is not necessary they should be under the At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>same roof. 1 Hale, 5G0. 1 Hawk. Ch. 38. If the out houses be adjoining to the mansion house, though there be no common enclosure or curtilage, they are still considered as parts of the mansion. 1 Hale, 559. The indictment need not alledge the burning'of a <em>mansion house, </em>but only of a <em>house. </em>East. C. L. p. 1020. 4 Blac. Commj 221. It must be the house of another, although it is unnecessary he should have the legal title or entire interest; a lawful possesion is sufficient. Cro. Car. 376. Chi tty, C. L. vol. 3, p. 532. It has been decided that arson cannot be committed by setting fire to premises which a man enjoys under a lease for years. Cro. Car. 376. Or even as tenant under an agreement for a lease. 1 Leach, 220. Nor can he be guilty of arson of the premises while tenant from year to year. But one entitled to dower, out of a dwelling house let to another person, if she burns it through malice, she will be guilty of arson. Fost. 113, And where a pauper was suffered to reside in a house free of rent it was held he might be guilty of arson in burning it, notwithstanding his possession. 1 Leach, 246, <em>in notis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The statute, 43 Geo. 3. C. 58, made the burning one\u2019s own house arson, but it does not extend to this country; nor have we a similar statute. It is here merely a misdemeanor at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">What shall be deemed a \u201c house,\u201d or the house of another has never been settled in this country, Upon this point, recourse must be had to the English statutes and the decisions of their courts of justice. Our statute, indeed, enumerates \u201c inhabited dwelling houses,\u201d and \u201c dwel- \u201c ling houses uninhabited <em>\u201c </em>house of public worship, or other public <em>\u201c </em>building \u201d and \u201c barn or grist-mill.\u201d No mention is made of a sawmill, or a fulling-mill, or many other mills but simply of a \u201c grist- \u201c mill.\u201d And it is very customary in the countrv for workmen to sleep in establishments for dressing cloth, &amp;c , and yet setting them on fire is only a misdemeanor at common law. A woollen or cotton factory is equally unprotected. It is neither an \u201c inhabited dwel- \u201c ling house,\u201d nor \u201c a dwelling house uninhabited.\u201d And is therefore, not within the statute making the burning of it arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Arson was always a felony at common law. It was, however, made treason by the 8 Hen. 6. C. 6; but this statute was soon after repeal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ed, and arson became felony again by I Ed. 6. C 12., and by the statute, 9 Geo, 1. C. 22. Clergy is taken away from principals and accessaries in almost every case. .</p>\n<p id=\"AWH2\">The statute of this State makes a material and important distinction be- \u2018 tween the punishment of arson of an 11 inhabited dwelling house,\u201d and an \u201c uninhabited one.\u201d The punishment for the first crime is death. But arson of uninhabited dwelling house, is subject to imprisonment for years not exceg fourteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">What a burning.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">It is necessary there should be an actual burning of the house, but it is Unnecessary any part of it should be entirely consumed, or even that the fire should have any continuance, but be put out, or go out of itself. 3 Inst. 66. 1 Hale, 568. 1 Hawk. ch. 39. 4. Black. Comm. 222. \u201c House burning, which is felony at common law, must be a mali- \u201c cious, voluntary, and actual burning; not putting fire only into a \u201c house or any part of it without burning; but if part of the house is \u201cburned, or if the fire doth burn, and then goeth out of itself, it is \u201c felony. The words are <em>i%cend.it et combussit; </em>but. if he had burned \u201cpart of the house, and the fire is quenched, or goes out before the \u201c whole house is burned, it is felony.\u201d If fire be thrown into a house in order to consume it, and no part of it is injured, the offence is no felony.
