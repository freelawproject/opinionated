The state of this case was as follows : the prisoner came to Boggs and Thompson\u2019s store on the 5th of August, and left them a quantity of fine goods for sale, telling them he had bought the goods of a young man whom he named, and had more of the same kind. From circumstances attending the situation of the goods, no regular invoice, or bill of parcels, the marks on some pieces being effaced, &amp;c. the auctioneer was sus- ... , . . picious they were not properly obtained : he communicated his suspicions to Mr. Austin, whom he knew had lost goods of the same description, a short time before. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Austin came to his store, and upon an examination of the <em>1 </em>x goods, identified them as his oxvn. The sale of the goods was to take place the same afternoon, at which sale the <em>PT^soaeL' </em>was to attend. Mr. Austin placed his brother in store to intercept him when he came to attend the sale, which was effected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\">The prisoner was arrested and brought to the police . office : he said the goods had been left at his house by one Stephens, who it seems by the examination of the prisoner, had left the city, and had given him a letter of instructions how to sell them. In questions put to the prisoner how he came to take goods to sell under the particular circumstances of these, not having the regular invoice, and bill of parcels, the usual marks, &amp;c. he replied, Mr. Stephen\u2019s told him they were smuggled by him; and upon being asked if he took a New York paper, and if he was not informed of the robbery of Haggerty and Austin\u2019s store, replied in the affirmative. The goods, which consisted of fine cambrics and silk hose, &amp;c. were crammed in a trunk without any order, and notin the usual method observed among merchants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-8\">After being arrested and taken to the police-office, he went to the City Hotel, and other places, to find the person from -whom he obtained the goods, but without effect. However, the same evening he was arrested at the prisoner\u2019s house,-and by his direction. It proved to be William Robertson, who was subsequently convicted for the of-fence of stealing these and other goods. Robertson was arrested and committed to Bridewell, and the prisoner bailed. Before this, however, the prisoner, in company with Mr. Austin and an officer, went up to his house, and a search was made for the remainder of the property, which was found in the garret, in a trunk, except a few pieces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>in the store, and a few pieces sold to the .neighboring storekeepersthese were all identified and proved by Austin, to be the same property taken from his store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">Robertson was produced as a witness by the proseentor, and refused to answer any questions in relation the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">The defendant produced a number of witnesses, who swore that he was aman of the most unexceptionable character, that he had long been known to them ; that he was a watch maker, and had arrived in this country about fifteen years ago from Scotland ; that he had worked at his trade a number of years, but finding it fail, had recourse to k\u00e9eping a small dry good store, and that they always believed him to be an honest, industrious man. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-10\"><em>Price, </em>his counsel,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At_\">submitted the case to the jury without making any observations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-11\"><em>Maxwell, District </em>Attorney,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARH\">said that he had no dispo-</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkqS\">sition to press this case, but that he thought it his duty to make some remarks to the jury; and that afterwards if the jury should think he was not guilty, he should rejoice in .his acquittal ; but if Cochrane was not a guilty man, he was a very imprudent one. About six weeks before the date of this charge, the store of Haggerty and Austin was robbed to a large amount; that robbery and the particulars of it was published in the New York papers, some of which the defendant took ; that he must have known of the robbery, appears almost impossible not to believe. That the manner of receiving the goods was calculated to awaken the suspicion of a prudent man.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-13\">The goods were crammed promiscuously in a trunk without order, or that method supposed to be attended to among dealers in that article; the transaction was a secret one ; at the time he \u00bfreceived the goods, according to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>own story, They were said to be smuggled by Robertson ; he ma]jes no inquiry about Robertson, or how he obtained the goods, he left them in small quantities at different Places) &amp;C.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aai\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Asd\">\u201cThe enormity and prevalence of this \u201c crime is great. It is our duty to punish it whenever and \u201c wherever it can be detected ; for if facilities was not i \u201c given to felony, to vend articles stolen, fewer robbe- \u201c ries would be committed. The case before us is one of \u201c doubt; the prisoner received the goods ; how did he \u201c receive them ? his intent can be made out only from \u201c an impartial view of all the circumstances taken togeth- \u201c er. The intention at the time constitutes the offence. If \u201c you think he received them <em>knowing </em>they were stolen, \u201c he ought to be convicted, otherwise he ought to be ac- \u201c quitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u201c The Court will pass a few circumstances that are im- \u201c portant in this case ; and first, of those circumstances \u201c that make against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u201c 1st. He bought them at a reduced price.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\u201c2d. The amount was large, being from $1500 to \u201c $1700.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\u201c 3d. They w\u00e9're received of a young man he did not \u201c know.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\"><em>\u201c </em>4th. They were thrown in a trunk in a confused and \u201c crowded manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">\u201c 5th. The trunk was found in a room up stairs, and not in his store.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">\u201c Second. There are other circfimstances that operate \u201c in his.favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">\u201c 1st. He goes in the day time to Boggs and Thomp- \u201c son\u2019s store, which is but a few doors from Haggerty and <em>\u201c </em>Austin\u2019s store.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201c 2d. He tells Mr. Thompson he had more of the same \u201c kind of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u201c 3d. He told Mr. Thompson he would be present at \u201c the Sal6, '</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u201c 4th. The original marks, with a few exceptions, were \u201c allowed to remain on the goods ; and after being ar- \u201c rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\u201c 5th. Goes to the City Hotel after the thief.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">\u201c 6th. Robertson, the real thief, upon being brought \u201c into Court, refused to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">\u201c Prom a fair view and comparison of these facts, it re- <em>\u201c </em>mains for the jury to say whether Cochrane is guilty of <em>u </em>receiving these goods, knowing they were stolen, or \u201c not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The jury retired, and returned in Court with a verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Note.\u2014In Bract. I. Edw. III. it is said, that anciently attempts upon the life of another were adjudged felony : the <em>will, </em>it was said, was taken for the <em>fact. </em>But now the law is altered. It does not punish unless the <em>intent </em>is carried into execution, except in cases of treason, where the intendment, if satisfactorily proved by circumstances, may be, and is punished without the intent being executed. 3 Inst. 108. The <em>intention, </em>however, is yet the principal ingredient of crime. The intention of force and violence makes riots criminal. 3 Inst.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">If a man entering a tavern commits a trespass, the law will adjudge that he \u25a0 originally intended it. 8 Rep.

Plow. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">In Hagerman\u2019s case, City Hail Rec. vol. 3. p. 73. it was held that the intent to kill is presumed from the means used which were calculated to produce death.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">\u25a0 And in James Gordon\u2019s case, City Hall Rec. it was decided that the intent to ravish might be presumed from acts indicative of that intention.
