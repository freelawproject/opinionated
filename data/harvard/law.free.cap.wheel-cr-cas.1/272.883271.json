The prisoner has told but one story\u2014has never appeared to be alarmed\u2014has never, so far as appears by the evidence, attempted to conceal any thing\u2014 made no attempts to escape. It was possible the deceased \u2022 . might have been murdered before the prisoner returned in might have been done in the night by one of the women in the house. In all these cases, however improbable they may be, room is afforded for doubt; .that circumstantial evidence ha\u2019d the same operation in capital cases as those of an inferior grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">The Jury returned a verdict of not guilty, in favor of the prisoner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
