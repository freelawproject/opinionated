M\u2019Euen and Graham, his counsel, plead not guilty. The facts, as detailed by the appeared to be as follows: about the close of the last term, information was obtained at the police-office, that <em>Ward's Island, </em>in the East River, above the city, had become a retreat for felon, who made it a repository for the, plunder they obtained, in the city and elsewhere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-22\">To ascertain the fact, and stop the progress of the evil, two of the police magistrates, the high constable, and seven or eight officers of the police, went up to the place : they found that the party they were in pursuit of were absent from the island. They found a very large mastiff dog placed at the corner of the house as a sentinel, to warn the inmates of the approach of danger. He threatened to be troublesome, and was secured; after taking proper measures, and placing themselves in proper positions, in and about the house, they waited the return of the party ; presently the saw approaching the shore, three men and one woman ; and as soon as they landed, the woman immediately walked up to the house, and whistled for the dog; but notwithstanding no answer was received, she passed along up' to the house, until she walked inside the door, where she was secured by the officers; the men were .severally arrested as they came into the door, secured in irons, conveyed to the city, and committed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Bridewell. Among the number, was Charles Gardner, the prisoner at the bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A79\">The complaint however, of the present indictment, was ^or a felony of a different descriptionimmediately on the of Gardner, he was observed to throw his hand gently upon the ceiling of the window, and upon raising it a pocket book was observed laying upon the place he had reached his \u00bfhand. The pocket book was immediately taken possession of by the officers, and it was found to contain the two counterfeit notes in question. It also contained the terms, abbreviations and initials known to be in use among counterfeiters. On searching the house, two tin boxes were found hidden under the floors, and weather-boarding, corresponding in amount and date, &amp;c. to those found in the pocket book of the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">These facts were hiade out by the witnesses, who were examined on the part of the people. The case was summed up by Messrs. Graham and M\u2019Euen for the prisoner, in which they contended that although their client had been found \u201cin a den of. thieves,\u201d and had also been found' in possession of counterfeit money, yet no evidence had yet been offered that he ever intended to pass it ; he had offered it tono one ; no one could say that he directly or indirectly attempted to put off his paper upon them: he might have received it from others, for a valuable consideration, not knowing it was bad ; every person is liable to receive false money, and spurious paper ; we often do receive it; very few men in the community but at-some time or other receive it; yet no man thinks of indicting them, &amp;.c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\">Maxwell, <em>District </em>Attorney,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEi\">replied : after commenting generally upon the case, observed, that this was not a case of a man receiving counterfeit money in the ordinary trails-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>actions of business, where he is often to be pitied, but not to be punished; but this was a case, where a young man without any visible means of support, chooses to connect himself with a gang of thieves and notorious counterfeiters; pursuing no employment but the commission crimes ; found in the actual possession of counterfeit money, and stolen goods to a large amount, giving no account how he came by them ; offering no proof of character\u2014such was this case. And he would venture to say, 'that in this and every similar one, it would be the duty of the jury to convict, and the court to severely punish.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-5\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AQf\">Recorder recapitulated the principal facts to the jury, and concluded by observing that \u201c all the witness agreed in every fac tthey had deposed <em>\u201c </em>to. The circumstances of the prisoner\u2019s laying his pock-<em>l' </em>et-book in the window was positively sworn toby three \u201c officers, that the pocket-book contained the notes describ- \u201c ed in the indictment; that the entries made of the purchase of counterfeit money in the pocket-book, was the \u201clanguageknown to be used among the venders and buy- \u201c ers of spurious notes ; that the bills found in the pocket- \u201c book corresponded to those found) in the accesses of the \u201c house ; exhibiting an extensive concern, carried on by the \u201c prisoner and others : that the prisoner had not shown that \u201che was a man of good character, as he ought to have \u201c done, if it was in his power; and that the fact of the pos- \u201c session of large quantities of spurious notes was posi- \u201c tively sworn to by respectable witnesses ; his intention to <em>\u201c </em>pass it is to be made out to the satisfaction of the jury. \u201c From all the circumstance of the case/- it remained for \u201cthe jury to say whether he had this money in his pos- <em>\u201c </em>session with intention to pass it or not; if they had a \u201c reasonable doubt, that doubt ought to operate in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u00ab of the prisoner; if on the contrary, they were convinced \u201c of his guilt, they would pronounce him so.\u201d The jury found him guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
