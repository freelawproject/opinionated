John Ireland was called, who testified that he had married the prisoner to Mary Boyd, in A <em>j j j j' i </em>in the presence of a number of people, in his parlour ; and that he believed the prisoner at the bar to be the same man he married to Mary Boyd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-19\">He was asked by Dr. <em>Graham, </em>counsel for the prisoner, if he was not certain : he replied in the negative, and observed that witnesses in this, and other courts, had sworn to identity of person, and afterwards had , , . \u25a0 ' , , ' themselves mistaken : and refused to swear positive that the prisoner was the man he married.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Dr. <em>Graham </em>objected to such indefinite and loose testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-12\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeP\">replied that the marriage in fact, intended by Ld. Mansfield, was nothing more than positive or satisfactory proof of the marriage, made out in the usual way, .and as contradistinguished from proof of hearsay and reputation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-9\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Adh\">\u201cWe think the testimony of Dr. Ire- \u201c land sufficiently explicit and positive. He is conscien- \u201c tious against swearing positive, and chooses this mode, \u201c as in his opinion the most safe and prudent : he has \u201c no doubt.that he is the man : he believes him to be the \u201c man, &amp;c. ; but will not swear positively that he is, for \u201c the reason he has given. And that in the opinion of the \u201c Court, is equivalent to saying he is the same person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The Rev. Merrit Haviland South proved he married the prisoner to Miss Harriet Ann Eliza Robertson, on the 14th day of September, 1822, in the City of New York, in the presence of her mother, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Dr. Graham, for the prisoner, rested his defence on a principle of law. He contended that a marriage in fact must be proved, and could not be implied, and which had not been done in the case now before the court. In support of his position he cited 4 Burr, 2057-8-9, decided by Ld. Mansfield, and also 7th Johnson, p. 315, which he contended went to show that a marriage in fact must be proved upon the trial, or in other words, cohabitation must be shown. The Doctor went into an argument of considerable length and great ability, to show that a marriage in fact must be proved, in which he took an extensive view of the civile and canon law in respect to this crime.</p>\n<author id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A6qe\">\u201cThe evidence against the prisoner is \u201c strong and conclusive. The testimony of Dr. Ireland is <em>\u201c of </em>such a nature as to leave no doubt in the mind of any \u201creasonable man. The testimony of Rev. Mr. Smith is \u201c still more explicit. The counsel for the prisoner has \u201c taken the only ground that he could take, and yet that \u201cfails him. The offence is a gross violation of moral \u201c decency, and has, in most countries, been severely pun- \u201c ished. In this country it has been made highly penal \u201c by statute. And it is proper it should be so : for Yew \u201c crimes can have a more fatal tendency, either as to pub- \u201c lie example or private suffering. In the case now before <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>the Court, two innocent females have been ruined by \u201c the crimes of the prisoner. If you believe the testimony \u201c the prisoner is certainly guilty ; if not, you will acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The jury found the prisoner guilty, and he was sentenced to five years\u2019 servitude in the State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Note.\u2014Bigamy has been defined to be \u201chaving a plurality of wives at the same time,\u201d Blac. Com. p. 163. It was made felony without benefit of clergy by Stat. 4 Edw. 1 C. 5. and again brought within clergy by the \u00bf Edw. 1 C. 12 \u00a7 16 : and by 1 Jac. 1. C. 11. there are five exceptions in this act, making the marriage no felony, one of the parties being alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">1. Where one of the parties.has been out of the kingdom for the space of five years, either with or without notice of the other party being alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">2. Where either of the parties have'absented themselves from the other 7 years, within the kingdom, and no knowledge of the party being alive within the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">3. Where there is a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">4. Where the first marriage is declared void, and the parties loosed <em>a vinculo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>5. Where .either party was under the age of consent, and! subsequent ratification of the marriage, 3 Inst. 89. Kel. 27. Hale P ' C. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Our Statute relating*to and defining this crime is found 1 Vol. Rev. Laws,, p. 113. The Statute makes it felony for any person being married or who shall hereafter marry, to at the same time marry any person or persons, their former husband or wife being alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The exceptions in this act are nearly similar to the English Statute. They are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">1. Where one of the parties shall be continually remaining out of the United States for the space of 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">2. Where one of the parties has absented himself or herself from the other, the one not knowing the other to be living within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">3. Where the parties are divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">4. Where the former marriage is declared void and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">5. Where the marriage is had, orto be had, or made within the age of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">Under this statute the following cases, among others, have been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-19\">Vide Teunis Van Pelt\u2019s case, City Hall Rec. vol. 1. p. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">In*a prosecution of a woman for bigamy, evidence of barbarous treatment by the first husband, before the marriage with the second took place\u2019 is inadmissible, but will be received by the court in mitigation of her punishment, Ibid vol. 1. p. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-22\">To Elizabeth Steer\u2019s case, City Hall Rec. vol. 2. p. 111. there is this Syllabus. On a traverse of an indictment for bigamy against S. for that on the 16th of March, 1815, she married, I. S. being alive, &amp;c., contrary to the form of the statute, &amp;c. It appeared by the testimony of K., a divine, that on the day first above mentioned, he married a woman of the name of S. to I. S., but that he, K., did not know that S. the prisoner, was the same person he so married; it was held that although this was sufficient evidence of a marriage defacto, of the person of the name of S., and therefore, that collateral evidence to identify such person, might be given, yet that the prosecutor should be precluded from establishing the second marriage, by cohabitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>or otherwise, without first proving that S. the prisoner, was the identical person so married by K.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The statute of bigamy does not render a second marriage legal, notwithstanding the former husband or wife may have been absent about S.years, and not heard of. It merely purges the felony, Fenton v. Reed, 4 Johns. Rep. 42. In- all cases except bigamy and criminal conversation, a marriage may be proved from cohabitation, reputation, acknowledgment of parties, reception in the family, and other circumstances. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">In a prosecution for bigamy, as well as actions for <em>crim. con. </em>the mere confession of the party is not sufficient evidence of the first marriage. A marriage in fact must be proved. The People vs. Humphrey.-, Johns. Rep. 314. *</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
