Mrs. Parker replied to her, \u201c it makes no difference, you can stop as you pass, and leave it.\u201d She, however, did not call; and a few days after Mrs. Parker went after her to obtain payment.\u2014 She had told Mrs. Parker, when she purchased the paint, that she lived at the house of Mr. Hays. She went- to his house and found she did not live there, but after-wards found out where she did live, and demanded payment of the article ; the defendant put her off from time to time, until Mrs. Parker threatened her with a suit.\u2014 On Friday afternoon she went again to her house, and demanded payment. The defendant was up stairs paint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ing one of the rooms, and as Mrs. Parker was returning from the house, passing the steps of the door, a of paint was dripped from a brush out of the second story wipdow upon her; which effectually destroyed her silk dress. Mrs. Parker testified that it could be no other son but Jane, for there was no other person in the room. *\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJ\">Sprinkling paint upon a from *e se\u00b0ond house is an as- and bat~</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-10\"><em>Price, </em>counsel for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahk\">called Elizabeth lass; who swore that she was in the room at the time,and that Jane M\u2019Murray did not throw the paint upon Mrs. Parker. Upon her being asked by <em>Maxwell,District Attorney, </em>who did throw it, replied she could not answer for fear of criminating herself; intimating that she was the person who threw it and not the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The Court told the jury \u201c that it was for them to decide \u201c upon the contradictory testimony of the prosecutor, and \u201c the witness for the prisoner; if they believed that each of \u201c them was entitled to the same degree of confidence, in \u201c point of veracity, yet the situation they stood in before \u201c the Court deserved their attention <em>; </em>the law has allowed \u201c a prosecutor to be a witness, but it would be supposing an \u201cimpossibility, to suppose they did not view their case with \u201c partiality, and that less credit ought to be given to the \u201ctestimony of a prosecutor, than to a disinterested witness, \u201cwho comes before the Court not impassioned by previous <em>\u201c </em>circumstances, and nothing to hope or fear from the re- \u201c suit of the prosecution.\u201d On some\u2019 of the jury\u2019s expressing a doubt whether the charge amounted to an assault' and battery or not, the Court said the offence, if proved, clearly amounted to an assault \" and battery. The jury found the defendent not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">Note.\u2014There can be no doubt of the legality of this decision. When the true situation of the prosecutor and the culprit are considered, we would find it impossible to bring ourjnind to believe that he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>be altogether indifferent to the issue of the case he prosecutes. There arre a thousand little circumstances that are calculated to raise his passion above the level of an honest indifference for the termination of a trial to which he himself has, in feeling become a party. Hence the bias he must almost infallibly receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">A great lawyer, speaking of prosecutors, has said, <em>\" </em>1 have found then^ \u201cin the course of my experience, generally very anxious to obtain a \u201c conviction of the unfortunate wretch upon his trial; andl may .with \u201cequal safety, say .that I have seldom found any unwillingness on the \u201c part of witnesses to give evidence. Indeed, I have had occasion \u201c much oftener to rebuke them for their over zeal in the cause of jus- \u201c tice, than to admonish them to give their testimony.\u201d Lord Ellen-borough\u2019s speech in the House of Lords, on the Bill relative to Stealing in Shops, &amp;c. 30th May, 1810.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
