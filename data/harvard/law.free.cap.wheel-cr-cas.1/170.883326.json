He repeated he wanted to see the \u201clady of the house.\u201d She told him that she was the lady of the house, and that no other lady was in the house. He took hold of her in a very impertinent and improper manner. She called her husband, who was in the house, and upon his coming to the door, the defendant commenced abusing them by immodest and indecent language, and intimated that the house was a house of ill-fame, and that he had had an improper meeting with Mrs. Davis, and finally struck Mr. Davis with a walking stick he had in his hand; Mrs. Davis running in between them, he struck her on the side of her head and knocked her down ; she was taken up in a state of insensibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">Process was issued against M\u2019Kinnon, upon which he was arrested, and bailed for his appearance to answer the charge in the sum of $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">It also appeared in evidence, that the cases were to have been heard at a former session of this court, but that an amicable settlement was on foot; and to effect it, a meeting was to have taken place at a Tavern in the Bowery. Mr. Davis attended for that purpose, but M'Kinnon, taking advantage of Mr. Davis\u2019s absence, managed to have one of the cases brought to trial during his absence, and no prosecutor appearing, M\u2019Kinnon was acquitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">The other indictment could not be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-8\">Upon these facts being show to the court, they instantly awarded a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\">The jury found M\u2019Kinnon guilty, without leaving the box.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aao\">rose and moved the Court that the bail entered by the defendant to answer, &amp;c., be, increased.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>Price</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzTJ\">observed that he would consider himself as ing in duty to his client if he forebore to express his sent\u00edments. He observed that he had seldom witnessed a more violent outrage than the one now before the court. It was unprovoked on the part of Mr. Davis and his wife. The consequences had been ruinous to the family. The vile and false aspersions cast upon the character of Mrs, Davis by the defendant, had operated upon the mind of the husband to such a degree as to induce a temporary separation. The outrage was committed at the house of Mr. Davis, and no real or pretended cause assigned for it; and hoped the court would put the defendant under such amount of bail as would insure his attendance to abide the judgment of the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-8\">\n<em>Phoenix</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqtT\">replied that the case had been called on in his absence, during an engagement in the marine court: that important witnesses for the defendant had not been heard: that the defendant would exhibit to the court affidavits that would give a different complexion to the whole case, and would show it nothing more than a common assault and battery.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-14\">An approved precedent, carefully copied from the printers forms on file in- the Clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The court observed it was a matter of discretion with them to increase the bail or not, and that they would not do it on slight grounds, but that by the evidence before them, the defendant appeared to have conducted himself in the most violent (not to say indecent) manner; that he bid yet furnished no excuse, or even palliation, and that the court considered it their duty to increase the amount of bail, and intimated to the counsel for the defendant, the necessity of exhibiting to the court affidavits in mitigation of the punishment. The court ordered the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>be recognized in the sum of $500, and two other sureties jn sum 0f $250 each, and that he stand committed until the order of the court be complied with.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
