She swore she saw a Mr. Cadwell pay to the prisoner\u2019s wife, for rent, the two $3 notes complained of. She was certain they were the same notes set forth in the <em>indictment.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-13\">\n<em>Maxwell, District Attorney,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfL\">observed that he had no disposition to press the case: it had become doubtful by the testimony of Eliza Collins, who, if she told the truth, certainly made out a satisfactory explanation to this charge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-14\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ATM\">\u201cGentlemen of the jury, if you believe \u201c the facts sworn to by the witness, you must acquit the \u00ab prisoner. He has explained how he got possession of the \u201c notes charged upon him: although the testimony is sus- \u201c picious, yet we cannot make out the prisoner\u2019s guilt, <em>\u201c </em>without positive and <em>satisfactory </em>proof, which appears \u201c to be wanting in this case. The witness says, that she <em>\u201c </em>saw O\u2019Bryan\u2019s wife receive the money, in his absence, \u201c and there has nothing yet appeared to show she has not \u201c sworn the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-17\">The jury found the prisqner not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
