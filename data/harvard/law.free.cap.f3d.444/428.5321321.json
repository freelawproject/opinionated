The court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the court and a majority of the judges who are in regular active service and who are not disqualified not having voted in favor (Fed.R. App. P. and 5th Cir. R. 35), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b453-5\">PATRICK E. HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<judges id=\"AR-\">joined by KING, DAVIS, WIENER, BENAVIDES, STEWART and DENNIS, Circuit Judges,</judges>\n<p id=\"AOz\">dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s refusal to consider en banc the important issues in this case. The panel majority rejects strict scrutiny on the basis that these \u201cnonimmigrant aliens,\u201d whatever that means, are not as \u201cdiscrete and insular\u201d as the \u201cpermanent resident aliens\u201d afforded suspect classification by the Supreme Court. It reaches that result by judicially crafting a subset of aliens, scaled by how it perceives the aliens\u2019 proximity to citizenship. This is a bold step not sanctioned by Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">For decades, many have argued that it is the classification of aliens as an insular minority that is suspect. The criticism comes in two forms. To some, the unique federal interest in regulating aliens offers a superior rationale for strict scrutiny than the aliens\u2019 insular status. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cthe responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal government.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">To others, the insular status of aliens exists only as a consequence of valid federal law, making strict scrutiny of alienage classifications never appropriate. This contention strikes twice. First, it contends that the alien\u2019s limited political role cannot support their treatment as an insular minority. This, because the very admission of the alien is by legislation that defines his role in the political community, subject only to constitutional constraints upon the exercise of that federal power. Second and relatedly, given the supreme federal regulatory power over matters of immigration, the status of persons admitted in conformity with federal law is by definition not immutable. To the point, this criticism is leveled at the claimed insular minority status of <em>all </em>aliens lawfully in the country. It draws no distinction between a particular alien\u2019s connection to citizenship or subsets of lawfully admitted persons. Rather, it rejects strict scrutiny without regard to the aliens\u2019 proximity to citizenship, the relevant factor for discrete and insular minority status under <em>Carolene Products.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Resting strict scrutiny on the insular minority status of legally admitted aliens has its weaknesses. But none support the panel opinion and, in any event, each has been rejected by the Supreme Court. As for the trumping constitutional power of the federal government in controlling the nation\u2019s borders, including matters of immigration and naturalization, an allocation that the Supreme Court has pointed to as itself demanding strict scrutiny of state regulations of persons whose presence in the country is lawful under federal law, the panel majority is silent \u2014 a silence made the more puzzling by its rationale that this \u201ccategory\u201d of alien has such a limited tenure in the United States under the conditions of federal law admitting them that their state regulation should not be subjected to strict scrutiny. This is exactly backwards. As the federal constraints are increased, the regulatory field for states is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>decreased.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the federal judiciary draws distinctions between different classes of aliens, applying strict scrutiny to some and rational-basis review to others, it shifts responsibility over aliens from the Congress to the States. This is perverse. The panel majority relaxes scrutiny of state regulation of aliens as the federal regulation of them is increased. This is too ambitious for me.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">. <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 81, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976); <em>Toll v.

For the reasons more fully detailed in my dissenting opinion from the panel majority\u2019s holding,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I reject the panel majority\u2019s creation of a new classification of \u201cnonimmigrant aliens,\u201d a distinction the Supreme Court has never drawn when discussing the alien suspect class, and its application of rational basis review to laws targeting this class. The matter at issue is clearly enbancworthy because of the far reaching consequences of the panel\u2019s holding. I continue to maintain that the plaintiffs in this case, who are lawfully admitted aliens residing in the United States, are part of the alien suspect class and that, therefore, laws that discriminate against them are inherently suspect and should be subjected to strict scrutiny. ' Accordingly, I dissent from the full court\u2019s failure to vacate the panel opinion and hear the case anew. Moreover, I fully concur in the persuasive opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing en bane penned by Judge Higginbotham.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-19\">. <em>LeClerc v.
