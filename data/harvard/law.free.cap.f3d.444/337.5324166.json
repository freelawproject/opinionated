Murillo-Lopez appeals his sentence, including a sixteen-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement, on the following grounds: (1) the sentence-enhancement provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional, (2) the district court erroneously sentenced him under the mandatory sentencing guidelines regime found unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and (3) the district court erroneously concluded that Murillo-Lopez\u2019s 2003 burglary conviction under Calif. Penal Code \u00a7 459 constitutes \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d a specifically enumerated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under section 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. For the reasons that follow, we vacate Murillo-Lopez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-20\">Murillo-Lopez concedes that his constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Torres v. United States</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and raises the issue here solely to preserve it for Supreme Court review. But Murillo-Lopez correctly asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines regime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Murillo-Lopez preserved this error in the district court, and the Government has not met its arduous burden of establishing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we vacate Murillo-Lopez\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In the interest of judicial efficiency and to provide guidance on remand,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we now consider whether Murillo-Lopez\u2019s pri- or burglary conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under section 2L1.2 of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The application notes to section 2L1.2 state that an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d if (1) it has the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another as an element of the offense, or (2) it qualifies as one of several specifically enumerated offenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Government contends only that Murillo-Lopez\u2019s burglary conviction constitutes a specifically enumerated offense, namely \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d; therefore, we do not consider whether physical force is an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In determining whether a prior offense is equivalent to an enumerated offense that is not defined in the Guidelines, like \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d we have said that \u201cwe must define [the enumerated offense] according to its \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019 and should rely on a uniform definition, regardless of the \u2018labels employed by the various States\u2019 criminal codes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have also said that we must apply a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes an enumerated offense as that offense \u201cis understood in its \u2018ordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u2019 meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the statute of conviction is overly broad, we may also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>examine certain adjudicative records to determine whether the prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThese records are generally limited to the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHX\">The Government concedes that the California burglary statute under which Murillo-Lopez was convicted includes offenses other than those that categorically qualify as \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d because the statute encompasses both dwellings and non-dwellings. But the Government contends that the criminal complaint to which Murillo-Lopez pleaded guilty establishes that he was in fact convicted of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d Although neither the judgment of conviction nor the charging document is part of the record, Murillo-Lopez concedes that he pleaded guilty to a criminal complaint charging him with \u201ca violation of [California] Penal Code section 459, a felony, in that on or about June 1, 2003, in the County of Riverside, State of California, he did wilfully and unlawfully enter a certain building, to wit, <em>an inhabited dwelling house, ... </em>with intent to commit theft and a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Section 459 of the California Penal Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">Every person who enters any house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse or other building, tent, vessel, as defined in Section 21 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, floating home, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 18075.55 of the Health and Safety Code, railroad car, locked or sealed cargo container, whether or not mounted on a vehicle, trailer coach, as defined in Section 635 of the Vehicle Code, any house car, as defined in Section 362 of the Vehicle Code, inhabited camper, as defined in Section 243 of the Vehicle Code, vehicle as defined by the Vehicle Code, when the doors are locked, aircraft as defined by Section 21012 of the Public Utilities Code, or mine or any underground portion thereof, with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary. As used in this chapter, <em>\u201cinhabited\u201d means currently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not. </em>A house, trailer, vessel designed for habitation, or portion of a building is currently being used for dwelling purposes if, at the time of the burglary, it was not occupied solely because a natural or other disaster caused the occupants to leave the premises.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Section 460 of the California Penal Code further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">(a) Every burglary of <em>an inhabited dwelling house, </em>vessel, as defined in the Harbors and Navigation Code, which is inhabited and designed for habitation, floating home, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 18075.55 of the Health and Safety Code, or trailer coach, as defined by the Vehicle Code, or the inhabited portion of any other building, is burglary of the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">(b) All other kinds of burglary are of the second degree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Murillo-Lopez does not dispute that he pleaded guilty to burglary of a \u201cbuilding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>to wit, an inhabited dwelling house,\u201d and he does not argue that the district court improperly considered the criminal complaint in determining whether his burglary conviction constituted a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d But he argues that even the crime charged in the criminal complaint is too broad to qualify as \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d because California courts construe the terms \u201cbuilding\u201d and \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d to include structures such' as tents<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and vessels used for human habitation<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and such structures do not fall within the scope of \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d as defined by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In <em>Taylor</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court construed the term \u201cburglary\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which is a sentencing enhancement enacted as part of the Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986. The Supreme Court concluded that the definition of \u201cburglary\u201d should not be derived from the common-law, which limited the offense to \u201c \u2018breaking and entering the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because \u201cthe contemporary understanding of \u2018burglary\u2019 has diverged a long way from its common-law roots.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, Congress intended a broader definition of the term. The Court also concluded that application of the enhancement should not depend on whether a crime is specifically denominated \u201cburglary\u201d under state law because of the variations, and overbreadth, in the scope of many state burglary statutes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, the Court said, \u201cCongress meant by \u2018burglary\u2019 the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but it \u201cmust have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various States\u2019 criminal codes.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Court thus determined that \u201cthe generic, contemporary meaning of burglary contains at least the following elements: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">As examples of state statutes that are overly broad, and thus not categorically subject to a section 924(e) enhancement, the Supreme Court mentioned statutes that include places \u201cother than buildings,\u201d such as automobiles, vending machines, booths, tents, boats, vessels, and railroad cars.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Court also noted the over-breadth of California\u2019s burglary statute, which includes such acts as \u201cshoplifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and theft of goods from a \u2018locked\u2019 but unoccupied automobile.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But the Court said that a conviction under an overly broad statute could nonetheless result in an enhancement if the charging documents and certain other conclusive adjudicative records establish that the defendant was convicted of generic burglary.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">It is from the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of overly broad burglary statutes that Murillo-Lopez derives his argument that \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d is but a narrow subset of \u201cburglary\u201d that cannot extend to places or structures excluded from the definition of generic burglary, like the tents and vessels included in the California definition of \u201cinhabited dwelling house.\u201d The Government counters that we must give effect to the ordinary meaning of \u201cdwelling\u201d as a place of habitation without limiting the types of structures that can constitute dwellings. Alternatively, the Government contends that use of any structure as a habitation makes it equivalent to a building or home within <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>generic definition of burglary.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">This court applies <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>categorical approach in determining whether a prior state conviction falls within the scope of the Sentencing Guidelines, but this does not mean that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cburglary\u201d automatically applies whenever the term \u201cburglary\u201d is used in the Guidelines. Although the uniformity concerns identified in <em>Taylor </em>are equally applicable to the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>Taylor </em>interprets a federal statute, does not purport to define \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d and does not purport to govern the Guidelines. Although we have not yet considered the precise argument presented in this case, we have considered whether prior convictions constituted \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under the Guidelines and have not relied on, or even cited, <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In each of those cases, we concluded that a conviction for \u201cburglary of a habitation\u201d under the Texas Penal Code constitutes a crime of violence even though the statutory definition of \u201chabitation\u201d includes \u201cvehicle[s] ... adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Other circuits have not applied <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cburglary\u201d to the term \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as used in the Guidelines, although those courts have not explicitly considered the issue presented here. In <em>United States v. Graham, </em>the Eighth Circuit concluded that a prior conviction for burglaries of unspecified \u201cstructures\u201d used as \u201cweekend fishing retreats\u201d was equivalent to \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d within the meaning of section 4B1.1 of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The court did not cite <em>Tay</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>lor </em>and instead relied on Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which defined \u201cdwelling\u201d as \u201c \u2018a building or portion thereof, a tent, a mobile home, a vehicle or other enclosed space which is used or intended for use as a human habitation, home or residence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>United States v. McClenton, </em>the Third Circuit concluded that burglary of a hotel guest room constitutes \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under section 4B1.2\u2019s \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provision.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Burglary of a hotel guest room would no doubt qualify as generic burglary under <em>Taylor </em>but the court did not rely on Taylofs definition. The court did cite <em>TayloT </em>s categorical approach for determining whether the prior conviction qualified as an enumerated \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> but primarily relied on <em>Graham </em>and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary for the appropriate definition of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The court noted that \u201c[a]t common law, burglary was considered to be an offense against habitation rather than against property. The peace of mind and security of the residents was sought to be protected, rather than the property.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>United States v. Wenner, </em>the Ninth Circuit considered whether a defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions under Washington law were equivalent to \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under section 4B1.2\u2019s \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provision.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The defendant made the same argument Murillo-Lopez raises here \u2014 that \u201c \u2018burglary of a dwelling\u2019 under the Guidelines must be a \u2018burglary\u2019 under <em>Taylor (i.e., </em>it must involve entry into a building), and the burglary must be of a \u2018dwelling\u2019 under federal law (which might differ from Washington\u2019s definition of a \u2018dwelling\u2019).\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The court agreed and concluded that the Washington burglary convictions were not crimes of violence because \u201c[s]ome things that are dwellings under Washington law <em>(e.g., </em>fenced areas, railway cars, and cargo containers) are not buildings or structures under federal law, and so cannot support a conviction for generic \u2018burglary\u2019 under <em>Taylor.'</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court stated that \u201cthe most logical and sensible reading of the Guidelines and the reading that is consistent with our cases is to construe \u2018burglary of a dwelling\u2019 as the <em>Taylor </em>definition of burglary, with the narrowing qualification that the burglary occur in a dwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">However, in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>the Ninth Circuit, citing <em>Wenner, </em>concluded that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>prior conviction under sections 459 and 460 of the California Penal Code constituted \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under section 2L1.2 of the Guidelines because the defendant pleaded \u201cguilty to \u2018willfully and <em>unlawfully </em>entering] a building with intent to commit theft\u2019 where the building was an \u2018inhabited dwelling house [or other residential building] ... within the meaning of Penal Code section 460.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The crime charged in <em>Rodriguez </em>is similar to the crime to which Murillo-Lopez pleaded guilty, although it does not appear that the <em>Rodriguez </em>court considered the type of structures included within the term \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d under California law. In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>which predates <em>Wenner, </em>the court concluded the defendant was properly assessed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under section 4B1.2 because he \u201cpleaded <em>nolo centendere </em>to charges that he \u2018did willfully and unlawfully enter the residence, and building occupied by [the victim], with the intent to commit larceny.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The court indicated that the reference to \u201cresidence\u201d was sufficient to constitute \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The Model Penal Code, which the Supreme Court considered in crafting the definition of burglary for purposes of the sentencing enhancement in section 924(e), does not include a separate offense called \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d Article 221.1 of the Model Penal Code, entitled \u201cBurglary,\u201d generally tracks Tayloris generic definition of \u201cburglary\u201d but enhances the degree of the crime \u201cif it is perpetrated in the dwelling of another at night.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> \u201cDwelling\u201d is not defined in this article or in the explanatory notes, but its inclusion as an enhancing factor suggests that \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d is a subset of generic burglary. Still, the Model Penal Code does not discuss the types of structures that would fall within the scope of the burglary provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Similarly, LaFave\u2019s treatise on substantive criminal law, which includes an in-depth examination of common-law burglary, also does not specifically address whether under the common law the term \u201cdwelling\u201d applied to non-affixed structures used for habitation, but it does note that \u201ccommon-law burglary found its theoretical basis in the protection of man\u2019s right of habitation\u201d and says</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">[t]he original term used in defining burglary was \u201cmansion house,\u201d but from its introduction the term was understood to include all dwellings, regardless of their size or worth. Because the basis of the crime was invasion of the right of habitation, the structure need only be a dwelling, that is, a place of human habitation, and occupancy rather than ownership was determinative.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Applying a common sense approach and the ordinary, contemporary and common meaning of the word \u201cdwelling,\u201d we conclude that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition of generic burglary, although instructive, does not strictly apply to the specific offense \u201cbur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>glary of a dwelling\u201d as used in the Guidelines. Instead, \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d includes the elements of generic burglary as stated in <em>Taylor </em>but it also includes, at a minimum, tents or vessels used for human habitation. Because Murillo-Lopez\u2019s California burglary conviction as described in the criminal complaint is equivalent to \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d the district court may consider section 2L1.2\u2019s \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement when sentencing Murillo-Lopez on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\">. 523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>see also United States v.
