HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">The State of Texas asks us to reconsider our grant of habeas relief to Carl L. Brooks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, the petition for rehearing by the panel is denied. The court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the court and a majority of the judges who are in regular active service and not disqualified not having voted in favor (Fed. R.App. P. and 5th Cir. R. 35), Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">The state presents two issues meriting discussion. First, the state contends that this Court, in granting Brooks habeas relief, relied upon a legal theory that is not \u201cclearly established\u201d by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the state contends that this Court, in violation of <em>Teague v. Lane,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>announced a new constitutional rule requiring the mandatory exclusion of certain venire members. We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-21\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b353-22\">While the panel opinion did not recite the now-rote hurdles to relief mandated by AEDPA, it cannot be said that the opinion failed to scrupulously adhere to the deferential standard of review imposed on inferior federal courts considering claims for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We maintain that the doctrine of implied bias is \u201cclearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The implied bias doctrine neither starts or ends with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. </em>Phillips.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There, the Court, relying on <em>United States v. Remmer (\u201cRemmer </em>/\u201d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> held that in most cases the remedy for claims of juror bias is a post-event hearing, in which the trial judge can examine the juror and obtain assurances that, despite the event leading to the claim of bias, the person is able to continue serving as an impartial juror.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Justice O\u2019Connor, concurring in the judgment, wrote separately to emphasize that, in some circumstances, a juror\u2019s assurances could not suffice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">Some examples might include revelation that the juror is an actual employee of the prosecuting agency, that the juror is a close relative of one of the participants in the trial or the criminal transaction, or that the juror was a witness or somehow involved in the criminal transaction. Whether or not the state proceedings result in a finding of \u201cno bias,\u201d the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury should not allow a verdict to stand under such circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Following the law in the Fifth Circuit,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we stated in the panel opinion that \u201c[o]ur question is whether Garcia\u2019s conduct is of the genre of cases Justice O\u2019Connor pointed to in her concurring opinion in <em>Phillips: </em>juror conduct not salvageable by post event hearings.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We answered that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Nothing in <em>Smith </em>rejects the doctrine of implied bias, as illustrated by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion, and the full history of <em>Remmer </em>bears this out. <em>Rem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>mer I </em>involved only the defendant\u2019s bare accusations of improper juror contact. Recognizing the seriousness of the charges, if true, the Supreme Court remanded for an evidentiary hearing \u2014 the \u201chearing\u201d remedy appropriated by <em>Smith </em>\u2014 to put of record \u201cwhat actually transpired [and] whether the incidents that may have occurred were harmful or harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nothing in <em>Remmer I </em>rejects the notion that sometimes courts must refuse to accept a juror\u2019s assurances of impartiality; it was only the posture of <em>Remmer I, </em>with the undeveloped record, that prevented the Court from deciding that question on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Following remand and an evidentiary hearing, the lower courts concluded the incident was harmless,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court granted certiorari a second time. It was then, in <em>Remmer II, </em>that the Court found, now with full understanding of the incident, that the evidence \u201creveals such a state of facts that neither [the juror] <em>nor anyone else </em>could say that he was not affected in his freedom of action as a juror.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There, a juror in a tax evasion case was offered a bribe in return for a favorable defense verdict. The juror reported the matter to the trial judge, who first disregarded it as a joke but later informed the FBI. An FBI agent interviewed the juror, but to the juror, it was not clear whether the government was contemplating prosecuting the juror for his role. The juror later testified that during the course of the trial, he was \u201cunder a terrific pressure.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On these facts, the Court quickly concluded no person could serve as an impartial juror. The phrase \u201cnor anyone else\u201d is critical here; <em>Remmer II </em>illustrates that there are certain factual circumstances, as illuminated by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Smith, </em>in which no reasonable person could not be affected in his actions as a juror and in which the Constitution refuses to accept any assurances to the contrary.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>short, <em>Remmer II </em>is an application of the implied bias doctrine; it is clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Nothing in <em>Smith </em>rejects <em>Remmer II. </em>Justice O\u2019Connor made it plain in an unchallenged statement that the majority opinion was \u201cnot foreclosing the use of implied bias in appropriate situations.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This observation is no more than the holding of the Court in <em>Remmer II. </em>The majority opinion, while citing <em>Remmer I, </em>offered no suggestion that its holding was a retreat from <em>Remmer II. </em>Some lower federal courts have read <em>Smith </em>as rejecting <em>Remmer I\u2019s </em>\u201cpresumption of prejudice\u201d in the context of outside influences on jury members.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This does not touch the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, in <em>Remmer II, </em>that under certain limited circumstances, no juror can serve impartially. The presumption of prejudice in <em>Remmer I </em>put the burden on the government to show a juror\u2019s impartiality. Who bears the burden of proving prejudice is not our question.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Bound by the strictures of AEDPA, our question is whether the state court\u2019s decision was an objectively unreasonable application of the doctrine of implied bias. The state court concluded that the events surrounding the arrest of juror Garcia, during Brooks\u2019s capital-murder trial, were not sufficient to imply bias. We disagree. Juror Garcia was arrested and booked for carrying a loaded, .25 caliber pistol into the courthouse on the day Brooks\u2019s sentencing hearing started. Facing the possibility of felony prosecution, Garcia\u2019s fate rest in the hands of the same prosecutor now seeking the death penalty in Brooks\u2019s trial. Throughout sentencing, Garcia never knew whether he would be prosecuted. He testified that the sentencing hearing was \u201cone entire week of hell,\u201d that he suffered \u201cunrelenting embarrassment,\u201d and that although he thought the matter would be held in confidence, it was \u201cthe head story at twelve, five, six and ten o\u2019clock for four straight days.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s power over Garcia presented an intolerable risk, one that denied Brooks his constitutionally entitled impartial jury, and we maintain that no reasonable jurist could disagree with our legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Next, the state contends that <em>Brooks </em>requires a finding of implied bias any time the district attorney has the power to prosecute a sitting juror for a misdemeanor, in violation of the ban on new rules in postconviction proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree. <em>Brooks </em>does not go so far.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is only an application of settled Supreme Court law to a set of facts, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>does not run afoul of <em>Teague\u2019s </em>prohibition on creating new law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-14\">. <em>See Brooks v.
