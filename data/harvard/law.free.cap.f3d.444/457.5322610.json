The court having been polled at the request of one of its members, and a majority of the judges who are in active service not having voted in favor (Fed. R.App. P. and 5th Cir.

STEWART, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<judges id=\"Aj1\">with whom KING, HIGGINBOTHAM, WIENER, BENAVIDES, and DENNIS, Circuit Judges,</judges>\n<p id=\"AMR\">join dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-24\">I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc in this case in which the panel majority reversed the district court\u2019s denial of Parker Drilling\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, thereby reversing the jury\u2019s grant of maintenance and cure to seaman Brown. Today, the full court countenances the panel majority\u2019s usurpation of the jury\u2019s constitutionally defined role as fact-finder, irreparably harming the jury system in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-25\">To be clear, the crux of my disagreement with the panel majority is not about what the outcome might have been had I been on the jury, nor about all of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>components of the <em>McCorpen </em>defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having carefully read the full trial record, my primary disagreement with the panel majority rests on my understanding of the jury\u2019s role as fact-finder and of our limited role as appellate court judges. \u2018 Brown, a seaman, alleged he was injured while working on an offshore drilling rig and brought suit against his employer seeking, inter alia, maintenance and cure. Following a three-day jury trial before an experienced trial judge, the jury deliberated for five hours and returned a verdict in favor of Brown on some, but not all of his .claims. Parker Drilling then filed a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and a Motion for a New Trial. As I explained in my dissent from the panel\u2019s decision, <em>Brown v. Parker Drilling Offshore Corp., </em>410 F.3d 166, 184-85 (2005) (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), the district court carefully considered these motions, and, in a. twenty-five page, detailed and lucid opinion, ultimately concluded that there was a legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of Brown and that the jury\u2019s verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence. Contrary to the intimation of the panel majority, the trial judge was not \u201casleep at the switch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The Seventh Amendment guarantees litigants a right to. a trial by jury and the Supreme Court has repeatedly admonished us not to substitute our judgments for those of the jury, <em>see, e.g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 151, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), yet the panel majority\u2019s decision can only be understood as such. The jury accepted Brown\u2019s version of the events and rejected Parker Drilling\u2019s and, as the district court correctly determined, taken in the light most favorable to Brown, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Even though Parker Drilling\u2019s counsel more than adequately placed the issue of Brown\u2019s credibility before the jury, the panel majority initially reversed the verdict in favor of Brown concluding that the jury had clearly erred. On panel rehearing, apparently in response to enlightened skepticism, it re-characterized the case as turning on an issue of law, laying the purported reversible error at the feet of the trial judge rather than the jury. But despite the panel majority\u2019s protestations to the contrary, this case remains exactly what it was when the panel first heard it \u2014 a vigorously tried case by experienced counsel on both sides before a seasoned trial judge, after which the jury returned a verdict that is (or should be) insulated from appellate fact-finding. And regardless of which chameleonic legalisms the panel majority uses to explain it, the panel majority\u2019s decision remains what it was from the beginning \u2014 an audacious exercise in violating the Seventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The panel majority, under the guise of correcting errors of law, usurped the jury\u2019s Seventh Amendment function, replacing the jury\u2019s verdict with a verdict of its own. Brown\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc was not an invitation for the full court to re-try this case for a third time, but an opportunity to correct the lamentable message that the panel majority\u2019s decision sent to the bench and bar throughout the Fifth Circuit \u2014 no jury verdict is invulnerable before this court. The panel majority\u2019s decision commandeered the jury\u2019s role as fact-finder and it is principally for this reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that I vehemently dissent from the full court\u2019s refusal to rehear this case en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-5\">. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly agree with Judge Wiener's special concurrence, which thoroughly explains the panel majority\u2019s errors with regard to <em>McCorpen v. Cent. Gulf S.S. Corp., </em>396 F.2d 547 (5th Cir.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b483-5\">WIENER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<judges id=\"ATc\">Specially concurring in STEWART, Circuit Judge\u2019s</judges>\n<p id=\"AY7W\">Dissent from Denial of Rehearing En Banc:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">I concur in Judge Stewart\u2019s opinion dissenting from this court\u2019s refusal to grant a rehearing en banc. I do not disagree with Judge Stewart\u2019s dissent in any way, nor do I disagree with either of his earlier panel dissents; indeed, I wholeheartedly agree with them all. Rather, I write only to supplement Judge Stewart\u2019s latest dissent with a more detailed explication of where, with respect, I perceive my colleagues of the panel majority (and those who failed to vote to rehear it en banc) to have violated our venerable precedent, thereby \u2014 unintentionally, I am sure \u2014 doing damage to the federal courts\u2019 civil jury system and thus to the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>I. Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In this maritime jury trial case, Brown, a seaman, claimed maintenance and cure for injuries incurred in a witnessed and documented traumatic accident on an offshore petroleum platform diming the course and scope of his employment. Parker Drilling, the employer or \u201cvessel owner,\u201d defended against payment of maintenance and cure to Seaman Brown. Parker Drilling did so based on Brown\u2019s omission, from a pre-hiring job application, of information about previous \u201cback trouble\u201d that he had experienced while working for prior employers. Specifically, Parker Drilling contended that it would not have hired Brown if he had not intentionally concealed that information, which \u2014 according to Parker Drilling \u2014 would have revealed prior medical problems that had a nexus with his present injury. Parker Drilling characterized Brown\u2019s conceded omissions <em>as intentional misrepresentation or concealment of medical facts. </em>Despite extensive and brutally zealous cross-examination by counsel for Parker Drilling, however, Brown stuck to his simplistic but straightforward explanation: Although he <em>knowingly </em>(i.e., not negligently or inadvertently) left out references to prior muscle-pulls and back sprains he had experienced while working at previous manual labor jobs, he did so in the belief that the questionnaire was not asking about such relatively minor problems but only about serious \u201cback trouble.\u201d Specifically, Brown testified that he thought that the questionnaire was referring only to \u201c... disc and all that, you know, broke back, a disc, neck being broke or something, the injury a real one instead of a pulled muscle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">After hearing this and much more testimony from (and cross-examination of) Brown, as well as from his treating physician and other doctors, from Parker Drilling\u2019s medical experts, and from eyewitnesses, the jury (1) credited Brown\u2019s explanation, viz., that his <em>knowing omission </em>of prior back sprain information was not, an <em>intentional misrepresentation or concealment of medical facts; </em>and (2) rejected Parker Drilling\u2019s claim of a connection between, on the one hand, those prior pulls and strains, caused by overexertion or heavy lifting on previous jobs, and, on the other hand, the distinguishable violent and more serious injury suffered on Parker Drilling\u2019s offshore rig, caused by a sudden and violent \u201ckick\u201d of the equipment. After the jury found for Brown and awarded, <em>inter alia, </em>mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>nance and cure (as well as finding bad faith denial by Parker Drilling), the district court, in a lengthy and well-reasoned ruling, denied Parker Drilling\u2019s post-verdict motions to have the jury\u2019s verdict overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\n<em>II. Controlling Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">All agree that the almost-conclusive presumption that every injured seaman is entitled to maintenance and cure is subject to one \u2014 but only one \u2014 exception that would let the vessel owner off the maintenance- and-eure hook. For more than thirty-five years, a vessel owner in this circuit could avoid liability for maintenance and cure in <em>only </em>one way: proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, all three prongs of the <em>conjunctive </em>test set forth in the landmark <em>McCorpen </em>case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under that test, the vessel owner has always had the burden of proving to the trier of fact (here, the jury) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">1. The claimant intentionally misrepresented or concealed medical facts <em>[first prong],</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">2. The non-disclosed facts were material to the employer\u2019s decision to hire the claimant <em>[second prong], and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">3. A connection exists between the withheld information and the injury complained of in a lawsuit <em>[third prong].</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The second prong of the <em>McCorpen </em>test \u2014 that Parker Drilling would have not hired Brown had it known that he had previously experienced job-related muscle pulls and back sprains \u2014 went largely uncontested. I thus assume for today\u2019s purposes that Parker Drilling met its burden on the second <em>(hiring </em>nexus) prong of <em>McCorpen, </em>i.e., a nexus between <em>hiring </em>Brown and the muscle-pull information that he omitted. As for the first and third prongs, however, I respectfully but strenuously disagree with the panel majority\u2019s determinations \u2014 and thus with the implied determinations of those of my colleagues who declined to support rehearing this case en banc \u2014 that, despite the jury\u2019s determination on the basis of a significant quantity of admittedly disputed fact evidence, (1) Brown\u2019s <em>omission </em>of back sprain information on his employment questionnaire constituted <em>intentional misrepresentation or concealment of medical facts (.McCorpen\u2019s </em>first prong), and (2) that there was a <em>nexus </em>between the <em>omitted back-sprain information </em>and the <em>traumatic injury </em>suffered on Parker Drilling\u2019s offshore platform, the one for which Brown sought maintenance and cure <em>(.McCorpen\u2019s </em>third prong). I remain convinced that this was legal error in the face of the jury\u2019s determinations reached at the end of a trial flawlessly conducted by the district court, that Parker Drilling had failed to meet its preponderance burden on these <em>two </em>of the three <em>McCorpen </em>prongs \u2014 the failure on either of which should have doomed Parker Drilling\u2019s resistance to paying Brown maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Yet the panel majority, which in its first opinion had reversed the <em>jury\u2019s </em>fact-intensive, hotly-contested, credibility-dependent verdict, withdrew that opinion and granted panel rehearing, only to reach essentially the same result. The second time, though, it did so by, of all things, reversing the district court\u2019s refusal to reverse the jury and enter judgment in favor of Parker Drilling.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">T read the panel majority\u2019s opinion on rehearing as confusing or conflating intentional <em>omission </em>of medical evidence (which the panel majority stated to be an <em>objective </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>inquiry) with McCorpen\u2019s \u201cintentionally misrepresenting] or concealing] medical facts,\u201d a <em>subjective </em>inquiry. The panel majority obviously re-weighed the evidence, then faulted the district judge for not having done what the panel majority did in its initial appellate opinion, viz., reverse the jury by conducting a constitutionally impermissible <em>appellate review of the facts. </em>And it did so despite our long-settled and well-established standard of appellate review under these circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But, when a case is tried by a jury, a Rule 50(a) motion is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In resolving such challenges, we draw reasonable inferences and resolve all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we will reverse the denial of a Rule 50(a) motion only if the evidence points so strongly and so overwhelmingly in favor of the nonmoving party that no reasonable juror could return a contrary verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A jury verdict must be upheld unless \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\u201d as the jury did.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The record contains a plethora of evidence, much on both sides of the various fact issues, and considerably more than just Brown\u2019s putatively self-serving explanation. But, drawing all inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in favor of Brown (the nonmoving party and the victor before the jury), an appellate court simply cannot say, as a matter of law, that the evidence pointed so strongly and overwhelmingly against Brown and in favor of Parker Drilling that \u201cno reasonable juror could return a contrary verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mischaracterizing intention to <em>omit </em>a fact as intention to <em>misrepresent </em>or <em>conceal </em>a fact undoubtedly contributed to the impermissible reversal of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to supplant the jury verdict with Parker Drilling\u2019s view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">The core problem that results from denying en banc rehearing and thereby allowing this case to stand lies in the recognition that it matters not whether federal district judges (much less federal appellate judges) can bring themselves to credit Brown\u2019s simplistic, uneducated explanation that he did not think that back sprains and muscle pulls amounted to the kind of \u201cback trouble\u201d about which Parker Drilling\u2019s questionnaire was inquiring. What does matter so critically to the civil jury law of this circuit, however, is that a jury of <em>Brown\u2019s peers </em>(who obviously understood and identified with the common kind of blue-collar, physically strenuous, manual labor regularly encountered in the \u201coil-patch\u201d) recognized the truism that workers like Brown go home every night bone-weary, muscle-sore, and bodily-bruised\u2014 and think nothing of it! These jurors, who observed Brown\u2019s demeanor, heard his treating physician\u2019s testimony about the earlier muscle strains, listened to the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tensive cross-examination of Brown, and considered all the other evidence, concluded that, yes, Brown did (as he admitted) intentionally omit the earlier information, but, no, he did <em>not </em>do so with the intention of concealing or misrepresenting anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Parker Drilling\u2019s failure to bear its burden of proving the first prong of <em>McCorpen </em>was all that should have been necessary to insulate the jury verdict against this vessel owner\u2019s post-verdict efforts to get the district court to overrule the jury. This is true \u201cin spades\u201d on appeal. Unlike the district judge (who, like the jury, observed Brown and all other witnesses firsthand), the two appellate judges of the panel majority overruled the district court\u2014 and thus the jury\u2019s verdict for Brown \u2014 on nothing more than the \u201ccold record.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">This is precisely the kind of civil <em>jury </em>case in which the verdict (and the refusal of the district court to supplant it) should not have been overturned on appeal. Otherwise, as Judge Stewart pointed out in his panel dissents and again in his dissent from denial of rehearing en banc, we do irreparable harm to the civil jury system in this circuit when we allow the panel majority\u2019s jury reversal to stand. We simply cannot sit in our remote, monastic chambers, look only at the record on appeal, then say that these cold facts point so strongly in favor of the vessel owner that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a verdict for the seaman. This is especially true when, as here, the vessel owner\u2019s only legally recognized avenue of escape from its virtually automatic obligation to pay maintenance and cure was to prove <em>all three </em>prongs of McCorpen\u2019s conjunctive test to the satisfaction of the jury. To repeat, I concur in Judge Stewart\u2019s Dissent from Denial of Rehearing En Banc and, despite my genuine respect for my colleagues who voted otherwise, offer the foregoing to supplement Judge Stewart\u2019s reasons for concluding that, indeed, this case cried out to be reheard en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\"> Judges King, Higginbotham, Benavides, Stewart, and Dennis concur in this Special Concurrence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">. <em>McCorpen v.
