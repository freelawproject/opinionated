The respondent, Entertainment Industry Coalition (EIC), challenged the validity of the resolution claiming the regulation conflicts with specific provisions of chapter 70.160 RCW, the Washington Clean Indoor Air Act.</p>\n<author id=\"ASS\">C. Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\u00b62 The Pierce County Superior Court concluded the resolution conflicts with this act, invalidated the resolution, and enjoined enforcement of the resolution. The superior court denied a request by EIC for attorney fees under RCW 4.84.350 and RCW 4.84.185. The Health Board appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the case was then transferred to this court. EIC cross-appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney fees. We affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">\u00b63 In 1985, the Washington Clean Indoor Air Act (Act) was enacted. Various sections of the Act are at issue in this case. RCW 70.160.030 states that \u201cNo person may smoke in a public place except in designated smoking areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">\u00b64 RCW 70.160.040(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">(1) A smoking area may be designated in a public place by the owner or, in the case of a leased or rented space, by the lessee or other person in charge except in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>(a) Elevators; buses, except for private hire; streetcars; taxis, except those clearly and visibly designated by the owner to permit smoking; public areas of retail stores and lobbies of financial institutions; office reception areas and waiting rooms of any building owned or leased by the state of Washington or by any city, county, or other municipality in the state of Washington; museums; public meetings or hearings; classrooms and lecture halls of schools, colleges, and universities; and the seating areas and aisle ways which are contiguous to seating areas of concert halls, theaters, auditoriums, exhibition halls, and indoor sports arenas; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-3\">(b) Hallways of health care facilities, with the exception of nursing homes, and lobbies of concert halls, theaters, auditoriums, exhibition halls, and indoor sports arenas, if the area is not physically separated. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">Except as provided in other provisions of this chapter, no public place, other than a bar, tavern, bowling alley, tobacco shop, or restaurant, may be designated as a smoking area in its entirety. If a bar, tobacco shop, or restaurant is designated as a smoking area in its entirety, this designation shall be posted conspicuously on all entrances normally used by the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u00b65 RCW 70.160.080 provides that \u201cLocal fire departments or fire districts and local health departments may adopt regulations as required to implement this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u00b66 On December 3, 2003, the Health Board adopted the resolution at issue in this case. The operative section being challenged states in relevant part: \u201cSmoke free air is mandated in all indoor public places, including a presumptively reasonable minimum distance ... of twenty-five (25) feet from entrances, exits, opening windows and ventilation intakes . . . .\u201d Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dep\u2019t Bd. of Health ch. 82, Regulation 82.3, \u00a7 3 (Dec. 3, 2003) (Resolution No. 2003-3527). This ban applies to all public places, including restaurants, taverns, bars, bowling alleys, and all other enclosed public areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\u00b67 EIC challenged the resolution and claimed the regulation conflicted with sections of the Act. EIC argues that a total smoking ban in all public areas\u2014including a bar, tavern, bowling alley, tobacco shop, restaurant, or an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ployee workplace, which are expressly exempted from regulation under the Act\u2014is contrary to RCW 70.160.040. EIC further argues that unless the Act specifically requires establishments to be smoke-free, business owners have the choice of having a smoking section or of remaining smoke-free.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\">\u00b68 A health board\u2019s authority to enact health regulations comes solely from statutory delegation. RCW 70-.05.060(3) provides for health boards to \u201cEnact such local rules and regulations as are necessary in order to preserve, promote and improve the public health. . ..\u201d The statute, under RCW 70.05.060(4), also directs a local health board to \u201cprovide for the control and prevention of any dangerous, contagious or infectious disease within the jurisdiction of the local health department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\u00b69 While the statutory delegation under RCW 70.05.060 is broad, such delegation does not include any power to enact regulations that conflict with state legislation. A local regulation conflicts with a statute when it permits what is forbidden by state law or prohibits what state law permits. Where such a conflict is found to exist, under the principle of conflict preemption, the local regulation is invalid. <em>Parkland Light &amp; Water Co. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Bd. of Health, </em>151 Wn.2d 428, 433, 90 P.3d 37 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\u00b610 We have previously found conflict preemption when an ordinance and statute cannot be harmonized. <em>HJS Dev., Inc. v. Pierce County ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Planning &amp; Land Servs., </em>148 Wn.2d 451, 482, 61 P.3d 1141 (2003). Most recently, under conflict preemption, we invalidated a local regulation where the Tacoma-Pierce County Board of Health, by resolution, ordered certain water districts and providers to fluoridate their water supply. <em>Parkland, </em>151 Wn.2d at 433-34. In <em>Parkland, </em>we invalidated the health board\u2019s action, despite the fact that fluoridation would fight disease, since the regulation was preempted by conflicting state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number> \u00b611 Like our previous cases, the Health Board resolution banning smoking also irreconcilably conflicts with specific state statutory provisions. By prohibiting smoking in all indoor public locations, the local regulation does not allow business owners to designate smoking areas. The Act permits smoking in certain public areas, providing that a \u201c[s]moking area may be designated in a public place by the owner . . . .\u201d RCW 70.160.040(1). The resolution, by imposing a complete smoking ban, prohibits what is permitted by state law: the ability of certain business owners and lessees to designate smoking and nonsmoking locations in their establishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\">f 12 The Health Board\u2019s authorization to implement the Act, under RCW 70.160.080, allows only regulations consistent within the Act\u2019s statutory guidelines. A statutory delegation to an agency or board is limited to those powers expressly granted, and if any doubt exists related to the granting of this power, it must be denied. <em>Employco Personnel Serv. v. City of Seattle, </em>117 Wn.2d 606, 617, 817 P.2d 1373 (1991). Thus, under the specific statutory provisions, most business owners have the choice to have a smoking section. In some businesses, like a bar, tavern, bowling alley, tobacco shop, or restaurant, the statute allows an owner to create the entire establishment as a smoking establishment. By prohibiting what the statute allows, the Health Board\u2019s resolution is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"> \u00b613 The Health Board contends that if any portion of the Act is found to preempt the smoking ban, the antismoking regulation is no longer in the hands of government, but instead with private business owners. The Health Board argues that this statutory authorization to designate smoking areas implicates the nondelegation doctrine. Under that doctrine, the legislature may grant regulatory authority to private parties only if proper standards, guidelines, and procedural safeguards exist. <em>United Chiropractors of Wash., Inc. v. State, </em>90 Wn.2d 1, 4-8, 578 P.2d 38 (1978). However, the legislature has drawn this line by giving business owners specific guidelines and by providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>local health boards and fire departments with the responsibility to ensure statutory compliance and implementation. RCW 70.160.040. We find that the Act, under RCW 70.160.040, provides sufficient standards, guidelines, and safeguards and leaves sufficient regulatory authority to local entities to ensure compliance with the statutory requirements. Thus, the nondelegation argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"> \u00b614 In its final argument, the Health Board contends that if any portion of the Act is found to preempt the smoking ban, there is an equal protection violation since certain workers are being denied protection from carcinogenic smoke fumes. Even if the Health Board were in a position, in a representative capacity, to make an equal protection argument, its claim fails. The purpose of the statute is to create areas within certain businesses to limit public exposure to \u201cenvironmental tobacco smoke,\u201d which the statute does to various degrees. To argue that the Act is punishing some class of workers confuses the effect of the legislation, and we find no equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">CONCLUSION AND ATTORNEY FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\u00b615 EIC argues that it should be awarded attorney fees. It claims that the Health Board\u2019s defense was frivolous, entitling EIC to attorney fees under RCW 4.84.185.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also,</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>under RCW 4.84.350,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the equal access to justice act (EAJA) (Laws of 1995, ch. 403, \u00a7 901), EIC argues that it is a qualified party, the Health Board is a state agency, and the Health Board\u2019s regulation was not substantially justified, thereby entitling EIC to attorney fees. The Health Board maintains it does not owe attorney fees, since its efforts to improve health conditions under RCW 70.05.060 were substantially justified and its defense was rational. The Health Board also contends that EIC is not entitled to attorney fees under EAJA because EIC is not a qualified party, the Health Board is not a state agency, and the awarding of fees would be unjust. The trial court denied EIC\u2019s request for attorney fees under both RCW 4.84.185 and RCW 4.84.350. The trial court found that the defense was not frivolous, there was substantial justification for the Health Board\u2019s actions, and neither EIC nor the Health Board completely fits the EAJA definitional requirements for EIC to have a valid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\u00b616 EIC argues that the trial court erred by not finding the Health Board\u2019s defense frivolous. The standard of review for attorney fees in frivolous lawsuits is abuse of discretion, examining the trial court\u2019s decision whether a case, taken as a whole, is advanced without reasonable cause. RCW 4.84.185; <em>State ex rel. Quick-Ruben v. Verharen, </em>136 Wn.2d 888, 903, 969 P.2d 64 (1998). Under this standard, we will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision only where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of attorney fees is untenable or manifestly unreasonable. <em>Ermine v. City of Spokane, </em>143 Wn.2d 636, 641, 23 P.3d 492 (2001). The trial court found that the Health Board made rational arguments in support of its defense. We agree with this finding and affirm the denial of attorney fees under RCW 4.84.185.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">\u00b617 EIC also contends that the trial court erred in denying it an award of attorney fees under EAJA. This act is intended to provide possible attorney fees for certain individuals and qualified groups who might otherwise be deterred from litigating against unjust state agency actions. RCW 4.84.350. EIC argues that we should review the trial court\u2019s decisions regarding EAJA attorney fees de novo, since the issues of whether EIC is a qualified party and the Health Board is a state agency are both matters of law. We agree that these two issues are questions of law and provide for de novo review. However, since the Health Board is not a state agency, as required by the act, EIC is not eligible for an award of attorney fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\u00b618 The EAJA allows an award of attorney fees only for a qualified party who prevails in a judicial review of an \u201cagency action.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The EAJA defines \u201cagency\u201d as \u201cany <em>state </em>board, commission, department, institution of higher education, or officer, authorized by law to make rules or to conduct adjudicative proceedings . .. .\u201d RCW 4.84-.340(1) (emphasis added). The definition of an \u201cagency action\u201d means an agency action as defined under chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). RCW 4.84.340(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\u00b619 On its face, the statute awards attorney fees only to qualified parties who prevail in a judicial review of actions against \u201cstate\u201d agencies. The Tacoma-Pierce County Board of Health is not a state agency. <em>See generally </em>chapter 70.05 RCW <em>(\u201cLOCAL </em>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, BOARDS, OF<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>FICERS\u2014REGULATIONS\u201d) (emphasis added). This description alone could resolve the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, there is additional support. Like the EAJA, the APA definition of \u201cagency\u201d is also limited to a \u201cstate board, commission, department, institution of higher education, or officer\u201d and an \u201cagency action\u201d is the \u201clicensing, the implementation or enforcement of a statute, the adoption or application of an agency rule or order, the imposition of sanctions, or the granting or withholding of benefits\u201d by such an \u201cagency.\u201d RCW 34.05.010(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\">\u00b620 The APA applies only to actions of state agencies clearly involved in statewide programs. <em>Riggins v. Hous. Auth., </em>87 Wn.2d 97, 100, 549 P.2d 480 (1976). <em>Riggins </em>set forth several nonexclusive factors to determine whether a government entity is a \u201cstate agency\u201d under the APA. These factors included whether the government agencies had limited geographical areas of operation, were independent and permitted to set their own rules and regulations, and were not receiving state funding. <em>Kitsap County Fire Prot. Dist. No. 7 v. Kitsap County Boundary Review Bd., </em>87 Wn. App. 753, 757, 943 P.2d 380 (1997); <em>Riggins, </em>87 Wn.2d at 101-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\u00b621 Under chapter 70.05 RCW, the duties of local health boards primarily deal with local health concerns, and local health boards operate with limited geographical jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>RCW 70.05.060- .070. They are independent and set their own rules and regulations. RCW 70.05.060(3). While they receive funding from <em>both </em>state and local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>sources, we find the funding source not to be the dispositive factor in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, the Health Board is not an agency under the APA, and therefore its actions were not \u201cagency actions\u201d under the APA. Thus, the Health Board is not an \u201cagency\u201d under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u00b622 Because the Health Board is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the EAJA, the EIC is not entitled to attorney fees under that act. We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney fees under RCW 4.84.350.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u00b623 The decision of the trial court is affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Alexander, C.J.; Madsen, Sanders, Bridge, Chambers, Owens, and Fairhurst, JJ.; and Ireland, J.
