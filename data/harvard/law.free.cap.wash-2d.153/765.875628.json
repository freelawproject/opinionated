Freeman. </em>Late one night, Javon Pitchford was invited to a party by a girl he had recently met. Pitchford did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>not know it at the time, but he and the girl had a mutual acquaintance in one of his old childhood friends, Michael Freeman. Freeman and Pitchford had seen each other only occasionally since childhood. As it happened, Freeman was among a group of men sent to pick Pitchford up and take him to the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">f4 But these men did not take Pitchford to the party. Instead, after a few detours, they stopped the car on a dark, dead-end street. Freeman got out, walked around to Pitchford\u2019s side of the car, opened the door, drew a .45-caliber handgun, and ordered Pitchford to hand over any valuables. When Pitchford did not immediately comply, Freeman said, \u201cWhat, you think I won\u2019t shoot you?\u201d and fired a single shot. 1 Report of Proceedings (RP) (Freeman) at 58-59. The bullet ripped through Pitchford\u2019s arm, chest, intestines, colon, and liver. Pitchford crawled out the other side of the car and collapsed bleeding in a driveway. Freeman and his associates robbed him and apparently left him for dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">\u00b65 Miraculously a cab driver found Pitchford, and he was taken to Harborview Medical Center in the usually deadly state of stage four shock. When Pitchford regained consciousness three days later, he identified Freeman as his assailant. A jury later convicted Freeman of both first degree assault and first degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\u00b66 At sentencing, Freeman unsuccessfully argued that the two convictions were the same for double jeopardy purposes because the jury was instructed that the use of force (effectively, the assault) was an element of the robbery. After multiple sentencing hearings, the trial judge ruled that the two convictions were not the same for double jeopardy purposes because it was \u201cclear that the shooting of Javon Pitchford was not necessary to accomplish the robbery. It was gratuitous . . . one could almost say a coldblooded afterthought to and not just an adjunct of the robbery.\u201d 3 RP (Freeman) at 435. Freeman was sentenced to 231 months confinement, with the assault and robbery convictions running concurrently, and the firearms en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>hancements running consecutively. Freeman appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed <em>(State v. Freeman, </em>118 Wn. App. 365, 76 P.3d 732 (2003)), and we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">\u00b67 <em>State v. Zumwalt. </em>William Lars Zumwalt and an acquaintance offered to sell drugs to a woman they met at the Fiesta Bowl Casino in Richland, Washington. They agreed to meet in the parking lot to conclude the transaction. Once there, Zumwalt apparently had second thoughts about selling the woman drugs. Instead of simply leaving, Zumwalt punched the victim hard in the face with his fist, knocking her to the ground. He caused serious injuries, including fracturing her eye socket. She was then robbed of approximately $300 in cash and casino chips.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\u00b68 Zumwalt later admitted he assaulted the woman but denied robbing her. He told the trial judge that he had become suspicious that she might be an agent of the local drug enforcement agency, grown fearful, and was merely trying to get away from her. The trial judge did not find this credible and convicted Zumwalt of first degree robbery and second degree assault. At sentencing, Zumwalt unsuccessfully moved to have the assault conviction vacated as merged with the robbery. The trial judge declined and entered both convictions, sentences to be served concurrently. The Court of Appeals reversed <em>(State v. Zumwalt, </em>119 Wn. App. 126, 82 P.3d 672 (2003)), and we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">A. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">\u00b69 Our review is de novo. <em>State v. Johnston, </em>100 Wn. App. 126, 137, 996 P.2d 629 (2000); <em>State v. Knutson, </em>88 Wn. App. 677, 680, 946 P.2d 789 (1997). The State may bring (and a jury may consider) multiple charges arising from the same criminal conduct in a single proceeding. <em>State v. Michielli, </em>132 Wn.2d 229, 238-39, 937 P.2d 587 (1997). Courts may not, however, enter multiple convictions for the same offense without offending double jeopardy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>State v. Vladovic, </em>99 Wn.2d 413, 422, 662 P.2d 853 (1983) (citing <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 344, 101 S. Ct. 1137, 67 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1981)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s act supports charges under two criminal statutes, a court weighing a double jeopardy challenge must determine whether, in light of legislative intent, the charged crimes constitute the same offense.\u201d <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Orange, </em>152 Wn.2d 795, 815, 100 P.3d 291 (2004). The legislature has the power to define offenses and set punishments. <em>See State v. Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d 769, 777-78, 888 P.2d 155 (1995) (rape and incest are separate offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">\u00b610 The dispositive question today is whether and, if so, when, the legislature intended to punish separately both a robbery elevated to first degree by an assault, and the assault itself. <em>Cf Garrett v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 779, 105 S. Ct. 2407, 85 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1985) (legislature has the power to criminalize every step leading to a greater crime, and the crime itself) <em>(citing Albrecht v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 1, 11, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. 505 (1927)); <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 688-89, 100 S. Ct. 1432, 63 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1980). If the legislature authorized cumulative punishments for both crimes, then double jeopardy is not offended. <em>See generally </em>William S. McAninch, <em>Unfolding the Law of Double Jeopardy, </em>44 S.C. L. Rev. 411, 483-84 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">\u00b611 Because the question largely turns on what the legislature intended, we first consider any express or im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>plicit legislative intent. Sometimes the legislative intent is clear, as when it explicitly provides that burglary shall be punished separately from any related crime. RCW 9A.52.050. Sometimes, there is sufficient evidence of legislative intent that we are confident concluding that the legislature intended to punish two offenses arising out of the same bad act separately without more analysis. <em>E.g., Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at <em>777-78 </em>(rape and incest are separate offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">\u00b612 Second, if the legislative intent is not clear, we may turn to the <em>Blockburger </em>test. <em>See Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 777-78; <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). If each crime contains an element that the other does not, we presume that the crimes are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. <em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 777; <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304 (establishing \u201csame evidence\u201d or \u201csame elements\u201d test); <em>State v. Reiff, </em>14 Wash. 664, 667, 45 P. 318 (1896) (double jeopardy violated when \u201c \u2018the evidence required to support a conviction [of one crime] would have been sufficient to warrant a conviction upon the other\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Morey v. Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871)).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">\u00b613 When applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we do not consider the elements of the crime on an abstract level. \u201c \u2018[W]here <em>the same act or transaction </em>constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision <em>requires proof of a fact </em>which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orange, </em>152 Wn.2d at 817 (quoting <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304 (citing <em>Gavieres v. United States, </em>220 U.S. 338, 342, 31 S. Ct. 421, 55 L. Ed. 489 (1911))). However, the <em>Blockburger </em>presumption may be rebutted by other evidence of legislative intent. <em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u00b6[14 Third, if applicable, the merger doctrine is another aid in determining legislative intent, even when two crimes have formally different elements. Under the merger doctrine, when the degree of one offense is raised by conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>separately criminalized by the legislature, we presume the legislature intended to punish both offenses through a greater sentence for the greater crime. <em>Vladovic, </em>99 Wn.2d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">\u00b615 Finally, even if on an abstract level two convictions appear to be for the same offense or for charges that would merge, if there is an independent purpose or effect to each, they may be punished as separate offenses. <em>State v. Frohs, </em>83 Wn. App. 803, 807, 924 P.2d 384 (1996) (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>92 Wn.2d 671, 680, 600 P.2d 1249 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">B. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">1. <em>Do the statutes authorize separate </em>punishments?</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\u00b616 Again, if the statutes explicitly authorize separate punishments, then separate convictions do not offend double jeopardy. <em>See Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 776; <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Burchfield, </em>111 Wn. App. 892, 896, 46 P.3d 840 (2002); <em>cf. </em>RCW 9A.52.050. Therefore, we begin our analysis with the most important question; what did the legislature intend? Evidence of legislative intent may be clear on the face of the statute, found in the legislative history, the structure of the statutes, the fact the two statutes are directed at eliminating different evils, or any other source of legislative intent. <em>Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 864, 105 S. Ct. 1668, 84 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1985); <em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 777-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">\u00b617 In this case, the statutes do not explicitly authorize separate punishments. <em>Compare </em>RCW 9A.56.200 (first degree robbery) <em>with </em>RCW 9A.36.011 (first degree assault). Freeman and Zumwalt argue that we should infer legislative intent based on the legislature\u2019s silence in the face of a long line of prior holdings that tended to find the two crimes to be the same for double jeopardy purposes. They note that since 1975, courts have regularly vacated assault convictions when the assault furthered a first degree robbery. <em>See generally </em>13 Royce A. Ferguson, Jr., Washington Practice: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4706, at 340-43 (3d ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>2004) (collecting cases). Freeman and Zumwalt argue that the fact the legislature has not indicated its discontent with these cases proves its approval. <em>Cf. State v. Coe, </em>109 Wn.2d 832, 846, 750 P.2d 208 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\u00b618 It is true that since 1975, courts have generally held that convictions for assault and robbery stemming from a single violent act are the same for double jeopardy purposes and that the conviction for assault must be vacated at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., State v. Prater, </em>30 Wn. App. 512, 516, 635 P.2d 1104 (1981); <em>State v. Springfield, </em>28 Wn. App. 446, 453, 624 P.2d 208 (1981) (\u201cSpringfield\u2019s one punch . . . can support a conviction for either the robbery or the assault, but not both.\u201d), <em>substantially overruled by Calle, 125 </em>Wn.2d at 777; <em>State v. Bresolin, </em>13 Wn. App. 386, 394, 534 P.2d 1394 (1975) (merging assault and robbery); <em>see generally </em>12 Royce A. Ferguson, Jr., Washington Practice: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2107, at 455-65 (3d ed. 2004); 13 Royce A. Ferguson, Jr., <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4706, at 340-44. Vacation of the assault charge is so ubiquitous that the model form in Washington Practice for a motion to merge counts at sentencing lists assault and robbery in the text of the model form. <em>Id. </em>at 350-51; <em>but see State v. Tanberg, 121 </em>Wn. App. 134, 87 P.3d 788 (2004) <em>petition for review deferred pending resolution of this matter </em>(Wash. Nov. 30, 2004). However, we conclude that no per se rule has emerged; instead, courts have continued to give a hard look at each case. <em>See generally Vladovic, </em>99 Wn.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u00b619 When an assault elevates the degree of robbery, courts have regularly concluded that the two offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes. However, with the exception of <em>Springfield </em>(which was substantially overruled by <em>Calle), </em>courts have not held as a matter of law that the two crimes are the same. The fact the legislature has not acted is also, potentially, evidence that it is satisfied with our current practice of analyzing these cases individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">\u00b620 Similarly, the State argues that we can find legislative intent to punish these crimes separately in the fact that the two statutes are directed at different evils. <em>See generally </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d 769. But in <em>Calle, </em>this court reviewed in detail the history and academic material bolstering its conclusion that the legislature <em>did </em>intend to combat different societal evils through the rape and incest statutes. <em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 780-81. No such historical review appears in the briefing here. Further, a per se holding that the legislature <em>never </em>intends these two crimes to merge would also require us to substantially overrule a long line of cases. <em>State v. Mahoney, </em>40 Wn. App. 514, 517, 699 P.2d 254 (1985); <em>Prater, </em>30 Wn. App. at 516; <em>Bresolin, </em>13 Wn. App. at 394; <em>cf. Vladovic, </em>99 Wn.2d at 419; <em>Johnson, </em>92 Wn.2d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">\u00b621 We find no explicit or implied legislative intent from the legislature\u2019s silence in the face of our holdings. Nor do we find explicit or implied legislative intent whether, as a matter of law, these statutes necessarily forbid different types of bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\u00b622 However, there is an important piece of evidence that recent legislatures intended to punish <em>first </em>degree assault and <em>first </em>degree robbery separately, at least under some circumstances. As the legislature is well aware, when a court vacates a conviction on double jeopardy grounds, it usually vacates the conviction for the crime that forms part of the proof of the other. <em>See, e.g., State v. Valentine, </em>108 Wn. App. 24, 26, 29 P.3d 42 (2001); <em>State v. Read, </em>100 Wn. App. 776, 792, 998 P.2d 897 (2000); <em>Prater, </em>30 Wn. App. at 516; <em>Springfield, </em>28 Wn. App. at 453; <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>23 Wn. App. 826, 863, 598 P.2d 756 (1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other </em>grounds, 93 Wn.2d 823, 613 P.2d 1139 (1980); <em>Bresolin, </em>13 Wn. App. at 394. This is because the greater offense \u201ctypically carries a penalty that incorporates punishment for the lesser included offence.\u201d Akhil Reed Amar &amp; Jonathan L. Marcus, <em>Double Jeopardy Law After Rodney King, </em>95 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 28 (1995). But when a first degree assault raises a robbery to first degree robbery, the case is atypical. The standard sentence for first degree assault (in this case, 111 months) is considerably longer than the standard sentence for first degree robbery (in this case, 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>months). Given the fact of the current sentencing schema, it is unlikely the legislature intended this result. While this is not necessarily dispositive, it does weigh upon our analysis. <em>Cf. Burchfield, </em>111 Wn. App. at 900 (considering the seriousness level assigned by the legislature when determining how the legislature intended two related crimes to be treated).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\u00b623 However, when assault in the second degree elevates robbery to the first degree, the result is more typical. In Zumwalt\u2019s case, he received a standard range sentence of 54 months on the \u201cgreater\u201d robbery conviction and 17 months for the \u201clesser\u201d assault conviction, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">\u00b624 Accordingly, we conclude that there is evidence that the legislature did intend to punish first degree assault and robbery separately. But we find no evidence that the legislature intended to punish second degree assault separately from first degree robbery when the assault facilitates the robbery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">2. <em>Are the two crimes, as charged and proved, the same in law and in fact? (The \u201csame evidence\u201d or \u201csame elements\u201d rule.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">f 25 <em>Blockburger </em>is part of our analytical framework. The parties seem to agree in their briefing to this court that <em>Blockburger </em>is not a basis to find a double jeopardy violation. Since the parties are not meaningfully adverse on this point, we will briefly address it only to give a more complete overview of modern double jeopardy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">\u00b626 When legislative intent is not clear, we turn to the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201csame evidence\u201d test. <em>Blockburger </em>is another rule of statutory construction specifically designed to determine legislative intent in the context of double jeopardy. <em>See Garrett, </em>471 U.S. at 778-79. Under <em>Blockburger, </em>we presume that the legislature did not intend to punish criminal conduct twice when \u201c \u2018 \u201c <em>the evidence required </em>to support a conviction upon one of [the charged crimes] would have been sufficient to warrant a conviction upon the other.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>Orange, </em>152 Wn.2d at 820 (alteration and emphasis added) (quoting <em>Reiff, </em>14 Wash, at 667 (quoting <em>Morey, </em>108 Mass, at 434)). Accordingly, if the crimes, as charged and proved, are the same in law and in fact, they may not be punished separately absent clear legislative intent to the contrary. <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304. We consider the elements of the crimes as charged and proved, not merely as the level of an abstract articulation of the elements. <em>See, e.g., Vladovic, </em>99 Wn.2d at 423; <em>see also Orange, </em>152 Wn.2d at 817-18 (explicitly rejecting the abstract analysis employed in <em>Valentine, </em>108 Wn. App. at 26-27). However, the mere fact that the same <em>conduct </em>is used to prove each crime is not dispositive. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 704, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1993) (explicitly rejecting \u201csame conduct\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">\u00b627 As we recently ruled, <em>Blockburger </em>\u201cis not dispositive of the question whether two offenses are the same. . . . Although the result of this test is presumed to be the legislature\u2019s intent, it is not controlling where there is clear evidence of contrary legislative intent.\u201d <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Percer, </em>150 Wn.2d 41, 50-51, 75 P.3d 488 (2003) (citing <em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 778, 780). At that point, we may return to other evidence of legislative intent, \u201cincluding the statutes\u2019 historical development, legislative history, location in the criminal code, or the differing purposes for which they were enacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. The process is recursive, returning to the legislature\u2019s intent again and again.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">\u00b628 Since all parties seem to agree that these crimes are not the same at law and since we are resolving these cases on other grounds, we will not take this opportunity to analyze these cases in light of <em>Blockburger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">3. <em>Do these crimes merge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">\u00b629 Another tool for determining legislative intent in the context of double jeopardy is the merger doctrine. As we have noted elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">[T]he merger doctrine is a rule of statutory construction which only applies where the Legislature has clearly indicated that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>order to prove a particular degree of crime <em>(e.g., </em>first degree rape) the State must prove not only that a defendant committed that crime <em>(e.g., </em>rape) but that the crime was accompanied by an act which is defined as a crime elsewhere in the criminal statutes <em>(e.g., </em>assault or kidnapping).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><em>Vladovic, </em>99 Wn.2d at 420-21. In both cases, to prove first degree robbery as charged and proved by the State, the State had to prove the defendants committed an assault in furtherance of the robbery. <em>Compare </em>RCW 9A.56.200 (first degree robbery) <em>with </em>RCW 9A.36.011 (first degree assault). As charged and proved, without the conduct amounting to assault, each would be guilty of only second degree robbery. <em>Compare </em>RCW 9A.56.210, .190 (defining second degree robbery) <em>with </em>RCW 9A.56.200 (defining first degree robbery). Under the merger rule, assault committed in furtherance of a robbery merges with robbery and without contrary legislative intent or application of an exception, these crimes would merge. <em>See generally </em>13 Ferguson, Jr., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4706, at 340-44. However, as noted above, we do find some evidence that the legislature specifically did not intend that first degree assault merge into first degree robbery: the hard fact that the sentence for the putatively lesser crime of assault is significantly greater than the sentence for the putatively greater crime of robbery. We find this evidence persuasive. Accordingly, we conclude the merger doctrine applies to merge Zumwalt\u2019s first degree robbery and second degree assault convictions, but not Freeman\u2019s first degree assault and robbery convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">4. <em>Did the commission of the \u201cincluded\u201d crime have an independent purpose or effect from the other crime?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjD\">\u00b630 Finally, we turn to a well established exception that may operate to allow two convictions even when they formally appear to be the same crime under other tests. These offenses may in fact be separate when there is a separate injury to the \u201cthe person or property of the victim or others, which is separate and distinct from and not merely incidental to the crime of which it forms an ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ment.\u201d <em>Frohs, </em>83 Wn. App. at 807 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>92 Wn.2d at 680). This exception is less focused on abstract legislative intent and more focused on the facts of the individual case. For example, when the defendant struck a victim <em>after </em>completing a robbery, there was a separate injury and intent justifying a separate assault conviction, especially since the assault did not forward the robbery. <em>See Prater, </em>30 Wn. App. at 516. However, this exception does not apply merely because the defendant used <em>more </em>violence than necessary to accomplish the crime. The test is not whether the defendant used the least amount of force to accomplish the crime. The test is whether the unnecessary force had a purpose or effect independent of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">\u00b631 There is no evidence in the record to support a conclusion that the violence used by Freeman to complete the robbery was \u201cgratuitous,\u201d or done to impress Freeman\u2019s friends, or had some other and independent purpose or effect. Using force to intimidate a victim into yielding property is often incidental to the robbery. <em>Prater, </em>30 Wn. App. at 516. The grievousness of the harm is not the question. <em>See Read, </em>100 Wn. App. at 791-92. While the trial court noted in his oral ruling that Freeman may have shot Pitchford to impress his friends, it was not found by the jury. Based on the crime charged and proved, Freeman shot Pitchford to facilitate the robbery. This exception would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">\u00b632 Similarly, this exception would not apply in Zumwalt\u2019s case. We are not without sympathy to the fact Zumwalt inflicted severe harm on his victim. However, the decision on what to charge is vested with the prosecutor, and the fact the violence used was excessive even in relation to the crime charged is not an appropriate basis for avoiding merger, although it may of course be considered in sentencing or in seeking an exceptional sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">\u00b633 We conclude that the legislature did intend to punish first degree assault and first degree robbery sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>rately, as the \u201clesser\u201d crime has the greater standard range sentence. We also conclude that a case by case approach is required to determine whether first degree robbery and second degree assault are the same for double jeopardy purposes. Generally, it appears that these two crimes will merge unless they have an independent purpose or effect. We affirm both divisions of the Court of Appeals and remand Zumwalt\u2019s case to the trial court for resentencing. Given our disposition, we do not reach the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Alexander, C.J.; C. Johnson, Sanders, Bridge, Owens, and Fairhurst, JJ.; and Ireland, J.
