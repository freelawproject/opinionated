This challenge requires this court to decide what constitutes the unit of prosecution for robbery. We conclude that the unit of prosecution for robbery is each taking of personal property from a person or from his or her presence against the person\u2019s will through the use or threat of force, violence, or injury to a person or property, regardless of the number of items taken. A single taking can result in a conviction on one count of robbery, regardless of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>number of persons present. Applying this definition of the unit of prosecution, Tvedt was properly convicted on four counts of robbery. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision upholding the convictions, although our analysis differs significantly.</p>\n<author id=\"Aq_X\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Madsen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\u00b62 Tvedt was charged with 12 counts of first degree robbery as a result of events occurring in September 2000. He pleaded guilty to counts I-VII and count XII. As to the remaining counts, counts VIII through XI, Tvedt \u201cstipulate [ed] to facts sufficient for a finding of guilty.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 24. He contends that his double jeopardy rights were violated by his convictions on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">f 3 According to the stipulated facts, on the morning of September 23, 2000, Tvedt entered an Exxon service station in Pierce County where two people were present, owner Monty Younce and cashier Addie Schaefer. Schaefer was behind the counter, and Younce was in the office. After Tvedt selected and brought an item to the counter, he quickly went behind the counter, pushed a knife blade into Schaefer\u2019s stomach, and then pushed her into the office. He forced Younce and Schaefer to lie face down on the floor. While brandishing the knife, Tvedt demanded money. Younce told Tvedt the only money on hand was in a deposit bag, which Tvedt stole. Tvedt then ordered Younce to give him the keys to Younce\u2019s truck, which Younce did. Tvedt left the station in the truck. The truck was later found abandoned nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u00b64 On the morning of September 25, 2000, Tvedt walked into a Texaco service station in Pierce County where store manager Jack Shepherd and assistant manager Teresa Piper were behind the counter. Shepherd was removing money from the safe. After selecting some food items, Tvedt suddenly drew a knife, went behind the counter, and stuck the knife into Shepherd\u2019s left side. He prodded Shepherd and Piper toward the back storage area, forced them to lie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>on the floor, and demanded the weekend receipts. After Piper told Tvedt the money was in a paper bag next to the safe, Tvedt stole the money and also stole Shepherd\u2019s cellular telephone. He then left the service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">\u00b65 The State charged Tvedt with four counts of first degree armed robbery based on these events. In relevant part, count VIII charged Tvedt with taking the cash from or from the presence of Younce and Schaefer. Count IX charged Tvedt with robbery based on taking Younce\u2019s truck. Count X charged Tvedt with taking cash from or from the presence of Shepherd and Piper. Count XI charged Tvedt with robbery based on taking Shepherd\u2019s cellular telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\u00b66 The trial court found Tvedt guilty on all four counts. At the sentencing hearing, Tvedt agreed that the State properly charged him with four counts of robbery but argued that only two deadly weapons enhancements were proper. The court rejected this argument, ruling that the State properly sought four weapons enhancements in connection with the Exxon and Texaco robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\u00b67 Tvedt appealed, arguing for the first time that the four convictions on counts VIII-XI violated the double jeopardy prohibition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions in a split decision. <em>State v. Tvedt, </em>116 Wn. App. 316, 65 P.3d 682 (2003). We granted discretionary review. <em>State v. Tvedt, </em>150 Wn.2d 1009 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">\u00b68 Tvedt claims that he should be convicted on only one count of robbery for his acts at each service station because he engaged in only one course of conduct at each. The State maintains that a conviction on one count of robbery is proper for each person whose will is overcome by the use or threatened use of force, i.e., each person placed in fear and from whom or from whose presence property is taken. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Neither position reflects the legislature\u2019s definition of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\u00b69 The double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. The Washington State Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be . . . twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d Const, art. I, \u00a7 9. The two clauses provide the same protection. <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, </em>142 Wn.2d 165, 171, 12 P.3d 603 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\u00b610 \u201cDouble jeopardy principles protect a defendant from being convicted more than once under the same statute if the defendant commits only one unit of the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d 607, 610, 40 P.3d 669 (2002) (citing <em>State v. Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d 629, 634, 965 P.2d 1072 (1998)). Accordingly, in order to resolve whether double jeopardy principles are violated when a defendant is convicted of multiple violations of the same statute, a court must determine what \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d the legislature intends to be the punishable act under the statute. <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 610; <em>Davis, </em>142 Wn.2d at 172; <em>State v. Tili, </em>139 Wn.2d 107, 113, 985 P.2d 365 (1999); <em>Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d at 634. The unit of prosecution for a crime may be an act or a course of conduct. <em>United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 225-26, 73 S. Ct. 227, 97 L. Ed. 260 (1952); <em>State v. Root, </em>141 Wn.2d 701, 710, 9 P.3d 214 (2000); <em>Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\u00b611 In determining legislative intent as to the unit of prosecution, we first look to the relevant statute. The meaning of a plain, unambiguous statute must be derived from the statutory language. <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 610; <em>Tili, </em>139 Wn.2d at 115. However, \u201c \u2018we are not allowed to look for an intent that reasonably could be imputed to [the legislature], nor are we permitted to construe [an] Act in a way that we believe will best accomplish evident statutory purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Keen, </em>96 F.3d 425, 433 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting <em>Brown v. United States, </em>623 F.2d 54, 59 (9th Cir. 1980)). Rather, as the Supreme Court has held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>when choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite. We should not derive criminal outlawry from some ambiguous implication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\"><em>Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. at 221-22. Therefore, if the legislature fails to define the unit of prosecution or its intent is unclear, under the rule of lenity any ambiguity must be \u201c \u2018resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d at 635 (quoting <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 84, 75 S. Ct. 620, 99 L. Ed. 905 (1955)).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\u00b612 RCW 9A.56.190 provides that \u201c[a] person commits robbery when he unlawfully takes personal property from the person of another or in his presence against his will by the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person or his property or the person or property of anyone.\u201d Under the plain language of the statute, the crime of robbery requires that there be a taking of property and that the taking be forcible and against the will of the person from whom or from whose presence the property is taken. By describing the crime of robbery as it did, the legislature established an offense which is dual in nature\u2014robbery is a property crime and a crime against the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\u00b613 There are several indications that the legislature intended that the unit of prosecution include both characteristics. Initially, the language of the statute clearly shows that the legislature was concerned with the offense as a property crime, as noted. Additionally, RCW 9A.56.190 requires a taking that must be accomplished \u201cby the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person or his <em>property </em>or the person or <em>property </em>of anyone.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not merely provide that the force must be directed at a person. It also provides that the use or threat of force, violence, or fear of injury may be directed to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u00b614 Moreover, the legislature classified robbery with other property offenses. Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, at 841, 846 (RCW 9A.56.200). Offenses included in the chapter, as codified in 1975, are theft, unlawful issuance of checks, taking motor vehicle without permission, theft of livestock, theft presumed from the failure to return leased items, extortion, possession of stolen property, obscuring the identity of a machine, and robbery. Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, RCW 9A.56.010-.210. The legislature classified robbery with property crimes, indicating a focus on the nature of robbery offenses as crimes against property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\u00b615 But it is equally apparent that the legislature intended that the unit of prosecution for robbery encompass its character as a crime against the person. The plain language of RCW 9A.56.190 shows that the legislature was concerned with the risks that actual and threatened force, violence, and injury entail, and with the nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct in achieving a taking. A forcible taking must occur, against the will of the person from whom or from whose presence the property is taken. The legislature thus clearly also described a crime against persons as well as against property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\u00b616 The language of RCW 9A.56.190 shows that the legislature\u2019s intent was to define the unit of prosecution in terms of a taking of personal property <em>and </em>in terms of an offense against the person from whom or in whose presence and against whose will the property is forcibly taken. The unit of prosecution need not be defined by only a single characteristic or element of a crime and the legislature has not done so. For example, in <em>Westling </em>we addressed the unit of prosecution for second degree arson damaging automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>biles and other motor vehicles. We noted that RCW 9A.48.030(1) refers, in relevant part, to the causing of <em>\u201ca </em>fire\u201d that damages \u201cany automobile.\u201d <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 611. Because \u201c \u2018any\u2019 means \u2018every\u2019 and \u2018all,\u2019 \u201d we concluded that one conviction is appropriate where one fire damages one or more automobiles, i.e., by use of the word \u201cany,\u201d the statute speaks in terms of \u201cevery\u201d and \u201call\u201d automobiles damaged by the one fire. <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 611-12 (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>117 Wn.2d 263, 271, 814 P.2d 652 (1991)). Thus, both (1) the causing of \u201ca\u201d fire and (2) the damaging of property, whether one item or more than one, define the unit of prosecution. <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 611-12. Similarly, in <em>Root, </em>141 Wn.2d 701, we held that the unit of prosecution for sexual exploitation of a minor under RCW 9.68A.040 is (1) each photo session (2) per minor involved in each session. Similar to the analyses in <em>Westling </em>and <em>Root, </em>we conclude that the unit of prosecution in this case entails more than a single characteristic of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\u00b617 In any event, even if we believed that the unit of prosecution must be identified by a single factor, we could not choose one or the other in this case, given the language of the statute and its placement in the criminal code. Thus, if it were necessary to identify one and only one aspect of a crime as the unit of prosecution, we would be compelled to apply the rule of lenity in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u00b618 Further, we do not agree with Tvedt that the unit of prosecution for robbery is a course of conduct. By defining the offense in terms of a forcible taking of property from or from the presence of another, the legislature intended that one can be convicted of robbery for each forcible taking from a separate person. We implicitly recognized this intent when we sustained convictions on two counts of robbery in <em>State v. Rupe, </em>101 Wn.2d 664, 693, 683 P.2d 571 (1984) on the ground that the defendant took cash from the tills of each of two tellers, each of whom was individually responsible for the money in her till and had control and possession of that money.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u00b619 We also do not agree with Tvedt\u2019s assertion that the Court of Appeals defined the unit of prosecution to mean that multiple convictions for robbery may be sustained based on the number of items of property taken from or from the presence of one person\u2014for example, three convictions of robbery if a watch, wallet, and ring are taken at the same time from the same person. Tvedt mischaracterizes the court\u2019s holding. The Court of Appeals properly rejected the premise that the number of robberies can be based merely on the number of items taken. <em>Tvedt, </em>116 Wn. App. at 321-22. The robbery statute does not support the premise that the number of items taken establishes the number of convictions that may be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\u00b620 Nor do we agree with the State\u2019s argument that the unit of prosecution is defined by the number of persons placed in fear. Nearly a century ago this court held that a conviction for robbery requires that the person from whom or in whose presence the property is taken have an ownership or representative interest in the property or have dominion and control over it. <em>State v. Hall, </em>54 Wash. 142, 143-44, 102 P. 888 (1909). The court rejected the argument that a conviction could be upheld where \u201ctitle was not alleged in the person robbed, nor is any connection shown or alleged between the person robbed and the property taken.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>54 Wash, at 143. The robbery statute then in effect was in relevant part essentially the same as the present statute. <em>Compare </em>Code of 1881, \u00a7 829 <em>with </em>RCW 9A.56.190.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in order for a robbery to occur, the person from whom or from whose presence the property is taken must have an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the property. <em>Hall, </em>54 Wash, at 143-44; <em>see also State v. Latham, </em>35 Wn. App. 862, 864-66, 670 P.2d 689 (1983); <em>see, e.g., Rupe, </em>101 Wn.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\u00b621 Accordingly, the unit of prosecution for robbery is each separate forcible taking of property from or from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>presence of a person having an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the property, against that person\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\u00b622 We next turn to the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that where a business\u2019s property is taken from or from the presence of multiple employees having joint control over the property, a conviction on a count of robbery may be sustained for each employee. In reaching this conclusion, Division Two of the Court of Appeals disagreed with Division One\u2019s constructions of the robbery statute in <em>State v. Molina, </em>83 Wn. App. 144, 920 P.2d 1228 (1996) and <em>State v. Johnson, </em>48 Wn. App. 531, 740 P.2d 337 (1987). In <em>Molina, </em>the court held that taking property from one cash register in the presence of two employees constituted only one robbery. In <em>Johnson, </em>the court held that only one robbery occurred where the defendant took property from the presence of two clerks in a store.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u00b623 Initially, we note that the Court of Appeals upheld the convictions from the Exxon station robberies based on the taking of cash from the presence of an employee and the taking of the truck keys from the owner, and upheld the convictions from the Texaco station robberies based on the taking of cash from the presence of one employee and the taking of the cell phone from the other. However, Division Two of the Court of Appeals went out of its way in this case to expressly disagree with Division One\u2019s construction of the robbery statute, and we accordingly address the matter to avoid possible confusion resulting from the divergence of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">\u00b624 It should be apparent, from our analysis of the unit of prosecution for robbery, that the analysis in <em>Molina </em>and <em>Johnson </em>best carries out the legislature\u2019s intent. The unit of prosecution is defined both by the taking of <em>property </em>and that the forcible taking be from or from the presence of a <em>person </em>against his or her will. If there is one taking of property, as the taking of the business\u2019s receipts from a single business safe or a single cash register, there can be a conviction for robbery on only one count, regardless of the</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>number of employees present who have authority over the property, because there has been only one taking. If, however, there is more than one taking from more than one person, multiple convictions may result. For example, as explained, in <em>Rupe </em>we held that two convictions for robbery were proper where each teller had dominion and control over her separate till. And in <em>State v. Turner, </em>31 Wn. App. 843, 846-47, 644 P.2d 1224 (1982), the court determined that convictions for two robberies were proper where the defendant took separate items of property from separate persons at their home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court in <em>Molina </em>and <em>Johnson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>correctly construed the robbery statute. Counts may not be multiplied based simply on the number of employees who have authority or control over the property and who are present during the taking.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u00b625 Once the unit of prosecution is determined, a factual analysis is necessary to decide whether, under the facts of the case, more than one unit of prosecution is present. <em>State v. Bobic, </em>140 Wn.2d 250, 266, 996 P.2d 610 (2000). Multiple convictions are proper only where the facts of the case support multiple units of prosecution committed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">\u00b626 To determine whether four convictions on four counts of robbery are proper in this case, we must first address a second issue in this case\u2014the effect of the charging document on the number of robbery convictions that can be upheld. The Court of Appeals requested supplemental briefing on this question. Although the Court of Appeals\u2019 majority opinion does not address the issue as a separate matter, the dissent concluded that convictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>four counts of robbery cannot be sustained because of the manner in which the State charged the offenses. <em>Tvedt, </em>116 Wn. App. at 325 (Armstrong, J., dissenting). The dissent observed that the State charged Tvedt with taking the cash from both persons, collectively, at each service station, and also charged him with taking an item of personal property at each station from one of the individuals. Because a conviction for robbery does not turn on the number of items taken from a victim, and Tvedt \u201csimply took more property from one of the same victims still under threat of force,\u201d the dissent reasoned, only one robbery occurred at each station. <em>Tvedt, </em>116 Wn. App. at 325-26 (Armstrong, J., dissenting). Tvedt urges us to follow this analysis. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">\u00b627 An information must state all the essential statutory and nonstatutory elements of the crimes charged. U.S. Const., amend. VI; Const. art. I, \u00a7 22; CrR 2.1(a)(1); <em>State v. McCarty, </em>140 Wn.2d 420, 424-25, 998 P.2d 296 (2000). However, surplus language in a charging document may be disregarded. <em>See State v. Stritmatter, </em>102 Wn.2d 516, 523-24, 688 P.2d 499 (1984); <em>State v. Worsham, </em>154 Wash. 575, 283 P. 167 (1929). That is, where unnecessary language is included in an information, the surplus language is not an element of the crime that must be proved unless it is repeated in the jury instructions. <em>State v. Miller, </em>71 Wn.2d 143, 146, 426 P.2d 986 (1967); <em>State v. Welding, </em>60 Wn. App. 184, 187 n.3, 803 P.2d 17 (1991); <em>State v. Rivas, </em>49 Wn. App. 677, 682-83, 746 P.2d 312 (1987); <em>State v. McGary, </em>37 Wn. App. 856, 859-60, 683 P.2d 1125 (1984). Nor is the information insufficient as a charging document if the defendant is not prejudiced by the inclusion of the unnecessary language. <em>Stritmatter, </em>102 Wn.2d at 524; RCW 10.37.056.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\u00b628 Here, to charge robbery the State had to allege, among other things, that property was taken from or from the presence of a person having an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the property. The State charged in count VIII that Tvedt took the business\u2019s cash from or from the presence of Younce and Schaefer, and in count X charged Tvedt with taking cash from or from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>presence of Shepherd and Piper. However, the State did not need to name every person who was present and placed in fear where only a single taking of property occurred. Thus, although counts VIII and X each charge robbery based on taking the business\u2019s cash from or from the presence of two named persons, identifying the persons robbed as Schaefer and Piper was sufficient to state the elements of the offenses charged. The name of Younce in count VIII and the name of Shepherd in count X may be disregarded as surplusage. The information then charges Tvedt with one count of robbery for taking cash from or from the presence of Schaefer at the Exxon service station, one count for taking Younce\u2019s truck, one count for taking cash from or from the presence of Piper, and one count for taking Shepherd\u2019s cellular telephone. The case was tried on stipulated facts to the court, and there were no jury instructions repeating the unnecessary allegations. Accordingly, this is not a case where the State had to prove the surplus facts included in the information and thus did not have to prove a robbery of each of the persons named in counts VIII and X or to prove a robbery of both collectively. <em>See McGary, </em>37 Wn. App. at 860. This is also not a case where the information is defective on the grounds of prejudice to the defendant resulting from the surplusage; Tvedt could not show prejudice given that he stipulated to the events that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\u00b629 Applying the appropriate unit of prosecution, Tvedt was properly charged with and convicted of four counts of robbery. At the Exxon station he forcibly took the cash from the presence of Schaefer, the cashier, against her will. He also forcibly took the truck keys from or from the presence of Younce, the owner, against his will. At the Texaco station Tvedt forcibly took cash from the presence of Piper, the assistant manager, against her will, and forcibly took Shepherd\u2019s cell phone against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">\u00b630 The legislature has defined the crime of robbery as both a crime against property and a crime against the person. The unit of prosecution must encompass both a taking of property and a forcible taking against the will of the person from whom or from whose presence the property is taken. Accordingly, a conviction on one count of robbery may result from each separate taking of property from each person; however, multiple counts may not be based on multiple items of property taken from the same person at the same time, nor may multiple counts be based on a single taking of property from or from the presence of multiple persons even if each has an interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\u00b631 We affirm Tvedt\u2019s four convictions for first degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Alexander, C.J., and C. Johnson, Sanders, and Fairhurst, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\"> A defendant may raise for the first time on appeal a claim that his double jeopardy rights were violated. <em>State v. Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d 629, 631-32, 965 P.2d 1072 (1998). There is no allegation here that Tvedt waived his double jeopardy rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Since 1975 additional property crimes have been added. <em>See </em>RCW 9A.56.230 -.310. Importantly, the legislature, not the code reviser, placed robbery in chapter 9A.56 RCW. <em>See </em>Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, at 841, 846. The legislature\u2019s placement of an offense within the criminal code is evidence of legislative intent. <em>See In re Pers. Restraint of Percer, </em>150 Wn.2d 41, 51-52, 75 P.3d 488 (2003) (when determining legislative intent as to whether two offenses were the same for double jeopardy purposes, the court looked to the location of the offenses in the criminal code); <em>State v. Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d 769, 780, 888 P.2d 155 (1995) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> The Code of 1881, \u00a7 829 provided: \u201cEvery person who shall forcibly and feloniously take from the person of another, or from his immediate presence, any article of value by violence or putting in fear, shall be deemed guilty of robbery.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\"> We also note that under the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis, sentences for multiple convictions of robbery could result that are disproportionate to the conduct committed. In <em>Ladner v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 79 S. Ct. 209, 3 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1958), the United States Supreme Court reversed one of two convictions for assault on a federal officer where the defendant fired a shotgun and injured two officers. The Government had argued that there were as many assaults as there were officers affected. The Court observed that under the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">[pjunishments totally disproportionate to the act of assault could be imposed [under that theory] because it will often be the case that the number of officers affected will have little bearing upon the seriousness of the criminal act. For an assault is ordinarily held to be committed merely by putting another in apprehension of harm whether or not the actor actually intends to inflict or is capable of inflicting that harm. Thus, under the meaning for which the Government contends, one who shoots and seriously wounds an officer would commit one offense punishable by 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, but if he points a gun at five officers, putting all of them in apprehension of harm, he would commit five offenses punishable by 50 years\u2019 imprisonment, even though he does not fire the gun and no officer actually suffers injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\"><em>Ladner, </em>358 U.S. at 177 (footnote omitted). The Court did not find congressional intent for this result in the materials before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Similar \u201cincongruous results,\u201d <em>Ladner, </em>358 U.S. at 177, could result under the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis. If a defendant with no prior offenses enters a restaurant after hours, orders five employees to lie on the floor at gunpoint and takes only money from a single cash register over which all of the employees share control, he could be convicted on five counts of robbery in the first degree. <em>See </em>RCW 9A.56.200. His standard range sentence for each offense would be 108-144 months or 9 to 12 years. RCW 9.94A.510, .525. (Absent aggravators, the sentences would run concurrently. RCW 9.94A.589(1). No firearm enhancements are included in these examples.) If, however, several employees have already gone home and only one employee remains who is forced at gunpoint to lie on the floor, the defendant could be convicted on only one count of first degree robbery. The defendant\u2019s standard range sentence would be 31-41 months. RCW 9.94A.510, .525. There is no difference in the defendant\u2019s conduct, using a firearm to force employees to lie on the floor, and no difference in the taking or the intent to take the money belonging to the restaurant. There is a considerable disparity, however, in the standard range sentences, based only on the number of employees who happen to be present. Given the significantly harsher result based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>number of persons present, there must be clear indications of legislative intent for such a result, and there are none.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The dissent maintains that a defendant who places a greater number of employees in fear of their lives would be insufficiently punished under the unit of prosecution we recognize. Dissent at 729-30. Nothing in our decision forecloses the State from charging other appropriate crimes, such as assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\"> We recognize, as the State points out, that there is a split of authority from other states regarding whether multiple robbery convictions may be upheld where a business\u2019s property is taken from the presence of more than one employee, each of whom has authority over, or dominion and control of, the property. Some courts conclude that robbery is primarily a crime against persons, and multiple convictions may result where more than one employee is present when the taking occurs. <em>E.g., People v. Borghesi, </em>66 P.3d 93 (Colo. 2003) (convictions on two counts of robbery upheld where cash was taken from two store clerks at a single cash register; a robber may be convicted of more than one count of robbery for a single taking of property from more than one person). Other courts conclude that although the crime involves a forcible taking, one taking will result in only one conviction, regardless of the number of employees present. <em>E.g., Wheat v. State, </em>297 Ark. 502, 503, 763 S.W.2d 79 (1989) (the defendant, while armed with a pistol, forced two clerks to lie on the floor while the pharmacist gathered property of the pharmacy; the court noted that while the focus of aggravated robbery is the threat of physical harm to the victim, only one robbery conviction can result where the defendant did not take or intend to take property individually from each person); <em>State v. Faatea, </em>65 Haw. 156, 648 P.2d 197 (1982) (five employees ordered at gunpoint to lie on the floor and threatened with having their heads \u201cblown off\u201d while defendant and another took hotel\u2019s money; four of defendant\u2019s five convictions for robbery reversed).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">\u00b632 (concurring) \u2014 I concur with the result the majority reaches in this case, affirming the Court of Appeals holding that Ronald Tvedt\u2019s double jeopardy rights were not violated when he was convicted of four counts of first degree robbery in connection with robberies of two commercial establishments where two employees were present at each location. I agree, based on <em>State v. Rupe, </em>101 Wn.2d 664, 693, 683 P.2d 571 (1984), that the State properly charged Tvedt with four counts of robbery for (1) the taking of the Exxon station\u2019s cash from Addie Schaefer, (2) the taking of Monty Younce\u2019s truck keys, (3) the taking of the Texaco station\u2019s cash form Teresa Piper, and (4) the taking of Jack Shepherd\u2019s cell phone. <em>See </em>majority at 719. However, I write separately because I believe that the proper unit of prosecution for robbery, as defined by our legislature, permits a separate count for each victim against whom a defendant uses or threatens force to accomplish the taking of property against the victim\u2019s will, from the victim\u2019s person, or in his or her presence, provided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>victim has an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the property taken.</p>\n<author id=\"Age\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Bridge, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Unit of Prosecution for Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\u00b633 The majority concludes that the legislature intended the unit of prosecution to \u201cencompass <em>both </em>a taking of property and a forcible taking against the will of the person from whom or from whose presence the property is taken,\u201d yet it further sets forth its conclusion that multiple counts may <em>not </em>be based on \u201ca single taking of property from or from the presence of multiple persons even if each has an interest in the property.\u201d Majority at 720 (emphasis added). It is this secondary assertion with which I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\u00b634 When defendants challenge multiple convictions for violations of a single statute, the question to be asked \u201cis what \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 has the Legislature intended as the punishable act under the specific criminal statute.\u201d <em>State v. Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d 629, 634, 965 P.2d 1072 (1998) (citing <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 83, 75 S. Ct. 620, 99 L. Ed. 905 (1955)). To determine the unit of prosecution, we look to the plain language of the statute. <em>State v. Tili, </em>139 Wn.2d 107, 113, 985 P.2d 365 (1999) (citing <em>Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d at 635). The Washington criminal code sets forth the definition of robbery: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>RCW 9A.56.190. RCW 9A.56.200 and .210 then go on to define first and second degree robbery respectively.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>A person commits robbery when he unlawfully takes personal property from the person of another or in his presence against his will by the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person or his property or the person or property of anyone. Such force or fear must be used to obtain or retain possession of the property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking; in either of which cases the degree of force is immaterial. Such taking constitutes robbery whenever it appears that, although the taking was fully completed without the knowledge of the person from whom taken, such knowledge was prevented by the use of force or fear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>\u00b635 As the majority notes, RCW 9A.56.190 establishes the crime of robbery as one which is dual in nature. <em>See </em>majority at 711. That is, the statute criminalizes a robber\u2019s taking of property and a robber\u2019s use of force against persons. <em>See </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 8.11, at 437 &amp; n.3 (1986) (noting that robbery is an offense against both persons and property, however with the \u201cmodern trend ... to consider [it] as an offense against the person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\u00b636 Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion however, RCW 9A.56.190\u2019s plain language evidences that the legislature principally intended to criminalize the robber\u2019s use or threatened use of force against individuals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>2 LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 437 n.3; <em>see also </em>77 C.J.S. <em>Robbery </em>\u00a7 2 (1994) (\u201cWhile [robbery] can be characterized as an offense against both person and property, robbery is held to be primarily an offense against the person.\u201d). Our legislature unambiguously set forth this intent through its definition of robbery in our criminal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\u00b637 First, the statutory composition of our robbery statutes evinces the legislature\u2019s codification of this crime as one committed against a person. Notably, RCW 9A.56.190, RCW 9A.56.200 (first degree robbery), and RCW 9A.56.210 (second degree robbery) ignore the type, value, and number of items taken by the robber. Rather, the principal differences between first and second degree robbery are the type of weapon, if any, employed by the robber and whether the robber inflicts bodily injury on his victim. RCW 9A.56.200, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>.210. This clearly demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent to punish robbers who inflict greater injury and/or pose additional physical threats <em>to victims </em>by brandishing a deadly weapon rather than to punish based on the number and/or value of the items taken by the robber.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor did the legislature adopt a hybrid analysis, taking into consideration both the type and degree of force used and the value of the property taken. Rather, it was <em>solely </em>concerned with the degree of injury and/or threat of physical violence against the person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>RCW 9A.56.190-.210.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\u00b638 Second, the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cthe person of another or in his presence\u201d in RCW 9A.56.190 provides further indication of its predominant intent to protect <em>individuals </em>from robbers\u2019 use of violence. By stating \u201cthe person of another or in his presence,\u201d the legislature refers to victims \u201cin the singular.\u201d <em>See People v. Borghesi, </em>66 P.3d 93, 98 (Colo. 2003). This signals with precision the legislature\u2019s intent to permit the State to charge robbers with a separate count of robbery for each <em>individual victim </em>against whom a robber uses or threatens force. Other jurisdictions have held similarly. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Rozplochi, </em>385 Pa. Super. 357, 364, 561 A.2d 25 (1989) (defendant could be convicted of two robberies for threatening two people during a single theft because the state statute \u201cwas written with regard to an <em>individual person </em>being placed in danger . . . and that a separate offense is committed for each individual person placed in such danger\u201d); <em>see also Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 590, 595, 347 S.E.2d 152 (1986) (\u201cThe statute refers to the victim in the singular and suggests that the General Assembly\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>primary purpose was the protection of an individual from violence and fear of harm during a robbery.\u201d). We should likewise recognize this clear indication of legislative intent. <em>See State v. Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d 607, 610, 40 P.3d 669 (2002) (\u201cThe meaning of a plain, unambiguous statute must be derived from the language in the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\u00b639 Here, the plain language in RCW 9A.56.190 unambiguously declares the legislature\u2019s intent to permit the State to charge a count of robbery for each victim against whom a defendant uses or threatens force to accomplish the taking of personal property against the victim\u2019s will from the victim\u2019s person or in his presence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, as we have previously held, the \u201ctaking of personal property\u201d under the robbery statute is satisfied when (1) the stolen property was under the victim\u2019s possession and control, (2) the victim acts in a representative capacity over the property, or (3) the victim has an ownership interest in the property. <em>Rupe, </em>101 Wn.2d at 693; <em>State v. Latham, </em>35 Wn. App. 862, 865, 670 P.2d 689 (1983) (\u201cThe deprivation of any ownership interest, including an undivided share, in the property taken, will support a robbery conviction. Also, \u2018[a] taking from one having the care, custody, control, management, or possession of the property is sufficient.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (citation omitted) (quoting 67 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Robbery </em>\u00a7 14, at 38-39 (1973)). I would thus hold here, in accord with the numerous other jurisdictions that have similarly held,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that in the event a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>defendant takes property by the use of or threat of force from the person or presence of multiple victims against their will, and the victims enjoy a joint ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the stolen property, a defendant may be convicted of counts of robbery equal to the number of victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u00b640 A careful examination of the facts of this case reveals the correctness of this interpretation. Recounting the facts as set forth by the majority: \u201con the morning of September 23, 2000, Tvedt entered an Exxon service station in Pierce County where two people were present, owner Monty Younce and cashier Addie Schaefer.... [Tvedt] quickly went behind the counter [and] pushed a knife blade into <em>Schaefer\u2019s </em>stomach.\u201d Majority at 708 (emphasis added). Tvedt then \u201cforced Younce <em>and </em>Schaefer to lie face down on the floor [and] [w]hile brandishing the knife, Tvedt demanded money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Younce, </em>under threat of the knife, instructed him where it was located. <em>Id. </em>Both Younce and Schaefer possessed an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the property taken. It is clear that both Younce <em>and </em>Schaefer were individually victims of Tvedt\u2019s robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u00b641 Next, two days later, Tvedt walked into a Texaco service station \u201cwhere store manager Jack Shepherd and assistant manager Teresa Piper were behind the counter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTvedt suddenly drew a knife . . . and stuck the knife into <em>Shepherd\u2019s </em>left side.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). He then prodded <em>both </em>\u201cShepherd and Piper toward the back storage area, forced them to lie on the floor, and demanded the weekend receipts\u201d and <em>Piper, </em>under duress, told Tvedt where the money was located. <em>Id. </em>at 708-09. Both Shepherd and Piper possessed an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the property taken. Again, both Shepherd <em>and </em>Piper were individually victims of Tvedt\u2019s robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\u00b642 The majority\u2019s reasoning ignores the common understanding that <em>things </em>get stolen while <em>people </em>get robbed. Younce, Schaefer, Shepherd, and Piper were all victimized by Tvedt when he \u201cunlawfully [took] personal property\u201d from their person or in their presence, over which they had an ownership, representative, or possessory interest, \u201cagainst [their] will by the use or threatened use of imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>diate force, violence, or fear of injury to <em>that </em>person.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> RCW 9A.56.190 (emphasis added). The majority\u2019s interpretation erroneously circumscribes the legislature\u2019s intent behind the robbery statute in the context of multiple victims and business establishments. The majority seemingly posits that the Texaco and Exxon stations were robbed, not the employees who worked there and were placed in fear of their lives. I do not agree that this is the crime the legislature defined or intended, and I thus cannot concur with the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Flaws in Majority\u2019s Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u00b643 The majority bases its conclusion regarding the proper unit of prosecution, in part, on the placement of robbery in our current criminal code, the rationale employed by Division One in prior factually analogous cases, and finally a policy rationale based on the potential ramifications for criminal defendants convicted under the unit of prosecution proffered by Division Two below. I address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\u00b644 <em>Placement of Robbery in Criminal </em>Code: In support of its conclusion, the majority finds that the legislature\u2019s classification of robbery in the chapter entitled \u201cTheft and Robbery,\u201d suggests that the legislature has \u201cindicated] a focus on the nature of robbery offenses as crimes against property.\u201d Majority at 712. This placement is not compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent. First, by our jurisprudence, the chapter title does not express legislative intent and, with respect to the crime of robbery, the legislature clearly indicated the same in the 1975 revisions to the criminal code. <em>See </em>Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, \u00a7 9A.04.010 (\u201cChapter, section, and subsection captions are for organizational purposes only and shall not be construed as part of this title.\u201d), <em>codified at </em>RCW 9A.04.010(5). Second, the majority itself notes that our legislature\u2019s definition of the crime of robbery has not been meaningfully amended since at least as far back as 1881. <em>See </em>majority at 714 <em>(comparing </em>Code of 1881, \u00a7 829 <em>with </em>RCW 9A.56.190). Moreover, it is insightful to compare today\u2019s definition with that enacted by the legislature in 1909, which set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">Robbery is the unlawful taking of personal property from the person of another, or in his presence, against his will, by means of force or violence or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his person or property, or the person or property of a member of his family, or of anyone in his company at the time of the robbery. Such force or fear must be used to obtain or retain possession of the property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Former RCW 9.75.010 (Laws of 1909, ch. 249, \u00a7 166). Wordsmithing aside, the legislature\u2019s 1909 definition was <em>exactly </em>the same as that which exists today. Compare RCW 9A.56.190. Unlike the 1975 revisions, in 1909 our legislature further indicated, in the session law, specific categorical groupings under which it classified crimes. Unlike ordinary \u201cLarceny\u201d (Laws of 1909, ch. 249, \u00a7 349, at 997), which was set out under the chapter heading \u201cCrimes Against Property. Crimes Against State Property.\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 986), the legislature purposefully placed \u201cRobbery\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 166, at 938) under the chapter heading \u201cCrimes Against the Person. Suicide.\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 929), adjacent to \u201cAssault\u201d and \u201cDuels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 161-65, 167-70. As the legislature has not meaningfully amended its <em>definition </em>of robbery since 1909, there is no reason to infer that it no longer thinks of the crime as one primarily \u201cagainst the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u00b645 The majority further contends that this court\u2019s decisions in <em>In re Personal Restraint of Percer, </em>150 Wn.2d 41, 51-52, 75 P.3d 488 (2003) and <em>State v. Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d 769, 780, 888 P.2d 155 (1995) support the proposition that this court has looked to the legislature\u2019s placement of an offense within the criminal codes as evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See </em>majority at 712 n.2. This claim is not persuasive in the context of the present issue before the court. Both <em>Percer </em>and <em>Calle </em>concerned whether <em>two </em>different statutory crimes were the \u201csame offense.\u201d <em>See Percer, </em>150 Wn.2d at 48-49 (second degree felony murder and vehicular homicide); <em>Calle, </em>125 Wn.2d at 778 (first degree incest and second degree rape). Consequently, it was logical to rely on the legislature\u2019s placement of the <em>two </em>crimes in the criminal code to determine whether the legislature intended to authorize multiple punishments for those offenses. <em>Percer </em>and <em>Calle </em>are not instructive in the context of a single crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u00b646 <em>Division One\u2019s Analysis in </em>Molina <em>and </em>Johnson: The majority concludes that Division One\u2019s analysis in <em>State v. Molina, </em>83 Wn. App. 144, 920 P.2d 1228 (1996) and <em>State v. Johnson, </em>48 Wn. App. 531, 740 P.2d 337 (1987) \u201cbest carries out the legislature\u2019s intent\u201d and is instructive in this context. Majority at 715. I disagree. Division One did not examine RCW 9A.56.190 to determine the legislature\u2019s intended unit of prosecution for robbery in either <em>Molina </em>or <em>Johnson. </em>Rather, it applied the then-accepted \u201csame evidence\u201d test to reach its conclusions. <em>Molina, </em>83 Wn. App. at 146-47; <em>Johnson, </em>48 Wn. App. at 535. Because this court has since adopted the \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d analysis for cases where a defendant claims his double jeopardy rights were violated when the State charges him with several violations of a single statute, Division One\u2019s rationale seems no longer viable. Contrary to Division One\u2019s analysis, this court has rejected use of the \u201csame evidence test\u201d in this context and established that the \u201cproper inquiry ... is what <em>\u2018unit of </em>prosecution\u2019 has the Legislature intended as the punishable act under the specific criminal statute.\u201d <em>Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d at 634 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>\u00b647 <em>Resulting Effect of Unit of Prosecution: </em>Finally, the majority claims that the unit of prosecution approved by Division Two here, which I would affirm, would lead to \u201c \u2018incongruous results.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 716 n.4 (quoting <em>Ladner v. United States, 358 </em>U.S. 169, 177, 79 S. Ct. 209, 3 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1958)). The majority reasons that a \u201cconsiderable disparity\u201d would exist in instances where a defendant orders five employees in a restaurant to lie on the floor at gunpoint while he takes money from a register under the joint control of all five employees, in comparison to cases where a defendant enters a restaurant with only one employee present and takes money from the same register. <em>Id. </em>The majority mistakenly and with apparent disregard of the victims of robbery crimes concludes that \u201c[t]here is no difference in the defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d <em>id, </em>choosing to ignore the fact that the defendant in the first scenario has, by his intentional act, chosen to place five people in fear of their lives.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is not \u201cincongruous\u201d to punish this defendant more harshly where he intended to place the lives of a greater number of employees in jeopardy in order to take the cash from a register for which they were all jointly responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u00b648 Accordingly, I would hold that in the event a defendant takes property by the use of or threat of force from the person or presence of multiple victims against their will, and the victims enjoy a joint ownership, representative, or possessory interest in the stolen property, a defendant may be convicted of counts of robbery equal to the number of victims. I believe this is the unit of prosecution the legislature intended in enacting RCW 9A.56.190- .210. I would thus affirm the Court of Appeals conclusion that Tvedt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>could be convicted of four counts of robbery in connection with his robberies of two commercial establishments each with two employees who both enjoyed a representative interest in the cash taken by Tvedt. <em>See State v.

The legislature required that a robber\u2019s use of force be used to accomplish the <em>\u201ctaking of personal property from </em>the person of another or in his presence <em>against his will.\u201d </em>RCW 9A.56.190 (emphasis added).

Thus the proper unit of prosecution does not include counts pertaining simply to bystanders who are nevertheless placed in fear by the robber\u2019s actions. Rather, a robber\u2019s use or threatened use of force against an individual must be coupled with the taking of that individual\u2019s property, including property over which he has an ownership, representative, or possessory interest, from that individual or in his presence against his will. <em>See </em>RCW 9A.56.190; <em>see also Rupe, </em>101 Wn.2d at 693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> <em>See Borghesi, </em>66 P.3d at 103 (\u201cBecause the common property taken from the second clerk was also taken from the presence of another\u2014the first clerk\u2014the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>robber\u2019s acts constitute different offenses as to each victim.\u201d); <em>Facon v.
