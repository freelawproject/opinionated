VanDerbeek appeals the decision of the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) Disciplinary Board (Board) to impose a two-year suspension for her billing and collection practices in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC). VanDerbeek principally asserts that the hearing officer and Board wrongfully determined that disbarment was the presumptive sanction and that they failed to properly weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. The WSBA supports the hearing officer\u2019s and Board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law but argues that VanDerbeek should be disbarred. We affirm the hearing officer\u2019s and Board\u2019s conclusions in substantial part but agree with the WSBA that disbarment is the proper sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b62 VanDerbeek graduated from law school in 1981. In 1986, she opened a solo practice in family law. Her husband, John VanDerbeek, managed her practice\u2019s bookkeeping and accounting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> VanDerbeek\u2019s practice grew dramatically in the early 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b63 In 1995, 28 former clients sued the VanDerbeeks for charging excessive fees. VanDerbeek signed a declaration in June 1996 informing plaintiffs that she was \u201cin the process\u201d of changing her billing software to remedy client complaints about her billing practices. The case settled in 1996, but VanDerbeek did not change her billing software until May 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b64 In response to grievances from these plaintiffs and other former clients, the WSBA instituted an investigation of VanDerbeek\u2019s billing practices. The WSBA consolidated these grievances and initiated the disciplinary action at issue here alleging, in relevant part, that in count I, VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a), 8.4(b), and 8.4(c) by inflating clients\u2019 bills; in count IV, VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(c) by billing clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with her attempts to collect outstanding fees; in count V, VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) by filing attorney liens on the proceeds of clients\u2019 real property sales and billing clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with filing such liens; in count VI, VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.4(b) and 1.5(b) when she refused to provide clients with itemized bills; in count VII, VanDerbeek violated RPC 8.4(c) when she intentionally misrepresented the capabilities of her billing software; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>count IX, VanDerbeek violated RPC 3.3(a)(1) by making a misrepresentation to the court about her intention to promptly change her billing practices; in count X, VanDerbeek violated RPC 5.3(a)-(c) and 8.4(a) by failing to properly supervise her employees and take action to rectify their billing misconduct; and, in count XI, VanDerbeek is unfit to practice law. <em>See </em>WSBA\u2019s Second Am. Formal Compl. at 4-22 (Aug. 23, 2002). Counts I, IV, and V are at issue here; neither party disputes the hearing officer\u2019s and Board\u2019s conclusions on counts VI, VII, IX, X, and XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Count I</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">f 5 In count I, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a), 8.4(b) (theft in the first degree in violation of RCW 9A.56.020), and 8.4(c) by charging 31 clients with \u201cexcessive and/or unreasonable fees by billing. . . for services that were not performed and/or inflating the amount of time that was spent on a service, and/or billing a client at attorney rates for legal assistant work and/or billing for overhead and secretarial work.\u201d R. at 11, Findings of Fact (FOF) 43. The hearing officer dismissed allegations of excessive billing by 17 of VanDerbeek\u2019s clients, but grievances filed by 14 clients remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b66 After considering testimony from experts on both sides\u2014VanDerbeek, clients, and clients\u2019 billing statements\u2014the hearing officer sustained charges that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) by intentionally charging excessive and unreasonable fees to 11 clients: Vicki Gould, Denise DeBoer, Michelle Drake (Forkner), Andria Kennoy, Sharyn Langston, Rita Gibbons, Janice Erdman, Rene Wiswall (Roberts), Diana Aumack, Angela Hirschbeel, and Charlene Daniels.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the hearing officer also concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that the WSBA had failed to prove that VanDerbeek charged June Roetemeyer, Dori Viltz, and Monti Darnall excessive fees. Lastly, she concluded that the WSBA failed to demonstrate by a clear preponderance of the evidence that VanDerbeek violated RPC 8.4(b) (theft in the first degree) or 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Count TV</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b67 In count IV, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(c) when she billed Daniel Breard, Charlene Daniels, Denise DeBoer, Michelle Drake (Forkner), Denise Gaffney, Rita Gibbons, and Susan Morris for her attorney fees and costs incurred in her attempts to collect these clients\u2019 outstanding fees. VanDerbeek claimed that her fee agreement permitted her to recover these fees and costs.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b68 The hearing officer found that, absent a court action, the plain language of the fee agreement did not permit VanDerbeek to bill clients for fees and costs associated with her attempts to collect her outstanding legal fees from these clients. However, she found credible VanDerbeek\u2019s testimony that she believed she was entitled to bill for the time spent collecting her fees. She concluded that VanDerbeek did not attempt to defraud her clients in violation of RPC 8.4(c) and that \u201c[t]here is not clear and convincing evidence that the amounts billed for collecting attorney fees were unreasonable\u201d in violation of RPC 1.5(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> R. at 19, FOF 93, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Count V</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b69 In count V, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek\u2019s practice of recording attorney liens on real property owned in whole or in part by clients Charlene Daniels, Susan Morris, and Dori Viltz violated this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ross v. Scannell, </em>97 Wn.2d 598, 647 P.2d 1004 (1982), and thus violated RPC 1.5(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). VanDerbeek admitted that she filed these liens but argued that the liens did not violate <em>Ross </em>since she filed them on the <em>proceeds </em>of her clients\u2019 real property sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">flO The hearing officer found that VanDerbeek\u2019s testimony was not credible, \u201cnor did Ms. VanDerbeek ever articulate the difference between filing on the real property and filing on the proceeds of the sale of real property when both filings appear as liens on a title report.\u201d R. at 20, FOF 102. She also found that VanDerbeek \u201cintentionally ignored the statute and Supreme Court case law in deciding to file the liens,\u201d and that she \u201cfiled the liens in an attempt to coerce her clients into paying disputed fees.\u201d R. at 20, FOF 102, 104. Consequently, the hearing officer concluded that VanDerbeek\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(d). The hearing officer, however, rejected the WSBA\u2019s claim that VanDerbeek violated RPC 8.4(c), reasoning that the WSBA failed to present any evidence that VanDerbeek \u201cintentionally or knowingly misled clients about whether she was billing for filing liens.\u201d R. at 20, FOF 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Count VI</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b611 In count VI, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.4 and 1.5(b) when she refused to provide clients with itemized bills. Additionally, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek failed to keep back-up documentation of her bills in order to properly respond to such requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b612 Based on testimony from the WSBA\u2019s expert, the hearing officer found that VanDerbeek had failed to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>proper back-up documentation but also found that \u201c[t]here was no evidence of a conspiracy to destroy records nor did the evidence warrant an inference that the records were intentionally destroyed to conceal their contents.\u201d R. at 21, FOF 109, 110. Thus, she concluded that VanDerbeek failed to provide sufficient information in response to five clients\u2019 requests for itemization in violation of RPC 1.4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the hearing officer rejected the WSBA\u2019s claim that VanDerbeek\u2019s failure to provide bills with adequate itemization violated RPC 1.5(b), reasoning that \u201cit is not a violation of the RPC to provide bills lacking adequate itemization, the violation consists of the failure to have sufficient back-up documentation to provide details upon request.\u201d R. at 20, FOF 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Count VII</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b613 In count VII, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek intentionally misrepresented the capabilities of her billing software to both the WSBA and her clients in violation of RPC 8.4(c) by telling them that her billing software could not provide itemization of fees and costs. VanDerbeek testified that she did not know her software could provide such information. The hearing officer noted that VanDerbeek\u2019s software indisputably could provide itemization but found VanDerbeek\u2019s testimony credible. The hearing officer concluded that the WSBA had \u201cfailed to meet its burden of showing dishonesty\u201d under RPC 8.4(c). R. at 29, FOF 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Count IX</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b614 In count IX, the WSBA alleged that VanDerbeek violated RPC 3.3(a)(1) when, in a June 11,1996 declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to superior court, she represented that she was \u201cin the process\u201d of changing her billing practices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> R. at 29, FOF 151. VanDerbeek failed to make any changes to her billing practices until March 2000, almost four years after making the 1996 declaration. The hearing officer rejected the WSBA\u2019s allegation, reasoning that \u201c[t]he term \u2018in the process\u2019 is not a precise term and is capable of different interpretations. . . . The fact that the changes were not made for a substantial period of time does not mean that Ms. VanDerbeek was not \u2018in the process\u2019 of making changes at the time the declaration was filed.\u201d R. at 29, FOF 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Count X</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b615 In count X, the WSBA alleged: (1) VanDerbeek violated RPC 8.4(a) when she assisted or induced John VanDerbeek\u2019s conduct in violating the RPCs; (2) VanDerbeek violated RPC 5.3(a) and 5.3(b) when she failed to take reasonable measures to ensure that her firm did not violate the RPCs and/or failed to supervise a nonlawyer, John VanDerbeek, to ensure that his conduct did not violate the RPCs; and (3) VanDerbeek violated RPC 5.3(c) when she ordered or ratified unethical employee conduct and/or failed to take remedial action after learning of the unethical conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b616 First, the hearing officer found that John VanDerbeek habitually added charges to clients\u2019 bills without explanation. VanDerbeek testified that she discontinued John\u2019s practice of adding these additional charges to clients\u2019 bills when she first learned of it in 1998. However, the hearing officer found that VanDerbeek failed to super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>vise John even after learning that he was adding additional charges to clients\u2019 bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b617 In addition, the hearing officer found that John violated the RPCs when he instituted a billing system,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">whereby legal assistant time was to be entered at half the amount of time actually spent on the task, using Ms. VanDerbeek\u2019s rate, to achieve a bill that would represent the correct dollar amount for the bills. It appears that legal assistant time was often, if not always, entered at the time actually billed and thus billed at Ms. VanDerbeek\u2019s own rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">R. at 31, FOF 165. The hearing officer concluded that VanDerbeek did not know this practice occurred but found that \u201ceven minimal review of the bills or the billing process should have revealed it to be happening.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b618 Lastly, the hearing officer considered John\u2019s response to clients who called with questions and complaints about their bills. The hearing officer found that \u201cMr. VanDerbeek created an atmosphere with clients and staff where they were afraid to question the billing process in an attempt to reduce or minimize inquiries into the bills, which he knew he would not be able to support.\u201d R. at 31, FOF 166. Further, even when VanDerbeek learned of client complaints, she did nothing to change her billing system. The hearing officer characterized her refusal to learn more about her billing system and software as a \u201cwillful failure to become adequately informed about her office policies and procedures.\u201d R. at 32, FOF 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u00b619 Because of VanDerbeek\u2019s failure to respond to client complaints, monitor John\u2019s billing practices, and her \u201cwillful failure\u201d to learn more about her firm\u2019s billing system, the hearing officer concluded that the WSBA had proved that she violated RPC 5.3(a) and (b). However, she concluded that the WSBA failed to establish that VanDerbeek violated RPC 8.4(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Count XI</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b620 In count XI, the WSBA claimed that VanDerbeek was unfit to practice law, pointing to a prior 1987 disciplinary action and the counts alleged in this complaint. Based on the counts in this complaint, the hearing officer concluded that \u201c[t]he enumerated violations above reflect adversely on Ms. VanDerbeek\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> R. at 38, CL 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Sanctions Imposed by the Hearing Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">f 21 For VanDerbeek\u2019s violations of RPC 1.5(a) in count I, the hearing officer concluded that disbarment was the presumptive sanction because VanDerbeek knowingly sent excessive and unreasonable bills with the intent of personal gain, which caused serious emotional and economic injury to her clients. On count V, the hearing officer determined that VanDerbeek\u2019s conduct of filing attorney liens on the proceeds of her clients\u2019 real property warranted an admonishment. She also concluded that a reprimand was the presumptive sanction for counts VI and X.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b622 In determining the appropriate sanction, the hearing officer found five aggravating factors: (1) a prior 1987 disciplinary action involving dishonesty; (2) a pattern of billing misconduct as well as a dishonest or selfish motive for financial gain and self-interest; (3) failure to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct; (4) the vulnerability of VanDerbeek\u2019s clients; and (5) substantial experience in the practice of law. The hearing officer also found four mitigating factors: (1) VanDerbeek\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d reputation as a lawyer; (2) the remoteness of her prior 1987 offense; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>VanDerbeek suffered other penalties or sanctions, namely the 1995 civil case brought by her former clients; and (4) the WSBA significantly delayed the disciplinary proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> R. at 40, Mitigating Factors 17-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b623 After considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, the hearing officer recommended a two-year suspension and 15 CLE (continuing legal education) hours of law office management.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She principally based this decision on the mitigating factor of delay and the fact that many of VanDerbeek\u2019s billing violations were a result of her husband\u2019s billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b624 The Board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended sanction with several amendments. On count I, the Board found that the WSBA had proved dishonesty and amended the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law to specifically include a violation of RPC 8.4(c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board also reinstated count TV, reasoning that \u201cthe record established a violation of Count 4 and that Ms. VanDerbeek\u2019s subjective belief about her fee agreement was not reasonable or relevant.\u201d Decision Papers (DP) at 3. However, on count XI, the Board reversed the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that VanDerbeek was unfit to practice law. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u00b625 The Board agreed that VanDerbeek\u2019s presumptive sanction was disbarment. Nine members of the Board found that mitigating factors, namely VanDerbeek\u2019s reliance on her husband to handle billing matters and the fact that VanDerbeek generally performed competent work for her clients, justified a two-year suspension. Four members dissented, arguing that VanDerbeek\u2019s misconduct should result in disbarment. Pursuant to ELC 13.9, the WSBA requested and the Board chair awarded $48,636.07 for costs and expenses incurred by the WSBA for VanDerbeek\u2019s disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b626 VanDerbeek appealed the Board\u2019s decision to this court. She argues that: (1) insufficient evidence exists to support the hearing officer\u2019s findings on count I that she charged six clients excessive and unreasonable fees; (2) the Board erred when it reinstated count IV of the WSBA\u2019s complaint; (3) the hearing officer and the Board erred by concluding that filing attorney liens on the proceeds of clients\u2019 real property sales constitutes a violation of RPC 1.5(a); (4) the hearing officer and Board wrongfully determined that disbarment was the presumptive sanction on count I and failed to properly weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors; and (5) the Board chair imposed excessive costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b627 This court exercises plenary authority in attorney discipline matters. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Brothers, </em>149 Wn.2d 575, 582, 70 P.3d 940 (2003) (citing <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Carmick, </em>146 Wn.2d 582, 593, 48 P.3d 311 (2002)). Even so, we give considerable weight to the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, especially with regard to the credibility and veracity of witnesses, and we will uphold the findings of fact if they are supported by a clear preponderance of the evidence. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Kagele, </em>149 Wn.2d 793, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>813, 72 P.3d 1067 (2003). We will uphold the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law if they are supported by the findings of fact. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Huddleston, </em>137 Wn.2d 560, 568-69, 974 P.2d 325 (1999). However, we review conclusions of law de novo. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Whitt, </em>149 Wn.2d 707, 717, 72 P.3d 173 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Count I</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b628 VanDerbeek argues that insufficient evidence exists to support the hearing officer\u2019s findings that she charged Erdman, Gibbons, Wiswall, Aumack, and Gould excessive and unreasonable fees in violation of RPC 1.5(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Relying on our opinion in <em>Kagele, </em>she claims the hearing officer made these findings based on her \u201cpersonal opinion of factual matters unsupported by the record.\u201d VanDerbeek\u2019s Br. at 25. On the other hand, the WSBA argues that substantial evidence exists to permit the hearing officer to reasonably infer that VanDerbeek charged these five clients excessive and unreasonable fees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b629 We agree with the WSBA. In <em>Kagele, </em>the hearing officer found that Kagele had performed a specific percentage of work for nine clients. 149 Wn.2d at 813. On appeal, Kagele argued that the hearing officer relied on his own personal opinion to reach the findings that he had per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>formed only a certain percentage of work for his clients. <em>Id. </em>We agreed, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">The record is silent on the method used by the hearing officer to calculate these percentages and contains no time analysis of Kagele\u2019s work for each client. The evidence does not establish what specific services Kagele agreed to render and lacks any assessment of the reasonable value of the services he did provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b630 Here, however, the hearing officer drew reasonable inferences from documents and testimony about the services VanDerbeek rendered to reach her findings. <em>See In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Cohen, </em>149 Wn.2d 323, 333, 67 P.3d 1086 (2003) (holding that it was appropriate for the hearing officer to draw reasonable inferences from the testimony and sequence of events presented at the disciplinary hearing). In Gould\u2019s case, the hearing officer heard testimony from Kirk Griffin who had served as opposing counsel. Griffin testified that his records \u201creflected far fewer calls\u201d to VanDerbeek\u2019s office than were billed to Gould as conversations with opposing counsel. R. at 17, FOF 79; Trial Record (TR) at 128-36. The WSBAalso presented an exhibit demonstrating that on December 23, 1999, VanDerbeek billed Gould for seven alleged conference calls with Griffin. <em>See </em>Ex. F-15, at 50-58; <em>see also </em>R. at 17, FOF 79. He did not bill his client for any calls. Ex. F-15, at 69-71. Based on this exhibit as well as Griffin\u2019s testimony, the hearing officer properly found that VanDerbeek charged Gould excessive and unreasonable fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b631 Similarly, in Aumack\u2019s case, the hearing officer examined documents and heard testimony which showed that VanDerbeek charged Aumack $350 for a simple 1.5 page letter notifying opposing counsel of her withdrawal and for preparation of a notice of withdrawal. <em>See </em>Ex. A-18, at 7-9; TR at 1146-49. From this, the hearing officer properly found that VanDerbeek charged Aumack excessive and unreasonable fees since the notice of withdrawal was a simple form, and the letter to opposing counsel could not have reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ably required more than two hours of attorney time to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b632 In Erdman\u2019s case, the hearing officer considered testimony from VanDerbeek as well as documents describing the services she allegedly rendered. Ex. A-18, at 18-25; TR at 1094-95. At issue were VanDerbeek\u2019s $70 and $126 fees for drafting a two sentence facsimile transmittal letter to opposing counsel and for preparation and filing of a notice of intent to withdraw. VanDerbeek testified that a paralegal might take .2 to .3 hours to prepare a notice of withdrawal and .1 to .2 hours to review the file for information. <em>See </em>TR at 1094-95. VanDerbeek, however, charged Erdman 1 hour of legal assistant time to draft the two sentence transmittal letter and 1.8 hours of legal assistant time for the preparation and filing of her notice of intent to withdraw. <em>See </em>R. at 12, FOF 73. VanDerbeek\u2019s testimony coupled with Erdman\u2019s billing statements provides a substantial basis for the hearing officer to find that VanDerbeek charged Erdman excessive and unreasonable fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b633 The WSBA also produced evidence showing that VanDerbeek charged Wiswall $336 for preparation of a summons and complaint in her action against Wiswall to collect outstanding legal fees. <em>See </em>Ex.

R. at 16, FOF 76. Again, we can conclude that the hearing officer reasonably found that $336 (2.4 hours of attorney time) for this form pleading was an excessive and unreasonable fee.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">|34 Lastly, in Gibbons\u2019 case, the WSBA produced evidence demonstrating that VanDerbeek charged $100 (.8 hours of attorney time) to draft a two paragraph letter requesting that Gibbons contact her; VanDerbeek charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>$100 (.8 hours of attorney time) to draft a one page letter to Gibbons requesting that she pay her outstanding legal fees; and VanDerbeek charged $225 (1.8 hours of attorney time) to prepare a notice of withdrawal and to draft a letter responding to Gibbons\u2019 complaint that VanDerbeek had failed to adequately represent her. <em>See </em>Ex. A-18, at 26-30, 35-38; TR at 1158-62, 1165-69; R. at 16, FOF 74. Given that the letters were mere requests for contact and/or payments for fees and that the notice of intent to withdraw was a simple form, the hearing officer properly found that VanDerbeek charged Gibbons excessive and unreasonable fees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Count IV</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b635 VanDerbeek also argues that the Board improperly reinstated count IV of the WSBA\u2019s complaint, which alleged that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(c) when she billed Breard, Daniels, DeBoer, Forkner, Gaffney, Gibbons, and Morris for attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with her attempts to collect their outstanding legal fees. The WSBA concedes that the evidence does not support a violation of RPC 8.4(c) but asserts that we should affirm the Board\u2019s conclusion that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b636 To assess the reasonableness of VanDerbeek\u2019s fees, we turn to the relevant factor, RPC 1.5(a)(8). <em>See In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Boelter, </em>139 Wn.2d 81, 96, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>985 P.2d 328 (1999).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> RPC 1.5(a)(8) requires this court to consider \u201c[wjhether the fee agreement or confirming writing demonstrates that the <em>client had received a reasonable and fair disclosure of material elements </em>of the fee agreement and of the lawyer\u2019s billing practices.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"> \u00b637 The pertinent provision of VanDerbeek\u2019s fee agreement provides that \u201c \u2018if legal action is necessary to collect any sum due and owing DIANE L. VANDERBEEK, the undersigned agrees to pay Court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the processing of such action.\u2019 \u201d R. at 18, FOF 90. VanDerbeek contends that her practice of billing clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with her attempts to collect outstanding legal fees was reasonable under <em>her </em>interpretation of the fee agreement. The Board rejected this argument, reasoning that VanDerbeek\u2019s subjective belief about the nature of her fee agreement was irrelevant and that under the plain language of her fee agreement, billing for such fees and costs was unreasonable. <em>See </em>DP at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b638 We agree with the Board. The language of VanDerbeek\u2019s fee agreement does not provide \u201creasonable and fair disclosure\u201d to <em>clients </em>about her practice of charging them for fees and costs incurred in connection with her attempts to collect their outstanding legal fees in the <em>absence of a legal action. </em>RPC 1.5(a)(8). Indeed, the word \u201caction,\u201d used in VanDerbeek\u2019s agreement, is commonly understood in \u201cits usual legal sense\u201d as \u201ca suit brought in a court.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 26 (5th ed. 1979). Accordingly, the Board properly reinstated violations of RPC 1.5(a) in count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b639 VanDerbeek also claims that she is being punished twice for the same conduct because findings in count IV duplicate findings in count I. On count I, the hearing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>based her conclusion, in part, that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) when she inflated Daniels\u2019, DeBoer\u2019s, Forkner\u2019s, and Gibbons\u2019 bills. <em>See </em>R. at 35, Conclusion of Law (CL) 6. On count IV, however, the Board concluded that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) because the fees she charged <em>Breard, </em>Daniels, DeBoer, Forkner, <em>Gaffney, </em>Gibbons, and <em>Morris </em>in connection with her efforts to collect her outstanding legal fees and costs were unreasonable under the terms of her fee agreement. <em>See </em>DP at 3; R. at 18, FOF 88. Because count I did not address fees VanDerbeek charged to Breard, Gaffney, and Morris, we affirm the Board\u2019s conclusion that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) when she charged unreasonable fees that were not reasonably and fairly disclosed in these three clients\u2019 fee agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Count V</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b640 VanDerbeek asserts that the hearing officer and the Board improperly concluded that she violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(d) by placing attorney liens on the proceeds of clients Daniels\u2019, Morris\u2019, and Viltz\u2019s real property sales and charging these clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with placing these liens. The WSBA, however, argues that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(d) since her fee agreement failed to disclose her practice of billing clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with filing these liens, and that VanDerbeek filed the liens in violation of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ross, </em>97 Wn.2d at 606-07. We agree with the WSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b641 The pertinent provision in VanDerbeek\u2019s fee agreement states \u201c[fit is further agreed that if legal action is necessary to collect any sum due and owing DIANE L. VANDERBEEK, the undersigned agrees to pay Court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the processing of such action.\u201d Ex. A-7, at 1, 24, 34. As noted, this provision of the fee agreement permits VanDerbeek to charge clients for fees and costs incurred from a <em>legal action </em>to collect their outstanding legal fees. Consequently, VanDerbeek\u2019s fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>agreement fails to provide clients \u201creasonable and fair disclosure\u201d of her practice to bill clients for fees incurred in connection with filing attorney liens on the proceeds of their real property sales. RPC 1.5(a)(8). Therefore, we hold that the hearing officer and Board properly concluded that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) by billing clients for these fees and costs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b642 VanDerbeek also argues that the hearing officer and Board improperly concluded that she violated RPC 8.4(d) by filing these attorney liens. RPC 8.4(d) provides that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: . . . [e]ngage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d In <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Curran, </em>115 Wn.2d 747, 764, 801 P.2d 962 (1990), we considered whether an attorney\u2019s conviction for vehicular homicide constituted misconduct that was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d under RPC 8.4(d). We noted that \u201c[decisions in this jurisdiction show that conduct deemed prejudicial to the administration of justice has generally been conduct of an attorney in his official or advocatory role or conduct which might physically interfere with enforcing the law.\u201d 115 Wn.2d at 764. We also established that \u201c[RPC 8.4(d)] only extends to violations of practice norms and physical interference with the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766. In Curran\u2019s case, we reasoned that he was not acting in his capacity as a lawyer nor attempting to physically interfere with law enforcement when he committed vehicular homicide, and thus declined to hold that he violated RPC 8.4(d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b643 Like the attorney in <em>Curran, </em>VanDerbeek claims that \u201c[s]he was acting in her personal capacity of seeking to collect a debt.\u201d VanDerbeek\u2019s Br. at 32. We find this argument unpersuasive. When she seeks to collect debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>owed by clients, VanDerbeek acts in her official capacity as an attorney. Indeed, any authority that VanDerbeek has to file attorney liens under RCW 60.40.010 results from her attorney-client relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"> \u00b644 Further, in <em>Ross, </em>we clearly established that attorneys may not file liens on real property under RCW 60.40.010. 97 Wn.2d at 606-07. Although <em>Ross </em>addressed attorney liens filed on the title of real property, we stated that attorney liens \u201cclouding title\u201d are prohibited under RCW 60.40.010. <em>Id. </em>at 607. We see no difference between attorney liens filed on the title of real property and those filed on the proceeds of real property sales since both filings appear as liens on a title report and thus have the effect of clouding clients\u2019 titles.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that by filing these liens, VanDerbeek disregarded our decision in <em>Ross, </em>97 Wn.2d at 606-07; such disregard constitutes a violation of practice norms \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d under RPC 8.4(d). <em>See Curran, </em>115 Wn.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b645 VanDerbeek appeals the Board\u2019s decision to affirm the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation to impose a two-year suspension for her violations of the RPCs, arguing that both the hearing officer and the Board erred by determining that disbarment is the presumptive sanction and by failing to properly weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> VanDerbeek asserts that she should receive a reprimand. Cross-appealing, the WSBA contends that the hearing officer and the Board improperly considered the mitigating factors and that VanDerbeek should be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"> \u00b646 In Washington, the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer </em>Sanctions<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>(Stan</em>dards) govern lawyer sanctions. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Halverson, </em>140 Wn.2d 475, 492, 998 P.2d 833 (2000). To determine whether the hearing officer and the Board properly determined VanDerbeek\u2019s presumptive sanction, we consider the ethical duties that she violated, her mental state, and the injury to her clients. <em>Id. See also In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Cohen, </em>150 Wn.2d 744, 758, 82 P.3d 224 (2004); Standakds std. 3.0(a)-(c). Next, we determine whether the hearing officer and the Board properly weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors. <em>Halverson, </em>140 Wn.2d at 493. After we determine VanDerbeek\u2019s appropriate sanction, we consider whether the revised Noble<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> factors of unanimity and proportionality should alter her sanction. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Kuvara, </em>149 Wn.2d 237, 259, 66 P.3d 1057 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b647 We give significant weight to the Board\u2019s recommended sanction since the Board is \u201c \u2018the only body to hear the full range of disciplinary matters\u2019 \u201d and has a \u201c \u2018unique experience and perspective in the administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of sanctions.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Dann, </em>136 Wn.2d 67, 84, 960 P.2d 416 (1998) (quoting <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Noble, </em>100 Wn.2d 88, 94, 667 P.2d 608 (1983)). However, we may ultimately reject the Board\u2019s recommendation. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Haskell, </em>136 Wn.2d 300, 317, 962 P.2d 813 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The Presumptive Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b648 VanDerbeek argues that the hearing officer and the Board improperly determined that disbarment serves as the presumptive sanction on count I. She asserts that she did not act knowingly when she sent her clients inflated bills.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b649 The findings here support the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that VanDerbeek at least acted knowingly when she sent clients inflated bills with the intent of personal gain.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See </em>R. at 35, Presumptive Sanction 2. The hearing officer found that VanDerbeek had engaged in a \u201cpattern of <em>intentionally </em>inflating time and overbilling clients.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> R. at 18, FOF 87 (emphasis added). This was amply illustrated by VanDerbeek\u2019s consistent practice of billing excessive fees for simple form pleadings, notices of intent to withdraw, and short letters requesting payment of fees. Indeed, VanDerbeek herself testified that these tasks did not equal the amounts she charged to clients. Moreover, VanDerbeek charged these excessive fees even though clients routinely questioned her billing practices, made re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>quests for itemization, and initiated a lawsuit alleging that VanDerbeek had inflated their bills. Because VanDerbeek acted \u201cknowingly\u201d with the intent of personal gain and caused serious financial and emotional injuries to her clients, we hold that the hearing officer properly concluded that disbarment constitutes the presumptive sanction under <em>Standards </em>std. 4.6.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b650 Next we consider the aggravating and mitigating factors. The hearing officer evaluated the aggravating and mitigating factors pursuant to <em>Standards </em>stds. 9.22 and 9.32. She found five aggravating factors: (1) a prior 1987 disciplinary offense involving dishonesty, (2) a pattern of billing misconduct as well as a dishonest or selfish motive for financial gain and self-interest, (3) failure to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct, (4) the vulnerability of VanDerbeek\u2019s clients, and (5) substantial experience in the practice of law. But she found four mitigating factors: (1) VanDerbeek\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d reputation as a lawyer, (2) the remoteness of her prior 1987 offense, (3) other penalties or sanctions, and (4) delay. R. at 40, Mitigating Factors 17-20. Based on these factors <em>plus </em>the factor that \u201cmany of the billing problems appear to have resulted from reliance on John VanDerbeek to handle billing matters,\u201d the hearing officer concluded that a two-year suspension was appropriate. R. at 41, Recommended Sanction 22. The Board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s analysis of the aggravating and mitigating factors as well as the recommended sanction. DP at 4-5. In addition, the Board emphasized that it reached its decision, in part, because \u201cit is undisputed that Ms. VanDerbeek worked hard and provided competent representation to her clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Aggravating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b651 VanDerbeek disputes all of the aggravating factors. First, she argues that the hearing officer should not have considered her 1987 disciplinary offense since \u201cit involved unrelated, personal behavior and was remote in time.\u201d VanDerbeek\u2019s Br. at 37. This court, however, routinely considers similar misconduct dating back many years to determine whether prior disciplinary offenses serve as an aggravating factor. <em>See In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Juarez, </em>143 Wn.2d 840, 880, 24 P.3d 1040 (2001) (considering a nine-year-old admonition for similar misconduct as an aggravating factor); <em>Cohen </em>150 Wn.2d at 761 (considering 30- and 10-year-old admonitions and reprimands for similar misconduct as an aggravating factor). Because VanDerbeek\u2019s 1987 reprimand and the charges alleged in count I of this action both pertain to violations of RPC 8.4(c), the hearing officer properly concluded that VanDerbeek\u2019s prior offense is similar to the matter at hand and, therefore, serves as an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b652 Next, VanDerbeek argues that a pattern of misconduct does not exist. We find our decision in <em>Brothers, </em>149 Wn.2d at 586, to be instructive. There we established that a pattern of misconduct constitutes an aggravating factor when \u201cmultiple violations occurred, involving multiple clients, over an extended period of time.\u201d <em>Brothers, </em>149 Wn.2d at 586 (citing <em>Juarez, </em>143 Wn.2d at 879; <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Anschell, </em>141 Wn.2d 593, 615, 9 P.3d 193 (2000); <em>Halverson, </em>140 Wn.2d at 499). In Brothers\u2019 case, we held that only two violations of RPC 1.5 did not establish a pattern of misconduct. <em>Id. </em>Here, however, VanDerbeek\u2019s misconduct involves charging 11 clients excessive and unreasonable fees in violation of RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(c) over an extended period of time. Consequently, the evidence supports the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that a pattern of misconduct exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b653 VanDerbeek also contends that she did not act with a dishonest or selfish motive. However, VanDerbeek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>has not offered any arguments or pointed to any evidence which would suggest that the hearing officer erred when, on count I, she found that VanDerbeek\u2019s violations were \u201cdone intentionally for the purpose of financial benefit of Respondent at the expense of her clients.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> R. at 18, FOF 87; <em>see also </em>DP at 3 (\u201cDisciplinary Counsel proved dishonesty\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that VanDerbeek\u2019s dishonest or selfish motive serves as an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b654 Relying on our opinion in <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Anschell, </em>149 Wn.2d 484, 514, 69 P.3d 844 (2003) <em>(Anschell </em>II), VanDerbeek disputes the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that her victims were vulnerable. In <em>Anschell </em>II, we stated that the record must show that an attorney\u2019s victims were \u201cunder [a] physical or mental disability or [were] otherwise particularly vulnerable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. Here, VanDerbeek testified that DeBoer was \u201cseriously mentally ill,\u201d Forkner had \u201cpsychological issues,\u201d Hirschbeel displayed \u201cwildly emotional\u201d behavior and sought therapy, Langston had experienced sexual abuse and domestic violence and suffered \u201cvery very serious psychological problems,\u201d Aumack\u2019s husband was abusive, and Gould\u2019s dissolution involved child custody issues and her husband was physically abusive. TR at 2113, 2134-37, 2141-44, 2147-49, 2154. Clearly, ample evidence exists to support the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that VanDerbeek\u2019s victims were vulnerable. <em>See Halverson, </em>140 Wn.2d at 496 (affirming the Board\u2019s conclusion that client going through a difficult dissolution and child custody proceeding was a vulnerable victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b655 Lastly, VanDerbeek challenges the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that she has substantial experience in the law, arguing that \u201c[s]he did have substantial experience in the practice of family law but she did not have experience in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the crucial aspect of the practice of law at issue here\u2014the area of billing matters.\u201d VanDerbeek\u2019s Br. at 39. This argument is not persuasive. VanDerbeek entered the practice of law in 1981 and opened her solo practice in 1984. Her misconduct in this matter occurred in 1992-2000. Thus, VanDerbeek had almost 10 years of law office management experience prior to the first instance of misconduct alleged in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b656 The WSBA challenges all of the mitigating factors. First, relying on our decisions in <em>Juarez, </em>143 Wn.2d at 880 and <em>Cohen, </em>149 Wn.2d at 340, the WSBA asserts that VanDerbeek\u2019s 1987 reprimand for violations of RPC 8.4(c) and 8.4(d) is not remote because it \u201cwas imposed for misconduct similar to the present case.\u201d WSBA\u2019s Br. at 43. In both <em>Juarez </em>and <em>Cohen, </em>we considered prior admonitions/reprimands for similar misconduct dating back 9 and 30 years as aggravating factors in the attorneys\u2019 current disciplinary proceedings. Further, in <em>Cohen, </em>we expressly declined to find that the remoteness of Cohen\u2019s prior similar disciplinary offenses served as a mitigating factor. 149 Wn.2d at 340. Like the prior offenses at issue in <em>Juarez </em>and <em>Cohen, </em>VanDerbeek\u2019s prior 1987 offense involved similar misconduct, i.e., violation of RPC 8.4(c). Accordingly, we hold that the remoteness of VanDerbeek\u2019s 1987 offense does not act as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b657 Next, citing to <em>Standards </em>std. 9.4(a), the WSBA argues that VanDerbeek\u2019s civil settlement should not serve as a mitigating factor. <em>Standards </em>std. 9.4(a) provides that \u201cforced or compelled restitution\u201d \u201cshould not be considered as either aggravating or mitigating.\u201d In <em>Standards </em>std. 9.4(a) (Commentary), the ABA clarifies that such action should not be considered mitigating when lawyers \u201cmake restitution only <em>after </em>a disciplinary proceeding has been instituted against them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, because VanDerbeek entered a settlement with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>clients <em>prior </em>to her disciplinary proceeding in this matter, <em>Standards </em>std. 9.4(a) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"> \u00b658 We must still determine whether settlement in a civil suit serves as a mitigating factor. We have held that criminal penalties properly serve as a mitigating factor. <em>See In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Immelt, </em>119 Wn.2d 369, 372, 831 P.2d 736 (1992); <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Petersen, </em>120 Wn.2d 833, 856, 846 P.2d 1330 (1993). Yet a civil settlement is substantially different from the criminal penalties we have previously acknowledged as mitigating factors. Presumably, VanDerbeek settled the suit to avoid the expenses of trial and to provide some restitution to her clients. Indeed, in some instances, a \u201ctimely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct\u201d may serve as a mitigating factor. Standards std. 9.32(d). However, the purpose of recognizing such action as a mitigating factor, in part, is to \u201censure that the lawyer has recognized the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. VanDerbeek, however, continued to commit misconduct after she and the plaintiffs reached this settlement. Thus, under the facts of this case, we hold that VanDerbeek\u2019s 1996 settlement does not act as a mitigating factor.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b659 The WSBA also contends that the hearing officer found that the delay in VanDerbeek\u2019s proceedings occurred in connection with other counts in its complaint. The hearing officer, however, did not confine her findings of delay to VanDerbeek\u2019s violations of RPC 1.4 and 5.3.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See </em>R. at 33, FOF 178, 179. Therefore, we hold that the hearing officer properly considered the mitigating factor of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>f 60 Next, the WSBA asserts that the hearing officer and the Board erred by considering John VanDerbeek\u2019s role as a mitigating factor for count I. We agree. On count I, the hearing officer never found that <em>John VanDerbeek </em>altered the billing data at issue. To the contrary, she found that on count I, VanDerbeek herself had engaged in a \u201cpattern of intentionally inflating time and overbilling clients.\u201d R. at 18, FOF 87. Thus, we decline to consider John\u2019s role as a mitigating factor for the sanction imposed for count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b661 Lastly, the WSBA argues that the Board improperly considered VanDerbeek\u2019s competence as a mitigating factor, contending that it will lead to extensive litigation in future disciplinary proceedings. Although the WSBA\u2019s concern may be valid, the Board\u2019s characterization of VanDerbeek\u2019s \u201ccompetent representation\u201d appears to be in reference to VanDerbeek\u2019s good reputation as a lawyer. <em>See </em>DP at 5. <em>Standards </em>std. 9.32(g) expressly provides that an attorney\u2019s reputation may serve as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> \u00b662 We now consider the Board\u2019s recommended sanction. We have held that \u201c[t]he Board should deviate from the presumptive sanction only if the aggravating and mitigating factors are sufficiently compelling to justifying a departure.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>149 Wn.2d at 339. As noted, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, both the hearing officer and Board determined that VanDerbeek\u2019s misconduct warranted a two-year suspension instead of the presumptive sanction of disbarment. <em>See </em>DP at 4-5. Because we have held that the hearing officer and the Board improperly considered the mitigating factors of the remoteness of VanDerbeek\u2019s prior disciplinary offense, other penalties or sanctions, and John VanDerbeek\u2019s role, the hearing officer\u2019s and Board\u2019s reasons for departing from the presumptive sanction become less convincing. Only two mitigating factors remain, delay in the disciplinary proceedings and VanDerbeek\u2019s good reputation. In <em>Immelt, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ordered disbarment when only one mitigating factor was present. 119 Wn.2d at 372-73. Similarly, in <em>Peterson </em>we found that the attorney failed to offer any \u201cextraordinary\u201d mitigating factors to warrant departure from the presumptive sanction of disbarment. 120 Wn.2d at 856. Thus, given that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors in VanDerbeek\u2019s case, we reinstate the presumptive sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The <em>Noble </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"> \u00b663 VanDerbeek argues that the revised <em>Noble </em>factors of unanimity and proportionality require a lesser sanction. <em>Kuvara, </em>149 Wn.2d at 259. This court gives less deference to \u201cthe decision of a divided board.\u201d <em>Whitt, </em>149 Wn.2d at 723. Here, the Board ruled 9-4 in favor of VanDerbeek\u2019s two-year suspension. DP at 4. Four members of the Board dissented, arguing that VanDerbeek\u2019s misconduct merited disbarment. DP at 5 n.3. Since the Board was far from unanimous and a majority of the Board improperly considered three mitigating factors, the <em>Noble </em>factor of unanimity does not warrant departure from disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> \u00b664 Next, VanDerbeek argues that disbarment is not proportional. \u201cUnder proportionality review, we analyze whether a presumptive sanction is proper by comparing the case at hand with other similarly situated cases in which the same sanction was approved or disapproved.\u201d <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Miller, </em>149 Wn.2d 262, 285, 66 P.3d 1069 (2003). In <em>Kagele, </em>we stated that the attorney facing discipline must bring forth cases demonstrating the disproportionality of the sanction imposed. 149 Wn.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b665 VanDerbeek relies on our decision in <em>Dann, </em>136 Wn.2d 67. In <em>Dann, </em>we upheld a one-year suspension for violations of RPC 8.4(c). <em>Id. </em>at 86-87. There the attorney had billed four clients for work that was actually completed by associate attorneys who billed at a lower rate, engaged in initial-switching on time slips submitted to the client, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and misrepresented to clients as to who was actually working on their cases. <em>Id. </em>at 78-79. The hearing officer considered five mitigating factors: \u201c \u2018(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (d) timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify the consequences of some misconduct; (i) delay in disciplinary proceedings; and, (1) remorse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82 (quoting Clerk\u2019s Papers at 155-56). We noted that Dann had engaged in serious misconduct which could arguably merit disbarment, but we ultimately upheld the Board\u2019s recommendation to impose a one-year suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b666 The WSBA claims that <em>Dann </em>is not comparable to VanDerbeek\u2019s case because: (1) the presumptive sanction in <em>Dann </em>was suspension; (2) VanDerbeek acted intentionally while Dann acted knowingly; (3) Dann merely switched initials while VanDerbeek \u201cintentionally padded bills to the financial detriment of clients\u201d; (4) VanDerbeek continued to \u201cengage in bill padding\u201d even after she settled the lawsuit for her unlawful billing practices; (5) VanDerbeek\u2019s clients were vulnerable; and (6) VanDerbeek engaged in misconduct for a substantial period of time with numerous victims, while Dann\u2019s misconduct involved only four clients. WSBA\u2019s Br. at 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b667 We agree with the WSBA. The WSBA correctly notes that the presumptive sanction in <em>Dann </em>was suspension not disbarment. 136 Wn.2d at 80. Further, the hearing officer and Board found that VanDerbeek had <em>intentionally </em>billed excessive and unreasonable fees for simple form pleadings, one-page letters, and notices of intent to withdraw. Unlike the attorney in <em>Dann, </em>VanDerbeek failed to end her unethical billing practices even after the 1996 settlement of her clients\u2019 civil lawsuit. Most importantly, VanDerbeek\u2019s clients were, by her own admission, vulnerable. Thus, significant factors exist here to justify disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b668 Finally, we turn to the issue of costs. Pursuant to ELC 13.9(a), the Board chair awarded the WSBA $48,636.07 for costs and expenses incurred by the WSBA in VanDerbeek\u2019s disciplinary proceeding.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> ELC 13.9(f)(1) states that \u201c[i]n matters reviewed by the Supreme Court under title 12, the Chair\u2019s decision is subject to review only by the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This court typically reviews attorney fee and cost awards for abuse of discretion. <em>See Rettkowski v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, </em>128 Wn.2d 508, 519, 910 P.2d 462 (1996); <em>see also King County Water Dist. No. 90 v. City of Renton, </em>88 Wn. App. 214, 228-29, 944 P.2d 1067 (1997). We will find abuse \u201conly when the exercise of. . . discretion is manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Rettkowski, </em>128 Wn.2d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b669 VanDerbeek contends that, pursuant to ELC 13.9(h), \u201cinterests of justice\u201d demand a reduction of the Board chair\u2019s cost award. She claims that these costs were a result of the method that the WSBA employed to investigate and litigate her case, and given that the WSBA has failed to prove parts of its complaint, this court should reduce the award. VanDerbeek, however, does not point to any specific costs that she claims are improper. Moreover, she ignores that the hearing officer and/or Board concluded that she violated most of the charges the WSBA had alleged in its complaint. Thus, she has failed to show that the Board chair\u2019s costs are \u201cmanifestly unreasonable,\u201d or that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d require us to reduce the award. <em>Rettkowski, </em>128 Wn.2d at 519; ELC 13.9(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b670 VanDerbeek has failed to show that any of the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact are unsupported by the evidence. She has also failed to demonstrate that the Board improperly reinstated violations of RPC 1.5(a) in count IV. We affirm the hearing officer\u2019s and Board\u2019s conclusion on count V that VanDerbeek violated RPC 1.5(a) and 8.4(d) by filing improper attorney liens and billing clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with those liens. However, while the hearing officer and the Board correctly determined that the presumptive sanction is disbarment, neither the hearing officer nor the Board properly weighed the mitigating factors when they reached their decision that VanDerbeek\u2019s misconduct justified only a two-year suspension. Independently weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors here, we hold that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. The revised <em>Noble </em>factors of unanimity and proportionality do not merit departure from this sanction. Lastly, we affirm the Board chair\u2019s award of costs to the WSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Alexander, C. J.; Chambers, Owens, and Fairhurst, JJ.; and Kurtz, J.

However, in another section of the findings, the hearing officer noted that VanDerbeek made the declaration at issue in June 1996. <em>See </em>R. at 11, FOF 42. It is clear that this declaration was made in June 1996. If the hearing officer had cited to the correct date of the declaration in her findings of fact pertaining to count IX, it is arguably possible that she could have concluded that the WSBA had proved count IX. The WSBA, however, has not raised this argument here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\"> Although the WSBA alleged in count X that VanDerbeek also violated RPC 5.3(c), neither the hearing officer nor the Board made any specific findings or conclusions pertaining to this violation.

Accordingly, these findings are accepted as verities on appeal. <em>Carmick, </em>146 Wn.2d at 594 (citing <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Curran, </em>115 Wn.2d 747, 759, 801 P.2d 962 (1990)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\"> The WSBA also contends that pursuant to RAP 10.3(g), VanDerbeek must make separate assignments of error for each finding of fact she disputes in count I. RAP 10.3(g), however, provides that an \u201cappellate court will only review a claimed error which is included in an assignment of error <em>or clearly disclosed in the associated issue pertaining thereto.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although VanDerbeek failed to make separate assignments of error, she did disclose which findings she disputed in her discussion of the associated issue. Thus, while separate assignments of error to each disputed finding would have been ideal, we conclude that VanDerbeek has sufficiently complied with RAP 10.3(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> We do not hold here that a lawyer may not charge a flat fee per document or product prepared so long as the client agrees to the per document fee and that the charged fee is reasonable under all the circumstances.

In Hirschbeel\u2019s case, the WSBA had offered evidence proving that VanDerbeek charged Hirschbeel $100 for a simple facsimile transmittal letter and a form notice of intent to withdraw. <em>See </em>Ex. A-18, at 40-42. The hearing officer soundly reasoned that \u201c[t]he work could not have taken .8 hour to prepare, and a secretary could have done the work.\u201d R. at 17, FOF 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\"> The WSBA noted in its brief that the Board appears to have reinstated only the portion of count IV pertaining to VanDerbeek\u2019s alleged violations of RPC 1.5(a) since the WSBA had confined its appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision on count IV to this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> In <em>Boelter, </em>we noted that RPC 1.5(a)(8) is \u201c[t]he relevant factor in a determination of reasonableness\u201d in instances where an attorney has charged clients\u2019 fees that were alleged to be outside of those agreed upon by the parties in their fee agreement. 139 Wn.2d at 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> VanDerbeek also appears to argue that the hearing officer and the Board improperly found that she had violated RPC 1.5(a) by concluding that any fees she charged clients for placing attorney liens on the proceeds of their real property sales were per se unreasonable. However, since we hold that her fee agreement failed to reasonably and fairly disclose to clients her practice of charging for such fees and costs in violation of RPC 1.5(a), we need not consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> VanDerbeek contends that the law was unclear as to whether she could file liens on the proceeds of Daniels\u2019 and Morris\u2019 real property sales until the Court of Appeals explicitly stated in <em>Robinson v. Khan, </em>89 Wn. App. 418, 423, 948 P.2d 1347 (1998), that liens filed on proceeds of real property sales act as a cloud upon title. Again, we find her argument unpersuasive. As the hearing officer noted, \u201cMs. VanDerbeek [could not] articulate the difference between filing on the real property and filing on the proceeds of the sale of real property when both filings appear as liens on a title report.\u201d R. at 20, FOF 102. Moreover, the hearing officer found that VanDerbeek \u201cintentionally ignored the statute and Supreme Court case law in deciding to file the liens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we reject VanDerbeek\u2019s claim that she believed she could lawfully file liens on the proceeds of the sale of Daniels\u2019 and Morris\u2019 real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">VanDerbeek also claims that she filed the attorney hen on the proceeds of the sales of Viltz\u2019s property \u201cbecause the court directed that the payments of the attorney fees were to come from the proceeds of the sale of the real property.\u201d VanDerbeek\u2019s Br. at 35. VanDerbeek appears to argue that this is equivalent to a judgment under RCW 60.40.010(4). However, RCW 60.40.010(4) permits liens after a court has entered a judgment against a client. In Viltz\u2019s case, the court was merely directing the method of fee payment for the parties at dissolution. VanDerbeek had not yet sought a judgment against Viltz. Thus, RCW 60.40.010(4) does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"><em> </em>VanDerbeek limits her argument to the hearing officer\u2019s and the Board\u2019s determination of the sanction on count I, the most serious charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> (1991 &amp; Supp. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\"> <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Noble, </em>100 Wn.2d 88, 667 P.2d 608 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> VanDerbeek does not dispute the hearing officer\u2019s findings that she acted with the intent of personal gain and that her clients suffered serious financial and emotional injuries from her billing practices.

When an attorney does not seek review of the chair\u2019s assessment but appeals his or her sanction to this court or this court affirms the chair\u2019s cost award, ELC 13.9(g) provides the mechanism for ensuring that such costs are properly awarded by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b671 (dissenting) \u2014 The majority opinion discounts several mitigating factors considered by the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) Disciplinary Board (Board). First is the remoteness of Diane VanDerbeek\u2019s 1987 fishing license offense.

The WSBA did not undertake its investigation of grievances filed until 1999. The majority fails to take into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>account the several hundred thousand dollar civil settlement which was paid long before this discipline action was instituted. A settlement is by its nature a voluntary action and was not compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b673 In the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>standards 9.4(a) &amp; commentary, the ABA makes it clear that \u201c[l]awyers who make restitution voluntarily and on their own initiative demonstrate both a recognition of their ethical violation and their responsibility to the injured client or other party.\u201d Since VanDerbeek entered into her settlement some three years prior to the WSBA commencing an investigation for discipline, the settlement should be taken into consideration as the Board did. This is a significant mitigating factor disregarded by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b674 The majority states that VanDerbeek continued to commit misconduct in her billing after she and her plaintiffs settled. It is difficult to understand why VanDerbeek continued to blindly rely on her husband and did not personally follow through to make sure the billing software and practices complied with the Rules of Professional Conduct after the settlement. However, this fact should not simply erase the mitigation. The several hundred thousand dollar settlement should be proportionately considered in mitigation. It is significant that those plaintiffs in the suit who were harmed received restitution. The Board properly considered this mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b675 The Board reversed the finding of the hearing officer in Count XI concerning unfitness to practice law. The WSBA did not appeal that conclusion. The majority holds that VanDerbeek\u2019s good reputation as a lawyer was properly considered by the Board. Granting that the violations based upon billing practices were serious, I would not disturb the Board\u2019s 9-4 determination that a two year suspension was the proper sanction.
