Airtouch Communications, Inc., </em>153 Wn. 2d 293, 103 P.3d 753 (2004), this case requires us to consider the enforceability of a predispute employment arbitration agreement in the context of employment discrimination litigation. Here, after employee Gerald Adler sued his employer Fred Lind Manor, the trial court granted Fred Lind Manor\u2019s motion to compel arbitration under the arbitration agreement. Adler asserts that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it violates his right to a jury trial, because the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, entitles him to a judicial forum, and because the arbitration agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. He also claims that Fred Lind Manor waived its right to arbitration and/or should be equitably estopped from demanding arbitration. We agree with Adler that the agreement\u2019s attorney fees and 180-day limitations provisions unreasonably favor Fred Lind Manor and are thus substantively unconscionable. We further conclude that factual disputes preclude resolution of Adler\u2019s claims of procedural unconscionability, the substantive conscionability of the fee-splitting provision, and whether his right to a jury trial was violated. We therefore remand these claims to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"ABL\">Bridge, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b62 Gerald Adler immigrated to the United States from Poland in 1990. On June 4, 1992, Fred Lind Manor, a business that provides housing and services to senior citizens, hired Adler for a maintenance personnel position. Two months later, Fred Lind Manor promoted Adler to maintenance and housekeeper supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b63 In 1995, Paradigm Senior Living assumed management of Fred Lind Manor and required all current employees to sign an arbitration agreement as a condition of their continued employment. The arbitration agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Arbitration Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">I hereby agree that any dispute related to my employment relationship shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in Seattle, Washington under the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules, except as other wise [sic] provided here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">I agree to the following terms of arbitration as part of this agreement to arbitration. The aggrieved party must deliver to the other party a written notice of his/her/its intention to seek arbitration no later than 180 days after the event that first gives rise to the dispute. Otherwise his/her/its rights shall be irrevocably waived. The dispute shall be decided by one arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the parties, or absent agreement, in accordance with the Rules. The arbitrator\u2019s fee and other expenses of the arbitration process shall be shared equally. The parties shall bear their own respective costs and attorneys fees. Washington law, to the extent permitted, shall govern all substantive aspects of the dispute and all procedural issues not covered by the Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 22. Adler signed the agreement as did general manager, Christine Serold.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">\u00b64 Adler received another promotion to maintenance and housekeeper director in May 1998. Then on January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>16, 2001, general manager Mark Mullen ordered him to move a commercial dryer, and while moving the dryer, Adler hurt his hip and back. On January 17, 2001, Adler visited his doctor who diagnosed him with hip osteoarthritis and advised him to perform \u201clight duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. On that same day, Adler filed his first claim with the Department of Labor and Industries (DLI).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He sustained additional injuries on June 1, 2001, and January 14, 2002, and filed claims with DLI for these injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 11, 2002, Mullen fired Adler for \u201c \u2018inability to operate all aspects of [the] maintenance department.\u2019 \u201d CP at 6. Fred Lind Manor replaced Adler with a younger employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b65 On October 2, 2002, Adler filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that Fred Lind Manor and Mullen violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e. In December 2002, Fred Lind Manor responded asserting that it had discharged Adler because of poor attendance, failure to meet productivity standards, Adler\u2019s sexual harassment of another employee, unauthorized use of Fred Lind Manor\u2019s facilities, and failure to respect residents\u2019 rights. Fred Lind Manor did not mention the existence of the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b66 On January 9, 2003, the parties attended EEOC mediation. Neither party made reference to the arbitration agreement. Approximately four months after mediation, the EEOC dismissed Adler\u2019s complaint stating that \u201cthe EEOC is unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the statutes.\u201d Fred Lind Manor\u2019s Answer to Mot. for Discretionary Review, Ex. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>f 7 On May 20, 2003, Adler filed a complaint in superior court alleging that Fred Lind Manor violated the WLAD by discriminating against him for his disability, age, and national origin; discharged him for pursuing worker\u2019s benefits in violation of Title 51 ROW; committed the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy; committed the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress; and created a hostile work environment. Fred Lind Manor filed its answer on August 1, 2003, claiming for the first time that Adler must submit his claims to arbitration. Fourteen days later, Fred Lind Manor moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. During a telephone conversation with Adler\u2019s attorney, Fred Lind Manor indicated that at arbitration, it planned to seek dismissal of Adler\u2019s claims pursuant to the 180-day statute of limitations provision of the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b68 In response to Fred Lind Manor\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, Adler claimed he did not understand that the 1995 agreement required him to arbitrate his future claims nor was he given a copy of the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He requested that the court declare the agreement void as unconscionable or, alternatively, find that Fred Lind Manor had waived arbitration. Without holding a hearing, the trial court granted Fred Lind Manor\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b69 Pursuant to RAP 2.3(b)(2), Adler filed a motion for discretionary review to this court asserting that (1) the trial court\u2019s order granting Fred Lind Manor\u2019s motion to compel arbitration violated his right to a jury trial under article I, section 21 of the state constitution; (2) the WLAD mandates a judicial forum; (3) the arbitration agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable and/or its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>provisions violate public policy; (4) Fred Lind Manor waived its right to arbitration by failing to raise it as a defense in a timely manner; and (5) Fred Lind Manor should be equitably estopped from compelling arbitration. He also requested attorney fees and costs under RAP 18.1(a), RAP 14.2, and RCW 49.60.030(2). We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b610 The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, applies to all employment contracts except for employment contracts of certain transportation workers. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 119, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001). Section 2 of the FAA provides that written arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of <em>any </em>contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[s]ection 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S. Ct. 927, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1983) (citing <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Corp., </em>388 U.S. 395, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967)). \u201cThe effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both state and federal courts must enforce this body of substantive arbitrability law. <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 489, 107 S. Ct. 2520, 96 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1987) (citing <em>Southland Corp. v.

Dean, Witter, Reynolds, Inc., </em>101 Wn.2d 585, 590, 681 P.2d 253 (1984). Courts must indulge every presumption \u201cin favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>460 U.S. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"> \u00b611 Although federal and state courts presume arbitrability, \u201cgenerally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc., v. Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S. Ct. 1652, 134 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1996); <em>see also Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, </em>513 U.S. 265, 281, 115 S. Ct. 834, 130 L. Ed. 2d 753 (1995). However, courts may not refuse to enforce arbitration agreements under state laws which apply only to such agreements, <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, </em>517 U.S. at 687 (citing <em>Allied-Bruce, </em>513 U.S. at 281); <em>see also Southland, </em>465 U.S. at 16; <em>Garmo, </em>101 Wn.2d at 590, or by \u201crely[ing] on the <em>uniqueness </em>of an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>482 U.S. at 492 n.9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"> \u00b612 We engage in de novo review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to compel or deny arbitration. <em>Ticknor v. Choice Hotels Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>265 F.3d 931, 936 (9th Cir. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1133 (2002); <em>Stein v. Geonerco, Inc., </em>105 Wn.

The party opposing arbitration bears the burden of showing that the agreement is not enforceable. <em>See Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 92, 121 S. Ct. 513, 148 L. Ed. 2d 373 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">WLAD Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">f 13 Relying on cases holding that an exclusive remedies provision in a collective bargaining agreement does not prevent employees from initiating civil suits in court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>violations of the WLAD, Adler argues that the WLAD requires a judicial forum for discrimination claims of employees. <em>See Reese v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>107 Wn.2d 563, 577, 731 P.2d 497 (1987) (holding that chapter 49.60 RCW permits individual employees to pursue their rights under the WLAD in court without first exhausting remedies in a collective bargaining agreement), <em>overruled on other grounds by Phillips v. City of Seattle, </em>111 Wn.2d 903, 766 P.2d 1099 (1989); <em>Bruce v. N.W. Metal Prods. Co., </em>79 Wn. App. 505, 513, 903 P.2d 506 (1995) (\u201cUnder Washington law, a disability discrimination claim arises out of statute, the WLAD, and is not preempted by any contractual or CBA [collective bargaining agreement] requirements or remedies.\u201d); <em>Ervin v. Columbia Distrib., Inc., </em>84 Wn. App. 882, 891, 930 P.2d 947 (1997) (holding that \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, does not preempt claims brought under Washington\u2019s Minimum Wage Act, chapter 49.46 RCW). The United States Supreme Court, however, has held that in instances where a valid individual employee-employer arbitration agreement exists, the FAA requires that employees arbitrate federal and state law discrimination claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 27-28, 111 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991) (holding that the FAA requires arbitration of age discrimination claims when a valid arbitration agreement exists); <em>Perry, </em>482 U.S. at 491 (FAA preempts state minimum wage law requiring a judicial forum for vindication of wage claims). Moreover, the FAA clearly preempts any state law to the contrary. <em>Id.; Southland, </em>465 U.S. at 16; <em>Garmo, </em>101 Wn.2d at 590. Thus, we reject Adler\u2019s claim that the WLAD entitles him to a judicial forum.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b614 It is black letter law of contracts that the parties to a contract shall be bound by its terms. <em>See Nat\u2019l Bank of Wash. v. Equity Investors, L.P., </em>81 Wn.2d 886, 912-13, 506 P.2d 20 (1973). Adler argues that he should be exempt from the terms of the agreement here because it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. \u201cThe existence of an unconscionable bargain is a question of law for the courts.\u201d <em>Nelson v. McGoldrick, </em>127 Wn.2d 124, 131, 896 P.2d 1258 (1995) (citing <em>Mieske v. Bartell Drug Co., </em>92 Wn.2d 40, 50, 593 P.2d 1308 (1979)). In Washington, we have recognized two categories of unconscionability, substantive and procedural. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Schroeder v. Fageol Motors, Inc., </em>86 Wn.2d 256, 260, 544 P.2d 20 (1975)). \u201cSubstantive unconscionability involves those cases where a clause or term in the contract is alleged to be one-sided or overly harsh . . . .\u201d <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260. \u201c \u2018Shocking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>to the conscience\u2019, \u2018monstrously harsh\u2019, and \u2018exceedingly calloused\u2019 are terms sometimes used to define substantive unconscionability.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>127 Wn.2d at 131 (quoting <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Annuity Bd. of S. Baptist Convention, </em>16 Wn. App. 439, 444, 556 P.2d 552 (1976)). Procedural unconscionability is \u201cthe lack of a meaningful choice, considering all the circumstances surrounding the transaction including \u2018 \u201c[t]he manner in which the contract was entered,\u201d whether each party had \u201ca reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract,\u201d and whether \u201cthe important terms [were] hidden in a maze of fine print.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260 (quoting <em>Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., </em>350 F.2d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 1965))). We have cautioned that \u201cthese three factors [should] not be applied mechanically without regard to whether in truth a meaningful choice existed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b615 We have not explicitly addressed whether a party challenging a contract must show both substantive and procedural unconscionability. However, our decisions in <em>Nelson, </em>127 Wn.2d at 131, and <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260, analyze procedural and substantive unconscionability separately without suggesting that courts must find both to render a contract void. <em>See also M.A. Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp., </em>140 Wn.2d 568, 588, 998 P.2d 305 (2000). A federal district court applying Washington law and the Court of Appeals have interpreted these decisions to mean that a party challenging a contract may allege either substantive or procedural unconscionability. <em>Luna v. Household Fin. Corp., </em>236 F. Supp. 2d 1166, 1174 (W.D. Wash. 2002) (noting that \u201cunder Washington law a contract may be invalidated on procedural unconscionability or substantive unconscionability grounds\u201d); <em>Tjart, </em>107 Wn. App. at 898 (party seeking to avoid enforcement of an arbitration agreement on ground of procedural unconscionability alone).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b616 Fred Lind Manor and amicus, Association of Washington Business (AWB), urge us to require proof of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>substantive and procedural unconscionability to render a contract void as unconscionable. The AWB asserts that a majority of courts adopt this approach since,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">[i]f, despite grossly unequal bargaining power between the parties or other evidence of lack of meaningful choice, the terms of the contract are nonetheless fair, the weaker party has suffered no injury. Likewise, courts should not interfere with the terms of a contract, however \u201charsh\u201d or one-sided, where the parties were of equal bargaining power or where there was no unfairness in the manner in which the contract was executed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Amicus Curiae Br. of AWB at 11. <em>See also </em>8 Samuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 18:10, at 67 (Richard A. Lord, 4th ed. 1998) (\u201c[S]urprise or an inability to bargain with understanding as to the terms of an agreement (procedural unfairness) must culminate in the drafting party\u2019s exacting harsh or unreasonable terms from the other party (substantive unfairness) before the concept of unconscionability becomes applicable in the view of perhaps most jurisdictions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b617 In <em>Maxwell v. Fidelity Financial Services, Inc., </em>184 Ariz. 82, 90, 907 P.2d 51 (1995), the Arizona Supreme Court considered an almost identical argument. There the court held that \u201ca claim of unconscionability can be established with a showing of substantive unconscionability alone, especially in cases involving either price-cost disparity or limitation of remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court, however, reserved the question whether procedural unconscionability alone could render a contract void as unconscionable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b618 We agree with the Arizona Supreme Court. In some instances, individual contractual provisions may be so one-sided and harsh as to render them substantively unconscionable despite the fact that the circumstances surrounding the parties\u2019 agreement to the contract do not support a finding of procedural unconscionability. <em>See </em>2 Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 208 cmt. e (1981) (\u201cParticular terms may be unconscionable whether or not the contract as a whole is unconscionable.\u201d). Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>now hold that substantive unconscionability alone can support a finding of unconscionability. However, since Adler has yet to prove a valid claim of procedural unconscionability, we decline to consider whether it alone will support a claim of unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Procedural Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b619 As noted, to determine whether Adler and Fred Lind Manor\u2019s arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable, we look to the circumstances surrounding their transaction to determine whether Adler lacked meaningful choice: \u201c \u2018[t]he manner in which the contract was entered,\u2019 whether [Adler] had <em>\u2018a </em>reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract,\u2019 and whether \u2018the important terms [were] hidden in a maze of fine print.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Williams, </em>350 F.2d at 449).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\"> \u00b620 First, Adler asserts that the arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract, which he argues, supports his claim of unconscionability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have established the following factors to determine whether an adhesion contract exists: \u201c(1) whether the contract is a standard form printed contract, (2) whether it was \u2018prepared by one party and submitted to the other on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis\u2019, and (3) whether there was \u2018no true equality of bargaining power\u2019between the parties.\u201d <em>Yakima County (W.

In <em>Yakima County Fire Protection District, </em>we noted that \u201cto the extent that the characterization of a contract as an adhesion contract has any relevance to determine the <em>validity </em>of a contract, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>is only in looking for procedural unconscionability.\u201d 122 Wn.2d at 393. However, the fact that an agreement is an adhesion contract does not necessarily render it procedurally unconscionable. <em>See Yakima County Fire Prot.

Paradigm provided a standard form printed arbitration agreement to all of Fred Lind Manor\u2019s employees. <em>See </em>CP at 39. Fred Lind Manor\u2019s representative, Serold, informed employees that they must sign the agreement as a condition of their continued employment, i.e., on a \u201ctake it or leave it basis.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Presumably, employees were not free to negotiate the terms of the agreement with Fred Lind Manor. Thus, there was \u201c \u2018no true equality of bargaining power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yakima County Fire Prot. Dist., </em>122 Wn.2d at 393 (quoting <em>Standard Oil, </em>347 F.2d at 383 n.5). Nonetheless, the fact that Fred Lind Manor and Adler\u2019s arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract does not end our inquiry. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b622 Adler further asserts that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable because his unequal bargaining power precluded him from negotiating terms of the agreement. <em>See </em>Br. of Pet\u2019r at 30-31 (citing <em>Ingle v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1165, 1171 (9th Cir. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1160 (2004)). However, we have held that while unequal bargaining power may exist between parties, the mere existence of unequal bargaining power will not, standing alone, justify a finding of procedural unconscionability. <em>See Yakima County Fire Prot. Dist., </em>122 Wn.2d at 392-93. <em>See also Tjart, </em>107 Wn. App. at 898-99; <em>Pub. Employees Mut. Ins. C v. Hertz Corp., </em>59 Wn. App. 641, 650, 800 P.2d 831 (199,.(\u2018), <em>review denied, </em>116 Wn.2d 1013 (1991); <em>Mendez, </em>111 WA. App. at 459. Rather, the key <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>inquiry for finding procedural unconscionability is whether Adler lacked meaningful choice. <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b623 Adler contends he lacked meaningful choice because the manner in which he entered the contract shows that he was forced to sign the agreement under threat that Fred Lind Manor would fire him, and that his financial circumstances, namely his new daughter and new house, placed pressure on him to sign the agreement. <em>See </em>CP at 84-85. He further avers that he \u201chad no idea what an arbitration was or what it meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84. Fred Lind Manor, however, disputes Adler\u2019s version of the facts asserting that it had no knowledge of Adler\u2019s financial circumstances; that it never threatened to fire him if he refused to sign the agreement; that Serold explained that \u201carbitration was an alternative to going into a lawsuit in court,\u201d CP at 40; and that Adler \u201c Mid not indicate any reservations or reluctance in signing the document, and prior to signing, he read it, seemed to understand it, and absolutely signed it of his own free will.\u2019 \u201d Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Br. at 35 (quoting CP at 305).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b624 Adler also contends that he did not have a reasonable opportunity to understand the arbitration agreement since his limited English impaired his ability to fully comprehend its provisions. On the other hand, Fred Lind Manor claims that Serold explained the terms of the agreement and that Adler appeared to understand its terms. Perhaps most importantly, Adler admits that he pondered the arbitration agreement for a week and presumably, had ample opportunity to contact counsel and inquire about the meaning of its terms. <em>See </em>CP at 85. We conclude therefore that the evidence here weighs against Adler\u2019s claim that he did not have a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b625 Further, the important terms were not hidden in a \u201cmaze of fine print.\u201d <em>See </em>CP at 22. First, this short half page agreement is clearly labeled \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d in boldface type and normal font. <em>Id. </em>The first sentence explicitly states, \u201cI hereby agree that any dispute related to my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>employment relationship shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration.\u201d lb. Thus, this circumstance of Adler and Fred Lind Manor\u2019s transaction does not support Adler\u2019s claim of procedural unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">126 Nevertheless, we have cautioned that these factors should \u201cnot be applied mechanically without regard to whether in truth a meaningful choice existed.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>127 Wn.2d at 131. Although Fred Lind Manor appears to have provided Adler with a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the agreement, and the important terms were not hidden, Adler and Fred Lind Manor offer remarkably different versions of the facts pertaining to the manner in which the contract was entered into. <em>Cf. Luna, </em>236 F. Supp. 2d at 1177 (holding that the plaintiff had failed to establish procedural unconscionability since he had a reasonable opportunity to consider the agreement and the arbitration clause was clearly set forth in the contract). Consequently, we cannot make a determination of procedural unconscionability without further factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b627 When disputes exist as to the circumstances surrounding an agreement, we remand to the trial court to make additional findings. <em>See Nelson, </em>127 Wn.2d at 136. If Fred Lind Manor\u2019s representative threatened to fire him for refusing to sign the agreement despite the fact that Adler raised concerns with its terms or indicated a lack of understanding, the manner of the transaction would lend support to Adler\u2019s claim of procedural unconscionability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(noting that undue pressure placed on a party at the time she entered into the agreement may lend support to a claim of unconscionability). However, if, as Fred Lind Manor contends, Serold explained the document and/or offered to answer Adler\u2019s concerns or questions, such facts will not lend support to Adler\u2019s claim of procedural unconscionability <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>16 Wn. App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>445 (noting that lack of evidence of \u201cdeceptive sale practices, fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence, duress, high-pressure tactics, overreaching, [or] fine print,\u201d will not support a claim of unconscionability). Accordingly, we remand Adler\u2019s case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Substantive Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b628 Adler contends that the agreement\u2019s unilateral application renders it substantively unconscionable. He further argues that the arbitration agreement\u2019s fee-splitting, attorney fees, and limitations provisions are substantively unconscionable. Fred Lind Manor disputes Adler\u2019s claims countering that he improperly relies on California and Ninth Circuit law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>Unilateral Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b629 Relying on <em>Ingle, </em>328 F.3d at 1174, Adler argues that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because it applies only to disputes brought by employees, not to disputes brought by Fred Lind Manor against its employees. Fred Lind Manor, however, claims that the agreement is bilateral since it also requires Fred Lind Manor to arbitrate any of its disputes brought against its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b630 To interpret the meaning of a contract\u2019s terms, Washington courts employ the context rule. <em>Berg v. Hudesman, </em>115 Wn.2d 657, 667, 801 P.2d 222 (1990). The context rule requires that we determine the intent of the parties by viewing the contract as a whole, which includes the subject matter and intent of the contract, examination of the circumstances surrounding its formation, subsequent acts and conduct of the parties, the reasonableness of the respective interpretations advanced by the parties, and statements made by the parties during preliminary negotiations, trade usage, and/or course of dealing. 25 David K. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>DeWolf &amp; Keller W. Allen, Washington Practice, Contract Law and Practice \u00a7 5.5 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b631 The text of the agreement here, as well as the parties\u2019 statements and conduct, support Fred Lind Man- or\u2019s claim that the agreement also requires it to arbitrate its disputes against employees. First, at the time the arbitration agreements were executed, then-manager Serold informed employees that the arbitration agreement reflected management\u2019s policy that all employment disputes, \u201cwhether by employer or an employee,\u201d be subject to binding arbitration instead of a lawsuit in court. CP at 39-40. Serold also indisputably acted in her role as Fred Lind Manor\u2019s representative when she signed Adler\u2019s and other employees\u2019 agreements on Fred Lind Manor\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Most importantly, the agreement provides, \u201c[t]he <em>aggrieved party </em>must deliver to the other party a written notice of <em>his /her/its </em>intention to seek arbitration .... Otherwise <em>his! her \u00a1its rights </em>shall be irrevocably waived.\u201d CP at 22 (emphasis added). This provision does not single out individual employees\u2019 disputes against Fred Lind Manor. Rather, it refers generically to the \u201caggrieved party,\u201d and, by use of the words \u201chis/her/its,\u201d clearly contemplates suits brought by Fred Lind Manor against its employees. CP at 22. Thus, we reject Adler\u2019s argument that this arbitration agreement applies unilaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>Fee-Splitting Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b632 Next, Adler argues that the agreement\u2019s fee-splitting provision is substantively unconscionable because the cost of arbitration would effectively bar him from bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>his claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Conversely, Fred Lind Manor argues that pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 91-92, Adler has failed to meet his burden to produce evidence showing that the fee-splitting provision makes arbitration prohibitively expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b633 As noted in <em>Zuver, </em>the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged that arbitration fees may prohibit employees from bringing their discrimination claims but held that \u201cwhere ... a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.\u201d <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 92. In <em>Zuver </em>we further held that in order for a party opposing arbitration to meet his burden of showing the likelihood of incurring excessive costs, the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Mendez, </em>111 Wn. App. 446, sets forth the proper approach. There the court held that by producing an affidavit describing his personal finances as well as fee information obtained from the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Seattle office, the party opposing arbitration, Mendez, had provided sufficient evidence to prove that the fee-splitting provision in his arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable. <em>Id. </em>at 467-68. Unlike Mendez, Adler has failed to provide any specific information about the arbitration fees he will be required to share and why such fees would effectively prohibit him from bringing his claims. Consequently, he has not met his burden here to show that the agreement\u2019s fee-splitting provision is substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b634 Although Adler has failed to meet his burden, we hesitate to reach a final decision about the substantive conscionability of the agreement\u2019s fee-splitting provision. In similar circumstances, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has remanded the case to the trial court and permitted limited discovery on the issue of whether such fees would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>effectively prohibit arbitration. <em>Blair v. Scott Specialty Gases, </em>283 F.3d 595, 610 (3d Cir. 2002); <em>Alexander v. Anthony Int\u2019l, L.P., </em>341 F.3d 256, 268 (3d Cir. 2003). Like the Third Circuit, we believe that Adler should have the opportunity to prove that the costs of arbitration would prohibit him from vindicating his claims. Therefore, on remand the trial court should provide the parties with the opportunity to engage in limited discovery regarding the costs of arbitration. On remand, \u201c[o]nce prohibitive costs are established, the opposing party [Fred Lind Manor] must present contrary offsetting evidence to enforce arbitration.\u201d <em>Mendez, </em>111 Wn. App. at 470. Such evidence may include an offer to pay all or part of the arbitration fees and costs. <em>See Zuver, </em>153 Wn. 2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\n<em>Attorney Fees Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b635 The arbitration agreement provides that \u201c[t]he parties shall bear their own respective costs and attorneys fees.\u201d CP at 22. Adler contends that this provision is substantively unconscionable because it is one-sided and overly harsh requiring him to waive the right to recover his attorney fees and costs under RCW 49.60.030(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Fred Lind Manor, on the other hand, asserts that this provision,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">provides only that the employer need not pay plaintiff\u2019s fees and costs leading up to and during the hearing; it does not hamper a prevailing claimant\u2019s right to attorney fees under the WLAD after ultimately prevailing. Both the Agreement and the rules provide that Washington law, including the WLAD, governs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Br. at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b636 We do not find Fred Lind Manor\u2019s interpretation of this provision persuasive. It is a well-known principle of contract interpretation that \u201cspecific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>guage.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 203(c) (1981). While the agreement generally provides that \u201cWashington law, to the extent permitted, shall govern all substantive aspects of the dispute and all procedural issues not covered by the Rules,\u201d the agreement\u2019s attorney fees provision specifically and unambiguously states that the \u201cparties <em>shall </em>bear their own respective costs and attorneys fees.\u201d CP at 22 (emphasis added). Moreover, any ambiguity between these arguably conflicting provisions is resolved against the drafter, Fred Lind Manor. <em>See </em>25 DeWolf &amp; Allen, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.4. Consequently, this provision effectively undermines a plaintiff\u2019s rights to attorney fees under RCW 49.60.030(2) and \u201chelps . . . the party with a substantially stronger bargaining position and more resources, to the disadvantage of an employee needing to obtain legal assistance.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>341 F.3d at 267. <em>See also Brooks v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>297 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2002) (noting that an arbitration agreement which restricts recovery of attorney fees would prevent plaintiffs from vindicating their statutory rights under Title VII). Thus, we hold that the attorney fees provision of the agreement is substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\n<em>Limitation on Actions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b637 Adler also argues the arbitration agreement\u2019s 180-day statute of limitations is substantively unconscionable because it provides for a substantially shorter limitations period than he is entitled to under the WLAD. Chapter 49.60 RCW, however, does not expressly provide for a particular statute of limitations for employment discrimination claims. Instead, courts have applied the general three-year statute of limitations in RCW 4.16.080(2) to WLAD claims reasoning that violations of chapter 49.60 RCW amount to an invasion of a person\u2019s legal rights. <em>Nearing v. Golden State Foods Corp., </em>114 Wn.2d 817, 820, 792 P.2d 500 (1990); <em>Lewis v. Lockheed Shipbldg. &amp; Constr. Co., </em>36 Wn.

Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>42 Wn. App. 692, 696, 713 P.2d 742, <em>review denied, </em>105 Wn.2d 1016 (1986)). Fred Lind Manor is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b639 As noted, Washington courts have established that a contract\u2019s limitations provision will \u201cprevail over general statutes of limitations unless prohibited by statute or public policy, or unless they are unreasonable.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>42 Wn. App. at 696; <em>State Ins. Co. v. Meesman, </em>2 Wash. 459, 463, 27 P. 77 (1891); 51 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Limitation of Actions </em>\u00a7 95 (2000). No statute explicitly prohibits Fred Lind Manor and Adler from adopting a shorter limitation provision for WLAD claims in their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b640 Numerous courts have considered whether limitations provisions in arbitration agreements and/or adhesion contracts are substantively unconscionable. Some have held that six-month limitations provisions for Title VII claims are reasonable, but that shorter limitations periods, i.e., 30 days, are substantively unconscionable. <em>Soltani v. </em>W.&amp;S. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>258 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir. 2001) (upholding a six-month limitations provision in an employment contract); <em>Taylor v. W.&amp;S. Life Ins. Co., </em>966 F.2d 1188, 1206 (7th Cir. 1992) (upholding a six-month limitation period). <em>Cf. Alexander, </em>341 F.3d at 267 (holding that a 30-day limitations provision is substantively unconscionable); <em>Plaskett v. Bechtel Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>243 F. Supp. 2d 334, 341 (D.V.I. 2003) (holding that a 30-day limitations provision is substantively unconscionable). The Ninth Circuit has held that even one-year limitations provisions are substantively unconscionable because they deprive plaintiffs the benefit of the continuing violation and tolling doctrines under federal and state discrimination laws. <em>Ingle, </em>328 F.3d at 1175; <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, </em>279 F.3d 889, 894-95 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1112 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u00b641 We agree with the Ninth Circuit. By limiting the period of time in which its employees may bring discrimination claims, Fred Lind Manor obtains unfair advantages. First, in order to timely pursue his claim against Fred Lind Manor at arbitration, an employee may be forced to forgo the opportunity to file his complaint and have that complaint investigated and mediated by the EEOC or Washington Human Rights Commission (WHRC). <em>See </em>RCW 49.60.230(2) (complaint filed with the WHRC under the WLAD \u201cmust be so filed within six months after the alleged act of discrimination\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (e)(1) (under Title VII, plaintiff must file an employment discrimination charge with the EEOC either 180 or 300 days after an \u201calleged unlawful employment practice occurred\u201d). Moreover, because the agreement demands that an employee \u201cdeliver to the other party a written notice of his/her/its intention to seek arbitration no later than 180 days <em>after the event that first gives rise to the dispute,\u201d </em>that employee could be barred from seeking those damages for a hostile work environment arising out of discriminatory behavior which occurred outside the limitations period. CP at 22 (emphasis added). <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 117, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002) (holding that a plaintiff alleging a hostile work environment claim under Title VII may seek damages for all behavior contributing to a hostile work environment claim, <em>including </em>behavior allegedly occurring outside the limitations period, \u201c[p]rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The agreement\u2019s language requiring written notice within 180 days of \u201cthe event that <em>first </em>gives rise to the dispute,\u201d could be interpreted to insulate the employer from potential liability for violative behavior occurring outside the limitations period by establishing a liability cut-off if notice of the <em>first </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>violative behavior is not given within 180 days. CP at 22 (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold that the 180-day limitations provision in the agreement unreasonably favors Fred Lind Manor and thus is substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Severance of the Substantively Unconscionable Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b642 Fred Lind Manor urges us to sever any provisions we find to be substantively unconscionable arguing that the essential term of the parties\u2019 bargain, i.e., arbitration, should be retained. Adler, however, contends that because the substantively unconscionable provisions pervade the entire agreement, we should refuse to sever those provisions and declare the entire agreement void. <em>See Ingle, </em>328 F.3d at 1180 (holding that the employer\u2019s \u201cinsidious pattern\u201d of seeking to tip the scales in its favor during employment disputes justified a decision to declare the entire agreement unenforceable). The 2 <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 208 (1981) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the time the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the contract, <em>or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term, </em>or may so limit the application of any unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">(Emphasis added.) For contracts concerning leases, sales, real property, and retail installments, our legislature has adopted the <em>Restatement </em>position directing that in cases where these contracts are found to contain an unconscionable provision, courts may \u201cenforce the remainder of the . . . contract without the unconscionable clause.\u201d RCW 62A.2A-108(1); RCW 62A.2-302; RCW 64.34.080; RCW 63.14.136.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b643 The <em>Restatement </em>position concerning severance of unconscionable provisions should also apply in cases where courts are confronted with substantively unconscionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>provisions in employment arbitration agreements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Accord Helstrom v.

Application of this rule facilitates the accomplishment of important federal and state public policies favoring arbitration of disputes. <em>See Gannon, </em>262 F.3d at 682 (noting that if courts declared an entire arbitration agreement invalid even if the agreement contained only one invalid provision, such a result would discourage parties from arbitrating their disputes).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b644 Nonetheless, we acknowledge that in instances where an employer engages in an \u201cinsidious pattern\u201d of seeking to tip the scales in its favor in employment disputes by inserting numerous unconscionable provisions in an arbitration agreement, courts may decline to sever the unconscionable provisions. <em>Ingle, </em>328 F.3d at 1180. In this case, however, Adler and Fred Lind Manor\u2019s arbitration agreement contains just two substantively unconscionable provisions. The primary thrust of their agreement is the agreement to arbitrate. Consequently, we can sever the unconscionable attorney fees and limitations provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>without disturbing the primary intent of the parties to arbitrate their disputes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Spinetti, </em>324 F.3d at 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Jury Trial Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b645 Adler argues that compelling him to arbitrate his disputes violates his jury trial rights under article I, section 21 of the Washington Constitution because he did not \u201cknowing [ly], voluntar[ily], and intelligent [ly]\u201d waive his right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Br. of Pet\u2019r at 13.

We rejected Hartford Insurance\u2019s argument reasoning that \u201c [b]y agreeing in the insurance policy it drafted to arbitrate its dispute with the Godfreys, Hartford voluntarily submitted itself to the jurisdiction of [the state arbitration act], and it waived the right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b646 Despite Adler\u2019s arguments to the contrary, our decision in <em>Godfrey </em>does not support his assertion that his jury trial rights were violated when he signed an agreement to arbitrate disputes with his employer. The crux of our decision in <em>Godfrey, </em>142 Wn.2d at 898, was that by knowingly and voluntarily agreeing to arbitration, a party implicitly waives his right to a jury trial by agreeing to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>alternate forum, arbitration. <em>See also Nat\u2019l Bank of Wash. v. Equity Investors, </em>81 Wn.2d 886, 912, 506 P.2d 20 (1973) (\u201cOne cannot, in the absence of fraud, deceit or coercion be heard to repudiate his own signature voluntarily and knowingly fixed to an instrument whose contents he was in law bound to understand.\u201d). In <em>Malted Mousse, Inc. v. Steinmetz, </em>we affirmed this conclusion noting that by agreeing to arbitration, parties \u201cgenerally waive their right to a jury.\u201d 150 Wn.2d 518, 526, 79 P.3d 1154 (2003). <em>Accord Cooper v. MRM Inv. Co., </em>367 F.3d 493, 506 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that by agreeing to an arbitral forum, an employee necessarily waives his right to a jury trial); <em>Burden v. Check Into Cash of Ky., LLC, </em>267 F.3d 483, 492 (6th Cir. 2001) (\u201cAs to the failure of the arbitration clause to include a jury waiver provision, \u2018the \u201closs of the right to a jury trial is a necessary and fairly obvious consequence of an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sydnor v.

Coates, </em>125 F. Supp. 2d 819, 834 (S.D. Miss. 2001) (by agreeing to arbitration, the parties implicitly waive their right to a jury trial), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>34 Fed. Appx. 964 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b647 Nonetheless, as discussed <em>supra, </em>disputes still remain about the manner in which Adler entered into the arbitration agreement with Fred Lind Manor. Consequently, we decline to hold here that Adler knowingly and voluntarily entered into the arbitration agreement with Fred Lind Manor. On remand, if the trial court concludes that Fred Lind Manor\u2019s representative threatened to fire him if he refused to sign the agreement despite the fact he raised concerns with its terms or indicated a lack of understanding, then the evidence here would not support Fred Lind Manor\u2019s claim that Adler knowingly and voluntarily agreed to arbitration, and thus implicitly waived his right to a jury trial. However, if as Fred Lind Manor contends, its representative explained the document and offered to answer Adler\u2019s concerns or questions, Adler\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b648 Adler also argues that Fred Lind Manor waived its right to compel arbitration by waiting until August 2003 before invoking the arbitration agreement. In <em>Steele v. Lundgren, </em>Division One of the Court of Appeals set forth the following three factors to determine whether a party waives his right to compel arbitration under the FAA: \u201c \u2018(1) knowledge of an existing right to compel arbitration, (2) acts inconsistent with that right, and (3) prejudice.\u2019 \u201d 85 Wn. App. 845, 849, 935 P.2d 671, <em>review denied, </em>133 Wn.2d 1014 (1997) (quoting <em>Kinsey v. Bradley, </em>53 Wn. App. 167, 169, 765 P.2d 1329 (1989)); <em>see also Brundridge v. Fluor Fed. Servs., Inc., </em>109 Wn. App. 347, 356, 35 P.3d 389 (2001), <em>review denied, </em>146 Wn.2d 1022 (2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 906 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b649 Fred Lind Manor has not acted in a manner here which suggests waiver. Although Fred Lind Manor participated in EEOC mediation without mentioning the existence of the arbitration agreement, mediation does not amount to commencement of legal action. Rather, mediation provides a mechanism to promote settlement of disputes prior to legal action and is nonbinding on either party. <em>See Steele, </em>85 Wn. App. at 854 (\u201c [Mediation, because it is not binding, is more a tool to facilitate settlement than an alternative to trial. . . . Parties should be able to pursue settlement at any time without being viewed as acting inconsistently with arbitration.\u201d). Further, Fred Lind Manor raised its defense of arbitration in its initial answer to Adler\u2019s complaint and promptly moved to compel arbitration after serving its answer. Thus, we conclude that Fred Lind Manor neither commenced litigation nor ignored arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Equitable Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b650 Adler alternatively urges us to apply the principle of equitable estoppel against Fred Lind Manor. \u201cEquitable estoppel may apply where there has been an admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>sion, statement or act which has been justifiably relied upon to the detriment of another party.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell &amp; Gwinn, L.L.C., </em>146 Wn.2d 1, 19, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). To establish equitable estoppel, Adler must show that Fred Lind Manor (1) made an admission, act, or statement inconsistent with a later claim; (2) Adler relied on Fred Lind Manor\u2019s admission, act, or statement; and (3) Adler would suffer injury if Fred Lind Manor \u201cis allowed to contradict or repudiate the earlier admission, act or statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b651 Adler contends that \u201cFred Lind Manor, knowing that Mr. Adler was unaware of the Arbitration Agreement and its 180[-]day limitations period, deliberately failed to provide him notice of the agreement after they were put on notice of Mr. Adler\u2019s Charge of Discrimination.\u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 35. Adler, however, fails to show that Fred Lind Manor acted inconsistently or made inconsistent statements. While Fred Lind Manor responded to Adler\u2019s EEOC complaint and participated in EEOC mediation without mentioning the existence of the arbitration agreement, these procedures do not amount to initiation of judicial proceedings; thus, Fred Lind Manor was not obligated to invoke arbitration. <em>See Steele, </em>85 Wn. App. at 854. Because Adler must establish all three elements of equitable estoppel, he has failed to meet his burden here. <em>See Campbell &amp; Gwinn, </em>146 Wn.2d at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b652 Lastly, Adler asserts that this court should award him attorney fees for this appeal pursuant to RAP 18.1(a) and RCW 49.60.030(2). RAP 18.1(a) advises that this court will award attorney fees \u201c[i]f applicable law grants to a party the right to recover reasonable attorney fees or expenses on review before either the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.\u201d However, the applicable law here, RCW 49.60.030(2), permits an attorney fees award only when a plaintiff prevails on his discrimination claim. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>does not, as Adler contends, authorize attorney fees in connection with opposing a motion to compel arbitration.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b653 We reject Adler\u2019s claims that the WLAD entitles him to a judicial forum, that Fred Lind Manor has waived its right to arbitrate this dispute, and/or that Fred Lind Manor should be equitably estopped from asserting arbitration. However, we conclude that the attorney fees and limitations provisions of the arbitration agreement are substantively unconscionable but sever these provisions from the agreement thus preserving the parties\u2019 intent to arbitrate their disputes. We remand to the trial court for determination, consistent with this opinion, of Adler\u2019s claims of procedural unconscionability, including whether Adler implicitly waived his right to a jury trial and the substantive conscionability of the fee-splitting provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Alexander, C.J., and Johnson, Sanders, Ireland, Chambers, Owens, and Fairhurst, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\"> Adler claims that he made a request to Mullen that Fred Lind Manor provide him with light duty pursuant to his doctor\u2019s orders, but Mullen failed to accommodate his hip injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> Adler also asserts that on other occasions, Mullen criticized Adler\u2019s claims to DLI, made fun of his accent, criticized him for hiring \u201cforeigners,\u201d and ridiculed him for his Polish origin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> Fred Lind Manor disputes Adler\u2019s claim that he never received a copy of the arbitration agreement. It notes that within one month of his termination, Adler requested a copy of his personnel file, which contained the arbitration agreement, and that he was permitted to inspect, examine, and copy his file. Fred Lind Manor contends Adler\u2019s action is verified by handwritten numbers he placed on the pages of his file while examining it.

Br. of Pet\u2019r at 23.

He asserts that this lends further support to his claim that the agreement applies unilaterally. We do not find this argument compelling.

However, Washington courts have <em>not </em>applied the rule set forth in <em>Saletic </em>to cases involving contracts that contain unconscionable provisions which could be severed from the remainder of the contract. <em>See, e.g., Baffin Land Corp. v.

The Ninth Circuit has recently held that an arbitration agreement entered into as a condition of employment is enforceable, notwithstanding the purposes of and remedies available under Title VII. <em>EEOC v.

The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>overturned its prior case law to the contrary in light of <em>Gilmer v.

In <em>Gilmer, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that an age discrimination claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, was subject to compulsory arbitration pursuant to an agreement in a securities registration application.</p>\n<author id=\"AR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Madsen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u00b655 Although the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision might be criticized as not necessarily flowing from <em>Gilmer </em>in that it may have blurred the issue of compulsory arbitration with the issue of compelling an employee to enter into an arbitration agreement, its result nevertheless appears to be correct given the logic of <em>Gilmer </em>and <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001). In these and similar cases the court has declared that agreements providing for compulsory arbitration are enforceable, even as to claims of unlawful discrimination, and are enforceable in the employment setting. The Court\u2019s cases demonstrate a strong preference for arbitration regardless of the oftentimes compulsory nature of the agreements. Thus, it is no great leap of logic to conclude that regardless of whether one is given a choice of signing an arbitration agreement in order to obtain employment or to continue employment, the law and policy favoring enforcement of compulsory arbitration also favors enforcement of an agreement to which an employee must agree to become or remain employed. The employee will rarely be in a position to complain other than by choosing to decline employment or continued employment. Any other view would essentially negate arbitration agreements in the workplace, contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b656 I concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
