Their daughter, Jean Owen, brought a wrongful death action against the State of Washington, Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad Company, and the city of Tukwila on behalf of her parents. Burlington Northern settled, and on summary judgment, the action against both the city and the State was dismissed by the King County Superior Court. Division One of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the suit against the State but reversed the order dismissing the city of Tukwila. Owen petitioned this court for discretionary review of the dismissal of the suit against the State, and the city of Tukwila cross-petitioned for review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 reinstatement of Owen\u2019s claim against it. We denied Owen\u2019s petition for review and accepted the city of Tukwila\u2019s cross-petition for review on September 5, 2003. We conclude that there are genuine and material facts as to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>roadway was maintained in a reasonably safe condition for ordinary travel. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"APWI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Chambers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">\u00b62 The fatal accident occurred at the intersection of South 180th Street and a set of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad Company (BNSF) railroad tracks in Tukwila, Washington. Three sets of railroad tracks intersect South 180th Street near the site of the accident. The eastern and middle sets of tracks are owned by BNSF, and the western set of tracks is owned by Union Pacific. West of the railroad tracks, South 180th Street intersects with 72nd Avenue South and the West Valley Highway. Both intersections are controlled by traffic signals. There is a crown in the road as it intersects with the railroad tracks, which allegedly limits westbound drivers\u2019 view of the traffic signals and any approaching trains. South 180th Street is a heavily traveled four lane road, and the three railroad tracks that intersect it are also heavily used by high-speed trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\u00b63 Glenn and Margie Nelson, ages 75 and 76, were traveling west on South 180th Street during Friday rush hour traffic. When the flow of traffic came to a halt due to the Tukwila traffic signals west of the railroad crossings, several vehicles, including the Nelsons\u2019, were stopped in the railroads\u2019 right of way. The truck in front of the Nelsons\u2019 vehicle was stopped on the eastern set of tracks when the truck\u2019s driver was alerted by a passenger that a train was approaching. The truck moved forward off the tracks and into safety. Unfortunately, as the truck pulled forward, so did the Nelsons\u2019 vehicle. After the Nelsons\u2019 vehicle pulled forward, the railroad light and bell signals activated and an automatic gate came down behind the Nelsons\u2019 vehicle, indicating a train was approaching within 20 seconds. The Nelsons tried to move forward and off the tracks, striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the truck in front of them. The truck, however, was already touching the vehicle in front of it and could not move any farther forward. The train struck the Nelsons\u2019 vehicle, instantly killing Margie in the passenger seat. Glenn, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, died later at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">f 4 In her second amended complaint, Owen makes several allegations of negligence by the city of Tukwila, ranging from failing to maintain South 180th Street in a safe condition, to failing to provide adequate warning of the dangers posed by the railroad crossings, to failing to adjust traffic control devices to prevent the dangers posed by the railroad crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\u00b65 Tukwila presented two arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment. Tukwila\u2019s main argument was that the claims against it should be dismissed because the decedents\u2019 \u201cown conduct removes the [decedents] from the class of persons to whom the city owes a duty.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 835; <em>see also </em>CP at 143 (\u201c[S]ummary judgment should be granted because [decedents\u2019] failure to exercise ordinary care for their own safety removes them from any duty owed by the City.\u201d). Additionally, Tukwila argued that it was not liable for damages arising from the accident because it had complied with all statutes, ordinances, and the <em>Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices </em>(2d ed. 1988) (MUTCD).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">\u00b66 The trial court granted Tukwila\u2019s motion for summary judgment and issued an order dismissing all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Tukwila. In summarizing its reasoning, the trial court stated: \u201cI\u2019m simply not persuaded that a reasonable jury could find under the facts and circumstances here .. . that there was any negligence by the City of Tukwila.\u201d CP at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">\u00b67 The Court of Appeals quickly and appropriately disposed of Tukwila\u2019s primary argument that it did not owe any duty to the Nelsons. <em>Owen v. Burlington N. Santa Fe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number><em>R.R., </em>114 Wn. App. 227, 232-33, 56 P.3d 1006 (2002). After noting that a municipality\u2019s duty to maintain its roadways reasonably safe for ordinary travel is owed to all persons, whether fault-free or negligent, <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Keller v. City of Spokane, </em>146 Wn.2d 237, 249, 44 P.3d 845 (2002)), the appellate court held evidence of the Nelsons\u2019 negligence does not \u201cexcuse the City from its duty\u201d and does not \u201cjustify the order of dismissal.\u201d <em>Owen, </em>114 Wn. App. at 233. The Court of Appeals also reasoned that the MUTCD<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed duties upon Tukwila, <em>Owen, </em>114 Wn. App. at 234-35, and held that Owen had raised an issue of material fact with respect to Tukwila\u2019s duty under the MUTCD, reasoning that \u201ca reasonable jury could conclude [based upon the evidence in the record] that unusual circumstances were present at the crossing, requiring more than normal signage and warnings to prevent motorists from being trapped in the path of an approaching train.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. Accordingly, the order dismissing Owen\u2019s claims against Tukwila was reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">\u00b68 The Court of Appeals did not reach whether, as a matter of law, the roadway was inherently dangerous or misleading. <em>Id. </em>at 240. Nor did the Court of Appeals reach proximate cause. <em>Id. </em>The appellate court below declined to reach these issues because Tukwila did not raise the former issue in its motion for summary judgment and abandoned the latter issue on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41. We granted the city\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\u00b69 First, we emphasize that the question before us is whether Owen has produced sufficient evidence of the city\u2019s negligence, and not any question of the potential comparative fault of the Nelsons. It is well established that Tukwila owes a duty to all travelers, whether negligent or fault-free, to maintain its roadways in a condition safe for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>ordinary travel. <em>See Keller, </em>146 Wn.2d at 249. Owen alleges a breach of that duty and a resulting injury. Any negligence on the part of the decedents is irrelevant to whether a material question of fact regarding the alleged breach of Tukwila\u2019s duty survives summary judgment. That is not to say that any negligence on the part of the decedents is irrelevant to the cause of action and may be raised by the city when appropriate. <em>See </em>RCW 4.22.005.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">\u00b6 10 We also emphasize our standard of review. We review summary judgment orders de novo and perform the same inquiry as the trial court. <em>Hisle v. Todd Pac. Shipyards Corp., </em>151 Wn.2d 853, 860, 93 P.3d 108 (2004). We examine the pleadings, affidavits, and depositions before the trial court and \u201ctake the position of the trial court and assume facts [and reasonable inferences] most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Ruff v. King County, </em>125 Wn.2d 697, 703, 887 P.2d 886 (1995) (citing <em>Hartley v. State, </em>103 Wn.2d 768, 774, 698 P.2d 77 (1985)). Owen is the nonmoving party. Thus, all facts and reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to her. <em>See id. </em>Summary judgment is proper if the record before the trial court establishes \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d CR 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\"> \u00b6 11 We first examine the duty, if any, of the city. Today, governmental entities are held to the same negligence standards as private individuals. <em>See Keller, </em>146 Wn.2d at 242-43. Liability for negligence does not require a direct statutory violation, though a statute, regulation, or other positive enactment may help define the scope of a duty or the standard of care. <em>Cf. Bauman v. Crawford, </em>104 Wn.2d 241, 244-45, 704 P.2d 1181 (1985). The MUTCD provides at least some evidence of the appropriate duty. <em>See </em>RCW 47.36.030; WAC 468-95-010; <em>see also Kitt v. Yakima County, </em>93 Wn.2d 670, 611 P.2d 1234 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\u00b612 Tukwila acknowledges that it has a duty to provide reasonably safe roads and this duty includes the duty to safeguard against an inherently dangerous or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>misleading condition. A city\u2019s duty to eliminate an inherently dangerous or misleading condition is part of the overarching duty to provide reasonably safe roads for the people of this state to drive upon. <em>See Keller, </em>146 Wn.2d at 249. The inherently dangerous formulation recognizes that \u201c[a]s the danger becomes greater, the actor is required to exercise caution commensurate with it.\u201d <em>Ulve v. City of Raymond, </em>51 Wn.2d 241, 246, 317 P.2d 908 (1957). Simply stated, the existence of an unusual hazard may require a city to exercise greater care than would be sufficient in other settings. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 251-52. <em>See also Bartlett v. N. Pac. R.R., </em>74 Wn.2d 881, 882-83, 447 P.2d 735 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">fl3 Whether the roadway was reasonably safe for ordinary travel is, in this case, a material question of fact. Questions of fact may be determined as a matter of law \u201cwhen reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion.\u201d <em>Hartley, </em>103 Wn.2d at 775. If reasonable minds can differ, the question of fact is one for the trier of fact, and summary judgment is not appropriate. We have noted before that \u201cissues of negligence and proximate cause are generally not susceptible to summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ruff, </em>125 Wn.2d at 703 (citing <em>LaPlante v. State, </em>85 Wn.2d 154, 159, 531 P.2d 299 (1975)); <em>accord Gilbert H. Moen Co. v. Island Steel Erectors, Inc., </em>128 Wn.2d 745, 759, 912 P.2d 472 (1996) (noting negligence is ordinarily a question of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">\u00b614 Similarly, whether a condition is inherently dangerous or misleading is generally a question of fact. <em>See Leber v. King County, </em>69 Wash. 134, 124 P. 397 (1912); <em>Provins v. Bevis, </em>70 Wn.2d 131, 422 P.2d 505 (1967); <em>Tanguma v. Yakima County, </em>18 Wn. App. 555, 563, 569 P.2d 1225 (1977); <em>cf. Hewitt v. Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle R.R., </em>66 Wn.2d 285, 291-92, 402 P.2d 334 (1965) (noting unusual circumstances at railroad crossing may allow trier of fact to find crossing \u201cexceptionally dangerous\u201d and \u201cextrahazardous\u201d). Likewise, the adequacy of the government\u2019s attempt to take corrective action is generally a question of fact. <em>E.g., Livingston v. City of Everett, </em>50 Wn. App. 655, 658, 751 P.2d 1199 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\u00b615 We turn now to whether there are any genuine issues as to any material facts. A material fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation. <em>Hisle, </em>151 Wn.2d at 861 (quoting <em>Barrie v. Hosts of Am., Inc., </em>94 Wn.2d 640, 642, 618 P.2d 96 (1980)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\u00b616 According to Owen\u2019s expert and the Tukwila public works director there is a high volume of both vehicle and train traffic at the crossing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The train traffic includes high-speed trains. There are three sets of active railroad tracks and two sets of crossing signals together in close proximity. There are nearby traffic signals which, according to lay witnesses and Owen\u2019s expert, frequently cause queuing of vehicles over the tracks. Additionally, there is an incline in the road as westbound travelers approach the crossings that, according to the lay witness and Owen\u2019s expert, limits drivers\u2019 ability to see the traffic signals or approaching trains.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">\u00b617 If the roadway is inherently dangerous or misleading, then the trier of fact must determine the adequacy of the corrective actions under all of the circumstances. <em>E.g.,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>Goodner v. Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R., </em>61 Wn.2d 12, 17-18, 377 P.2d 231 (1962). If the corrective actions are adequate, then the city has satisfied its duty to provide reasonably safe roads. According to evidence presented by Owen, an array of remedial measures existed ranging from installing a stop sign before the crossings,* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> posting additional signage to give warnings at each approach, extending the detection period to give vehicles more than 20 seconds advanced warning of an approaching train, and upgrading signals, to separating the railway and vehicle grades. The absence of any of these available remedial measures in combination with the particular conditions at this crossing, including the volume of vehicle and high-speed train traffic, the presence of traffic signals that cause vehicles to halt on multiple sets of tracks, and the alleged limited visibility of westbound drivers, provides evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude the roadway was not maintained in a condition reasonably safe for ordinary travel or was inherently dangerous or misleading, requiring warnings or elimination of the particular dangers present.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">\u00b618 Because reasonable minds may differ as to whether the roadway was reasonably safe for ordinary travel, inherently dangerous, or misleading, and whether appropriate corrective action has been taken, questions of material fact exist and summary judgment is inappropriate. We affirm the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>C. Johnson, Sanders, and Owens, JJ., and Ireland, J. Pro Tem., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> The Washington Department of Transportation has adopted the MUTCD. WAC 468-95-010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\"> Tukwila\u2019s argument that it does not have unilateral authority to install a traffic preemption device is unpersuasive. The MUTCD, section 8A-1, provides that a railroad and the highway agency with authority over the roadway have \u201cjoint responsibility in the traffic control function.\u201d CP at 792. Although Tukwila lacks the unilateral authority to install and operate a signal preemption device, any municipality that deems the public safety requires signals or other warning devices at any crossing of a railroad at common grade <em>\u201cshall file </em>with the utilities and transportation commission a petition in writing, alleging that the public safety requires the installation of specified signals or other warning devices at such crossing or specified changes in the method and manner of existing crossing warning devices.\u201d RCW 81.53.261 (emphasis added). Moreover, the statutory requirement in RCW 47.36.050 for railroad owners and operators to post sawbuck signs at crossings and to comply with other laws regulating railroad crossings does not relieve Tukwila of its duty to maintain roadways reasonably safe for ordinary travel. Nor does our holding that federal preemption prohibits municipalities from imposing speed limits or waiting times on railroads by ordinance discharge Tukwila\u2019s duty to maintain its roadway in a condition reasonably safe for ordinary travel. <em>See City of Seattle v.

I reach that conclusion after reviewing the facts in the record and drawing inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Jean Owen, the nonmoving party. This review has satisfied me that there is no question of material fact on the issue of whether Tukwila breached its duty to maintain the roadway in question in a manner that was reasonably safe for ordinary travel. Because the majority reaches an opposite conclusion, I dissent.</p>\n<author id=\"AiZ4\">Alexander, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\u00b620 Although Owen made general allegations regarding what she claims was the negligent design of South 180th Street and the lack of proper signage thereon, the central focus of her argument here revolved around the vague assertion that Tukwila was negligent in not making an effort to obtain installation of a signal preemption device to prevent traffic backups over the railroad tracks where the accident occurred that led to the deaths of Glenn and Margie Nelson. It was on this claim that a majority at Division One of the Court of Appeals determined that there is a material factual question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The problem with that conclusion is that there is no authority or precedent imposing such a duty on the part of a city. Furthermore, the evidence that Owen presented to support her assertion that a signal preemption device would be effective in clearing traffic from the railroad tracks during rush hour was insufficient to withstand a summary judgment dismissing her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>\u00b621 According to the record, a signal preemption device is one that is automatically activated by an approaching train. When activated, it causes traffic lights at intersections in the vicinity of a railroad crossing to turn green. This has the intended effect of allowing traffic to move through the intersections and not become entrapped at a railroad crossing. The device is also designed to give an additional warning of an approaching train in the form of flashing lights at a street intersection that are activated 20 seconds before the train passes through the intersection. The <em>Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices </em>(2d ed. 1988) (MUTCD), which the majority acknowledges has been adopted by the Washington Department of Transportation, recommends that except under \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d signal preemption devices should only be tied into traffic signals that are within 200 feet of a railroad crossing. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 797. Because a signal preemption device gives only an approximate 20 second warning of an approaching train, the farther a traffic light is from railroad tracks, the less effective a signal preemption device will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">\u00b622 This court has held that \u201cbare assertions that a genuine material [factual] issue exists will not defeat a summary judgment motion in the absence of actual evidence.\u201d <em>Trimble v. Wash. State Univ., </em>140 Wn.2d 88, 93, 993 P.2d 259 (2000). In regard to a signal preemption device, Owen relied entirely on the declaration of Dr. John Glennon, a civil engineer who consults on highway safety measures. Dr. Glennon stated that \u201c[t]he subject railroad crossing has a high traffic volume that, because of nearby intersections, commonly queues over the railroad crossing. Because an approaching train does not pre-empt the nearby traffic signals, the probability of having vehicles trapped on the tracks with an approaching train is relatively high.\u201d CP at 628. Dr. Glennon further indicated that South 180th Street is an extremely hazardous roadway that makes it an \u201cunusual circumstance,\u201d which \u201cmay\u201d require the implementation of a signal preemption device. <em>Id. </em>at 360. He did not, however, indicate that Tukwila should have preempted any particular traffic light.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u00b623 Even viewing Dr. Glennon\u2019s declaration in the light most favorable to Owen, it cannot be said that the declaration raises a factual question about Tukwila\u2019s failure to maintain its roadway in a safe condition or its duty to obtain installation of a signal preemption device at the South 180th Street intersection. The signal preemption device that Dr. Glennon referred to would control a traffic light that is located approximately 660 feet west of where the set of Union Pacific tracks cross South 180th Street. <em>Id. </em>at 557; <em>see also id. </em>at 786. Dr. Glennon\u2019s mere speculation that Tukwila may have had an obligation to obtain installation of a signal preemption device at the road/track intersection pertinent to this case, which would be tied to a traffic signal marker located three times beyond the distance recommended by the MUTCD, does not establish a breach of duty by Tukwila.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\u00b624 It is also significant that Tukwila lacked the authority to install a signal preemption device, even assuming that the railroad crossing in question presented an \u201cunusual circumstance.\u201d In that regard, it is clear that the obligation, if any, to install and operate a signal preemption device rests with the railroad company. It is not the municipality\u2019s responsibility. <em>See, e.g., </em>RCW 47.36.050 (railroad company responsible for erecting and maintaining traffic devices in its right-of-way); <em>City of Seattle v. Burlington N. R.R., </em>145 Wn.2d 661, 674, 41 P.3d 1169 (2002) (\u201cThe City\u2019s ordinance that reserves to it the authority to control railroad activities that interfere with city traffic is subject to preemption under the [Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995] and the [Federal Rail Safety Act of 1970].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>\u00b625 While conceding that Tukwila did not have unilateral authority to install a signal preemption device at the road/track intersection, the majority dismisses the point. It relies on the provisions of RCW 81.53.261 for the proposition that Tukwila should have, at the very least, filed a written petition with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, alleging that better warning devices were required for public safety at this crossing. Majority at 789 n.2. In my view, that conclusion is a stretch. A party should bear liability only for the breach of a duty it could fulfill. That party should not have liability for failing to convince another party to fulfill its duty. <em>See </em>RCW 81.53.261 (the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission may order a railroad company to implement additional traffic control devices).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">\u00b626 In sum, there is nothing in the record to show that Tukwila breached its duty to maintain its roadway in a reasonably safe manner for ordinary travel. Tukwila posted the signs and signals it was required to post and then some.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While there is undoubtedly a potential of danger present at any railroad crossing, the record shows that a myriad of signs and devices regulated this crossing. Drivers approaching the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company and Union Pacific railroad tracks from the west, the direction from which the Nelsons came, encounter several warnings including, in order: a large white \u2018X\u201d and \u201cRR\u201d on the pavement; a yellow sign containing a black \u2018X\u201d and the letters \u201cRR\u201d; a white crossbuck sign announcing \u201cRAILROAD CROSSING\u201d; a sign attached to the sign mast that states \u201c2 TRACKS\u201d; and a sign that commands \u201cDO NOT STOP ON THE TRACKS.\u201d CP at 555, 556. In addition, the railroad crossing has flashing light signals and gates, which are automatically activated by approaching trains. When the crossing gates come down, they prevent automobile traffic from proceeding onto the railroad tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u00b627 With the benefit of hindsight, one can always argue that more could have been done to prevent a tragic accident like the one that took the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Nelson. The question, though, is not could the city have done more. The question is: did it breach a duty? In my view it did not, and I would, therefore, reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the summary judgment the trial court granted to Tukwila.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">\u00b628 I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Madsen, Bridge, and Fairhurst, JJ., concur with Alexander, C.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Reconsideration denied July 22, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\"> At the Court of Appeals, it was the plaintiff\u2019s principal contention that Tukwila should have separated the railroad crossing from vehicular traffic by means of an underpass.
