We answer \u201cno\u201d to that question, holding to the well-established definition of the term as \u201cdriving in a rash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d We, therefore, affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in each of the cases before us.</p>\n<author id=\"A4y\">Alexander, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">\n<em>State v. Roggenkamp</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">\u00b62 Michael Roggenkamp was charged in King County Juvenile Court with one count of vehicular homicide and two counts of vehicular assault. The charges stemmed from an incident that occurred in May 2000 at a road intersection near Enumclaw. Then and there a vehicle driven by 16-year-old Roggenkamp struck a vehicle driven by JoAnn Carpenter. When the collision occurred, Roggenkamp was traveling in the wrong lane of traffic at more than twice the speed limit in an attempt to pass another vehicle. Carpenter and a passenger in her car, Andrew Strand, were both severely injured. Another passenger, Carpenter\u2019s son, Michael, died from injuries he received in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u00b63 The charges against Roggenkamp were premised on the \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative of the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In finding Roggenkamp guilty, the trial court determined that driving or operating a vehicle \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d means to \u201coperative] a motor vehicle in a rash and heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d <em>State v. Roggenkamp, </em>115 Wn. App. 927, 935, 64 P.3d 92 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\u00b64 Roggenkamp appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals, Division One, which affirmed. Roggenkamp then sought review by this court, arguing that the trial court erred when it applied the \u201crash and heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences\u201d language, and did not apply the \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d language that appears in the reckless driving statute, RCW 46.61.500(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contended, alternatively, that a superseding event caused the incident that led to the charges against him and that, therefore, his convictions should be reversed and the charges dismissed. We granted Roggenkamp\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\n<em>State v. Clark</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">\u00b65 Jason Ray Clark was charged in Clark County Superior Court with three counts of vehicular assault. The charges arose out of a June 2001 car crash in Vancouver, Washington in which Clark\u2019s speeding vehicle struck a vehicle driven by Deborah Pratt. Pratt and two of Clark\u2019s passengers were seriously injured in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u00b66 Like the charges against Roggenkamp, the charges against Clark were premised on the \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative of the vehicular assault statute. Injury instruction 10, the trial court indicated that \u201cto operate a vehicle in a reckless manner\u201d means driving in a \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 17. The jury found Clark guilty as charged. Clark appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals, Division Two, asserting for the first time that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that one operates a vehicle \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d if he or she drives in a \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. <em>State v. Clark, </em>117 Wn. App. 281, 71 P.3d 224 (2003). Clark subsequently sought review by this court, again raising the question of whether the jury was properly instructed on the definition of \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d We granted Clark\u2019s petition for review and consolidated the review with Roggenkamp\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u00b67 The State contends here, as it did at the Court of Appeals, that Clark waived his right to challenge the adequacy of jury instruction 10 by failing to object to the instruction at trial. We reject this argument. Failure to properly instruct the jury on an element of a charged crime is an error of constitutional magnitude which may be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Stein, </em>144 Wn.2d 236, 241, 27 P.3d 184 (2001); RAP 2.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">A. The appropriate definition of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u00b68 Roggenkamp and Clark each assert that the trial court applied an erroneous definition of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d as that term is used in the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes. They would have us hold that the term is defined by the \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d language that appears in the reckless driving statute, RCW 46.61.500(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> \u00b69 We review a question of statutory construction de novo. <em>State v. Votava, </em>149 Wn.2d 178, 183, 66 P.3d 1050 (2003). Statutory construction begins by reading the text of the statute or statutes involved. If the language is unambiguous, a reviewing court is to rely solely on the statutory language. <em>State v. Avery, </em>103 Wn. App. 527, 532, 13 P.3d 226 (2000) . Where statutory language is amenable to more than one reasonable interpretation, it is deemed to be ambiguous. <em>State v. Keller, </em>143 Wn.2d 267, 276, 19 P.3d 1030 (2001) . Legislative history, principles of statutory construction, and relevant case law may provide guidance in construing the meaning of an ambiguous statute. <em>Fraternal Order of Eagles, Tenino Aerie No. 564 v. Grand Aerie of Fraternal Order of Eagles, </em>148 Wn.2d 224, 243, 59 P.3d 655 (2002) .</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">1. The definition of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d as used in the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes is well settled in our case law</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">\u00b610 The term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d is not defined in either the vehicular homicide statute, RCW 46.61.520, or the vehicular assault statute, RCW 46.61.522. Nor is the term defined elsewhere in the motor vehicle code. However, through a series of decisions by this court, a definition of the term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d for purposes of the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes has evolved and is now well settled. This evolution culminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>in our decision in <em>State v. Bowman, </em>57 Wn.2d 266, 270, 271, 356 P.2d 999 (1960), in which we indicated that driving \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d means \u201cdriving in a rash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u00b611 Roggenkamp and Clark each assert that the Court of Appeals has wavered in its application of the definition of \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d In support of this assertion, they call to our attention three cases in which divisions of that court have applied the \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d language of the reckless driving statute to vehicular assault or vehicular homicide cases. <em>See State v. Hursh, </em>77 Wn. App. 242, 248, 890 P.2d 1066 (1995) (Division One) (vehicular assault); <em>State v. Miller, </em>60 Wn. App. 767, 773, 807 P.2d 893 (1991) (Division Three) (vehicular homicide); and <em>State v. McAllister, </em>60 Wn. App. 654, 658-59, 806 P.2d 772 (1991) (Division Three) (vehicular homicide).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u00b612 We view the <em>McAllister, Miller, </em>and <em>Hursh </em>decisions as aberrations in the long string of cases, stretching back to 1938, that have rejected defining the term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d in vehicular homicide and vehicular assault cases as \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d This position finds support in the fact that Division Three of the Court of Appeals implicitly declined to follow its holdings in <em>Miller </em>and <em>McAllister </em>in a later case in which it explicitly rejected a defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe \u2018reckless manner\u2019 element of vehicular assault is the same as the \u2018willful or wanton disregard\u2019 element of reckless driving.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>90 Wn. App. 41, 47-48, 950 P.2d 977 (1998). In that case, the court held that driving in a \u201c \u2018reckless manner\u2019 . . . means to drive in a rash or heedless manner, with indifference to the consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>2. Principles of statutory interpretation dictate that we not adopt petitioners\u2019 proposed definition of driving \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">\u00b613 The interpretation of driving \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d that petitioners advocate would require us to dismember both the term \u201cin a reckless manner,\u201d as used in the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes, and the term \u201creckless driving,\u201d as used in the reckless driving statute. We say that because, in order to hold that \u201creckless\u201d in the term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d has the same meaning as \u201creckless\u201d in the term \u201creckless driving,\u201d we would have to sever the word \u201creckless\u201d in each of these statutes from the surrounding context and read the word as if it stood alone. We are not inclined to do that because in doing so we would violate fundamental principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\u00b614 A principle consistent with this view is that of noscitur a sociis, which provides that a single word in a statute should not be read in isolation, and that \u201c \u2018the meaning of words may be indicated or controlled by those with which they are associated.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>137 Wn.2d 712, 729, 976 P.2d 1229 (1999) (quoting <em>Ball v. Stokely Foods, Inc., </em>37 Wn.2d 79, 87-88, 221 P.2d 832 (1950)). In <em>Jackson, </em>we applied this principle and held that the word \u201cshelter\u201d in the phrase \u201cfood, water, shelter, clothing, and medically necessary health care,\u201d as used in RCW 9A.42.010(1), should not be isolated and analyzed apart from the words surrounding it. <em>Id. </em>In interpreting statutory terms, a court should \u201c \u2018 \u201ctake into consideration the meaning naturally attaching to them from the context, and . . . adopt the sense of the words which best harmonizes with the context.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dermott v. Kaczmarek, </em>2 Wn. App. 643, 648, 469 P.2d 191 (1970) (quoting 50 Am. Jur. <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 247 (1944))).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\"> \u00b615 In the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes, the word \u201creckless\u201d is plainly part of the term \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d By the same token, the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201creckless\u201d as it appears in the reckless driving statute is part of the term \u201creckless driving.\u201d The terms \u201creckless manner\u201d and \u201creckless driving\u201d both function as single units of meaning in their respective statutes. In each, \u201creckless\u201d functions as an adjective. In the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes, \u201creckless\u201d modifies \u201cmanner.\u201d In the reckless driving statute, on the other hand, \u201creckless\u201d modifies \u201cdriving.\u201d Furthermore, \u201creckless manner\u201d and \u201creckless driving\u201d are each terms of art unique to the state\u2019s motor vehicle laws that have long been employed by the legislature to describe driving offenses. <em>See, e.g., </em>Laws of 1923, ch. 122, \u00a7 2. To carve up the phrases \u201creckless manner\u201d and \u201creckless driving\u201d by severing \u201creckless\u201d from each phrase in order to read it in isolation would clearly violate the dictates of the aforementioned doctrine of noscitur a sociis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\u00b616 Another well-settled principle of statutory construction is that \u201ceach word of a statute is to be accorded meaning.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Schillberg v. Barnett, </em>79 Wn.2d 578, 584, 488 P.2d 255 (1971). \u201c \u00a3[T]he drafters of legislation . . . are presumed to have used no superfluous words and we must accord meaning, if possible, to every word in a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Recall of Pearsall-Stipek, </em>141 Wn.2d 756, 767, 10 P.3d 1034 (2000) (quoting <em>Greenwood v. Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>13 Wn. App. 624, 628, 536 P.2d 644 (1975)). \u00a3\u00a3[W]e may not delete language from an unambiguous statute: \u00a3 \u201cStatutes must be interpreted and construed so that all the language used is given effect, with no portion rendered meaningless or superfluous.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. J.P., </em>149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003) (quoting <em>Davis v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing, </em>137 Wn.2d 957, 963, 977 P.2d 554 (1999) (quoting <em>Whatcom County v. City of Bellingham, </em>128 Wn.2d 537, 546, 909 P.2d 1303 (1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u00b617 Petitioners\u2019 reading of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d runs afoul of the aforementioned principle because it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>render some words in the statute to be without meaning or purpose. Isolating \u201creckless\u201d from the phrase \u201cin a reckless manner,\u201d as petitioners advocate, would render the word \u201cmanner\u201d meaningless and superfluous. Petitioners, in short, would rewrite the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes by stripping out the word \u201cmanner\u201d so that an element of vehicular homicide or vehicular assault is \u201cdriving recklessly.\u201d We should resist doing that because when interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018this court is required to assume the Legislature meant exactly what it said and apply the statute as written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pearsall-Stipek, </em>141 Wn.2d at 767 (quoting <em>In re Custody of Smith, </em>137 Wn.2d 1, 8, 969 P.2d 21 (1998)). In the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes, the legislature said that operating or driving \u201ca vehicle in a <em>reckless manner,\u201d </em>not \u201cdriving recklessly,\u201d was an element of the crime. We must assume that the legislature meant precisely what it said and apply the statute as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\u00b618 Another fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the legislature is deemed to intend a different meaning when it uses different terms. <em>State v. Beaver, </em>148 Wn.2d 338, 343, 60 P.3d 586 (2002) (\u201c[w]hen the legislature uses different words within the same statute, we recognize that a different meaning is intended.\u201d); <em>Simpson Inv. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>141 Wn.2d 139, 160, 3 P.3d 741 (2000) (it is \u201cwell established that when \u2018different words are used in the same statute, it is presumed that a different meaning was intended to attach to each word.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State ex rel. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n v. Rains, </em>87 Wn.2d 626, 634, 555 P.2d 1368 (1976))).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the legislature chose to use the term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d in the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>use the term \u201creckless driving\u201d in another.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the legislature chose different terms, we must recognize that a different meaning was intended by each term.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">\u00b619 The structure of the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes further dictates that \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d not be defined as \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, \u201c[t]here are three alternative means of committing both vehicular homicide and vehicular assault.\u201d <em>Roggenkamp, </em>115 Wn. App. at 935 (footnote omitted). These offenses can be committed in three alternative ways: by operating a motor vehicle either while \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug,\u201d \u201c[i]n a reckless manner,\u201d or \u201c[w]ith disregard for the safety of others.\u201d RCW 46.61.520, .522. If \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d is defined as driving \u201cwith willful or wanton disregard for the safety of others,\u201d the \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative of committing vehicular homicide or vehicular assault would be completely swallowed up and thus rendered meaningless and superfluous. Both the driving \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative and the driving \u201cwith disregard for the safety of others\u201d alternative would apply to the same act, but the \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative would require proof that the defendant acted with willfulness or wantonness. The \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative would be effectively written out of the statute as prosecutors, seeking to avoid having to prove the higher mental state, stopped charging defendants under the \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d alternative. We must assume that when the legislature created three alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ways of committing vehicular homicide and vehicular assault, it meant for each alternative to be distinct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">3. The legislative histories of the vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and reckless driving statutes make clear that \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d was intended to have a meaning distinct from \u201creckless driving\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\u00b620 The present reckless driving statute, RCW 46-.61.500, was enacted in 1965. <em>See </em>Laws of 1965, Ex. Sess., ch. 155, \u00a7 59. However, a statute similar to the current statute was enacted in 1937. Laws of 1937, ch. 189, \u00a7 118. The earlier statute made it unlawful to \u201coperate a motor vehicle in a <em>reckless manner\u201d </em>and directed that <em>\u201c\\f\\or the purpose of this section </em>to \u2018operate in a <em>reckless </em>manner\u2019 shall be construed to mean the operation of a vehicle upon the public highways of this state in such a manner as to indicate either a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The vehicular homicide statute (then known as negligent homicide by means of a motor vehicle) was also enacted in 1937. Laws of 1937, ch. 189, \u00a7 120. It provided that \u201c[w]hen the death of any person shall ensue within one year as a proximate result of injury received by the operation of any vehicle ... in a <em>reckless manner </em>or with disregard for the safety of others, the person so operating such vehicle shall be guilty of negligent homicide by means of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In 1961, all laws relating to motor vehicles, including the 1937 reckless driving and vehicular homicide statutes, were repealed and reenacted as part of the motor vehicle code, Title 46 RCW. Laws of 1961, ch. 12. The 1937 reckless driving statute became RCW 46.56.020, but the language of the statute was unchanged. <em>Id. </em>The vehicular homicide statute became RCW 46.56.040, but the language of that statute, too, was unchanged. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">121 It was in 1965 that the legislature undertook a major revision of the State\u2019s motor vehicle laws that af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>fected nearly the entire motor vehicle code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Laws of 1965, Ex. Sess., ch. 155. As noted above, this effort included a repeal of the 1937 reckless driving statute, Laws of 1965, Ex. Sess., ch. 155, \u00a7 91, and the enactment of an entirely new reckless driving statute, Laws of 1965, Ex. Sess., ch. 155, \u00a7 59. The 1965 reckless driving statute, codified at RCW 46.61.500, differs from the reckless driving law it replaced in that it no longer employed the term \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d Because the new statute did not refer to operating a motor vehicle \u201cin a reckless manner,\u201d the language of the 1937 reckless driving statute dictating a unique construction of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d for purposes of that section was necessarily omitted. The only construction of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d that remained is the one articulated by this court in Bowman: driving in a \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>57 Wn.2d at 271 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\u00b622 This history demonstrates that the legislature has always intended that \u201creckless manner\u201d as used in the vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes <em>not </em>be defined as \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d Between 1937 and 1965 both the reckless driving statute and the vehicular homicide statute employed the term \u201cin a reckless manner,\u201d but the reckless driving statute expressly provided that the phrase \u201coperate in a reckless manner\u201d was to be given an exceptional construction unique to that section. As used elsewhere in the motor vehicle laws, \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d was to be defined differently.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By expressly limiting the \u201cwillful or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d construction of \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d to the reckless driving statute only, the 1937 legislature clearly demonstrated its intent that \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d as used in the vehicular homicide statute was <em>not </em>to mean \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\u00b623 In the 1965 revisions to the motor vehicle code, the legislature used different terminology to describe the offense of reckless driving. This choice of language achieved the legislature\u2019s purpose of criminalizing driving a vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property and eliminating the confusion over the meaning of \u201creckless manner,\u201d as discussed in <em>State v. Dichert, </em>194 Wash. 629, 632, 79 P.2d 328 (1938). That the 1965 reckless driving statute was enacted in order to differentiate between \u201creckless driving\u201d and driving \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d reinforces the conclusion that the legislature intended \u201creckless driving\u201d to have a meaning distinct from \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"> \u00b624 When amending a statute, the legislature is presumed to know how the courts have construed and applied the statute. <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Quackenbush, </em>142 Wn.2d 928, 936, 16 P.3d 638 (2001). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that once a statute has been construed by the highest court of the state, that construction operates as if it were originally written into it.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Morris, </em>87 Wn.2d 922, 927, 557 P.2d 1299 (1976). Thus, our definition of \u201creckless manner\u201d as used in the vehicular homicide statute, articulated in <em>Bowman, </em>57 Wn.2d at 271, operates as if it were originally written into the vehicular homicide statute and we must presume that the legislature was aware of this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">\u00b625 The vehicular homicide and vehicular assault statutes have been recodified or amended numerous times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>since they were enacted. <em>See </em>Laws of 2001, ch. 300, \u00a7 1; Laws of 1998, ch. 211, \u00a7 2; Laws of 1996, ch. 199, \u00a7 8; Laws of 1996, ch. 199, \u00a7 7; Laws of 1991, ch. 348, \u00a7 1; Laws of 1983, ch. 164, \u00a7 2; Laws of 1983, ch. 164, \u00a7 1; Laws of 1975, 1st Ex.

Despite these many statutory changes, the legislature has never availed itself of the opportunity to redefine the term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d as used in the vehicular assault or vehicular homicide statutes. Because the legislature has acquiesced in this court\u2019s definition of \u201cin a reckless manner,\u201d we will not alter our interpretation of that term until the legislature provides a different definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"> \u00b626 In sum, we find no basis upon which to export the \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d language used in the reckless driving statute and import it to define the term \u201cin a reckless manner\u201d in the two pertinent felony statutes. We conclude, therefore, that the courts below applied the correct definition of the term \u201cin a reckless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">B. Did the Court of Appeals err when it held the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find that Roggenkamp\u2019s actions were the sole proximate cause of the accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\u00b627 Roggenkamp makes the additional argument that JoAnn Carpenter\u2019s actions prior to the fatal incident were a superseding event that renders his conviction improper<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the Court of Appeals erred in not so concluding. We have reviewed the Court of Appeals decision resolving this issue in favor of the State and find ourselves entirely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>agreement with the decision and the reasoning that led to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">\u00b628 As the Court of Appeals pointed out, JoAnn Carpenter\u2019s actions were, at most, a concurring cause, not a superseding cause of the accident. A concurring cause does not shield a defendant from a vehicular homicide conviction. <em>State v. Souther, </em>100 Wn. App. 701, 710-11, 998 P.2d 350, <em>review denied, </em>142 Wn.2d 1007, 34 P.3d 1232 (2000). We, therefore, affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\u00b629 For more than four decades we have defined the term \u201creckless manner,\u201d as used in the vehicular assault and vehicular homicides statutes, as meaning to operate a vehicle in a \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences.\u201d The express language of the aforementioned statutes as well as legislative history and recent case law does not provide any basis for departing from this traditional definition. Therefore, we reaffirm that the \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences\u201d definition is the proper definition of the term \u201creckless manner\u201d as it appears in RCW 46.61.520(l)(b) and RCW 46.61-.522(l)(a). We hold additionally that JoAnn Carpenter\u2019s actions were, at the very most, a concurring cause of the accident and not a superseding cause as a matter of law. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals in both of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">C. Johnson, Madsen, Bridge, Owens, and Fairhurst, JJ., and Ireland, J.

My reasons follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\u00b632 This statutory construction inquiry must consider our primary aim is to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent, remembering such intent is derived solely from the plain language of the statute if it is unambiguous, accepting the legislature means precisely what it says. <em>State v. J.P., </em>149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003); <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>143 Wn.2d 162, 175, 19 P.3d 1012 (2001).

Cam, </em>135 Wn.2d 193, 203, 955 P.2d 791 (1998). However it is equally important that a court may \u201cnot delete language from an unambiguous statute.\u201d <em>J.P., </em>149 Wn.2d at 450. \u201c \u2018Statutes must be interpreted and construed so that all the language used is given effect, with no portion rendered meaningless or superfluous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v.

And this principle mandates a statute\u2019s plain language is to be discerned not simply from a tunnel-vision approach considering no more than the section at issue, but rather \u201cfrom all that the Legislature has said in the statute <em>and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Ecology v.

S.P., </em>110 Wn.2d 886, 890, 756 P.2d 1315 (1988) (quoting <em>Addleman v. Bd. of Prison Terms &amp; Paroles, </em>107 Wn.2d 503, 509, 730 P.2d 1327 (1986)).

Only when harmonization is not possible does the court separately construe statutes dealing with the same subject matter. <em>Id.; see also State v.

[i]n a reckless manner.\u201d RCW 46.61.520(1)(b); <em>see also </em>RCW 46.61.522(1)(a). Thus, all three sections of the motor vehicle code cited above require \u201creckless\u201d driving before a defendant is convicted of reckless driving, vehicular homicide, or vehicular assault. Not only does this invoke the common statutory construction principle of construing provisions in pari materia, but we are also legislatively commanded to do as much: \u201cThe provisions of this title [Title 46 RCW] shall be construed in pari materia even though as a matter of prior legislative history they were not originally enacted in the same statute.\u201d RCW 46.98.020. Such a declaration evinces clear legislative intent to preclude isolationist judicial interpretation of any one provision in the motor vehicle code. To the contrary, in pari materia provisions must and should be construed alike. <em>Champion, </em>81 Wn.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u00b635 <em>Champion </em>is instructive.

As such, we are required by plain language and also as a matter of basic statutory construction to give identical definitions throughout Title 46 RCW.

Laws of 1961, ch. 12. Though the legislature did not alter the language criminalizing reckless driving and vehicular homicide, it did add what is now RCW 46.98.020, which directs the courts to construe the act\u2019s provisions in pari materia and as if they were enacted at the same time. Laws of 1961, ch. 12, at 435, <em>codified at </em>RCW 46.98.020.

That the legislature chose to repeal the fundamental basis for <em>Dickert </em>and its progeny (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Bowman) </em>cannot be ignored. <em>Every </em>action by the legislature must be given effect, for \u201c[t]he [1] egislature \u2018does not engage in unnecessary or meaningless acts, and we presume some significant purpose or objective in every legislative enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Recall of Pearsall-Stipek, </em>141 Wn.2d 756, 769, 10 P.3d 1034 (2000) (quoting <em>John H.

As a result there is no longer any statutory basis to distinguish the reckless driving definition from the operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner prong of the vehicular homicide and assault statutes. The majority however avers <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>interpretation of the vehicular homicide and assault statutes operates as though the legislature had originally written it into the statute.

Unconstitutional to Fail to Use or Instruct Jury on \u201cWillful or Wanton\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u00b6 47 Axiomatic in constitutional jurisprudence is the requirement for the \u201cState [to] prove every essential element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction to be upheld.\u201d <em>State v. Byrd, </em>125 Wn.2d 707, 713, 887 P.2d 396 (1995). This court has held, in the context of examining the reckless driving statute as a lesser included offense of felony flight from a police officer, that \u201creckless driving requires either a willful <em>or </em>wanton disregard for the safety of others.\u201d <em>State v. Parker, </em>102 Wn.2d 161, 164, 683 P.2d 189 (1984); <em>see also id. </em>at 168 (Utter, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe crime of reckless driving . . . requires the jury to find a defendant conscious and capable of forming a purposeful mental state; he, too, must be found capable of driving with a \u2018wilful [sic] or wanton\u2019 disregard for the safety of others.\u201d (quoting RCW 46.61.500 and WPIC (Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal) 95.10)).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\u00b6 48 It follows then that an element of reckless driving is acting with either willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. RCW 46.61.500(1). And since this definition of reckless driving applies to crimes of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault, the failure to instruct the jury on that element deprives the defendant of the constitutional right to a jury determination on all elements of the alleged crime. <em>State v. Smith, </em>131 Wn.2d 258, 263, 930 P.2d 917 (1997) (\u201cIt cannot be said that a defendant has had a fair trial if the jury must guess at the meaning of an essential element of a crime or if the jury might assume that an essential element need not be proved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">IV. Errors <em>Not </em>Harmless</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\u00b649 Finally, I dispose of any contention these errors might be so harmless the convictions should nonetheless be upheld. Though an erroneous jury instruction and/or conclusion of law that misstates an element of a charged crime unconstitutionally violates the right to a jury, the conviction will still be upheld if the error was harmless beyond a</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Brown, </em>147 Wn.2d 330, 344, 58 P.3d 889 (2002). The test for harmless error when the instructions misstate or omit an element is \u201cwhether it appears \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 15, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999) (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967)), <em>quoted in Brown, </em>147 Wn.2d at 341. Such an inquiry requires the appellate court to \u201cask[] whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. \u201cWhen applied to an element omitted from, or misstated in, a jury instruction, the error is harmless if that element is supported by uncontroverted evidence.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>147 Wn.2d at 341 (citing <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 18).

The trial judge correctly recognized the \u201cwillful or wanton\u201d standard examines the defendant\u2019s mental state, considering the inherently subjective components of those terms. <em>See Adkisson v. City of Seattle, </em>42 Wn.2d 676, 682-83, 258 P.2d 461 (1953).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>1. Recklessness, as defined in WPIC 90.05, <em>focuses on the act itself rather than the mens rea. </em>Reckless driving as defined in the relevant statute [RCW 46.61.520(1)(b) and RCW 46.61-.522(1)(a)] is shaded towards the negligent driving standard <em>as opposed to the non-negligent or non-vehicular homicide or vehicular assault definition of recklessness, which requires proof of willfulness or wanton conduct. </em>However, ordinary negligence in operating a motor vehicle does not render a person guilty of vehicular homicide. <em>Recklessness under these standards is easier to prove than the willful or wanton standard, which incorporates a greater focus on the mental state of the person.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u00b651 That the trial judge specifically admitted the prosecution\u2019s burden was \u201ceasier to prove\u201d because of the \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences\u201d standard demonstrates the reasonable possibility a different result would have been reached had the trial judge followed the \u201cwillful or wanton\u201d standard.

As Clark drove down Northeast Minnehaha Street in Vancouver, he pulled alongside a vehicle driven by Thomas Severson. There was conflicting testimony as to whether Clark intended to race Severson and how fast Clark was driving throughout the entire incident. Clark testified that when he pulled up alongside Severson that passenger Monica Caywood made an obscene gesture to Severson (she \u201cflipped him off\u201d), and that he sped away from Severson \u201cso he didn\u2019t try anything\u201d as Clark \u201cdidn\u2019t know the guy.\u201d II Verbatim Report of Proceedings <em>(State v.

Furthermore, there was controverted evidence over how fast Clark actually drove. More fundamentally though, the jury expressed confusion over the definitions of \u201crash,\u201d \u201cindifferent,\u201d and \u201cheedless,\u201d as evidenced by its request for definitions of each term, CCP at 21,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> thus indicating a reasonable possibility the jury might have returned an acquittal had it been instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>differently on a more difficult standard for the State to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">\u00b653 As reasonable doubt exists in both <em>State v. Roggenkamp </em>and <em>State v. Clark </em>whether use of the erroneous \u201crash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences\u201d standard was harmless, reversal is required in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u00b654 Read in its present state, \u201creckless\u201d must have identical meaning throughout the motor vehicle code. Necessarily then, a person is guilty of vehicular homicide or vehicular assault if charged due to death or injury resulting from \u201coperating a motor vehicle . . . [i]n a reckless manner,\u201d RCW 46.61.520(l)(a), only if that person was \u201creckless[ly] driving\u201d as defined in RCW 46.61.500(1). There is no current ground to bifurcate these definitions, and the majority\u2019s adherence to antiquated precedent, the basis of which was repealed by the legislature almost 40 years ago, ignores the current plain language of Title 46 RCW. In so doing, the majority effectively nullifies RCW 46.98.020\u2019s command to construe all provisions of the motor vehicle code in pari materia.

Sess., ch. 136, \u00a7 85, and then a gross misdemeanor, Laws of 1990, ch. 291, \u00a7 1, the \u201cwillful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d has remained the same. <em>Compare </em>Laws of 1965, Ex. Sess., ch. 155, \u00a7 59 (employing quoted language) <em>with </em>RCW 46.61.500(1) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> The post <em>-Bowman </em>cases referencing the \u201ca rash or heedless manner, indifferent to the consequences\u201d standard are inapposite to the issue at hand. <em>See State v. Brooks, 73 </em>Wn.2d 653, 440 P.2d 199 (1968); <em>State v. Eike, </em>72 Wn.2d 760, 435 P.2d 680 (1967). Not only was the definition of \u201coperating a motor vehicle .. . [i]n a reckless manner\u201d at issue in <em>Brooks, </em>but the court never even mentioned the \u201crash or heedless, indifferent to the consequences\u201d definition the majority here follows. <em>Eike </em>is equally inapposite. There we recognized the vehicular homicide statute sets forth not two, but three methods of committing the crime: \u201c(1) Driving while under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs; (2) driving in a reckless manner; and (3) driving with disregard for the safety of others.\u201d <em>Eike, </em>72 Wn.2d at 764. We rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cdriving with disregard for the safety of others,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 766, was subsumed in the \u201cdriving in a reckless manner\u201d alternative. The only mention of the \u201crash or heedless\u201d standard followed by the majority appeared in the <em>Eike </em>dissent. <em>See id. </em>at 778 n.5 (Donworth, J., dissenting). Thus, no decision from this court considered the propriety of the \u201crash or heedless, indifferent to the consequences\u201d standard after the 1961 and 1965 legislative amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> The majority at 628 also declares the \u201conly construction of \u2018in a reckless manner\u2019 that remained\u201d after the 1965 reckless driving statute was the court\u2019s prior construction of the vehicular homicide statute. This ignores the fact that the legislature passed the \u201cin pari materia\u201d statute in 1961. The enactment of the \u201cin pari materia\u201d was the legislature\u2019s directive that similar terms in the statute be construed the same, and by giving definitional content to \u201creckless\u201d driving (i.e., operation of a motor vehicle) the legislature was clearly <em>rejecting </em>this court\u2019s prior construction of the term as used in other sections in the same title.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Further it is clear that while the majority is possibly correct that the legislature\u2019s purpose may have been to \u201celiminate confusion\u201d over the meaning of \u201creckless manner\u201d (although one would think that <em>Dickert </em>itself cleared up any such \u201cconfusion\u201d), the resolution of that \u201cconfusion\u201d was to define \u201creckless\u201d driving (i.e., operation of a motor vehicle) in RCW 46.61.500(1) and to apply that definition through the \u201cin pari materia\u201d statute to RCW 46.61.520(1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> The trial court provided the jury with no additional guidance, instructing the jury it \u201cshould rely upon [its] common understanding of the ordinary meaning of these words.\u201d CCP at 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">\u00b656 (concurring in dissent) \u2014 I concur with the dissent that the statutory underpinning of the jury instruction has been statutorily eroded. <em>See </em>dissent at 631-32; RCW 46.61.500(1) (modern definition of reckless driving). I also agree with the dissent that the error in the instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by <em>State v. Brown, </em>147 Wn.2d 330, 344, 58 P.3d 889 (2002). The erroneous instruction substantially relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove willful and wanton behavior, and I cannot say with confidence\u2014let alone beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014that a properly instructed jury would have found the defendants guilty. To that extent, I concur in the dissent.</p>\n<author id=\"AhQf\">Chambers, J.</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
