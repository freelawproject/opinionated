Unfortunately, it appears the trial court considered marital fault in distributing the parties\u2019 property, disfavoring Gilbert because she obtained an order of protection against Muhammad based on charges of domestic violence. Division Two of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s distribution of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities, finding that there was no improper consideration of fault. <em>In re Marriage of Muhammad, </em>119 Wn. App. 166, 174, 79 P.3d 483 (2003). Because we hold that fault was considered, and that such considerations constitute an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>abuse of discretion, we reverse and remand for a new trial on the issue of the property division and instruct the Pierce County Superior Court to assign a new trial judge for the rehearing of the case.</p>\n<author id=\"ATl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Owens, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b836-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\u00b62 Gilbert and Muhammad lived together continuously as unmarried cohabitants from December 1994 to August 1996 (approximately 20 months), at which point they became married. The parties separated on April 3, 2001, and dissolved their marriage on April 5,2002. During the period from the parties\u2019 initial cohabitation until just prior to the dissolution, Muhammad was employed as a deputy sheriff in Kang County. Gilbert was employed by Albertson\u2019s and Pierce County Transit during the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\u00b63 On the date of separation, events occurred that would, unfortunately, later become intertwined with the property distribution in the parties\u2019 marriage dissolution. On the afternoon of April 3, 2001, Muhammad engaged Gilbert and her sister in argument. The police were dispatched based on allegations that Muhammad pointed a weapon at the two women and threatened them. Though he denied brandishing a weapon or making the threats, Muhammad was arrested and charged with two counts each of domestic violence harassment and intimidation with a deadly weapon. Based on the domestic violence allegations, Gilbert obtained an order of protection in Pierce County Superior Court on November 16, 2001. As part of the trial court\u2019s order, Muhammad was barred from owning or possessing a firearm in any capacity. For Muhammad, the consequences of having the firearm prohibition placed in the trial court\u2019s order of protection included losing his job as a deputy sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">\u00b64 Subsequent to the order of protection, the dissolution proceeded in a separate trial court, which was responsible for distributing the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities. The assets at issue were generally limited to the following: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Muhammad\u2019s pension valued at approximately $38,400, (2) Gilbert\u2019s Albertson\u2019s and Pierce County Transit pensions totaling approximately $7,625, (3) two cars, (4) a tax refund, (5) four savings bonds, (6) personal property, and (7) a house that was in foreclosure proceedings. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 13-14. Approximately $8,200 of Muhammad\u2019s $38,400 pension was accumulated during the 20-month premarriage cohabitation of the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 liabilities included: (1) first and second mortgages on the home totaling $155,500, (2) $1,232 in property taxes, (3) phone bills in excess of $4,000, (4) credit account debt of approximately $4,575, and (5) debt owing on the parties\u2019 two cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">\u00b65 The trial court appears to have divided the assets evenly with one important exception: Muhammad and Gilbert were each awarded their undivided pensions, valued at $38,400 and $7,625, respectively. In the findings of fact, the trial court stated that if the pensions were to have been evenly divided, each party would have received approximately $21,400, which meant that under the court\u2019s division Muhammad was receiving $8,800 more, and Gilbert $8,800 less, than 50 percent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite recognizing the disparity, the trial court awarded the pension benefits as they were held by the parties. The trial court also declined to divide the approximately $8,200 of Muhammad\u2019s pension earned during the 20-month meretricious relationship but instead awarded it entirely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Muhammad on the grounds that the amount was \u201cminimal.\u201d CP at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">\u00b66 In ruling from the bench, the trial court remarked extensively on the relationship between Muhammad\u2019s unemployment and Gilbert\u2019s decision to obtain a protective order. These remarks include the following excerpts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">In one sense <em>I do think that Mrs. Muhammad has sought to punish Mr. Muhammad </em>and that\u2019s not to say that he didn\u2019t bring a considerable amount of this on himself by at least some level of his own activities. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">I think what\u2019s probably most troubling here in regard to how you try to resolve the rather minimal property issues that we have is the protection order problem. She had to know or at least should have known or should have been told that if she proceeded with this protection order, that he was not going to have a job and he wasn\u2019t going to have an income and he wasn\u2019t going to be able to pay his debts, let alone the mortgage payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">Now, from her side of the fence obviously that\u2019s a catch 22 because she felt she needed the protection order, and if she felt she really needed the protection order, then she had to proceed with that. But then I think if that\u2019s the situation, <em>she has to recognize the consequences and you can\u2019t just ignore the fact that there are consequences. Fairly substantial consequences. Those consequences have been taken into consideration in terms of trying to make the distribution somewhat equitable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 24, 2002) at 2-4 (emphasis added). In assigning liability to the parties for the two mortgages on the home purchased by Muhammad before the marriage, the trial court went on to engage in the following colloquy with counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">[THE COURT:] I\u2019m going to obviously make him hold her harmless for at least half of that [mortgage] debt. But I\u2019m not going to make him hold her harmless for the whole thing because this relates to what I\u2019m talking about in the sense of she was in a bit of a catch 22 on this\u2014in this order, protection order but <em>she had to know what the consequences were and the consequences basically were that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to pay that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>THE COURT: And he made payments or it\u2019s true that he\u2019s like $7000 behind or whatever he is, but you know, <em>I just don\u2019t see that if she\u2019s going to put him out of a job, what does she expect him to pay and what does she expect him to do? </em>I don\u2019t see that happening. It\u2019s not going to get paid. And I\u2019m not saying she did it deliberately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">MR. BENJAMIN: Really we would say he put himself out of [a] job when he threatened the sister with the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">THE COURT: That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a catch 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">MR. BENJAMIN: We get the feeling she is getting punished by the Court for getting the protection order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">THE COURT: I\u2019m doing what I think is fair and what I think is fair is to walk out of this marriage of four and a half years with essentially what they had, if they can and that can\u2019t be done in his case. I mean it just can\u2019t be done. So no, I am not trying to punish anybody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">VRP (Jan. 24, 2002) at 10-11, 14-15 (emphasis added). Finally, the formal findings of fact in the dissolution decree include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">By the Respondent [Gilbert] obtaining a permanent domestic violence protection order against the Petitioner, Dawud A. Muhammad, said Petitioner no longer has the ability under Federal Law to own or use a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">The ability to own and use a weapon is a condition of his employment through the King County Sheriff\u2019s Office or any other law enforcement agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">As a result of the Petitioner\u2019s being unable to own or use a weapon, the Petitioner has been terminated from his employment with the King County Sheriff\u2019s Office and is not eligible for any law enforcement position at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-13\">The only work for which the Petitioner is qualified at this time is as a law enforcement officer and he is currently unemployed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-14\">\n<em>The Respondent knew, and has known for some considerable period of time, that by seeking and making the protection order permanent she would effectively terminate her husband\u2019s ability to work.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>By virtue of the obtaining of the permanent domestic violence protection order the Petitioner\u2019s ability to obtain gainful employment or meaningful retirement benefits in the future is severely limited due to his education and training.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">CP at 17 (emphasis added).* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notably, the trial court did provide some indication that he was attempting to balance the pension disparity between Muhammad and Gilbert by awarding Gilbert the personal property in her possession at dissolution, though no formal finding of fact as to value was included in the dissolution decree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> VKP (Jan. 24, 2002) at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">\u00b67 Gilbert appealed the trial court\u2019s property distribution to Division Two of the Court of Appeals on two grounds. First, Gilbert assigned error to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the order of protection in distributing the community assets and liabilities. Second, Gilbert assigned error to the trial court\u2019s failure to award her some portion of the approximately $8,200 of Muhammad\u2019s pension that accrued during the meretricious relationship. In a divided opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Muhammad, 119 Wn. App. at 174. The court held that while the trial court\u2019s remarks \u201cmay have been inartful. . . the property division was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167-68. The court reasoned that although fault cannot be considered by the trial court when distributing the property, taking account of the economic circumstances of the parties, including Muhammad\u2019s unemployment, was valid. <em>Id. </em>at 174. The court went on to conclude that \u201c[n] either the text of the trial court\u2019s opinion nor its written findings reflect a causal link between the obtaining of the order\u2014the \u2018fault\u2019 on the part of Cherry [Gilbert]\u2014and the disparate property division as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals did not address the trial court\u2019s designation of the portion of Muhammad\u2019s pension acquired during the parties\u2019 meretricious relationship as \u201cminimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\u00b68 1. Whether the trial court improperly weighed Gilbert\u2019s decision to obtain a domestic violence protection order against her as \u201cmarital fault\u201d during the property distribution in the parties\u2019 dissolution of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u00b69 2. Whether the trial court failed to properly consider the portion of Muhammad\u2019s pension that accrued during the parties\u2019 20-month meretricious relationship that preceded their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\u00b6[10 3. Whether Gilbert is entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to RCW 26.09.140.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">\u00b611 A property division made during the dissolution of a marriage will be reversed on appeal only if there is a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Kraft, </em>119 Wn.2d 438, 450, 832 P.2d 871 (1992). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds or untenable reasons.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Littlefield, </em>133 Wn.2d 39, 46-47, 940 P.2d 1362 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">A. Consideration of the Protection Order</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">\u00b612 In a marriage dissolution proceeding, the trial court must \u201cdispos [e] of the property and the liabilities of the parties, either community or separate, as shall appear just and equitable after considering all relevant factors.\u201d RCW 26.09.080. Such factors include \u201c[t]he economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>property is to become effective\u201d but may not include \u201cmarital misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 .080(4). While courts have held that negatively productive conduct that causes the dissipation of <em>marital assets </em>can be considered, marital fault alone is not an appropriate consideration. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Steadman, </em>63 Wn. App. 523, 527-28, 821 P.2d 59 (1991) (holding that the \u201cmarital misconduct\u201d at issue in RCW 26.09.080 \u201crefers to immoral or physically abusive conduct within the marital relationship!, not] gross fiscal improvidence, the squandering of marital assets or . . . the deliberate and unnecessary incurring of tax liabilities\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>In re Marriage of Clark, </em>13 Wn. App. 805, 808-09, 538 P.2d 145 (1975) (taking account of how labor or negatively productive conduct created or dissipated certain marital assets is appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">\u00b613 A number of aspects of the property division strongly indicate that the trial court went beyond simply looking to the parties\u2019 existing economic circumstances, but instead weighed Gilbert\u2019s decision to obtain a protective order against her. First, there is the large disparity between the values of the parties\u2019 pensions that accrued during the marriage. Although the exact value of the personal property awarded to Gilbert and Muhammad is not before us, the payment of approximately $12,287 to $15,250 from Muhammad to Gilbert that would have been required to offset the pension disparity cannot be fully accounted for. Second, the classification of approximately $8,200 of Muhammad\u2019s pension earned during the meretricious relationship as \u201cminimal,\u201d where that portion constituted approximately 21 percent of the total amount at issue ($38,400), is inexplicable. CP at 19. There are very few people for whom half of $8,200 is a \u201cminimal\u201d amount, and given the total assets and liabilities at issue in this dissolution proceeding, Gilbert and Muhammad are clearly not among them. Third, there is the decision to make Gilbert liable for half of any deficiency on the home because, as the trial court stated from the bench, \u201cI just don\u2019t see that <em>if she\u2019s going to put him out of a job, </em>what does she expect him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>to pay and what does she expect him to do?\u201d VRP (Jan. 24, 2002) at 14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">\u00b614 Beyond the highly questionable division of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities, the language used by the trial court in the oral ruling and written findings of fact also suggests an improper consideration of Gilbert\u2019s \u201cfault.\u201d For instance, statements regarding the trial court\u2019s belief that Gilbert obtained the protective order because she \u201csought to punish\u201d Muhammad, and that Gilbert had to \u201crecognize the consequences\u201d that were \u201ctaken into consideration in terms of trying to make the distribution somewhat equitable,\u201d have no discernable purpose other than to attempt to justify the use of \u201cfault\u201d in dividing the property. <em>See </em>VRP (Jan. 24, 2002) at 2-4. Most striking of all are the written findings of fact, which read like a logical syllogism linking Muhammad\u2019s unemployment and purported unemployability to Gilbert\u2019s decision to obtain the protective order. <em>See </em>CP at 17. Specifically, the fifth finding in section 2.20 of the findings of fact and conclusions of law states that Gilbert \u201cknew, and has known for some considerable period of time, that by seeking and making the protection order permanent she would effectively terminate her husband\u2019s ability to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This finding begs the question, what purpose could the trial court have had for taking notice of Gilbert\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d about the effect of the protective order except to establish causation and assign fault? No acceptable answer to this question is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">\u00b615 Despite our conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion, we decline to go further and hold, as Gilbert requests, that a job loss resulting from a domestic violence allegation or conviction constitutes negatively productive conduct that may be weighed <em>against </em>the unemployed party. Such a holding would require the imposition of a new rule, as no court in this state has held that at-will employment is a marital asset that may be dissipated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>asset recognized by our courts that is at all similar to employment is economic goodwill, which requires more than access to an income stream. <em>See In re Marriage of Hall, </em>103 Wn.2d 236, 241-42, 692 P.2d 175 (1984) (\u201c[goodwill is not the earning capacity itself.\u201d A salaried professional cannot possess goodwill as a matter of law since there is no \u201cbusiness or practice to which [it] can attach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">\u00b616 In sum, we hold that the language in the trial court\u2019s oral ruling and written findings of fact, along with the questionable aspects of the property division itself, establish a clear inference that the court improperly considered Gilbert\u2019s decision to obtain a protective order against Muhammad as \u201cmarital misconduct.\u201d The consideration of marital misconduct is explicitly prohibited in RCW 26-.09.080. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s property division was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds or untenable reasons\u201d amounting to an abuse of discretion. See <em>Littlefield, </em>133 Wn.2d at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">B. Meretricious Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\u00b617 As a general rule, property acquired during a meretricious relationship is divisible upon dissolution of the relationship. <em>Connell v. Francisco, </em>127 Wn.2d 339, 347, 349, 898 P.2d 831 (1995) (\u201cproperty that would have been characterized as community property had the parties been married ... is properly before a trial court and is subject to a just and equitable distribution\u201d). The record indicates that the trial court gave consideration to the approximately $8,200 of Muhammad\u2019s pension that accrued during the meretricious relationship, classifying the amount as \u201cminimal\u201d within the greater distribution scheme. However, as noted above, this aspect of the distribution is intertwined with the court\u2019s error in assigning fault to Gilbert for obtaining the protective order. As such, we note only that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>assets acquired by both parties during the meretricious relationship must be reconsidered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">C. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\u00b618 An award of attorney fees and costs may be granted in an appellate court\u2019s discretion under RCW 26.09.140. Upon a request for fees and costs under RCW 26.09.140, courts will consider \u201cthe parties\u2019 relative ability to pay\u201d and \u201cthe arguable merit of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Leslie, </em>90 Wn. App. 796, 807, 954 P.2d 330 (1998). In this case, we find that the issue raised by Gilbert on appeal had considerable merit. However, the current economic circumstances of the parties are unknown. Accordingly, upon remand, the parties may submit evidence regarding Muhammad\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees associated with the appeal, and the trial court may order such payment if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">\u00b619 The trial court\u2019s division of the parties\u2019 property in the dissolution decree was an abuse of discretion because marital fault was improperly considered. The decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the trial court is therefore reversed, and the matter is remanded for new property division proceedings. Additionally, for the sole purpose of avoiding any appearance of unfairness or bias, we instruct the Pierce County Superior Court to assign this case to a new trial judge. Gilbert\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs pursuant to RCW 26.09.140 is subject to consideration on remand. We recognize that this outcome may ultimately result in a hollow victory for Gilbert in that the assets at issue are likely to have dissipated long ago. However, the legal principle must be clear: a trial court cannot hold one spouse\u2019s assertion of his or her legal right to a protective order against that spouse during the property distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>where the order results in the loss of employment for the other spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Madsen, Bridge, Chambers, and Fairhurst, JJ., and Ireland, J. Pro Tern., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-5\"> There was no finding by the trial court as to the value of Gilbert\u2019s Albertson\u2019s pension that accrued during the parties\u2019 premarriage cohabitation. The trial court found only that the Albertson\u2019s pension was worth approximately $10,000, of which approximately $5,000 had accrued during the marriage. CP at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\"> Just exactly how the trial court reached these figures is in no way apparent. If only the period during marriage were considered, Muhammad\u2019s and Gilbert\u2019s pensions were worth approximately $30,200 and $7,625, respectively. An even division of these sums would have required a payment of approximately $11,287 from Muhammad to Gilbert. Furthermore, as the Corut of Appeals accurately noted, \u201c[i]f the period of cohabitation contributions were included, an even split of the pensions, with no other property considerations, would have meant a payment of about $15,250 from Dawud [Muhammad] to Cherry <em>[Gilbert]Muhammad, </em>119 Wn. App. at 172.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> We note that the reference to federal law as the source of the firearm prohibition in the court\u2019s first finding of fact is incorrect. Rather, it was RCW 9.41.800 and the order of protection itself that prevented Muhammad from owning or possessing firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\"> The trial court stated only that he was awarding \u201c[m]ost of the expensive and nice items of [personal] property to Gilbert. CP at 14. The Court of Appeals stated that Gilbert failed to provide an adequate record with regard to the value of the personal property, <em>Muhammad, </em>119 Wn.

The trial judge who presided over this marriage dissolution proceeding is a veteran judge who is well respected in his jurisdiction and statewide. In my view, he is fully capable of doing what most trial judges have to do from time to time and that is to consider a case anew on remand after his or her decision in the case has been reversed in whole or in part by an appellate court. Disqualification of a trial judge on remand should be ordered only in extreme cases where there are indications in the record that the trial judge is unwilling or unable to fairly consider the case on remand. There is no such indication in the record before us and, therefore, there should be no change of judge at the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">C.

The party who challenges a decision in a dissolution proceeding must demonstrate that the trial court manifestly abused its discretion.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Stenshoel, </em>72 Wn. App. 800, 803, 866 P.2d 635 (1993) (citing <em>In re Marriage of Griffin, </em>114 Wn.2d 772, 776, 791 P.2d 519 (1990)). The majority finds the trial judge abused his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>discretion here by considering marital fault. Majority at 806.* 1234*<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I dissent because the judge based his decision on the economic realities of the case, not fault of the parties.</p>\n<author id=\"Ahc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Sanders, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b847-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u00b623 RCW 26.09.080 requires a fair and equitable distribution of the property without regard to fault, while still considering the economic circumstances of the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[Fairness] is attained by considering all of the circumstances of the marriage, past and present, with an eye to the future needs of the persons involved. Fairness is decided by the exercise of wise and sound discretion not by set or inflexible rules.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Clark, </em>13 Wn. App. 805, 810, 538 P.2d 145, <em>review denied, </em>86 Wn.2d 1001 (1975). The property division need not be mathematically precise: \u201cThus, in making a division of the property the law does not impel an equal or exact division of the community property of the parties. The disposition only need be just and equitable, and wide latitude and discretionary powers are vested in the trial court in order to accomplish this division.\u201d <em>Rogstad v. Rogstad, </em>74 Wn.2d 736, 738, 446 P.2d 340 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">\u00b624 Abuse of discretion depends on what the court considered and how it reached its decision. Courts cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>consider \u201cmarital fault,\u201d but the equitable distribution must be fair. Dawud Muhammad\u2019s domestic abuse cannot be considered, but the fact is he is currently unemployed for whatever reason. And the statute specifically lists as a factor the \u201ceconomic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of property is to become effective.\u201d RCW 26.09.080(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\u00b625 The trial court divided the assets of this relatively short marriage equitably by considering the relevant statutory criteria. The court recognized that Muhammad was unemployed, and yet still imposed on him half of the community\u2019s debts. The court did not view the disparity between the two pension awards as punishing Cherry Gilbert. <em>See </em>Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 24, 2002) at 14-15 (\u201cI\u2019m doing what I think is fair and what I think is fair is to walk out of this marriage of four and a half years with essentially what they had, if they can and that can\u2019t be done in his case. I mean it just can\u2019t be done. So no, <em>I am not trying to punish anybody.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gilbert\u2019s seeking and obtaining the protection order did not affect the property division; the causal connection between the two is simply lacking. The trial court properly focused on the economic realities of the situation, not the fault of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">\u00b626 Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it divided the pension accumulations during the meretricious relationship. When asked if Gilbert would receive credit for the premarital cohabitation, Judge Bruce W. Cohoe answered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">Sure, I\u2019ve taken that into consideration. They lived together during that period of time, but if they had never gotten married, there probably\u2014they would have simply gone their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>separate ways, and there probably wouldn\u2019t have been any claim or any of this type of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-4\">I don\u2019t see that as being a major amount of money that\u2019s going to change. Even if I said I treated that one portion, I certainly don\u2019t treat it after they separate. But even if I treated that one portion, the change is\u2014it may increase that\u2014I think it goes from 19 to 25, $6,000, half of it is $3,000. It doesn\u2019t increase that amount so that I\u2019m going to change my mind about how it should be allocated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">VRP (Jan. 24, 2002) at 12-13. The judge considered the property accumulated during the meretricious relationship and chose to award it as he did; the entire pension went to Muhammad as part of the larger distribution scheme. The conclusions of law also listed this property as \u201cminimal.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 19. Based on the record before the court, I cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by reaching this result. It is within the realm of possible divisions; it may not be the one we would have chosen, but that does not render it an abuse of discretion. Gilbert was awarded assets, some debts, and enjoys continuing employment. Muhammad has assets, much debt and no employment. The judge weighed these factors and divided the property, attempting to place the parties in approximately the same position they were in before the marriage. This result is hardly a \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion.\u201d I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">\u00b627 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\"> \u201cA manifest abuse of discretion is present if the court\u2019s discretion is exercised on untenable grounds.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Olivares, </em>69 Wn.
