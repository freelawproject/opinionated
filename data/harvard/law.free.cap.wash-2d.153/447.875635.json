We hold that the trial court\u2019s instruction was not prejudicial or erroneous. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals. As to the issue of sanctions, the opinion of the court is reflected in the dissent, which holds that the trial court abused its discretion and vacates the order imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b62 Glenn and Janice Thompson (Owners) own a 15 acre parcel of land in Enumclaw, Washington. In June 1998, Owners agreed to rent the barn on the property to King Feed &amp; Nutrition Service, Inc. (King Feed), for storing hay cut from Owners\u2019 and other properties in the local area. On August 27, 1998 the barn was completely destroyed by fire. The cause of the fire was determined to be spontaneous combustion due to the negligent storage of wet hay. Liability as to the cause of the fire is not in dispute on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b63 In October 1999, Owners brought suit to recover the cost of replacing the barn. During discovery, Owners sent King Feed a request for admission to admit negligence and proximate cause and to admit that Owners were not contributorily negligent or comparatively at fault. King Feed denied all requests for admission and raised the affirmative defense that Owners may have been comparatively at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b64 At trial, Owners called several experts to testily as to the value of the barn. A real estate agent estimated the rental value of the barn to be at least $2,500 per month and the value of the barn itself to be $400,000. A general contractor estimated the cost of rebuilding the barn to be more than $500,000. Areal estate appraiser estimated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the \u201cbarn contributed a value of $300,000 more or less\u201d to Owners\u2019 property. Verbatim Report of Proceedings at 285. The appraiser also estimated that the cost of replacing the barn would be between $485,000 and $500,000. In response, King Feed called one witness, a real estate sales associate, who testified that the barn added $100,000 to $110,000 to the value of Owners\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b65 The jury awarded Owners $300,000. In a posttrial motion, Owners requested the trial court to \u201corder defendant to partially reimburse\u201d Owners\u2019 reasonable attorneys fees and costs as sanctions for discovery violations under CR 37(c) and/or CR 26(g) and RCW 4.84.185. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 134. The trial court granted Owners\u2019 motion under CR 37(c) and ordered King Feed to pay an additional $19,434. The court specifically noted that not every item related to negligence and causation is reimbursable. Rather, reimbursement is limited to the costs associated with the time period after which a reasonable person in King Feed\u2019s position should have conceded the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b66 The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in a partially published opinion, holding that (1) the trial court did not err by refusing to give King Feed\u2019s proposed instruction on damages, <em>(Thompson v. King Feed &amp; Nutrition Serv., Inc., </em>117 Wn. App. 260, 70 P.3d 972 (2003)), and (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting CR 37(c) sanctions against King Feed for its failure to admit certain matters in the requests for admission propounded by Owners during discovery. <em>Id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b67 In addition, Owners requested an award of additional attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal under CR 37(c) and RAP 14.1-14.4. The Court of Appeals denied this request because none of the cited provisions support such an award. <em>Thompson, </em>117 Wn. App. 260, slip op.

Did the trial court abuse its discretion in granting sanctions against King Feed under CR 37(c)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">3. Should Owners be awarded additional attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal pursuant to CR 37(c) and RAP 14.1-14.4?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\n<em>1. Did the trial court err in rejecting WPI 30.11 as the proper measure of damages instruction for the negligent destruction of a building?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b69 Jury instructions are reviewed de novo, and an instruction that contains an erroneous statement of the applicable law is reversible error where it prejudices a party. <em>Cox v. Spangler, </em>141 Wn.2d 431, 442, 5 P.3d 1265, 22 P.3d 791 (2000). Jury instructions are sufficient when they allow counsel to argue their theories of the case, do not mislead the jury and, when taken as a whole, properly inform the jury of the law to be applied. <em>Id. \u201cA </em>clear misstatement of the law, however, is presumed to be prejudicial.\u201d <em>Keller v. City of Spokane, </em>146 Wn.2d 237, 249-50, 44 P.3d 845 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u00b610 King Feed contends that the Court of Appeals\u2019 affirmation of instruction 8 is \u201can erroneous statement of the applicable law on damages.\u201d Pet. for Review at 15. Jury instruction 8 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">If your verdict is for the plaintiff, then you must determine the amount of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the plaintiff for such damages as you find were proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>If you find for the plaintiff, you should consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">1.

The fair market value of the barn;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">3. The fair rental value of the barn;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">4. The reasonable cost to replace the barn if you find:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">a. that there is reason personal to the owner for replacing the barn or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">b. where there is reason to believe that the plaintiff will replace the barn to its original condition, and you find that the cost of replacing the barn, although it may be greater than the value added to the property by the barn, is not unreasonably disproportionate to the diminution in market value of the property because of the loss of the barn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">CP at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b611 King Feed maintains the court should have given proposed jury instruction D6. According to King Feed, proposed instruction D6* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2was based upon WPI 30.11 and contained an accurate statement of the applicable measure of damages based on <em>Hogland v. Klein, </em>49 Wn.2d 216, 298 P.2d 1099 (1956). WPI 30.11 states that the measure of damages to personal property should be the lesser of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">1. The reasonable value of necessary repairs to any property that was damaged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">2. The difference between the fair cash market value of the property immediately before the occurrence and the fair cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>market value of the unrepaired property immediately after the occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b612 In addition to <em>Hogland, </em>King Feed relies upon the cases <em>Pepper v. J.J. Welcome Construction Co., </em>73 Wn. App. 523, 871 P.2d 601 (1994), <em>DeYoung v. Swenson, </em>6 Wn. App. 452, 493 P.2d 1247 (1972), and <em>Falcone v. Perry, </em>68 Wn.2d 909, 416 P.2d 690 (1966) to support the contention that the \u201clesser than\u201d rule is correctly applied when a barn is negligently destroyed by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">f 13 In response, Owners argue that instruction number 8 was proper and that the \u201clesser than\u201d rule is inapplicable to this case. In support, Owners point to the \u201cNote on Use\u201d that accompanies WPI 30.11, which states: \u201cThis instruction may not be appropriate for damages to real estate or improvements thereon.\u201d WPI 30.11. They also argue that under the general rule stated in <em>Burr v. Clark, </em>30 Wn.2d 149, 190 P.2d 769 (1948), they were entitled to ask the jury to award the cost of restoring the barn. Lastly, Owners distinguish both <em>DeYoung </em>and <em>Pepper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b614 We find that WPI 30.11, the \u201clesser than\u201d rule, is inapplicable in circumstances involving negligent destruction of a building. In addition to the \u201cNote on Use\u201d cited by Owners, a careful reading of the cases cited by King Feed illustrates that WPI 30.11 applies to situations in which property is damaged, not destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b6[15 In <em>Hogland, </em>the owner of a house contracted with a company to have the house moved to a new location. The move required separating the house into two sections. The first section was moved without incident, but the second section was damaged when one of the supporting timbers fractured. The trial court, quoting 15 <em>American Jurisprudence Damages </em>section 113, at 524 (1938), applied the \u201clesser than\u201d rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cThe owner is entitled to recover the entire cost of restoring a damaged building to its former condition unless such cost exceeds its diminution in value as the result of the injury, in which event the recovery must be limited to the amount of such diminution. Under this rule the court should receive evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>both as to the cost of restoring the building and as to the amount of its diminished value, and then adopt as the measure of damages the lesser of the two amounts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><em>Hogland, </em>49 Wn.2d at 220. We affirmed the \u201clesser than\u201d rule as the proper measure of damages for the damaged portion of the house. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b616 In <em>Falcone, </em>the executors of an estate sued to recover damages from a truck driver whose runaway truck struck and damaged a home. We approved a jury instruction based upon the \u201clesser than\u201d rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201cThe measure of damages with reference to the plaintiffs\u2019 property in this case is the entire cost of restoring the damage to return the property to its former condition unless the cost exceeds the diminution in value as a result of the accident, in which event the measure of damages would be the difference between the fair cash market value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property immediately before and immediately after the accident. You must adopt as the measure of damages the lesser of the two amounts, the cost of repair or the diminution in value as I have instructed you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cIf you find the plaintiffs\u2019 building could be restored to its former condition, then you may take into account in determining plaintiffs\u2019 damages the cost of restoration of the building and such loss of rent, if any, as you find plaintiffs may have sustained during the time when, with reasonable diligence, the building could have been restored to its former condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Falcone, </em>68 Wn.2d at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u00b617 In <em>Pepper, </em>the landowners brought suit after observing increased runoff and sedimentary deposits on their land, allegedly due to the clearing and grading of a neighboring plat of land. <em>Pepper, </em>73 Wn. App. at 528. The trial court limited the damage award to the lesser of restoration costs or the diminution in value of the property. <em>Pepper, </em>73 Wn. App. at 541. The property owners appealed contending the proper measure of damages for injuries to land, where the land is capable of being restored to its former condition, is restoration costs. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals agreed. <em>Id. </em>Only in dicta did the court state, \u201cWashington courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>consistently applied the \u2018lesser-than\u2019 rule in fixture cases where the damaged real property is affixed to land.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b618 <em>Hogland, Falcone, </em>and <em>Pepper </em>affirm our conclusion that prior case law holds the \u201clesser than\u201d rule is limited to situations where property is damaged and capable of repair. None of these cases support the contention that the \u201clesser than\u201d rule should be applied when a building is completely destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b619 King Feed also relies on <em>DeYoung. </em>In <em>DeYoung, </em>the defendant\u2019s negligent burning of debris on his land led to the destruction of his neighbor\u2019s barn. The Court of Appeals stated the proper measure of damages as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">Where the wrong consists in the removal or destruction of some addition, fixture or part of real property, the loss may be estimated upon the diminution in the value of the premises, if any results; or upon the value of the parts severed or destroyed, and that valuation should be adopted which will prove most beneficial to the injured party, as he is entitled to the benefit of his property intact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\"><em>DeYoung, </em>6 Wn. App. at 454. The Court of Appeals then affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of $12,000 for lost storage space. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b620 <em>DeYoung, </em>does not support King Feed\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, the measure of damages articulated in <em>DeYoung </em>concerns calculating recovery of lost <em>storage space, </em>not for recovery of the building itself. As the Court of Appeals stated, \u201c[t]he $12,000 award does not therefore represent the cost of replacing the identical building but rather the cost of replacing lost storage space to which plaintiff is entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the <em>DeYoung </em>court did not apply the \u201clesser than\u201d rule. While <em>DeYoung </em>did state the loss may be estimated upon the diminution in value or upon the value of the parts severed or destroyed, the rule was not limited to the lesser of the two amounts. On the contrary, the proper valuation was the one that proved most beneficial to the injured party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">\u00b621 King Feed also claims that the Court of Appeals\u2019 affirmation of jury instruction 8 in this case was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>King Feed argues that if the jury had been instructed pursuant to the \u201clesser than\u201d rule, it would not have awarded $300,000, which exceeds the diminution in value of the whole property by $200,000. Pet. for Review at 16. Kang Feed appears to base this claim on the testimony of its expert who stated that the diminution in value of the entire 15 acre parcel of land after the destruction of the barn was $100,000. As stated, we disagree with King Feed\u2019s contention that the \u201clesser than\u201d rule is the correct measure of damages. We also disagree with King Feed\u2019s interpretation of the \u201clesser than\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b622 As we articulated in <em>Hogland, </em>the general \u201clesser than\u201d rule is: \u201c \u2018The owner is entitled to recover the entire cost of restoring a damaged building to its former condition unless such cost exceeds its diminution in value as the result of the injury, in which event the recovery must be limited to the amount of such diminution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hogland, </em>49 Wn.2d at 220 (quoting 15 Am. Jur. \u00a7 113, at 524). Under this rule, an owner is entitled to recover the entire cost of restoring a damaged building to \u201cits\u201d former condition unless those costs exceed \u201cits\u201d diminution in value. Both of the \u201cits\u201d in this rule distinctly refer to the damaged building, not the entire parcel of property the building was located upon as King Feed would have us hold in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b623 Similarly, a close analysis of WPI 30.11 yields the same result. To reiterate, WPI 30.11 states that the measure of damages to personal property should be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">1. The reasonable value of necessary repairs to <em>any property that was damaged; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">2. The difference between the fair cash market value of the <em>property </em>immediately before the occurrence and the fair cash market value of the <em>unrepaired property </em>immediately after the occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">WPI 30.11 (emphasis added). As was the case with \u201cits\u201d in the general formulation of the \u201clesser than\u201d rule articulated in <em>Hogland, </em>the term \u201cproperty\u201d in WPI 30.11 refers to the individual piece of personal property that was damaged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>such as a vehicle. The term \u201cproperty\u201d does not include any uninjured real property the personal property may be attached to. Thus, WPI 30.ll\u2019s references to \u201cproperty\u201d do not support a calculation of diminution based upon the entire 15 acre parcel of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b624 WPI 30.11 does not apply for two additional reasons. First, the title of WPI 30.11 states that it is intended as a measure of damages for <em>personal </em>property. Second, the Note on Use specifically states, \u201cThis instruction may not be appropriate for damages to real estate or improvements thereon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201clesser than\u201d rule does not apply in the case of negligent destruction of a building, nor does it apply to the diminution in value of an entire parcel of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"> \u00b625 We also conclude that the jury\u2019s award of $300,000 does not indicate any prejudice and was proper under the instructions given. \u201cThe purpose of awarding damages in cases involving injury to real property is to return the injured party as nearly as possible to the position he would have been in had the wrongful act not occurred.\u201d 16 David K. DeWolf &amp; Keller W. Allen, Washington Practice: Tort Law and Practice \u00a7 5.2, at 126 (2d ed. 2000). In addition, when awarding damages for an action concerning real property, \u201c[t]he decision as to which measure of damages to apply is one left to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Testimony at trial estimated the fair market value of the barn to be $300,000 and the replacement cost of the barn to be more than $500,000. Under the evidence presented, instruction 8 resulted in a jury award that is a reasonable estimate of the amount necessary to put Owners in the position they would have been in had the wrongful act not occurred. King Feed was not prejudiced by the giving of instruction 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in granting sanctions against King Feed under CR 37(c)?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b626 King Feed argues that the trial court abused its discretion in granting sanctions under CR 37(c) for King Feed\u2019s failure to admit certain matters in the requests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>admission propounded by Owners. Owners argue the scope of their Request for Admission (RFAs) were proper under CR 36(a), which states that requests for admission may cover \u201cany matters within the scope of rule 26(b) set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact.\u201d CR 36(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b627 We review a trial court\u2019s decision to impose discovery sanctions under CR 37(c) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rivers v. Wash. State Conference of Mason Contractors, </em>145 Wn.2d 674, 684, 41 P.3d 1175 (2002). A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds. <em>Wash. State Physicians Ins. Exch. &amp; Ass\u2019n v. Fisons Corp., </em>122 Wn.2d 299, 339, 858 P.2d 1054 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">f28 CR 37(c) provides that if a party fails to admit the truth of any matter as requested under a CR 36 request for admission and the matter is subsequently proved, the party may apply to the trial court for an order requiring the other party to pay reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including attorney fees. The trial court may then order payment unless it finds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">(1) the request was held objectionable pursuant to rule 36(a), or (2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe the fact was not true or the document was not genuine, or (4) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">CR 37(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">129 The purpose of requests for admission is to eliminate from controversy factual matters that will not be disputed at trial. <em>Santos v. Dean, </em>96 Wn. App. 849, 861, 982 P.2d 632 (1999); <em>Brust v. Newton, </em>70 Wn. App. 286, 295, 852 P.2d 1092 (1993). A party is not required to concede either factual matters central to the lawsuit or legal conclusions. <em>Puget Sound Nat\u2019l Bank v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>32 Wn. App. 32, 49, 645 P.2d 1122 (1982); <em>see also Reid Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. Bellevue Props., </em>7 Wn. App. 701, 704, 502 P.2d 480 (1972) (\u201cIt is not a proper use of CR 36 to request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>an adversary to admit, in effect, the truth of the assertion that he should lose the lawsuit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b630 However, CR 36 does permit \u201cstatements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact.\u201d CR 36(a). CR 36(a) also states that a party who believes that a matter for which an admission has been requested relates to \u201ca genuine issue for trial or a central fact in dispute may not, on that ground alone, object to that request; he may, subject to the provisions of rule 37(c), deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.\u201d CR 36(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b631 The requests at issue here, and their answers, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">1.

This argument fails because CR 36 clearly states a party may not deny a request on the grounds that the party considers the matter on which the admission has been requested \u201cpresents a genuine issue for trial,\u201d or <em>\u201ca </em>central fact in dispute.\u201d CR 36(a). A party may deny a request for admission only pursuant to the four exceptions of CR 37(c) and must include the specific reasons for such denial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b634 Furthermore, King Feed had a duty to seasonably supplement its initial responses to the requests for admission. The fact that the requests were propounded within days of the complaint is immaterial. CR 26(e)(2) provides that a party is under a duty to supplement a prior response if he obtains information upon the basis of which \u201che knows that the response was incorrect when made\u201d or \u201che knows that the response though correct when made is no longer true.\u201d CR 26(e)(2)(A), (B). King Feed either denied each request for admission directly or denied each request based on insufficient information upon which to base an informed decision despite reasonable inquiry, further stating that discovery and investigation were continuing. Although King Feed contested its liability at trial, there is nothing in the record to support its contentions. As the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>noted in her ruling, \u201cit doesn\u2019t appear that there was a reasonable ground to believe that the cause of the fire was anything other than the storage of wet hay and that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\u201d CP at 444. All of the experts concluded the likely cause of the fire was spontaneous combustion of hay. As such, there was sufficient evidence upon which King Feed should have based an informed response to the request for admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b635 King Feed\u2019s second argument appears to be that the requests for admission asked King Feed to concede legal conclusions including negligence, proximate cause, and absence of contributory negligence. This argument fails because the requests did not ask King Feed to state legal conclusions. What courts refer to as legal conclusions may also be called questions of law. CR 36 does not authorize requests for admission to ask, nor require a party to answer, questions of law. Rather, the requests for admission asked King Feed major factual issues and asked King Feed to apply the law to the facts concerning negligence, proximate cause, and contributory negligence. Nothing in CR 36 entitled King Feed to deny the questions in absence of proof to support such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b636 Therefore I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant sanctions pursuant to CR 37(c). There is no limitation in CR 36 or CR 37 that restricts requests for admission to the admission of major factual issues, nor were there any questions which asked King Feed to concede legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b637 <em>3.

Clark, </em>30 Wn.2d 149, 190 P.2d 769 (1948), considered the proper measure of damage for injury to real property. In <em>Burr </em>the defendants\u2019 employee caused the plaintiffs\u2019 furnace boiler to explode while attempting to repair their residential heating system. Thereafter the plaintiffs hired a heating contractor who determined the boiler had to be replaced \u201cas it was impossible during the war years to get the parts required for the repair of the old boiler.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for negligence seeking to recover the cost of replacing the boiler. The heating contractor testified at trial that \u201cthe new boiler was the only one available, of the size necessary for the particular job\u201d and that \u201cthe method employed for remedying the situation was the cheapest that could be figured out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157-58. The trial court awarded the plaintiffs damages equal to the cost of purchasing and installing a new boiler.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b644 On appeal we affirmed and set out the following oft-quoted general rules to measure damage to real property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">In the case of real property, where the injury is only temporary, and the property can he restored to its original condition at a reasonable expense and at a cost less than the diminution in the value of the property, the general rule for the measure of damages is the cost of restoration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The general rule is well stated in <em>Koyen v. </em>Citizens[\u2019] <em>National] Bank, </em>107 Neb. 274, 185 N.W. 413 [1921], as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201cProperty such as fences, parts of buildings, and machinery, and furnaces, is capable of being replaced, and the proper measure of damages for the destruction thereof is the cost of restoring or replacing such property. If the property destroyed has no value separate and apart from the realty, the measure of damages for property destroyed is the difference between the value of the real estate before the injury and after the injury. But as to the destruction of property which is a part of the real estate, whose destruction does the realty itself no damage and is capable of being repaired or replaced, the measure is the cost of repairing or restoring the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 158 (some citations omitted). <em>Burr </em>stated the general rule that the correct measure of damage is the cost of repair or diminution of value, whichever is less.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u00b645 <em>Hogland v. Klein, </em>49 Wn.2d 216, 298 P.2d 1099 (1956), followed this rule, applying it specifically to a destroyed building. In <em>Hogland </em>the plaintiff agreed to move a building for the defendant. The move required the plaintiff to divide the building into two sections. During the course of the move, one of the beams supporting the second section of the building broke and that part of the building was destroyed. The trial court determined that prior to the accident, the value of the damaged portion of the building was $1,000 and that immediately after, the value was $100. Finding the cost of repairing the damaged portion of the building \u201cfar exceeded\u201d that portion\u2019s actual value prior to the accident, the trial court awarded the defendant $900, an amount equal to the difference in value of the damaged portion of the building before and after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b646 On appeal we quoted favorably the general rule set forth in <em>American Jurisprudence:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\"><em>\u201cThe owner is entitled to recover the entire cost of restoring a damaged building to its former condition unless such cost exceeds its diminution in value as the result of the injury, in which event the recovery must be limited to the amount of such diminution. </em>Under this rule the court should receive evidence both as to the cost of restoring the building and as to the amount of its diminished value, and then adopt as the measure of damages the lesser of the two amounts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>Hogland, </em>49 Wn.2d at 220 (emphasis added) (quoting 15 Am. Jur. \u00a7 113, at 524). Applying that rule we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b647 Read together, <em>Burr </em>and <em>Hogland </em>establish generally the measure of damage is the cost to repair or restore the building to its former condition or its diminution in value, whichever is less. <em>Hogland, </em>49 Wn.2d at 220; <em>Burr, </em>30 Wn.2d at 158. This is especially true where, as was the case in <em>Hogland, </em>the building at issue is destroyed and is uneconomical to repair. <em>See Hogland, </em>49 Wn.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b648 Subsequent cases have also applied this formula with little difficulty. In <em>Falcone v. Perry, </em>68 Wn.2d 909, 416 P.2d 690 (1966), the defendant\u2019s employee negligently allowed a truck to roll down the street into the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>house, causing extensive damage. 68 Wn.2d at 910. Testimony presented at trial established the house was worth between $4,000 and $6,000 and could be repaired for about $4,400. The value of the real property before the accident was roughly $28,000, and the value after was about $27,600. At trial both parties agreed \u201cthe proper measure of damages [was] the cost of repairs to the building, or the diminution in value of the plaintiff\u2019s property, whichever [was] the lesser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911-12. The jury rendered a verdict of $4,095 after being instructed, among other things, that it \u201c \u2018must adopt as the measure of damages the lesser of the two amounts, the cost of repair or the diminution in value.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. On appeal we affirmed the jury\u2019s award, citing favorably both <em>Burr </em>and <em>Hogland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b649 In <em>Pepper v. J.J. Welcome Construction Co., </em>73 Wn. App. 523, 871 P.2d 601 (1994), excessive runoff damaged the Peppers\u2019 land. They sued the developer who was clearing and grading the neighboring land for damages. The trial court applied the \u201clesser than\u201d rule, but the Court of Appeals disagreed since the damage was to the land itself, not to any structure. However, it noted that \u201cWashington courts have consistently applied the \u2018lesser-than\u2019 rule in fixture cases where the damaged real property is affixed to land.\u201d <em>Pepper, </em>73 Wn. App. at 541. The <em>Pepper </em>court correctly distinguished, as had the <em>Burr </em>court years earlier, between harm to the land itself and harm to improvements on the land. The \u201clesser than\u201d rule applies in the latter context.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">f 50 Despite the clarity of our precedent, the lead opinion makes a logic-defying leap after analyzing these cases. The lead opinion confines the \u201clesser than\u201d rule to cases where the building is \u201cdamaged.\u201d Lead opinion at 457. But if the building is \u201cdestroyed\u201d a different rule applies. Nowhere do our cases articulate this distinction, probably because it is illogical and nearly impossible to apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Just how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>damage must a building sustain before it is \u201cdestroyed\u201d rather than merely \u201cdamaged\u201d? If a defendant negligently cuts down a tree, causing it to fall on the neighbor\u2019s garage and cave in one side of the building, is it damaged or destroyed? If the defendant negligently sets fire to a building that is severely charred but still standing with some structural integrity, is it damaged or destroyed? The court\u2019s job is reduced to defining where on that elusive continuum one crosses the magical line from \u201cdamaged\u201d to \u201cdestroyed\u201d with a concomitant change in the measure of damages. Such a distortion is unworkable and will result in future litigants straining to compare their facts to cases in which the measure of damages yielded the most favorable award.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b651 The lead opinion also ignores the facts of <em>Hogland, </em>in which the building half being moved was \u201cpractically demolished.\u201d 49 Wn.2d at 218. <em>Hogland </em>made no effort to distinguish between \u201cdamaged\u201d and \u201cdestroyed,\u201d but instead simply applied the \u201clesser than\u201d rule. <em>Burr </em>did the same in the context of a boiler that was completely destroyed and evidence suggested replacement was the cheapest alternative. The lead opinion\u2019s newly minted distinction is without precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b652 After distorting our case law to avoid its conclusions, the lead opinion does not tell us what the rule <em>is </em>in the context of a \u201cdestroyed\u201d building beyond a statement that the general purpose of damages for \u201c \u2018injury to real property is to return the injured party as nearly as possible to the position he would have been in had the wrongful act not occurred.\u2019 \u201d Lead opinion at 459 (quoting 16 David K. DeWolf &amp; Keller W. Allen, Washington Practice: Tort Law and Practice \u00a7 5.2, at 126 (2d ed. 2000)). While useful as a purpose statement, this broad language is no substitute for specific rules carefully formulated and applied over many years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00b653 Jury instruction 8 is wrong because it misstates the law applicable to the present facts. Here, as in <em>Hogland, </em>the injury at issue is the negligent destruction of a building. At trial, evidence was presented that the cost of replacing the barn was roughly $500,000, and the fair market value of the barn before the fire was between $100,000 and $320,000. The evidence thus established that the barn, like the building in <em>Hogland, </em>had value separate and apart from the real property. Thus, the proper measure of damages under these circumstances is the lesser of the cost to replace the barn or the diminution in value of the property as a result of the fire. <em>See Hogland, </em>49 Wn.2d at 220. This is precisely the measure of damages proposed instruction D-6 would have instructed the jury to award.* 12***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because jury instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>tion 8 did not include the diminution in value limitation on damages established in <em>Hogland, </em>it was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b654 The instruction was prejudicial to King Feed. The Thompsons\u2019 appraiser presented evidence at trial that immediately before the fire their barn was worth between $290,000 and $320,000, and therefore the barn \u201ccontributed a value of $300,000, more or less, to the Thompson property.\u201d Verbatim Report of Proceedings at 285. However, King Feed\u2019s expert countered by testifying the barn added approximately $100,000 to $110,000 to the value of the Thompsons\u2019 property. In light of the conflicting value estimates, we cannot say jury instruction 8 was harmless because we cannot be sure what the jury would have done had it been properly instructed. Thus, King Feed was prejudiced by jury instruction 8. An error related to a jury instruction will be \u201creversible error where it prejudices a party.\u201d <em>Hue v. Farmboy Spray Co., </em>127 Wn.2d 67, 92, 896 P.2d 682 (1995). The case must be reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II.

Furthermore, a party who believes a request for admission relates to \u201ca genuine issue for trial or a central fact in dispute may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may, subject to the provisions of rule 37(c), deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b659 The requests for admission at issue here, and Ring Feed\u2019s answers, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">1.

Together, requests for admission 1, 2, and 4 asked King Feed to admit that it \u201cnegligently\u2019 stored hay in the Thompsons\u2019 barn and that such \u201cnegligence\u201d was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of the fire. Negligence and proximate cause are legal conclusions and are matters usually reserved for the jury. Similarly, requests 3 and 5 asked King Feed to admit there was no \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d on the part of the Thompsons for the fire. Contributory negligence, like negligence, is a legal conclusion usually reserved for the jury. Although the requests for admission were phrased arguably to characterize them as relating to the application of law to fact under CR 36(a), King Feed\u2019s negligence and liability for the fire are legal conclusions. To that extent, King Feed likely had \u201cother good reason for the failure to admit\u201d the Thompsons\u2019 requests for admission. CR 37(c)(4). Thus, the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees and expenses against King Feed abused its discretion. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and vacate the order imposing sanctions on King Feed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">III.

Its distinction between \u201cdamaged\u201d and \u201cdestroyed\u201d buildings is misguided and wholly unnecessary. The new rule is confusing and will work considerable mischief in future cases.

If the harm is to the land itself, the next step is to apply the temporary/ permanent rule with its associated measures of damages. <em>Harkoff v. Whatcom, County, </em>40 Wn.2d 147, 241 P.2d 932 (1952), articulated this standard in the context of a suit for harm to real property from the flooding of the county\u2019s roadside drainage ditch. We stated this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">In determining what is the applicable rule for measuring damages in cases like the one before us, one of the first questions is whether the damage to the property is permanent, or whether the property may be restored to its original condition. If the injury is permanent, the general rule applicable is the difference between the market value of the property immediately before the damage and its market value immediately thereafter. If, however, the property may be restored to its original condition the measure of damages is the reasonable expense of such restoration, and in a proper case the loss of use or of income therefrom for a reasonable time pending such restoration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 152. The court noted that choosing between these two rules is sometimes difficult: \u201cA study of the foregoing questions will indicate that sometimes it has been difficult to determine which rule to apply to a given situation. In some situations, the cost of repairing the injury may be greater than the diminution in its market value, in which event the courts are inclined to use the latter measure of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">This temporary/permanent distinction is amply illustrated by case law and treatises. <em>See, e.g., Colella v. King County, </em>72 Wn.2d 386, 433 P.2d 154 (1967); 16 David K. DeWolf &amp; Keller W. Allen, Washington Practice: Tort Law and Practice \u00a7 5.2, at 126-28 (2d ed. 2000). Stated simply, the rule is that if the injury to the <em>real estate </em>(land) is temporary or capable of repair, then the measure of damages is the reasonable cost of repair. But if the injury is permanent or beyond repair, then the measure of damages is the diminution in value of the property. It must be emphasized that the temporary/permanent distinction does <em>not </em>apply to harm to improvements. <em>Compare </em>22 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Damages </em>\u00a7\u00a7 255-57 (2003) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 269, 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\"> <em>See supra </em>note 3 for a discussion of the temporary/permanent distinction for harm to the real estate itself. There is no similar distinction for harm to structures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\"> The lead opinion also quotes the same treatise for the proposition that the trier of fact may choose the measure of damages. Lead opinion at 459 (quoting 16 DeWolf &amp; Allen, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.2, at 126). The authors of the treatise obtained this rule from <em>Tatum v. R&amp;R Cable, Inc., </em>30 Wn. App. 580, 636 P.2d 508 (1981), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>overruled on other grounds by Beckmann v. Spokane Transit Authority, </em>107 Wn.2d 785, 733 P.2d 960 (1987), in which the court stated in a footnote: \u201cThe trial court believed restoration damages were the proper method; that is within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Tatum, </em>30 Wn. App. at 584 n.2. This proposition is true only so far as it does not contradict the general rule for damages articulated by our precedent. The cases cited earlier do not grant the trier of fact the discretion to choose the measure of damages. <em>See, e.g., Pepper, </em>73 Wn. App. at 541 (holding that the trial court erred by using the wrong rule for measuring damages). The trier of fact determines the amount of damages using the various measures, and then may award replacement damages unless they exceed diminution in value damages, in which case it must award the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\"> Jury instruction D-6 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">If your verdict is for the plaintiff, then you must determine the amount of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the plaintiff for such damages as you find were proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">If you find for the plaintiff your verdict should be the lesser of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">1.
