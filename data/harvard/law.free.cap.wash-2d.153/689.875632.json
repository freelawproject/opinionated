We hold that it does not and affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<author id=\"A4s\">Fairhurst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">\u00b62 Tony Douglas Robinson entered two separate <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>} </em>pleas to one count of kidnapping and one count of delivery of cocaine. He received a separate sentence for each count. Robinson directly appealed his kidnapping conviction, alleging in part breach of the plea agreement. At all times during plea bargaining, sentencing, and appeal, Robinson was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">\u00b63 Almost one year after sentencing, but prior to the Court of Appeals decision on Robinson\u2019s appeal, Robinson moved pro se pursuant to CrR 7.8 to withdraw both of his guilty pleas, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct by reason of breach of the plea agreement, and newly discovered evidence. He also moved for the appointment of counsel to present his motions to withdraw but cited no authority that would entitle him to counsel. The trial court summarily denied all motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">\u00b64 The Court of Appeals filed an unpublished opinion affirming the kidnapping conviction. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>noted at 114 Wn. App. 1012 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">\u00b65 Robinson appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions to withdraw guilty pleas and for appointment of counsel. The trial court appointed counsel to pursue this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before the Court of Appeals, counsel argued that CrR 3.1(b)(2) entitled Robinson to representation below when moving to withdraw his guilty pleas. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>noted at 117 Wn. App. 1073, slip op. at 3 (2003). The Court of Appeals reversed the denial of the motion to withdraw one of the guilty pleas based on newly discovered evidence, but let stand the denial of the motion to withdraw the other plea and the denial of appointment of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 9-10. We granted review solely on the question of entitlement to counsel under CrR 3.1(b)(2). <em>State v. Robinson, </em>151 Wn.2d 1018 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\u00b66 Robinson asserts that he was entitled to counsel at state expense under CrR 3.1(b)(2) when he moved to withdraw his guilty pleas after sentencing pursuant to CrR 7.8.</p>\n<p id=\"AT0F\">\u00b67 CrR 3.1(b)(2) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">A lawyer shall be provided at every stage of the proceedings, including sentencing, appeal, and post-conviction review. A lawyer initially appointed shall continue to represent the defendant through all stages of the proceedings unless a new appointment is made by the court following withdrawal of the original lawyer pursuant to section (e) because geographical considerations or other factors make it necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\u00b6 8 The court will apply canons of statutory interpretation when construing a court rule. <em>City of Seattle v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>Guay, </em>150 Wn.2d 288, 300, 76 P.3d 231 (2003). We review construction of a court rule de novo because it is a question of law. <em>See Judd v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>152 Wn.2d 195, 202, 95 P.3d 337 (2004). While the plain language of a court rule controls where it is unambiguous, under our court rule interpretation guidelines we must examine CrR 3.1(b)(2) in context with the entire rule in which it is contained as well as all related rules. <em>See Rest. Dev., Inc. v. Cananwill, Inc., </em>150 Wn.2d 674, 682, 80 P.3d 598 (2003); <em>cf. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell &amp; Gwinn, L.L.C., </em>146 Wn.2d 1, 10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002) (requiring consideration of surrounding text when discerning the plain meaning of a statutory provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">\u00b69 CrR 3.1, captioned \u201cRIGHT TO AND ASSIGNMENT OF A LAWYER,\u201d has six parts. Part (a), captioned \u201cTypes of Proceedings,\u201d establishes the scope to which the rest of the rule applies. It provides that the right to a lawyer extends \u201cto all criminal proceedings for offenses punishable by loss of liberty.\u201d CrR 3.1(a). Part (b), is captioned \u201cStage of Proceedings.\u201d Subpart (b)(1) tells us when the right first accrues: \u201cas soon as feasible after the defendant is taken into custody, appears before a committing magistrate, or is formally charged, whichever occurs earliest.\u201d Subpart (b)(2) describes how long that right is retained: \u201cat every stage of the proceedings, including sentencing, appeal, and post-conviction review.\u201d Subpart (b)(2) further provides that the same lawyer should represent the defendant through all of these stages of a criminal proceeding unless withdrawal is necessary under part (e). Part (c) establishes the procedure for explaining the right to a lawyer and putting the defendant in contact with one; part (d) describes eligibility for a lawyer at state expense under this rule; part (e) explains when a lawyer is allowed to withdraw; and part (f) describes the availability of expert, investigative, or other types of services other than a lawyer at state expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\u00b610 The specific provision at issue here, CrR 3.1(b)(2), broadly describes the various stages of a criminal proceeding to which the right to counsel attaches, \u201cincluding sentencing, appeal, and post-conviction review.\u201d But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>right is not limitless. We must also discern the plain meaning of CrR 3.1(b)(2), while taking into account related court rules and controlling case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\u00b611 The various stages of a criminal proceeding listed in CrR 3.1(b)(2) are more specifically covered elsewhere. For example: (1) CrR 3.1(b)(1) and CrR 3.1(c) delineate the right to counsel prior to arraignment, (2) CrR 4.1(b) outlines the right to counsel at arraignment and throughout trial, (3) CrR 7.2(b) requires notification of the right to counsel on appeal at sentencing, and (4) CrR 7.6(b) provides for counsel at probation revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\u00b612 Moreover, the right to counsel is constitutionally guaranteed at all critical stages of a criminal proceeding, including sentencing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and additionally on first appeal when states provide a right of appeal. State <em>v. Rupe, </em>108 Wn.2d 734, 741, 743 P.2d 210 (1987) (\u201cSentencing is a critical stage of the proceedings, at which a defendant is constitutionally entitled to be represented by counsel.\u201d); <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 355-56, 83 S. Ct. 814, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1963) (holding on equal protection grounds that meaningful first appeal requires appointment of counsel for indigent defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">\u00b613 In only one area have we applied the right to counsel under CrR 3.1 or CrRLJ 3.1 beyond what is constitutionally required. That stage is at the beginning, and our motivation was the preservation of evidence. <em>See State v. Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d 193, 211, 59 P.3d 632 (2002) (holding CrRLJ 3.1(b)(1) extended right to counsel beyond the constitution pursuant to rule-making authority regarding preservation of evidence). Robinson argues the plain language of CrR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>3.1(b)(2), \u201cpost-conviction review,\u201d requires appointment of counsel for his motions to withdraw. But it is not that simple. We know of no reported case where counsel has been appointed at the late stage of plea withdrawal following sentencing even though CrR 3.1 has been on the books since 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\u00b6 14 We do allow appointment of counsel for a personal restraint petition (PRP) after an initial determination that the petition is not frivolous. RAP 16.11, .15. This makes sense given the history of rules governing postconviction relief. Originally, postconviction relief was detailed in former CrR 7.7. That rule provided that petitions for postconviction relief were to be made to the chief judge of the Court of Appeals in the district where the petitioner was convicted. Former CrR 7.7(a) (1973) (rescinded 1976). Counsel would be provided at state expense after an initial determination that the petition was not frivolous. Former CrR 7.7(b), (e). In 1976, the Rules of Appellate Procedure were adopted, and RAP 16.3-.15, the rules governing PRPs, superseded the relief previously available under former CrR 7.7. The procedure for presenting a PRP and obtaining counsel is similar to that formerly provided in CrR 7.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\u00b615 We adopted CrR 7.8 in 1986. CrR 7.8 is narrower than former CrR 7.7 and allows for relief from judgment due to mistakes, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, or other irregularities, but not for errors of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similar to former CrR 7.7, and the current RAPs governing PRPs, CrR 7.8 provides that a court may summarily deny a motion under this rule if the motion and supporting affidavits do not \u201cestablish grounds for relief.\u201d CrR 7.8(c)(2). CrR 7.8(b) provides that motions made under this rule are subject to RCW 10.73.090, .100, .130, and .140. These code provisions generally apply to collateral attacks and most notably to PRPs. This evinces a strong intention on the rule drafters\u2019 part that motions made under CrR 7.8 in superior court are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>subject to the same limitations, when appropriate, that apply to PRPs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In further evidence of the similarity of treatment between certain kinds of relief sought under CrR 7.8 and relief sought in PRPs, CrR 7.8 allows a trial court to transfer a CrR 7.8 motion to the Court of Appeals to be treated as a PRP \u201cto serve the ends of justice.\u201d CrR 7.8-(c)(2). Thus, the trial court may serve as an initial screener, much like the chief judge of the Court of Appeals would in a PRP, prior to either transferring the motion to the Court of Appeals or evaluating the merits of a motion and possibly appointing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"> \u00b616 It is apparent, then, that CrR 3.1(b)(2) refers to the right to counsel that is either already constitutionally guaranteed or provided elsewhere in the rules. The broad, sweeping language of the provision is not without limit and must be read in context with related court rules. With respect to the right to counsel for postconviction review, we have imposed a limitation that requires, in the case of PRPs, for the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, and in the case of CrR 7.8 motions, for the superior court judge, to initially determine whether the petition or motion establishes grounds for relief. If it does not establish grounds for relief, the judge may dismiss the petition or deny the motion without a hearing on the merits. If it does establish grounds for relief, counsel may be provided if not already available.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u00b617 In Robinson\u2019s case, the trial court summarily denied his motions, including the motion for appointment of counsel. By not holding a hearing, the trial court effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>determined that Robinson did not establish grounds for relief. Under our above analysis, Robinson would not have been entitled to counsel. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the denial of one motion to withdraw based on newly discovered evidence. It then alternatively determined either that the right to counsel issue was moot or that any denial of counsel was harmless error. Robinson claims that the error was not harmless or moot, and that had he been provided counsel he would have been able to make a record that would show that his two pleas were part of a joint plea agreement. If that were the case, Robinson would have been entitled to withdraw both pleas under <em>State v. Turley, </em>149 Wn.2d 395, 402, 69 P.3d 338 (2003) (requiring court to allow defendant to withdraw all pleas in a joint plea agreement when one is \u00e1llowed).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"> \u00b618 Because the asserted error is a violation of a court rule (rather than a constitutional violation), it is governed by the harmless error test. <em>Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d at 220. Thus, only if the error was prejudicial in that \u201c \u2018within reasonable probabilities, [it] the error [had] not occurred, the outcome of the [motion] would have been materially affected\u2019 \u201d will reversal be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>(second alteration in original) (quoting <em>State v. Neal, </em>144 Wn.2d 600, 611, 30 P.3d 1255 (2001)). Robinson claims that \u201c[alp-plying this test in [his] case seems particularly cruel and counterproductive,\u201d because the \u201cfailure to provide [him] counsel to assist in the preparation and presentation of his motion to withdraw the guilty pleas made it impossible for him to present the requisite showing the pleas constituted a joint deal.\u201d Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 13-14. But if Robinson were entitled to counsel at all, it would not have been until <em>after </em>the motion to withdraw was already prepared and initially presented. This is because, as we discussed above, the trial court may summarily deny a motion under CrR 7.8 when it lacks merit, similar to dismissal of a PRP, prior to appointing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u00b619 Most dispositive is that Robinson did not argue that counsel was necessary to establish that his guilty pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>were part of a joint plea agreement in front of the Court of Appeals. He also did not claim that his guilty pleas were even part of a joint plea agreement. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellant at 1 (\u201cMr. Robinson entered <em>Alford </em>pleas ... as part of separate plea agreements.\u201d); Pro Se Suppl. Br. of Appellant at 1 (same). Rather, he asserted one basis from which his kidnapping plea should be withdrawn and one basis from which his cocaine delivery plea should be withdrawn. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellant at 13, 25. The Court of Appeals reversed the cocaine delivery plea based only on Robinson\u2019s newly discovered evidence argument. It did not determine whether there was a joint plea agreement because Robinson made no such argument. If counsel did not argue that the pleas were part of a joint plea agreement in front of the Court of Appeals, there is no indication that it would have done so at the trial level. Because Robinson makes this argument for the first time before this court, we decline to address it. <em>See </em>RAP 2.5(a). Accordingly, we hold that any denial of the right to counsel was harmless because the Court of Appeals reversed the denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea under which Robinson may have been entitled to counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u00b620 In one final argument, Robinson asserts that we have already decided the pertinent issue in <em>Templeton </em>and are now bound by that decision in the current matter. <em>Templeton </em>does not control the present case. In <em>Templeton, </em>we were called upon to determine whether CrRLJ 3.1(b)(1) exceeded the court\u2019s authority in granting a right to counsel not specifically provided for constitutionally or legislatively. 148 Wn.2d at 212. CrRLJ 3.1(b)(1) closely resembles CrR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>3.1(b)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We held that the right to counsel under CrRLJ 3.1(b)(1) was a proper exercise of our procedural rule-making authority because it \u201caffects and regulates the process of \u2018taking and obtaining evidence\u2019 and preservation of such evidence. Preservation of evidence is a procedural matter.\u201d <em>Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d at 217 (quoting <em>State v. Fields, </em>85 Wn.2d 126, 128, 530 P.2d 284 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">|21 The right to counsel presently asserted is readily distinguishable from the right to counsel at issue in <em>Templeton. </em>First, as noted, the <em>Templeton </em>decision determined the validity of a rule for courts of limited jurisdiction, not a superior court rule. Second, the rule being reviewed (CrRLJ 3.1(b)(1)) was neither the rule at issue here (CrR 3.1(b)(2)), nor its limited jurisdiction counterpart (CrRLJ 3.1(b)(2)). Finally, whereas the right at issue in <em>Templeton </em>was pretrial and related to collection and preservation of evidence, the right at issue here is postjudgment, and the same rationale cannot apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\u00b622 Court rules must be read in their proper context. Reading CrR 3.1(b)(2) in conjunction with the rest of the court rules and controlling case law makes it evident that the right to counsel recognized in CrR 3.1(b)(2) is not limitless and is specifically applied in various other provisions. Aright to counsel may attach when making a CrR 7.8 motion after the court determines that the motion establishes grounds for relief. Here, the superior court found no grounds for relief and did not appoint counsel for the CrR 7.8 motions. On appeal, with counsel, the Court of Appeals determined the superior court was incorrect in denying one of his motions to withdraw guilty plea. Because the Court of Appeals determined a ground for relief, the superior court was incorrect in denying counsel. But the latter error was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>harmless in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 subsequent reversal. We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Alexander, C.J.; C. Johnson, Bridge, Chambers, and Owens, JJ.; and Ireland, J.

Although Robinson was represented on his first appeal by counsel, he moved for the appointment of counsel for withdrawal of his pleas before a decision in his first appeal was reached. The trial court and the State made no mention of that fact (Robinson might still have been represented) at the proceeding where the trial court summarily dismissed Robinson\u2019s CrR 7.8 and request for counsel motions. The State did, however, make mention of this fact when Robinson was appointed counsel for his appeal of those motions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">MS.

The Washington State Bar Association task force on Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction \u201cextensively revised\u201d subsection (b)(2), however, \u201cto state simply that a lawyer shall be provided at \u2018every critical stage of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d 4B Karl B. Tegland, Washington Practice: Rules Practice, CrRLJ 3.1, task force cmt. at 450 (6th ed. 2002). The task force agreed that the inclusion of appeal and postconviction review was \u201cmisplaced\u201d in both CrR 3.1 and JCrR 2.11, presumably because the task force did not consider them to be \u201ccritical stages\u201d of a criminal proceeding. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, CrR 3.1(b)(2) has not been amended since its adoption in 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em> </em>Relief for errors of law must be sought under CrR 7.5 (motion for a new trial) by an appeal or a PRR</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> RCW 10.73.150, regarding the right to counsel on collateral attack, was not enacted until 1995, after CrR 7.8 was last amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> In Robinson\u2019s case, it is unclear whether he still had counsel at the time he filed his pro se motions to withdraw and for appointment of counsel. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">It is true that CrR 7.8 does not explicitly state when, if ever, counsel will be provided when motions are made pursuant to this rule. However, CrR 7.8(b) requires that motions be \u201csubject\u201d to the limitations found in the statutes that also govern PRPs. We thus interpret CrR 7.8 to provide counsel after an initial determination has been made that the motion is not frivolous, much like the procedure used to appoint counsel in PRPs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> It is important to note that Robinson sought counsel not for withdrawal of his pleas prior to sentencing, but rather postjudgment. Were he to seek withdrawal prior to judgment, pursuant to CrR 4.2(f), he would arguably still be entitled to counsel constitutionally because there is a right to counsel through sentencing. <em>Rupe, </em>108 Wn.2d at 741. Instead, because Robinson tried to withdraw his pleas after judgment, CrR 4.2(0 directs that his motion be treated as a motion for relief from judgment or order under CrR 7.8.

Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s history lesson, I find no basis to conclude the proper \u201ccontext\u201d of CrR 3.1(b)(2) shows it does not apply to CrR 7.8 motions, nor do I agree the plain meaning of this text permits such \u201ccontextual\u201d analysis in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u00b625 First, CrR 3.1(b)(2) means what it says.

True, the Rules of Appellate Procedure (RAPs) provide more specific guidance for the provision of attorneys in personal restraint petitions (PRPs). And it is hardly surprising similar provisions existed in the predecessor rule governing relief similar to PRPs, former CrR 7.7 (rescinded 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">f 27 However, we are not dealing with the RAPs governing PRPs or the predecessor rule CrR 7.7. We are dealing with CrR 7.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\u00b628 CrR 7.8 has no predecessor rule. It was not derived from CrR 7.7. CrR 7.8 was adopted <em>ten years </em>after CrR 7.7 was rescinded and the RAPs governing PRPs adopted. In 1986, CrR 7.8 was adopted by this court sui generis.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">\u00b629 The majority mistakenly compares CrR 7.8 to former CrR 7.7 without reason for its analogy. While the majority has clearly shown that the current RAPs governing PRPs include similar attorney-appointment provisions to prior CrR 7.7, it has not demonstrated any link between CrR 7.8 and the prior \u201cpost-conviction\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">\u00b630 Nor does the majority offer any reason why CrR 7.8 motions are not governed by the requirements of CrR 3.1(b)(2). Unlike the RAP provisions governing PRPs or prior CrR 7.7, CrR 7.8 contains no specific attorney-ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>pointment provisions. Motions under CrR 7.8 are clearly governed by the general requirements of CrR 3.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\u00b631 Since CrR 3.1(b)(2) applies, the State makes two arguments against CrR 3.1(b)(2) itself. The State claims that we do not have the authority to promulgate the rule and that the rule conflicts with RCW 10.73.150. Neither claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\u00b632 Binding precedent compels me to conclude we have the authority to promulgate CrR 3.1(b)(2). As a general rule, this court has the inherent power to prescribe rules of procedure and practice. <em>State v. Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d 193, 212, 59 P.3d 632 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201cSubstantive law prescribes norms for societal conduct and punishments for violations thereof. It thus creates, defines, and regulates primary rights. In contrast, practice and procedure pertain to the essentially mechanical operations of the courts by which substantive law, rights, and remedies are effectuated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 213 (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>84 Wn.2d 498, 501, 527 P.2d 674 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\u00b6 33 \u201c[T]he right to counsel established by court rule is a \u2018procedural\u2019 matter promulgated under this court\u2019s rule-making authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216. The provision of an attorney is the quintessential procedural right,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the ultimate guardian of the substantive constitutional rights guaranteed to all criminal defendants, and thus CrR 3.1(b)(2) is well within this court\u2019s inherent power.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">\u00b634 Even if within this court\u2019s power, the State alternatively claims CrR 3.1(b)(2) conflicts with RCW 10.73.150. That statute defines when the legislature requires counsel for indigent defendants. However nothing in that statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>purports to limit this court\u2019s ability to promulgate rules that provide for counsel in additional circumstances, nor could the legislature impinge upon the inherent power of this court to make rules on matters of procedure and process without violating separation of powers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And it is this court\u2019s duty to construe statutes so as to avoid constitutional infirmities. <em>State ex rel. Faulk v. CSG Job Ctr., </em>117 Wn.2d 493, 500, 816 P.2d 725 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\u00b635 The State then contends even if it was error to not appoint counsel, the error was harmless. All parties cite the general maxim that violations of court rules are subject to harmless error analysis. <em>Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d at 220; <em>State v. Jaquez, </em>105 Wn. App. 699, 716, 20 P.3d 1035 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u00b636 Yet I have a very hard time discerning why the outright unconstitutional denial of an attorney is a structural error not subject to harmless error consideration, but denial of a rule-entitled attorney is. The United States Supreme Court has concluded that the denial of counsel when required by the constitution is \u201cstructural error\u201d and is not subject to harmless error analysis in the first instance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">One of those violations, involved in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335[, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799] (1963), was the total deprivation of the right to counsel at trial. . . . These are structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by \u201charmless-error\u201d standards. The entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end is obviously affected by the absence of counsel for a criminal defendant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-8\"><em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 309-10, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>\u00b637 The interests are the same. Indeed, when <em>Templeton </em>applied a harmless error analysis, it relied on a case analyzing whether evidentiary error was harmless, not a structural error like the right to counsel. <em>Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d at 220 n.126 (citing <em>State v. Neal, </em>144 Wn.2d 600, 611, 30 P.3d 1255 (2001)). Similarly, <em>Jaquez, </em>105 Wn. App. at 716, and the case upon which <em>Jaquez </em>relied, <em>State v. Greer, </em>62 Wn. App. 779, 790 n.4, 815 P.2d 295 (1991), contain no analysis of why denial of the right to counsel under court rules should be treated any differently than the unconstitutional denial of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\u00b638 Moreover, in this context the failure to provide an attorney as required by the court rules can never be harmless under the harmless error test. The standard is whether \u201c \u2018within reasonable probabilities, ... [if] the error [had] not occurred, the outcome of the trial would have been materially affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Templeton, </em>148 Wn.2d at 220 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Neal, </em>144 Wn.2d at 611).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u00b639 Where the analysis of error which allegedly occurred at trial or plea is required, a trained legal mind is necessary. A layman cannot effectively determine whether certain errors occurred or effectively present legal analysis of such errors to the court for correction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We can never know what additional valid claims or persuasive argument an attorney could have made. Thus, I would opine denial of an appointed attorney in a situation requiring a lawyer\u2019s analysis and a lawyer\u2019s ability to present legal arguments can never be harmless. There is always a \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>probability\u201d that an attorney could have identified an issue or presented an argument that would have swayed the trial court, which motion would have been within the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant under CrR 7.8.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\u00b640 Indeed, the requirement for an attorney\u2019s specialized knowledge and training is so vital that where appointment of counsel is required by the constitution, \u201can outright denial of counsel is conclusively presumed to be prejudicial.\u201d <em>City of Seattle v.

Winston, </em>105 Wn. App. 318, 19 P.3d 495 (2001), whether CrR 3.1(b)(2) provides a right to counsel in preparing such a motion is a matter of first impression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b740-11\"> <em>City of Richland v.

The provision of an attorney is important precisely to make trial and appellate procedures function correctly, and to safeguard fundamental substantive rights, such as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\"> Preemption arises when the legislature has expressed its intent to preempt the field or that intent is manifest from necessary implication. <em>HJS Dev., Inc. v.

Nothing in the statute expresses intent to preempt court rules, and no necessary implication to exclude other coequal branches of government from acting in matters of joint authority could be derived from one branch acting in a manner that does not conflict with, but rather complements, the other branch\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> As the United States Supreme Court said in the seminal <em>Gideon </em>case:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law.
