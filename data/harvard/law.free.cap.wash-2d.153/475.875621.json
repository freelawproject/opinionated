ESB 6453 also allowed for implementation of a \u201cMontana style\u201d primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>system as an alternative, should the Louisiana system be overturned by the courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Governor Locke then vetoed the sections of the bill enacting the Louisiana system, leaving the Montana system in place. Petitioners, including the Washington State Grange, two voters, and four legislators, filed an original action in this court challenging the validity of both the portion of the legislation allowing for the Montana system and the governor\u2019s veto. This court granted review to determine whether ESB 6453 or the final legislation, either because of the governor\u2019s veto or due to flaws in the legislative enactment process, violated article III, section 12 (governor\u2019s veto powers), article II, section 19 (single subject and subject in title rules), or article II, section 38 (limitation on amendments) of the Washington Constitution. On June 10, 2004, this court heard oral argument in this case. We then issued an order denying the writ requested by the petitioners. This opinion explains that decision.</p>\n<author id=\"AEy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Bridge, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u00b62 We hold that the governor acted within the power granted to him under the article III, section 12 veto power when he vetoed several numbered sections of ESB 6453. We also conclude that for the purposes of an article II, section 19 analysis, we must consider what a legislator or citizen would understand the title of a bill to mean, upon reading that title for the first time, and that to do so, we must look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>to the common and ordinary meaning of the terms used in the title, rather than the meaning assigned to those terms in the text of the bill. The common and ordinary meaning of the title of ESB 6453, \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary,\u201d encompasses both a Louisiana style top two primary system and a Montana style primary system because either system qualifies candidates to appear on the general election ballot. E.S.B. 6453, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2004). As a result, we hold that ESB 6453\u2019s bill title was adequate at all stages of the legislative process and no violation of article II, section 19 occurred. Finally, we hold that amendments that were adopted during the legislative process did not violate article II, section 38 of the Washington Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b63 Since 1935, Washington has conducted \u201cblanket\u201d primaries, under which primary voters have been permitted to vote for the candidate of their choice for each office, regardless of the candidate\u2019s political affiliation and without the voter being required to declare affiliation with any political party. <em>Democratic Party of Wash. State v. Reed, </em>343 F.3d 1198, 1201 (9th Cir. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1213 <em>and </em>541 U.S. 957 (2004). The top vote getting candidate from each party has then advanced to the general election. In 2000, the United States Supreme Court declared a similar California system to be unconstitutional because it violated the political parties\u2019 First Amendment right of association. <em>Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, </em>530 U.S. 567, 575, 577, 586, 120 S. Ct. 2402, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2000). Subsequently, the democratic, republican, and libertarian parties in Washington challenged Washington\u2019s blanket primary system, claiming that it too violated their freedom of association. <em>Democratic Party of Wash. State, </em>343 F.3d at 1201. In 2003, the Ninth Circuit held that Washington\u2019s blanket primary system was indeed unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>tutional and the United States Supreme Court refused to review that decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1204, 1207. The federal courts have enjoined Washington from using the blanket primary-in future elections. U.S. Dist. Ct. Order of Clarification at 1, <em>Wash. State Democratic Party v. Reed, </em>No. C00-5419FDB (May 10, 2004). Therefore, the 2004 legislature was faced with the task of developing a new primary system for Washington State.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b64 In response to this dilemma, Bill 6453 was introduced in the Washington Senate. Statement of Agreed Facts (SAF) at 3. The original title of the bill was \u201cAN ACT Relating to the modified blanket primary.\u201d S.B. 6453, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2004). The original bill provided only for a \u201cLouisiana style\u201d or \u201ctop two\u201d primary system. The full Senate considered Senate Bill 6453 on March 2, 2004, and amended the bill by adopting Senate Amendment 757. SAF at 3. The Senate Amendment changed the title of the act to \u201cAn Act Relating to a qualifying primary.\u201d <em>See </em>E.S.B. 6453; S. amend. 757, \u00a7 1. Under the resulting Engrossed Senate Bill, primary elections would not function as a procedure to determine the nominees of political parties, but would instead qualify candidates for the general election ballot. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 1(2). Candidates would be allowed to identify a political party preference, but only in order to provide voters with a brief description of the candidate\u2019s political philosophy. <em>Id. </em>Each voter, regardless of party affiliation, would be able to vote for any candidate listed on the ballot and the two candidates who received the most votes (the top two vote getters) would advance to the general election so long as they received at least one percent of the total votes cast for that office. <em>Id. </em>The Senate concluded that \u201c[n]o registered voter of the state of Washington should be required to divulge to any public or private entity his or her party affiliation, if any, as a prerequisite to voting.\u201d E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 1(3)(c). In sum, under ESB 6453,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u201cPrimary\u201d means a statutory qualifying procedure in which each registered voter eligible to vote in the district or jurisdiction is permitted to cast a vote for his or her preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>candidate for each office appearing on the ballot, without any limitation based on party preference or affiliation on the part of the voter or the candidate, with the result that not more than two candidates for each office qualify to appear on the general election ballot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 5. Finally, the Senate included an emergency clause, indicating that the legislation would take effect immediately. S. amend. 757, \u00a7 60; E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 205. The Senate passed ESB 6453 by a vote of 28 to 20 and the bill was sent to the House. SAF at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b65 On March 8, 2004, the House of Representatives considered ESB 6453 and amended it. <em>See </em>H. amend. 1184. The House amendment added a second part to the legislation (sections 101-193) establishing the \u201cMontana style\u201d primary as an alternative to the Louisiana top two primary, should the Louisiana primary be struck down by any court of competent jurisdiction. H. amend. 1184, \u00a7 101; E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">f 6 The amendment declared that the Montana primary was intended to protect the general election ballot for minor party and independent candidates and to maintain the candidate\u2019s right to self-identify with any major political party, while preserving voter privacy and rejecting mandatory voter registration by political party. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 140. Under the Montana system, major political party<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> candidates for most partisan elected offices<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would be nominated by way of a primary election using one of two possible ballot formats. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 139. The consolidated ballot format <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>requires a voter to check a box to indicate the major political party for which he or she chooses to vote. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 126. Checking the box of a particular party would allow a voter to vote for primary candidates of that party, but not of the other major party or parties. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 142(1). A primary vote would not be tabulated if the voter either checked more than one party box or failed to check a party box at all. <em>Id. </em>Under the alternative, physically separate ballot format, a voter would receive several ballots, one for each major political party and one nonpartisan ballot. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 142(2). The voter would choose which party\u2019s ballot to vote but could not vote on more than one party ballot. <em>Id. </em>A voter who did not choose to vote any major party ballot would be left to vote only the nonpartisan offices on the nonpartisan ballot in the primary election. <em>See id. </em>Under either ballot format, no minor party or independent candidate would appear on the <em>primary </em>ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b67 Under ESB 6453\u2019s Montana option, no record would be created identifying which party a voter chose to vote, and under no circumstances would an individual be required to affiliate with or declare a preference for a political party upon registering to vote. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7\u00a7 107-108. Though minor party and independent candidates would be excluded from the primary ballots, they would be eligible to participate in the general election if nominated by convention. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 110(1). To be valid, a convention must be attended by at least 100 Washington registered voters, and candidates for United States president, vice president, senator, representative, or any statewide office must be nominated by signatures from at least 1,000 registered Washington voters. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 111. For other offices, 100 signatures of voters in the jurisdiction of the office must be obtained. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b68 In sum, after the House amendments were added, ESB 6453 contained two parts. Part 1 (sections 1-57) provided for the Louisiana top two primary. Part 2 (sections 102-193) provided for the alternative Montana primary, should a court strike down the top two primary system. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>House amendments also amended the emergency clause so that it would apply to the entire legislation <em>except </em>sections 102 through 193, the part referring to the Montana system. E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 205. The House passed ESB 6453 as amended by a margin of 51 to 46. SAF at 3. On March 10, 2004, the Senate voted to concur with the House amendment adding the Montana primary alternative by a margin of 36 to 12. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">f 9 On April 1, 2004, the governor vetoed Part 1 of the bill, the part enacting the Louisiana top two style system. Veto Message (VM) on S.B. 6453, at 1; E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7\u00a7 1-57. He also vetoed sections 101 and 201, which established the Montana primary as an alternative only if the Louisiana top two system should be struck down by a court. VM at 1; E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7\u00a7 101, 201. The result was that the remaining, postveto legislation enacted only the Montana style primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b610 In his veto message, referring to the Montana primary as the \u201c \u2018open primary/private choice\u2019 system\u201d and the Louisiana top two primary as the \u201c \u2018modified blanket primary,\u2019 \u201d Governor Locke explained that the legislature knowingly forwarded him two options, and he chose the Montana system over the Louisiana top two system. VM at 1-2. Governor Locke gave several reasons for his decision. Because the level of participation is almost twice as high in general elections as it is in primary elections, the governor sought to provide broader voter choice in the general election by choosing the system that allowed for more candidates in the general election. VM at 2. In addition, he worried that the top two primary system would result in instances where two candidates of the same party would advance to the general election, disenfranchising voters of other parties. <em>Id. </em>He also expressed concern that the top two primary system would effectively deny minority and independent candidates access to the general election ballot because those candidates would almost never be one of the top two vote getters in a primary election. <em>Id. </em>The governor predicted that the top two system would \u201calmost certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>result in major parties nominating their candidates through caucuses and embroiling the state in lengthy litigation over the use of party labels by candidates who have not been nominated according to party rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, he speculated that the political parties would promptly block the top two primary in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Therefore, he vetoed the sections establishing the top two primary, leaving the Montana primary system in its place. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b611 In his veto message, the governor also discussed section 205 of ESB 6453, which provides that \u201c[e]xcept for sections 102 through 193 of this act [providing for the Montana style alternative], this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.\u201d E.S.B. 6453, \u00a7 205. The governor, however, opined that <em>any </em>newly established primary system should be subject to an emergency clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">The emergency declaration in section 205 applies in these circumstances to the entire bill as I have signed it into law. Any other reading would thwart the manifest purpose of the Legislature and lead to an absurd result. Obviously, the reference to sections 102 through 193 was intended only to apply if the bill signed into law had multiple inconsistent primary systems. With my veto action, however, this is not the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">VM at 4. Even so, the governor chose not to veto section 205 because he wanted to avoid ambiguity as to whether an emergency need for a primary system existed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b612 Although the legislature could have reconvened upon a two-thirds vote of both houses in order to reconsider vetoed sections of the bill, it did not do so. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 12. Because the legislature did not override the governor\u2019s veto, ESB 6453, as altered by the governor\u2019s vetoes, became Laws of 2004, chapter 271 (chapter 271).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u00b613 The Washington State Grange, two individual voters, and four state legislators filed an original action in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>court under article IV, section 4 of the Washington Constitution. They asked that this court issue a writ of mandamus directing the secretary of state and the governor to conduct the 2004 primary election in accordance with ESB 6453 as passed by the legislature. In the alternative, they sought a writ compelling the secretary of state and the governor to conduct the 2004 election in accordance with preexisting primary laws, striking only the provision of preexisting law requiring a blanket primary. Specifically, the petitioners argued that chapter 271 or its enactment process violated three provisions of the Washington Constitution: article III, section 12 (governor\u2019s veto powers), article II, section 19 (single subject and subject in title), and article II, section 38 (limitation on amendments).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 10, 2004, we heard oral argument on these issues, and on the same day this court issued an order denying the writ. This opinion explains that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u00b614 This court reviews the constitutionality of legislation de novo. <em>See Pierce County v. State, </em>150 Wn.2d 422, 430, 78 P.3d 640 (2003). The party asserting that an act violates the state constitution \u201c \u2018bears the heavy burden of establishing its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 any reasonable doubts are resolved in favor of constitutionality. <em>Id. </em>at 430 (quoting <em>Amalgamated Transit Union Local 587 v. State, </em>142 Wn.2d 183, 205, 11 P.3d 762, 27 P.3d 608 (2000)); <em>Citizens for Responsible Wildlife Mgmt. v. State, </em>149 Wn.2d 622, 631, 71 P.3d 644 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">A. Article III, Section 12\u2014Governor\u2019s Veto Power</p>\n<p id=\"AHyr\"> \u00b615 This court has held that in approving or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>disapproving legislation, the governor acts in a legislative capacity. <em>Hallin v. Trent, </em>94 Wn.2d 671, 677, 619 P.2d 357 (1980); <em>Wash. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Ass\u2019ns v. Evans, </em>88 Wn.2d 563, 565, 564 P.2d 788 (1977). Before the adoption of the 62nd Amendment to the Washington Constitution in 1974, article III, section 12 provided that if presented with a bill containing more than one section or item, the governor could veto \u201cone or more <em>sections or items </em>while approving other portions of the bill.\u201d Former Const, art. III, \u00a7 12 (1889) (emphasis added). Historically, governors generally vetoed entire bills, entire numbered sections, or entire appropriation items. <em>Motorcycle Dealers Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>111 Wn.2d 667, 671, 763 P.2d 442 (1988). However, in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, governors increasingly vetoed items that were less than entire sections of nonappropriation bills. <em>Id. </em>at 671-72. In response, the voters approved what became Amendment 62 to the Washington Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 672-73. The amendment provided that when presented with a bill containing more than one section or appropriation item, the governor may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">object to one or more sections or appropriation items while approving other portions of the bill: <em>Provided, </em>That <em>he may not object to less than an entire section, </em>except that if the section contain one or more appropriation items he may object to any such appropriation item or items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Const, art. III, \u00a7 12 (amend. 62) (second emphasis added). The amendment permitted the governor to veto sections of a bill but limited the use of the item veto to appropriation bills and expressly prohibited the partial veto of anything less than \u201c \u2018an <em>entire </em>section\u2019 \u201d of a nonappropriation bill. <em>Motorcycle Dealers, </em>111 Wn.2d at 673. The amendment also provided the legislature with new authority to reconvene itself by a two-thirds vote in each house within 45 days of the end of the session, in order to override gubernatorial vetoes. Const, art. III, \u00a7 12 (amend. 62); <em>Motorcycle Dealers </em>at 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b616 Prior to the 62nd Amendment, this court applied two tests to evaluate the validity of vetoes, the affirmative-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>negative test and the separate subject test. Under the affirmative-negative test, if the veto amounted to destructive or negative action preventing some provision from becoming law, then the veto was permissible, but if the veto improperly added \u201ca new or different result from that which the Legislature intended,\u201d the veto was improper. <em>Motorcycle Dealers, </em>111 Wn.2d at 676. Under the separate subject test, this court would uphold a veto of a portion of a nonappropriation bill, regardless of the numbered sections created by the legislature, if \u201cthe portion vetoed contained separate, distinct and independent subject matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677. Yet after the 62nd Amendment, this court abandoned both tests because they proved to be \u201csubjective, unworkable and ... no one could safely predict whether any given partial veto would be upheld or struck down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676-77. Instead, the <em>Motorcycle Dealers </em>court concluded, based on the plain language of the 62nd Amendment, that \u201cgubernatorial vetoes of less than entire sections of nonappropriation bills are void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b617 Then in 1997, in <em>Washington State Legislature v. Lowry, </em>131 Wn.2d 309, 931 P.2d 885 (1997), this court retreated from the bright line rule set forth in <em>Motorcycle Dealers </em>and allowed the veto of subsections of a nonappropriation bill. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 321. The <em>Lowry </em>court recognized the historic creativity of both the legislature and the governor in dealing with the veto power, <em>id. </em>at 317, and distinguished <em>Motorcycle Dealers </em>on the grounds that, unlike the <em>Lowry </em>court, the <em>Motorcycle Dealers </em>court had not been \u201cconfronted with a case of legislative manipulation\u201d intended to frustrate the exercise of the gubernatorial veto. <em>Id. </em>at 319. The <em>Lowry </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">We decline to abandon our constitutional responsibility to referee disputes between the branches. If the Court withdraws from the fray, the delicate constitutional balance the Framers erected and the people amended between the executive and legislative branches with respect to the veto power is upset. If this Court declines to exercise its constitutional responsibility to define a \u201csection\u201d to which the Governor\u2019s veto applies, it entrusts the sectional veto to the sole discretion of the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>lature, a result the Framers clearly did not intend. Our constitution condones neither artful legislative drafting nor crafty gubernatorial vetoes. We <em>must </em>carry out our mandate as the Supreme Court of Washington to decide whether legislative designation of sections is true to the spirit of the constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 320. Thus, when discussing the proper definition of \u201csection,\u201d this court has indicated that it will intervene to prevent obvious circumvention of the veto power by the legislature or equally obvious manipulation of that power by the governor. <em>Id. </em>at 320-21 (noting that the court was correct to hold in <em>Washington Ass\u2019n of Apartment Ass\u2019ns, </em>88 Wn.2d 563, that the governor manipulated the pre-Amendment 62 item veto power when he used that power to completely rewrite portions of the legislation). Yet, the <em>Lowry </em>court was clear that we should interfere \u201c[o]nly rarely, and reluctantly\u201d \u201cto ensure that neither the Legislature nor the Governor will so conduct its affairs . . . [such] that the coordinate branch of government is substantially deprived of the fair opportunity to exercise its constitutional prerogatives as to legislation.\u201d 131 Wn.2d at 320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b618 The Grange argues that the governor\u2019s veto in this case is unconstitutional under article III, section 12. First, the Grange seems to argue that the governor improperly vetoed something less than an \u201centire section.\u201d <em>See </em>Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Reply Br. at 6; Const, art. III, \u00a7 12. While the governor vetoed less than an entire part of ESB 6453 when he vetoed sections 101 and 201, his veto erased only whole sections of the bill. The Grange points to no instance in which this court has overturned a veto of a numbered section because the other numbered sections in that part of the bill were left untouched. <em>See, e.g., Lowry, </em>131 Wn.2d at 321 (upholding vetoes of subsections of a numbered section); <em>Wash. Fed\u2019n of State Employees, Council 28 v. State, </em>101 Wn.2d 536, 538, 544, 682 P.2d 869 (1984), (upholding veto of a single numbered section). The plain language of article III, section 12 clearly allows the governor to veto entire <em>sections </em>of nonappropriation bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00b619 In addition, the Grange contends that the governor improperly attempted to rewrite section 205 of ESB 6453 (the emergency clause), an action that falls outside the governor\u2019s veto power and amounts to the type of manipulation that the <em>Lowry </em>court declared would require intervention from this court. Furthermore, the Grange seems to assert that this attempt to rewrite section 205 renders the governor\u2019s entire veto message, including all vetoes of any section of ESB 6453, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b620 While the governor stated that the \u201cemergency declaration in section 205 applies in these circumstances to the entire bill as I have signed it into law,\u201d we understand the governor\u2019s message to be an explanation of what he interpreted section 205 to mean. VM at 4. He agreed that a new primary system is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, and the support of the state government and its existing public institutions. <em>Id. </em>He also noted the risk that delay could lead to the complete absence of a partisan primary election in 2004. <em>Id. </em>The governor expressly declined to veto section 205 because to do so might risk ambiguity as to whether an emergency need for the primary exists at all. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The Grange has not shown that the governor intended to do anything more than to express his opinion, admittedly rather forcefully, as to the interpretation of section 205. The expression of such an opinion is within the governor\u2019s prerogative; in fact, Washington courts have looked to the governor\u2019s interpretation of legislation as an element of legislative history when interpreting statutes. <em>See, e.g., Rozner v. City of Bellevue, </em>116 Wn.2d 342, 349, 804 P.2d 24 (1991); <em>State v. Sell, </em>110 Wn. App. 741, 745-46, 43 P.3d 1246 (2002). Therefore, we conclude that the governor did not rewrite or redraft section 205, but instead expressed his opinion as to the proper interpretation of that section, something that he clearly has the power to do in the context of a veto message. <em>See </em>Const, art. III, \u00a7 12; <em>Cascade Tel. Co. v.

Huntley, </em>39 Wn.2d 191, 198-99, 235 P.2d 173 (1951)). Another closely related purpose is to prevent the attachment of an unpopular bill to a popular one on an unrelated subject in order to guarantee the passage of the unpopular provision. <em>Pierce County, </em>150 Wn.2d at 429-30. Finally, the purpose behind the subject in title rule is to guarantee that the members of the legislature and the public are given notice of the subject matter of a bill. <em>Id. </em>at 430; <em>Amalgamated Transit, </em>142 Wn.2d at 207. The Grange argues that after the governor\u2019s veto, the subject of chapter 271, namely implementation of the Montana primary system, is not reflected in the title, \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary.\u201d E.S.B. 6453.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b622 A title complies with the subject in title rule if it provides \u201cnotice that would lead to an inquiry into the body of the act, or indicate to an inquiring mind the scope and purpose of the law.\u201d <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>State, </em>62 Wn.2d 504, 506, 383 P.2d 497 (1963). As explained in more detail below, this court has evaluated the sufficiency of the titles of both initiatives and bills by considering the meaning that the title would convey to the typical reader. Then the court determines whether the contents of the text of the legislation are reflected in the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b6 23 <em>Construction of a Bill Title for the Purposes of Article II, Section 19: </em>The full title of chapter 271 is \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary; [amending, adding new sections to, or repealing more than 100 sections of Title 29A RCW]; prescribing penalties; providing a contingent effective date; and declaring an emergency.\u201d Laws of 2004, ch. 271. Here, the Grange and the secretary of state argue that the meaning of the term \u201cqualifying primary\u201d as used in the title is governed by the technical definition of the term as articulated in the text of ESB 6453. In contrast, the governor contends that the meaning of the title is determined by evaluating the common and ordinary meaning of the words in the title, without reference to the text of the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b624 In both <em>Petroleum Lease Properties Co. v.

State, </em>7 Wn.2d 613, 623-24, 110 P.2d 627 (1941), this court construed the title of an act according to the common and ordinary meaning of the terms therein and then compared the subject expressed in the title with the contents of the act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <em>Petroleum Lease </em>court considered the meaning of the term \u201csecurity,\u201d while the <em>DeCano </em>court considered the meaning of the word \u201calien.\u201d <em>Petroleum Lease, </em>195 Wash, at 257-58; <em>De Cano, </em>7 Wn.2d at 623-24. The <em>Petroleum Lease </em>and <em>DeCano </em>courts both recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201c[w]ords in a title must be taken in their <em>common and ordinary meanings, </em>and the legislature cannot in the body of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>act impose another or unusual meaning upon a term used in the title without disclosing such special meaning therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Petroleum Lease, </em>195 Wash, at 261 (emphasis added) (quoting 59 C.J. <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 390 at 810 (1932)); <em>DeCano, </em>7 Wn.2d at 626. The <em>Petroleum Lease </em>court looked to the \u201cmeaning of the word \u2018security\u2019 as that term is commonly understood and defined by standard dictionaries\u201d and the prior statute\u2019s definition of the term. <em>Petroleum Lease, </em>195 Wash, at 258. The <em>DeCano </em>court found that the title in that case gave no intimation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">the body of the act contains an amended definition of the word \u201calien\u201d which brings within its purview a whole new class of persons who are not in fact aliens in common understanding, by judicial construction, or under the express definition contained in the prior law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>DeCano, </em>7 Wn.2d at 624.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u00b625 This court has applied a similar analysis in recent cases. In <em>Washington Federation of State Employees v. State, </em>127 Wn.2d 544, 556, 901 P.2d 1028 (1995), we again articulated the test for determining whether the subject of an act is reflected in its title. First, \u201c[u]nder Const, art. II, \u00a7 19, the title is construed with reference to the language used in <em>the title.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>Great N. Ry. Co. v. Cohn, </em>3 Wn.2d 672, 680, 101 P.2d 985 (1940) (\u201c[T]he title must be construed with reference to the language used in the title only <em>and not in the light of the context of the act.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Then, the court must \u201cexamine[] the body of the act to determine whether the title reflects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>subject matter of the act.\u201d <em>Wash.

This court first discussed the meaning of the term \u201ctax\u201d as defined in the text of 1-695 and then compared that definition to the common and ordinary meaning of \u201ctax\u201d as used in the title; we transposed the order of the discussion, but the analysis remained the same. <em>Id. </em>at 218-20, 222-23; <em>see also id. </em>at 192. The term \u201ctax\u201d was defined, for the purposes of application of 1-695, in the text of the initiative itself. <em>Id. </em>at 218-19. Once it had established the meaning of the term \u201ctax\u201d as defined in the text of 1-695, the court\u2019s ultimate inquiry was \u201cwhether, for purposes of the article II, section 19 subject-in-title rule, the term \u2018tax\u2019 has a broader meaning than its commonly understood, traditional meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. The court concluded that the 1-695 definition was broader than the common and ordinary meaning of the term. <em>Id. </em>at 226. Therefore, the title of the initiative did not adequately reflect the contents of the initiative. <em>See id. </em>at 225-26.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">[W]e affirm the trial court\u2019s holding that 1-695 violates the subject-in-title rule of article II, section 19 on the basis that the ballot title of 1-695 states \u201c[s]hall voter approval be required for any <em>tax </em>increase\u201d without any indication in the title that \u201ctax\u201d has a meaning broader than its common meaning. Nothing about this ballot title gives any notice that would indicate to the voters that the contents of the initiative would include voter approval for charges other than taxes or suggest inquiry into the act be made to learn the broad meaning of \u201ctax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 227 (footnote omitted). Thus, after comparing the common and ordinary meaning of the word \u201ctax,\u201d to the broader meaning assigned to the term in the text of the initiative, <em>id. </em>at 220, 222, 225-27, the court concluded that the ballot title was misleading because the average voter would not anticipate the broader application of the initiative to fees that ordinarily fell outside of the definition of a tax. <em>Id. </em>at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b627 In sum, when evaluating the sufficiency of a title under article II, section 19, this court has consistently construed the title according to the common and ordinary meaning of its language. The court then compares the title to the text of the enactment to determine whether a subject in title violation exists. Neither the Grange nor the secretary of state has pointed to a case in which this court has looked to the definition of a term contained in the text of the enactment to construe the title, and we decline to do so in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Grange\u2019s repeated references to the text of ESB 6453 and its legislative history are irrelevant to the construction of the <em>title </em>of the legislation. The text of the bill is relevant only insofar as we must examine the contents of the bill in order to discern whether its subject is adequately reflected in the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b628 <em>An Act Relating to a Qualifying Primary: </em>Following established precedent to this case, we must first look to the common and ordinary meaning of \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary\u201d by referring to a dictionary definition of the title\u2019s terms. E.S.B. 6453; <em>see Salts v. Estes, </em>133 Wn.2d 160, 167, 943 P.2d 275 (1997). <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>defines \u201cqualify\u201d as \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>reduce from a general undefined, or comprehensive to a particular or restricted form.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1858 (2002). <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>includes in its definition of \u201cqualify,\u201d \u201d[t]o reach the later stages of a selection process or contest by competing successfully in earlier rounds.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 1479 (3d ed. 1992). \u201cPrimary\u201d or \u201cprimary election\u201d has been defined as \u201can election in which qualified voters nominate or express a preference for a particular candidate or group of candidates for political office, choose party officials, or select delegates for a party convention,\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 1800, and \u201c[a] preliminary election in which voters nominate party candidates for office,\u201d American Heritage, <em>supra, </em>at 1438. Thus, the common and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cqualifying primary\u201d is an election in which the list of potential candidates for an office is reduced or refined and certain candidates are chosen to advance to the later general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b629 The governor notes that during the House and Senate floor debates, the legislators did not refer to the Louisiana top two primary system as the \u201cqualifying primary.\u201d Instead, they referred generally to the Louisiana, Cajun, or top two system. <em>See </em>Tr. (Mar. 8, 2004) at 2, 4, 6; Tr. (Mar. 10, 2004) at 1, 2, 3. In fact, Senator Kastama noted that both systems \u201cqualify candidates for the general election.\u201d Tr. (Mar. 10, 2004) at 2. While we cannot glean the thinking of the entire legislature from the comments of a few members, it is interesting to note that the term \u201cqualifying primary\u201d was not commonly used among the legislators during debate to refer to the top two system. <em>See Lowry, </em>131 Wn.2d at 326-27 (listing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">f 30 In sum, Washington case law directs that we must construe the words in the title of ESB 6453 and chapter 271 according to their common and ordinary meaning, rather than according to the definition assigned to them in the text of the bill. Under the common and ordinary meaning of the words, \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary\u201d refers to an election in which the list of potential candidates for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>office is reduced or refined and certain candidates are chosen to advance to the general election. Therefore, the generic subject reflected in this title is the adoption of a primary system that qualifies candidates for the general election ballot.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The title is a general one and \u201c \u2018any subject reasonably germane to such title may be embraced within the body of the bill.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens, </em>149 Wn.2d at 633 (quoting <em>DeCano, </em>7 Wn.2d at 627).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"> \u00b631 <em>Adequacy of the Title of ESB 6453: </em>The second clause of article II, section 19 requires that the subject of a bill must be expressed in its title.

After the governor\u2019s veto, the resulting legislation, chapter 271, created only a Montana style primary system. The Grange seems to argue both that ESB 6453 as passed by the legislature and chapter 271 as signed by the governor violated article II, section 19 because the Montana style primary was not a qualifying primary and thus it was never encompassed within the bill title.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b6 33 However, we conclude that because a Montana system is an option that would qualify candidates for the general election ballot, the Montana style primary system is reasonably germane to the bill title as construed in the prior section of this opinion. The title does not provide details of the chosen system, but it need not do so. <em>See Amalgamated Transit, </em>142 Wn.2d at 217. The title would lead a reader to inquire into the body of the act to learn the details of the proposed system. <em>See Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n, </em>62 Wn.2d at 506. A voter or a legislator reading the title of chapter 271 for the first time, without any knowledge of the contents of the act, would be reasonably informed as to the subject matter of the act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b634 While the parties disagree as to which version of the legislation we should apply the subject in title analysis\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the bill as passed by the legislature or the bill as signed by the governor\u2014the result is the same in either case. Because the title reflects the generic subject of the adoption of a primary system that qualifies candidates for the general election ballot, it would easily encompass both primary system alternatives. Thus, we need not decide today at what stages of the legislative process article II, section 19 applies. We conclude that neither ESB 6453 as passed by the legislature nor chapter 271 as signed by the governor violates the subject in title provision of article II, section 19.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">C. Article II, Section 38\u2014Limitation on Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b635 Article II, section 38 of the Washington Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o amendment to any bill shall be allowed which shall change the scope and object of the bill.\u201d Although the Grange claims that ESB 6453 violated article II, section 38, there is very little discussion of the provision in the Grange\u2019s briefs and, instead, the Grange focuses on article II, section 19. Because the Grange has provided no substantive discussion to support its claim regarding article II, section 38, we conclude that the Grange has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that this provision was violated. <em>See Pierce County, </em>150 Wn.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\"> \u00b636 Furthermore, article II, section 38 governs legislative actions and the Grange has pointed to no case in which the provision has been applied to a governor\u2019s veto. In fact, this court has insisted upon application of the \u201cenrolled bill rule\u201d in any article II, section 38 analysis.

The governor did not act outside his veto power when he vetoed entire sections of ESB 6453 and thus there was no violation of article III, section 12. The court must construe the title of an enactment according to the common and ordinary meaning of the terms therein, and given the common and ordinary meaning of the language in the title \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary,\u201d the title is general, and the Montana style nominating primary system fits within the subject matter expressed in the title.

For example, a voter may vote for a republican candidate for attorney general but a democratic candidate for governor. Only the top two vote getting candidates, regardless of party, advance to the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">A Montana style primary requires each primary voter to choose among major party ballots; the voter\u2019s choice is limited to primary candidates appearing on the major party ballot that the voter has chosen. One candidate from each major party advances to the general election ballot.

The Grange has not pointed to a single instance in which this court has invalidated all of a governor\u2019s vetoes in their entirety based only upon the impropriety of the governor\u2019s action with regard to a single section.

However, <em>Shelton Hotel </em>clearly addresses the interpretation of the text of a statute itself, <em>not </em>the construction of words used in the title of a piece of legislation. <em>Id. </em>at 501. Several cases involving the construction of titles are more helpful here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\"> These cases may suggest that if the act in question is amendatory in nature, then the court may consider prior legislative definitions of a term or prior judicial construction of a term, in addition to the common and ordinary meaning of a term. <em>See Petroleum Lease, </em>195 Wash, at 258 (referring to term as defined in original act); <em>DeCano, </em>7 Wn.2d at 624 (referring to common understanding, judicial construction, or express definition in prior law). However, there is no prior statutory definition of \u201cqualifying primary.\u201d In addition, while both the secretary of state and the dissent hint that the legislature drew the term \u201cqualifying primary\u201d from the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>California Democratic Party, </em>530 U.S. at 585-86, the term actually adopted by the United States Supreme Court in that case was \u201cnonpartisan blanket primary.\u201d The Grange, the secretary of state, and the dissent are unable to point to a judicially created definition of \u201cqualifying primary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> The dissent admits that we \u201cmust first construe [a bill] title according to its language.\u201d Dissent at 503. But instead of looking to the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms in the title as required by precedent from this court, the dissent, like the Grange and the secretary of state, attempts to define \u201cqualifying\u201d by looking to the text of the bill. Notably the dissent fails to cite to any instance in which this court has looked to the definition of a term contained in the text of an enactment to construe its title. <em>See </em>dissent at 503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\"> The Grange also seems to argue that because the House amendment adding the Montana alternative was voted on in the Senate on a particularly busy day, senators would have actually been misled by the title referring to a qualifying primary. However, this court has held that the enrolled bill doctrine forbids us from inquiring into whether the legislature would have actually been misled by an amendment that changes the text but not the title of a bill. <em>See Brower v.

Here, the common and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cqualifying primary\u201d <em>is </em>broad enough to encompass the Montana style system because a Montana system is an option that would qualify candidates for the general election ballot.

In its brief, the Grange refers to analyses traditionally connected with the single subject rule, including discussion of general versus restrictive title and the concept of rational unity. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Opening Br. at 46. Yet while the Grange explicitly refers to the subject in title rule several times, it does not state that ESB 6453 contained two unrelated subjects.

Fed\u2019n of State Employees v. State, </em>127 Wn.2d 544, 556, 901 P.2d 1028 (1995). The majority emphasizes the importance of using the ordinary meaning of words when construing the title. It utilizes the dictionary definition of \u201cqualify\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u201cprimary or primary election,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and then combines the two definitions to arrive at the \u201ccommon and ordinary meaning\u201d of \u201cqualifying primary.\u201d Majority at 495-97. The majority\u2019s resulting amalgamated definition is: \u201can election in which the list of potential candidates for an office is reduced or refined and certain candidates are chosen to advance to the later general election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496. In substance this definition is really no different from the majority\u2019s definition of \u201cprimary election,\u201d rendering the modifier \u201cqualifying\u201d entirely superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b644 A better approach is to define the words in context, thereby providing effect and meaning to each word used in the title. <em>See Amalgamated Transit, </em>142 Wn.2d at 220 (\u201cAll language in a piece of legislation should be given effect, so that no provision is rendered superfluous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u00b645 If a primary is an election in which voters choose which candidates advance to the general election, then a \u201cqualifying primary\u201d must be a certain kind of primary. The phrase describes a particular system in which a group of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>candidates is narrowed to two finalists without regard to party. However, a \u201cnominating primary\u201d is very different.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This is a system in which voters choose or nominate the parties\u2019 candidates for the general election. These definitions distinguish between the two kinds of primaries giving meaning to each word. The majority\u2019s approach avoids a distinction which the legislature chose to make through the use of specific words. The bill makes the critical legislative distinction between a \u201cqualifying\u201d primary (as originally intended) and a \u201cnominating\u201d primary which is all that is left after the veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b646 ESB 6453 as passed by the legislature created a \u201cqualifying\u201d or \u201ctop two\u201d primary, in which the top two candidates in any race advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation. This system is distinct from a \u201cnominating\u201d system in which voters choose the parties\u2019 nominees for the general election.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b647 The legislature defined the difference between a \u201cqualifying\u201d or top two primary and a \u201cnominating\u201d primary. The senate entitled the top two primary bill as \u201cAN ACT Relating to a qualifying primary.\u201d Statement of Agreed Facts (SAF) Ex. 4, at 1. The house then amended the bill to include two sections. The original senate top two primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>section was entitled a \u201cqualifying\u201d primary, whereas the alternate party nomination section was denominated a \u201cnominating\u201d primary. Each system fell under a subtitle with the appropriate name, whereas the entire bill was titled, \u201cAN ACT Relating to a <em>qualifying </em>primary.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b648 The house amendment made the nominating primary an alternative to the qualifying primary only if it was judicially invalidated. The pertinent section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that a candidate may not identify a major or minor political party as best approximating his or her political philosophy . . . the secretary of state shall notify the governor [and others] that the state can no longer conduct a <em>qualifying </em>primary and instead will conduct a <em>nominating </em>primary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">SAF Ex. 5, at 2 (emphasis added). These words are purposeful legislative terms describing two distinct primary systems; however, the majority transposes the legislative terms, standing legislative intent on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b649 ESB 6453 as passed by the legislature created a qualifying primary with a contingent nominating primary alternative in case the qualifying primary was found invalid. The act\u2019s title matched its contents perfectly. However, when Governor Locke vetoed the qualifying primary system, the remainder created a nominating system notwithstanding a title which identified the previously rejected alternative. Assuming the validity of the governor\u2019s veto the bill was thereby forced into violation of article II, section 19 since its title did not describe but was contrary to its substance. No amount of wordplay can escape this self-evident conclusion. A qualifying primary is fundamentally distinct from a nominating primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">f 50 The distinction between the two primary systems is of Grand Canyon-esque proportions compared to the majority\u2019s razor thin line in <em>Amalgamated Transit. </em>There the majority argued at length that \u201ctax\u201d as used in I-695\u2019s title did not fairly describe \u201cany monetary charge by govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ment,\u201d and therefore the title violated the subject-in-title rule. 142 Wn.2d at 226.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> I posit that if an initiative is unconstitutional under the subject in title rule because voters might be misled by a broad definition of \u201ctax,\u201d then surely enacting the opposite system from the one described in ESB 6453\u2019s title obviously violates the same rule. The majority would do well to remember its own exhortation: \u201cA court should \u2018not strain to interpret [a] statute as constitutional: a plain reading must make the interpretation reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Amalgamated Transit, </em>142 Wn.2d at 225 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Soundgarden v.

Here a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d requires us, as did the legislature, to differentiate between a \u201cqualifying\u201d primary and a \u201cnominating\u201d primary, recognizing the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b651 The governor\u2019s veto reversed the subject of the bill without changing its title.
