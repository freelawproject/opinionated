The court subsequently admitted a 1993 lost will, purporting to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Margaret\u2019s last will and testament, on summary judgment and awarded attorney fees to Richard Burns, the personal representative under the 1992 will. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment and the attorney fee award and remanded the case with instructions that all issues pertaining to the will should be decided in one proceeding. We affirm the Court of Appeals but base our decision on the grounds that there are genuine issues of material fact as to the execution of the lost will that must be decided at a trial. We also clarify the Court of Appeals\u2019 statements regarding the standard of proof necessary to admit lost wills and clarify the role of res judicata in probate proceedings.</p>\n<author id=\"AyV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Owens, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b62 On October 11, 2000, Margaret Black, a resident of Columbia County, Washington, died, leaving property subject to probate. A will executed on December 10, 1992, was admitted to probate on October 12, 2000, and Richard Burns was appointed as the personal representative. The 1992 will requested Burns be appointed as the personal representative and left all of Margaret\u2019s farm property to Douglas William (Bill) Carlton. The residuary of the estate was split into thirds among Eugene Ayers or upon his death to his daughter, Bill Carlton, and the First Christian Church of Dayton. The will explicitly excluded Myrna Black, Margaret\u2019s daughter. The 1992 will was signed by Margaret, signed by two witnesses, and included an attached affidavit of the subscribing witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">f3 Subsequently, Myrna Black petitioned the court to admit a 1993 lost will to probate. Myrna also contested the 1992 will under RCW 11.24.010 to prevent the four-month statute of limitations from running in case her petition to probate was unsuccessful. The 1993 will appointed Myrna as the personal representative and transferred all of Margaret\u2019s property to Myrna, which was in direct contradiction with the 1992 will. An unsigned draft of the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>included a place for Margaret to sign, an attestation clause with a place for two witnesses to sign, and a certificate of the subscribing witnesses describing the legal requirements of the will\u2019s execution. On August 7, 2001, Myrna filed a motion for summary judgment to admit the 1993 lost will.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b64 Affidavits by Robert Reiter, Janet Taylor, Paul Blauert, and Myrna Black were submitted in support of the lost will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Robert Reiter\u2019s affidavit states the following. Reiter, a California attorney and Myrna\u2019s friend, accompanied Myrna to visit her mother in August 1993. Myrna and Reiter obtained the unexecuted 1993 will from Paul Blauert in Seattle, Washington, and then continued to Walla Walla, Washington, where Margaret resided. Reiter discussed the 1993 will with Margaret, Margaret read the will, and Reiter verified that the will reflected her wishes. Myrna arranged for a notary public to attend the execution of the will in order to notarize the will and other documents. After reviewing Margaret\u2019s notarized power of attorney, allegedly signed on the same day as the will, August 14, 1993, Reiter remembered the notary was Janet Taylor. After Margaret reviewed and discussed the will, she initialed each page and signed the will in the presence of Reiter and Taylor. Reiter and Taylor then signed as witnesses. Attached to his affidavit is a copy of the will Reiter remembers Margaret executing. Reiter also submitted a declaration to the court stating that he personally read the signed will and that this was the will Myrna received in Seattle. Subsequently, Reiter and Myrna returned to Seattle, and Myrna gave Blauert the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">f 5 In his affidavit Blauert stated that he prepared the 1993 will at Myrna\u2019s request, and the provisions in the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>attached to his affidavit are the same as those in the will given to Myrna in August 1993. Myrna returned this same document to Blauert on August 15, 1993. Blauert noticed the will was executed on August 14,1993, and it was signed by two attesting witnesses. The original will and another document were placed in a file. In October 2000, Myrna contacted Blauert requesting the will. Blauert could not find the file and stated that when he retired in January 1996 he had discarded most of his paper files. A computer disk with a copy of the will and a transmittal letter was found, and from this Myrna was sent an unsigned copy of the will. Although Blauert may have sent Myrna the original will, currently the original 1993 will appears to be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b66 Janet Taylor, the notary public and the other witness to the 1993 will as identified by Reiter, does not recall witnessing the 1993 will or any of the people involved. Taylor was a notary public in 1993, and she recognized her signature on Margaret\u2019s durable power of attorney, executed August 14, 1993. She believed she personally witnessed Margaret sign this document because she did not notarize documents for people she did not know unless the person was present. However, Taylor has no recollection of witnessing the will, or speaking to Myrna, Margaret, or Reiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b67 Despite Burns\u2019 and the beneficiaries\u2019 objections to summary judgment, Judge William Acey granted Myrna\u2019s motion for summary judgment admitting the lost will to probate, awarded attorney fees to Burns, and denied Myrna\u2019s attorney fees until after adjudication of any challenges to the lost will. In his oral opinion, Judge Acey noted that the summary judgment was granted based on Reiter\u2019s and Blauert\u2019s affidavits, and he did not make a finding that Taylor had signed the will. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Sept. 26, 2001) at 15, 17. The beneficiaries and Burns appealed the summary judgment order, and Myrna cross-appealed the attorney fee award. The Court of Appeals reversed summary judgment, reversed the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>fee award to Burns, and remanded the case with instructions to resolve all issues regarding the will in one proceeding. <em>In re Estate of Black, </em>116 Wn. App. 476, 480, 488, 66 P.3d. 670 (2003). Myrna filed a petition for review with this court, and Burns and the beneficiaries filed cross-petitions for review. We granted review of all issues on December 24, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the Court of Appeals on different grounds and clarify the court\u2019s statements regarding burdens of proof and res judicata in probate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b68 1. Whether the Court of Appeals erred regarding the necessary burden of proof required to admit lost wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b69 2. Whether summary judgment admitting Margaret\u2019s lost will was properly reversed in light of genuine issues of material fact regarding execution of the lost will.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b610 3. Whether the Court of Appeals erred in its analysis of the role res judicata plays in probate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u00b611 4. Whether the Court of Appeals erred in ordering all issues involving Margaret\u2019s 1992 and 1993 wills resolved in one proceeding on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\u00b612 5. Whether any party is entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\"> \u00b613 On summary judgment, we \u201cengage [ ] in the same inquiry as the trial court.\u201d <em>Failor\u2019s Pharmacy v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>125 Wn.2d 488, 493, 886 P.2d 147 (1994). We will not resolve factual issues, but rather must determine if a genuine issue as to any material fact exists. <em>Balise v. Underwood, </em>62 Wn.2d 195, 199, 381 P.2d 966 (1963). \u201cA material fact is one upon which the outcome of the litigation depends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The moving party has the burden of proving there is no genuine issue of material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and all inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id.; see also </em>Civil Rules (CR) 56(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving party must then \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>La Plante v. State, 85 </em>Wn.2d 154, 158, 531 P.2d 299 (1975); <em>Snohomish County v. Rugg, </em>115 Wn. App. 218, 224, 61 P.3d 1184 (2002) (stating that a nonmoving party must set forth evidentiary facts, not suppositions, opinions, or conclusions); <em>see also </em>CR 56(e). Only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and reasonable people could reach \u201cbut one conclusion\u201d from all of the evidence is summary judgment appropriate. <em>Barrie v. Hosts of Am., Inc., </em>94 Wn.2d 640, 642, 618 P.2d 96 (1980); <em>Balise, </em>62 Wn.2d at 199. Further, it should be noted that proceedings where a will is being challenged are equitable in nature and are reviewed de novo upon the entire record. <em>In re Estate of Ney, </em>183 Wash. 503, 505, 48 P.2d 924 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">A. Standard of Proof for Lost Wills</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b614 The Court of Appeals incorrectly stated that a lost will may be admitted to probate only if the will is in existence at the time of the testator\u2019s death and the will\u2019s contents are proved \u201c \u2018clearly and distinctly by the testimony of at least two persons.\u201d <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 484 (quoting <em>In re Estate of Nelson, 85 </em>Wn.2d 602, 605, 537 P.2d 765 (1975)). <em>Nelson </em>interpreted an earlier version of the lost will statute, RCW 11.20.070. <em>Nelson, 85 </em>Wn.2d at 605. Since <em>Nelson, </em>the legislature has amended the statute and deleted the requirement that the will must be in existence at the time of the testator\u2019s death. <em>See </em>Laws of 1994, ch. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 75. The current statute also states that the contents \u201cmust be proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, consisting at least in part of a witness to either its contents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>or the authenticity of a copy of the will.\u201d RCW 11.20.070(2). While the legislature may amend a statute, the court must interpret the present language of the statute and may not \u201crewrite explicit and unequivocal statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Mollichi, </em>132 Wn.2d 80, 87-88, 936 P.2d 408 (1997). The Court of Appeals erred in reciting the statutory requirements to admit a lost will to probate and the burden of proof necessary to prove the contents of a lost will.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b615 Further, the Court of Appeals erred in stating that \u201c[pjroof of the execution of a lost will is by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 483 (citing <em>Nelson, 85 </em>Wn.2d at 607-08; <em>In re Estate of Peters, </em>43 Wn.2d 846, 860, 264 P.2d 1109 (1953)). The Court of Appeals cites <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Peters </em>for this proposition, but neither case supports this burden of proof. In <em>Nelson, </em>the formalities of execution of the will were not contested, and the court used the clear preponderance of the evidence standard to determine if the will was in existence at the time of the testator\u2019s death, a requirement no longer applicable under the current statute. 85 Wn.2d at 606-08. <em>Peters, </em>interpreting a former version of RCW 11.20.070, states that the clear and distinct burden of proof relates only to the contents of the will, and proof as to the execution of the will is found in the first paragraph of the statute. 43 Wn.2d at 860. However, the execution of the will was not contested in <em>Peters, </em>paragraph one of the statute does not provide a standard for the appropriate burden of proof, and the court provides no standard for proving the execution of a will. <em>Id. </em>Although the court later mentions the preponderance of the evidence standard, this is in regard to whether the testator lacked capacity and does not strongly support the proposition that that standard should apply to the execution of a will generally. <em>Id. </em>at 861; <em>see also In re Estate of Gardner, </em>69 Wn.2d 229, 235-36, 417 P.2d 948 (1966) (quoting <em>Peters, </em>43 Wn.2d at 860, for the proposition that the \u201c \u2018clear and distinct\u2019 \u201d burden of proof refers only to proving the contents of the will, but not stating the applicable burden of proof to be applied to the execution of a will); <em>In re Estate of Neubert, </em>59 Wn.2d 678, 685, 369 P.2d 838 (1962) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00b616 \u201cA statute must be read as a whole giving effect to all of the language used,\u201d and each provision must be harmonized with other provisions to \u201c \u2018insure proper construction of every provision.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Young, </em>125 Wn.2d 688, 696, 888 P.2d 142 (1995) (quoting <em>Addleman v. Bd. of Prison Terms &amp; Paroles, </em>107 Wn.2d 503, 509, 730 P.2d 1327 (1986)). Reading RCW 11.20.070 as a whole supports using the \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing\u201d burden of proof for the execution and the content of a will. Case law does not support allowing a lower burden of proof for the execution of a lost will than is used for proving the contents of a lost will. <em>See In re Last Will &amp; Testament of Borrow, </em>123 Wash. 128, 130, 212 P. 149 (1923) (applying the same burden of proof to the execution and the contents of a lost will).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the appropriate burden of proof pertaining to the execution of a lost will should be \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">B. Admission of the 1993 Lost Will</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b617 The Court of Appeals applied RCW 11.20.070 to determine if the 1993 will should be admitted to probate and found that Myrna had met the technical requirements of the statute. <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 484. However, the court concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate because, based on the doctrine of res judicata, summary judgment would not allow disputed issues to be argued in a later will contest, which would \u201cinadvertently short circuit[ ] the statutory probate scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-86. The Court of Appeals correctly applied RCW 11.20.070 but incorrectly held that Myrna had met the technical requirements of the statute. The court also erred in its application of res judicata, and that issue will be discussed below. <em>See infra </em>section C.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>1. Applicable Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"> \u00b618 At the outset, we must determine which statutes apply to this case. We decide issues of statutory construction de novo. <em>In re Estate of Baird, </em>131 Wn.2d 514, 518, 933 P.2d 1031 (1997). Statutes relating to the same subject are construed together and, in \u201c \u2018ascertaining legislative purpose . . . are to be read together as constituting a unified whole, to the end that a harmonious, total statutory scheme evolves.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hallauer v. Spectrum Props., Inc., </em>143 Wn.2d 126, 146, 18 P.3d 540 (2001) (quoting <em>State v. Wright, </em>84 Wn.2d 645, 650, 529 P.2d 453 (1974)). When more than one statute applies, the specific statute will supersede the general statute. <em>See Hallauer, </em>143 Wn.2d at 146 (stating that when statutes conflict, the specific statute supersedes the general statute); <em>Waste Mgmt. of Seattle, Inc. v. Utils. &amp; Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>123 Wn.2d 621, 630, 869 P.2d 1034 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b619 Here, we need consider only two statutes, RCW 11.20.070 and RCW 11.12.020. Although RCW 11-.20.020 explains how a party may petition a court to admit a will to probate in an ex parte proceeding, here the 1993 will is a lost will; therefore, the specific lost will statute, RCW 11.20.070, and not the general statute applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> RCW 11.20.070(1) states that the court \u201cmay take proof of the execution and validity of the will and establish it\u201d after notice has been given to all parties. To determine whether the will was properly executed, the court must use RCW 11.12.020, which describes the proper execution of all wills. <em>See In re Estate of Harris, </em>10 Wash. 555, 559, 39 P. 148 (1895) (discussing former RCW 11.12.020 and stating that a</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>lost will must have the same RCW 11.12.020 requirements as all other wills); <em>Neubert, </em>59 Wn.2d at 685 (finding evidence sufficient to establish execution of a lost will under RCW 11.12.020).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The petitioner must prove the execution and the contents of the will \u201cby clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\u201d RCW 11.20.070(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">2. Technical Requirements: Execution of the Lost Will</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b620 RCW 11.12.020(1) requires all wills to be in writing, \u201csigned by the testator or by some other person under the testator\u2019s direction in the testator\u2019s presence,\u201d and attested to by <em>two </em>witnesses in the presence of the testator and at the testator\u2019s request. The witnesses may attest to the will by subscribing their names to the will or by signing an affidavit in compliance with RCW 11.20.020(2). Citing <em>In re Estate of Campbell, </em>47 Wn.2d 610, 615-16, 288 P.2d 852 (1955), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[a]n attestation clause is prima facie evidence that the [will] was signed by the witnesses in the presence of the testatrix and at her direction.\u201d <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 484. However, in <em>Campbell, </em>it appears that the will presented to the court included the testator\u2019s signature and a signed attestation clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 47 Wn.2d at 614-15; <em>see In re Estate of Chafey, </em>167 Wash. 185, 189, 8 P.2d 959 (1932) (stating that an attestation clause <em>with a genuine signature of the testator </em>is prima facie evidence of the will\u2019s execution); <em>see also In re Estate of</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Alfaro, </em>301 Ill. App. 3d 500, 504, 703 N.E.2d 620, 234 Ill. Dec. 759 (1998) (stating that an attestation clause with genuine signatures on the instrument is prima facie evidence that the will was properly executed). Here, the computer copy of the will does not contain any signatures by the testator or the witnesses. Therefore, the unsigned will and unsigned attestation clause is not prima facie evidence of proper execution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b621 Absent a signed attestation clause, execution may also be proved if witnesses testify they signed the document in the presence of the testator and testify to facts showing attestation as a matter of law. <em>In re Estate of Chambers, </em>187 Wash. 417, 427-28, 60 P.2d 41 (1936); <em>In re Estate of Lindsay, </em>91 Wn. App. 944, 949, 957 P.2d 818 (1998). The definition of witness as used in RCW 11.12.020 is \u201cone who has personal knowledge of the fact that the will was signed by the testator.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Price, </em>73 Wn. App. 745, 751, 871 P.2d 1079 (1994). Here, Reiter submitted an affidavit stating that Margaret signed the will in his presence and he signed the will as a witness. This satisfies the RCW 11.12.020 requirement as to one witness. However, Myrna must prove two attesting witnesses signed the document. Therefore, we must determine whether Taylor signed the document and, if so, if she did so as an attesting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">f 22 A witness may testify only to events within his or her personal knowledge, and affidavits submitted during summary judgment proceedings must be based on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge. Rules of Evidence (ER) 602; CR 56(e); <em>Visser v. Packer Eng\u2019g Assocs., </em>924 F.2d 655, 659 (7th Cir. 1991) (interpreting Federal Rule of Evidence 602, which is the same as ER 602, and stating that testimony outside an affiant\u2019s personal knowledge is not admissible in an affidavit submitted during summary judgment proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ings). A witness who personally observes an event can state an opinion, conclusion, or impression as to the event and may testify \u201c \u2018about the state of mind of another, so long as the witness personally witnessed events or heard statements that are relevant to prove the other person\u2019s state of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Contreras, </em>57 Wn. App. 471, 477, 788 P.2d 1114 (1990) (quoting 5A Karl B. Tegland, Washington Practice: Evidence Law and Practice \u00a7 218(2), at 153 (3d ed. 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b623 Here, Reiter stated that Margaret signed the will in Taylor\u2019s presence and he observed Taylor signing the document as a witness. However, his recall of Taylor as the notary who was present was based on a review of the notarized power of attorney containing Taylor\u2019s signature. Further, in Reiter\u2019s declaration, submitted to the court to oppose summary judgment, he states that Margaret signed the will in the presence of witnesses and a notary, implying that Taylor was not a witness. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 112; <em>see also </em>CP at 1 (petition to probate the lost will stating the will was executed in the presence of two witnesses and a notary public); <em>but see </em>CP at 2, 31 (noting that Taylor was a witness). Moreover, from Taylor\u2019s affidavits, it appears she was present for the notarization of Margaret\u2019s power of attorney, but it is not clear that she had personal knowledge that Margaret signed the will, as she does not recall any of the events associated with the execution of the will. Although Blauert stated he noticed the will was signed by two attesting witnesses, he did not state the names of the witnesses. Therefore, it is unclear if Taylor\u2019s signature is the other witness signature on the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b624 Additionally, even if Taylor signed the document, it is unclear if she signed it as a notary or as an attesting witness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A notary\u2019s signature may be \u201cdeemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the signature of an attesting witness\u201d where all other requirements of a valid attestation are met. <em>Price, </em>73 Wn. App. at 752-53.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Price, </em>a notary\u2019s signature met the legal requirements of attestation where the notary interacted with the testator and could judge his competency, the notary declared the testator signed the will in her presence, the testator requested she sign the will, and she was qualified to be a witness. <em>Id. </em>at 753; <em>see also Alfaro, </em>301 Ill. App. 3d at 510 (stating that the main issue is whether the notary is attesting to the genuineness of the signature or if she is attesting to all acts necessary to properly execute a will). Here, based on Taylor\u2019s affidavits, she did not interact with Margaret, she did not declare that Margaret signed the will in her presence, and she did not state that Margaret requested her to sign the will. Although Reiter states that the will was signed in the presence of himself and Taylor, there is no other evidence that Taylor had personal knowledge pertaining to whether Margaret signed the will. Further, as discussed above, the record contains contradictory evidence as to whether two witnesses and a notary were present, indicating Taylor was not a witness. CP at 1, 2, 31, 112. Therefore, even if Taylor signed the will, her signature may be only that of a notary and not as an attesting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b625 On summary judgment, inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Balise, </em>62 Wn.2d at 199.

Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b626 Although we have held that summary judgment is not appropriate in light of genuine issues of material fact regarding the execution of the will, we address the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion discussing res judicata to clarify how this doctrine works in regard to probate proceedings. The Court of Appeals stated that summary judgment admitting the 1993 lost will was not appropriate because it would preclude challenges to the will\u2019s validity. <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 485-86. We grant Myrna\u2019s motion for leave to supplement the record and admit the trial court order limiting the issues at summary judgment to admission of the 1993 will (see Trial Court Order) in order to explain why the Court of Appeals is mistaken in this case. <em>See </em>Rules of Appellate Procedure 9.10 (allowing the court to supplement the record in order to decide the merits of an issue on review).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>f27 The doctrine of res judicata prevents relitigation of the same claim where a subsequent claim involves the same subject matter, cause of action, persons and parties, and quality of persons for or against the claim made. <em>Seattle-First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Kawachi, </em>91 Wn.2d 223, 225-26, 588 P.2d 725 (1978). Res judicata bars \u201cevery question which was properly a part of the matter in controversy, but it does not bar litigation of claims which were not in fact adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226; <em>DeYoung v. Cenex Ltd., </em>100 Wn. App. 885, 891-92, 1 P.3d 587 (2000) (stating that res judicata applies to matters actually litigated and those that could and should have been raised in the prior proceeding). This doctrine applies to issues decided on summary judgment. Because \u201c[a] grant of summary judgment is a final judgment on the merits with the same preclusive effect as a full trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 892, an unappealed summary judgment is res judicata as to rights determined during summary judgment. <em>See Lowe v. Double L Props., Inc., </em>105 Wn. App. 888, 896, 20 P.3d 500 (2001) (stating that an unappealed summary judgment became res judicata as to a party\u2019s maintenance rights, which had been determined in the summary judgment proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b628 Normally, the offer to probate a will is a non-adversary proceeding, and a hostile party waits until the will is admitted to probate to contest the will under RCW 11.24.010. <em>Campbell, </em>47 Wn.2d at 612-13. However, a will contest is not the exclusive way to contest a will, and \u201c[u]nder certain circumstances, a hearing upon a petition to probate a will may properly become an adversary proceeding.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Seattle-First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>49 Wn.2d 728, 736, 306 P.2d 739 (1957). Where a party raises issues regarding the jurisdiction of the court or other issues that could or should be determined at the hearing upon a petition to probate, the proceeding may be adversarial. <em>Id. </em>However, if a party contests the admission of the will to probate, generally that same party may not file a later will contest. The party\u2019s only remedy is to appeal the order admitting the will. <em>In re Estate of Hall, </em>34 Wn.2d 830, 833, 210 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>406 (1949); <em>see also In re Estate of Godfrey, </em>164 Wash. 269, 270-73, 2 P.2d 894 (1931) (finding that where an executor under an earlier will appeared to contest the admission of a later will and did not appeal the decree admitting the later will the executor subsequently could not file a separate will contest).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b629 However, it must be remembered that res judicata bars only claims actually adjudicated which were or should have been raised in the proceeding. Here, the trial court specifically stated it would not address claims regarding competency or undue influence and limited the summary judgment trial to whether the lost will should be admitted to probate, which included whether the will was executed at all. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. Order; <em>see also </em>Judge\u2019s Oral Op. (Sept. 6, 2001) at 4, 10 (stating that although the court has suspicions about undue influence, the issue will be addressed at the will contest trial). Because the trial court order limited the issues, the grant of summary judgment admitting the 1993 will would not bar claims regarding competency or undue influence because these claims were not addressed, nor could they be addressed, in the summary judgment trial. Therefore, the Court of Appeals was incorrect in basing its denial of summary judgment on res judicata grounds, since unadjudicated issues regarding the will\u2019s validity precluded by the trial court order could be raised by the beneficiaries in a later will contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">D. One Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b630 Although we base our reversal of summary judgment on different grounds, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of summary judgment. We also affirm the decision to remand the case with instructions to decide all issues pertaining to the 1992 and 1993 wills in one proceeding. <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> \u00b631 If a party challenges a will at probate, instead of waiting to file a will contest, and the challenge is not jurisdictional, it is within the court\u2019s discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>decide whether to hear the issues at probate or reserve the issues. <em>Gordon, </em>49 Wn.2d at 736. Under an abuse of discretion standard, the trial court\u2019s decision should be upheld unless it is \u201c \u2018manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

When claims arise from the same \u201c \u2018transactional nucleus of facts\u2019 \u201d and the damages are \u201cintimately related in time, origin, and motivation, because they arise out of the same interactions between the deceased and the respondents,\u201d the claims make a \u201cconvenient trial unit\u201d and should be decided in the probate proceeding. <em>Hadley v.

Trying all claims in one proceeding furthers the purpose of the probate statutes \u201cto avoid the trial of separate and distinct contests.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Larson, </em>187 Wash. 183, 188, 60 P.2d 19 (1936) (stating that a normal (e.g., not lost) will should be admitted in an ex parte proceeding and hostile parties should wait to contest the will until after admission).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b633 Here, the trial court recognized problems regarding the competency of Margaret, the authenticity of the lost will, and the possibility of undue influence. <em>See </em>Trial Court Order; Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Sept. 26, 2001) at 15-16. However, the court chose to reserve these issues for the will contest because the court found the issues went to the weight of the lost will and not to its admissibility. <em>Id. </em>We find that it was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion not to hear all issues regarding the validity of the will at the probate proceeding. <em>See Gordon, </em>49 Wn.2d at 736-37 (finding the trial court abused its discretion by not hearing all objections in the probate proceeding because the court\u2019s action could cause a delay to a hearing on the contest and to an appeal). We find that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>remand it is more appropriate to hear all issues regarding the validity of both wills in one proceeding because the claims are interrelated and involve the same \u201ctransactional nucleus of facts.\u201d <em>See Hadley, </em>60 Wn. App. at 442-43 (finding the claims of undue influence, abuse of confidence, fraud, and substitution of wills should be determined in the probate challenge). On remand we trust that the court will hear claims in a sequential order, hold all parties to the appropriate burdens of proof, and determine which will is the last will and testament of Margaret Black.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">E. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b634 The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees to Burns and stated that the court should award fees to both parties or to neither. <em>Black, </em>116 Wn. App. at 491. We affirm the Court of Appeals and remand the attorney fee issue to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b635 The controlling statute in this case is RCW 11.96A.150. This statute leaves the award of attorney fees to the discretion of the court, and we will not interfere with a trial court\u2019s fee determination unless \u201cthere are facts and circumstances clearly showing an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Larson, </em>103 Wn.2d 517, 521, 694 P.2d 1051 (1985); RCW 11.96A.150; <em>see also </em>RCW 11.24.050 (attorney fee statute under the will contest chapter stating that where a will is revoked, assessment of costs shall be in the court\u2019s discretion). Based on the holdings <em>in In re Estate of Jolly, </em>3 Wn.2d 615, 101 P.2d 995 (1940), and <em>In re Estate of Watlack, </em>88 Wn. App. 603, 945 P.2d 1154 (1997), we find that the court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to Burns only.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b636 In <em>Watlack, </em>the court ordered the estate to pay the attorney fees of all parties to the will dispute because the litigation involved all beneficiaries and affected the rights of all the beneficiaries. 88 Wn. App. at 612-13 (distinguishing <em>In re Estate of Niehenke, </em>117 Wn.2d 631, 818 P.2d 1324 (1991), a case where the dispute did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>involve all beneficiaries); <em>see also Niehenke, </em>117 Wn.2d at 648 (noting that where all beneficiaries are not involved in litigation, an award from the estate would harm the uninvolved beneficiaries). The court in <em>Jolly </em>found an award to an executor was appropriate where the executor unsuccessfully defended a will in good faith. 3 Wn.2d at 626-27.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This case is analogous to <em>Watlack </em>and <em>Jolly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b637 Here, like <em>Watlack, </em>the will dispute involves all the beneficiaries, affects the rights of all beneficiaries, and an award against the estate would not harm any uninvolved beneficiaries. The litigation benefits the estate by establishing the final wishes of Margaret and establishing which alleged beneficiaries have a right to Margaret\u2019s estate. <em>See Niehenke, </em>117 Wn.2d at 647-48 (stating there are situations where attorney fees are properly assessed against the estate, but noting that generally the estate must be benefited if attorney fees are assessed against it). Further, although one party will be unsuccessful in the will dispute, if it is shown that the party had a duty to oppose the will and acted in good faith, under <em>Jolly </em>the party may still be entitled to attorney fees. 3 Wn.2d at 626-27. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals and remand this issue to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b638 We clarify that the statutory requirements as currently written in RCW 11.20.070 must be followed and that the execution and content of a will must be proved by \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\u201d We affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of summary judgment on the grounds that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the execution of the 1993 lost will. While res judicata may apply to summary judgment proceedings regarding probate, here the Court of Appeals improperly applied the doctrine in light of the trial court\u2019s order limiting the issues in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>probate proceeding. We remand this case to be decided in one proceeding, with all issues regarding the 1992 and 1993 wills to be decided in that proceeding.

However, here no witnesses are absent, incompetent, or unable to testify. Finally, once the will is admitted to probate, any interested person may contest the will within four months of admission under RCW 11.24.010. However, technically this proceeding is not a will contest, since the parties are challenging the admission of the 1993 will during the offer to probate the will (e.g., it has not been decided whether the 1993 will is admitted yet).

Nowhere in that subsection is any reference to proof of the lost will\u2019s execution. Rather it is subsection (1) of RCW 11.20.070 which addresses proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of that element as well as the will\u2019s validity (i.e., testamentary capacity, lack of undue influence). Not coincidentally, RCW 11.20.070(1) makes <em>no </em>mention of proving a lost will\u2019s provisions. Thus, there is an express legislative distinction between proving a lost will\u2019s execution and validity and proving the lost will\u2019s testamentary scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b643 However the majority blends subsections (1) and (2) together under the erroneous belief it is reading RCW 11.20.070 as a whole and giving effect to all language used. Majority at 163. It is firmly established though that courts \u201cmust not add words where the legislature has chosen not to include them.\u201d <em>Rest. Dev., Inc. v. Cananwill, Inc., </em>150 Wn.2d 674, 682, 80 P.3d 598 (2003). Yet this is precisely what the majority does by interjecting \u201cexecution\u201d into RCW 11.20.070(2)\u2014the only subsection in chapter 11.20 RCW (the applicable chapter for proving wills for probate) to even reference the \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing\u201d standard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b644 Even assuming the statute is ambiguous yields the same result, as our cases construing prior versions of the statute recognized a distinction between proving a will\u2019s execution and its contents. If a statute is ambiguous, meaning it is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations, then the court may look beyond the plain language to other aids, such as legislative history. <em>State ex rel.

This court recognized \u201cthe clear and distinct proof referred to in the lost wills statute, RCW 11.20.070, relates <em>only to the provisions of the instrument, and not to its execution. </em>Proof as to the execution of the instrument is dealt with in the <em>first paragraph of that statute and in other statutes.\u201d In re Estate of Peters, </em>43 Wn.2d 846, 860, 264 P.2d 1109 (1953) (emphasis added) (citing RCW 11.20.020, .040); <em>see also In re Estate of Gardner, </em>69 Wn.2d 229, 235-36, 417 P.2d 948 (1966). The \u201cother statutes\u201d referenced in <em>Estate of Peters </em>describe the standard procedure for admitting any <em>existing </em>will to probate and how such proof may be obtained if one or more of the subscribing witnesses is deceased or unavailable. <em>See </em>RCW 11.20.020, .040. Thus, proof of a lost will\u2019s execution under former RCW 11.20.070 was <em>no different </em>than proving any other will\u2019s execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00b645 When the legislature amended RCW 11.20.070 in 1994<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by enacting Substitute House Bill 2270, Laws of 1994, ch. 221, \u00a7 20, it left much of the first paragraph intact as a newly created subsection (1). <em>Cf. </em>RCW 11.20.070(1). Along with removing the requirement to prove the lost will\u2019s existence at the time of the testator\u2019s death, the amendment further replaced the \u201cclearly and distinctly\u201d standard with the \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing\u201d one, which now comprises subsection (2). RCW 11.20.070(2). Thus, as was the case in <em>Estate of Peters, </em>the statute still requires the same standard of proof for execution of the lost will as it does for existing wills. To conclude as the majority does requires one to assume the legislature overruled <em>Estate of Peters </em>sub silentio. <em>Estate of Peters, </em>43 Wn.2d at 860. Yet the legislature\u2019s refusal to modify the relevant language<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> from the first paragraph of former RCW 11.20.070 rebuts this assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b646 <em>In re Last Will &amp; Testament of Borrow, </em>123 Wash. 128, 212 R 149 (1923) is not to the contrary.

Our majority\u2019s excessive reliance on <em>Borrow\u2019s </em>language referencing \u201cexecution\u201d has already been conclusively rejected. In <em>Estate of Gardner </em>the court looked to both the quoted portion from <em>Borrow </em>on which our majority so heavily relies and the above-referenced quote from <em>Estate of Peters. </em>69 Wn.2d at 235. <em>Estate of Gardner </em>found <em>Estate of Peters </em>more persuasive on the point and permitted the lost will to be probated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b647 Since the presumptive burden of proof for civil cases is by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Reese v. Stroh, </em>128 Wn.2d 300, 312, 907 P.2d 282 (1995), and proving execution of a lost will for probate is the same as proving execution of any other will, it follows that standard of proof applies when a lost will is offered for probate until the legislature mandates otherwise. Whereas the will\u2019s contents must be proved by \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing evidence,\u201d RCW 11.20.070(2), execution is proved by a preponderance of the evidence. It may or may not be better policy to require the heightened standard to prove a lost will\u2019s execution; that debate, however, belongs in the legislature\u2014not this court. <em>State ex rel.

However when this record is viewed <em>as a whole, </em>reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion: Margaret Black signed this written will on August 14, 1993, and Robert Reiter and Janet Taylor signed their names as witnesses. My reasons follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b649 The statutory requisites to formally execute a will are minimal. <em>Estate of Gardner, </em>69 Wn.2d at 236; <em>In re Estate of Chambers, </em>187 Wash. 417, 425, 60 P.2d 41 (1936). A will is validly executed if it is (1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, and (3) \u201cattested by two or more competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>witnesses, by subscribing their names to the will, or by signing an affidavit that complies with RCW 11.20.020(2), while in the presence of the testator and at the testator\u2019s direction or request.\u201d RCW 11.12.020(1). Myrna, as petitioner to admit the will, must prove all three of these elements. RCW 11.20.070(1). In addition, because Myrna seeks to admit a will that has been lost, she must also prove that will\u2019s substantive provisions. RCW 11.20.070(2). Proof of the will\u2019s provisions <em>{not </em>execution) must be by \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The only debatable issue here is whether the will was attested to by two or more persons who subscribed their names to the will in Margaret\u2019s presence and at Margaret\u2019s direction or request. RCW 11.12.020(1).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b650 This case ultimately turns on whether the affidavits of Seattle attorney Paul Blauert, California attorney Robert Reiter, and notary Janet Taylor sufficiently remove any genuine issue of material fact as to whether two persons witnessed Margaret execute this will and subscribed their names to the will attesting to this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">f 51 A signed attestation clause is prima facie proof that the will was signed by two witnesses in the testatrix\u2019s presence and at her request or direction. <em>In re Estate of Campbell, </em>47 Wn.2d 610, 615-16, 288 P.2d 852 (1955). While the majority correctly notes the proffered copy of the lost will is unsigned, uncontradicted testimony from Blauert and Reiter demonstrate that two persons signed that clause: Reiter and Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b652 A copy of the lost will was provided as an attachment to both Blauert\u2019s and Reiter\u2019s affidavits respectively. Blauert affirmed that the copy attached to his affidavit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>identical to the actual will he drafted and kept on file. That copy is the same in all respects as the copy attached to Reiter\u2019s affidavit, which Reiter affirms is identical to the will actually executed by Margaret. That will contained an attestation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b653 Reiter also testified by declaration that he \u201casked Mrs. Black a number of questions [about the will] in Ms. Taylor\u2019s presence.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 31. Margaret told Reiter that she understood she was signing a will and that the will \u201cleft her entire estate to Myrna.\u201d CP at 31. He further testified that in Margaret\u2019s presence he \u201cand Ms. Taylor signed [their] names <em>as witnesses thereto.\u201d </em>CP at 31 (emphasis added). Finally Reiter affirmed he and Myrna gave that signed document to Blauert at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport the following day. CP at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b6 54 Blauert testified that he drafted the will and that it was the same document Myrna returned to him when she returned to Seattle from Walla Walla. CP at 43-44. This corroborates Reiter\u2019s testimony. Blauert further testified that the will \u201chad been executed on August 14, 1993, and that it had been attested to and signed by two witnesses.\u201d CP at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b655 The majority is correct Blauert\u2019s testimony alone insufficiently demonstrates Taylor and Reiter signed as witnesses, as Blauert was not present when the will was signed. Majority at 167. But when viewed in conjunction with Reiter\u2019s testimony and the identity between the copies of the will attached to Blauert\u2019s and Reiter\u2019s affidavits, the only reasonable conclusion to draw is that Reiter and Taylor signed the attestation clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b656 The majority emphasizes, however, that Taylor cannot independently recall Margaret Black executed the will. Majority at 167-68. Such is not dispositive. <em>See In re Estate of Neubert, </em>59 Wn.2d 678, 369 P.2d 838 (1962). In <em>Estate of Neubert </em>the only living attesting witness, an attorney in the law firm which possessed a conformed copy of the lost will, \u201chad no independent memory of Mrs. Neubert [the testatrix] or the execution of the [lost] will in his and [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>other witness\u2019s] presence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682. In fact, not one person who testified at the probate hearing could independently recall execution of the will. The sole testimony came from another attorney in the law firm, the attorney witness who could not recall the specific execution, and a secretary, all of whom testified to the procedure for conforming copies of wills. <em>See id. </em>at 680-84. Though <em>not one </em>attesting witness testified to the actual execution of the lost will, we held the execution had been sufficiently proved. <em>Id. </em>at 685.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Likewise, <em>Estate of Gardner </em>held probate of a lost will was required where one subscribing witness specifically recalled execution of <em>the </em>will at issue and the subscribing witness could only recall that <em>a </em>will was executed, though she could not accurately recall the date of execution. <em>Estate of Gardner, </em>69 Wn.2d at 236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b657 Thus we have not once, but twice held execution of a lost will was sufficiently proved by fewer than two witnesses affirmatively testifying to the execution of the will. Yet the majority discounts these authorities claiming \u201conly one attesting witness testified.\u201d Majority at 169 n.ll. This simply is not true. To the contrary there are affidavits filed under oath by not only Reiter but also Taylor and Blauert. Merely because Taylor lacks independent recollection of this will\u2019s execution does not render her testimony useless and irrelevant. Rather, Taylor affirms she met Margaret Black in 1993. In her second declaration Taylor acknowledges she \u201cbelieve [s] that [she] did personally observe Margaret Black sign the Durable Power of Attorney on August 14, 1993, because [she] did not notarize documents for individuals [she] did not know, without them being in [her] presence at the time of signing.\u201d CP at 119-20. Moreover the majority\u2019s attempted distinction based on \u201cone\u201d witness\u2019s testimony is tenuous given <em>Estate of Neubert </em>held execution was proved despite no affirmative testimony to the execution of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u00b658 The majority further notes Taylor may have served only as a notary and not as a witness. Majority at 167-68. For support the majority relies on both the petition to admit the will and one of Reiter\u2019s declarations that suggests there were two witnesses and a notary in the room where Margaret executed the will. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68. To conclude, as the majority does, one must assume not two but three persons stood next to Margaret when she executed the will. <em>Nothing </em>in the record other than semantics suggests this, and the authority on which the majority relies specifies the opposite.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b659 Reiter\u2019s initial declaration asserts he \u201cand Ms. Taylor signed [their] names <em>as witnesses thereto.\u201d </em>CP at 31 (emphasis added). Furthermore, the second page of the petition to admit the will, which the majority fails to mention, alleges \u201cMr. Reiter has executed an Affidavit filed herein testifying as to the provisions and execution of the Will by the decedent and decedent\u2019s testamentary capacity and to the witnessing of the Will by both himself and <em>the other witness, Janet Taylor, who also notarized the executed Will.\u201d </em>CP at 2 (emphasis added). Thus, when viewing the petition <em>as a whole, </em>Myrna alleged that Taylor was both a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>notary <em>and </em>a witness. Surrounding circumstances can render a notary\u2019s signature into that of a subscribing witness so long as it meets the formal requirements of attestation. <em>In re Estate of Price, </em>73 Wn. App. 745, 752-53, 871 P.2d 1079 (1994) (citing <em>Estate of Chambers, </em>187 Wash, at 423). The majority distinguishes <em>Estate of Price </em>claiming Taylor did not interact with Margaret nor affirmatively declare that Margaret signed the will in her presence. Yet nowhere in Taylor\u2019s written testimony is there any denial such interaction took place. Moreover Blauert\u2019s and Reiter\u2019s affidavits establish Taylor signed the attestation clause along with Reiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b660 All three affidavits when viewed in conjunction with one another establish Myrna met her prima facie summary judgment burden. Given that the beneficiaries of the 1992 will failed to produce any evidence outside their pleadings that demonstrated a genuine issue of fact remains,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> summary judgment must be awarded. CR 56(c). Basically the majority does not find Reiter and Blauert credible, despite the fact both individuals were deposed by the beneficiaries of the 1992 will, and the beneficiaries ultimately unearthed no evidence to discredit them. However judging a witness\u2019s credibility when the opposing party does not bring forth any countering evidence is inappropriate. <em>Howell v. Spokane &amp; Inland Empire Blood Bank, </em>117 Wn.2d 619, 626, 818 P.2d 1056 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b661 Genuine issues of fact may remain as to whether Margaret Black executed the 1993 lost will under undue influence or without sufficient testamentary capacity. Yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>those issues must be decided in a subsequent will contest. They are therefore immaterial to the issue to which summary judgment was sought. <em>See Ruff v.

Courts presume a change in legislative intent whenever it materially alters a statute and that the legislature intended to exclude the term so omitted. <em>Rhoad v.

The amendment of \u201cthe witnesses\u201d to \u201cany witnesses\u201d suggests the legislature sought to clarify the requirement in lost wills cases that every witness must provide signed proof of a lost will\u2019s execution. <em>Accord </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 97 (1981) (defining \u201cany\u201d as \u201cused as a function word to indicate the maximum or whole of a number or quantity,\u201d such as \u201cgive me [any] letters you can find\u201d).

Moreover the contents of the will unquestionably leave Margaret\u2019s entire estate to Myrna. While one need only prove the substance of the lost will\u2019s provisions and not the exact language to satisfy RCW 11.20.070(2), <em>Estate of Gardner, </em>69 Wn.2d at 236, the affidavits of Blauert and Reiter demonstrate the copy of the lost will Blauert drafted and the copy Reiter witnessed are identical.

Even assuming this to be true, the 1993 will must be admitted to probate. Execution of a will is still valid even if one of the attesting witnesses is interested (i.e., a beneficiary under the will). RCW 11.12.160(2); <em>Estate of Chambers, </em>187 Wash. at 420 (holding beneficiaries under a will are qualified to testify to execution). Rather the interested witness would lose his or her gift under the will (absent proof overcoming a presumption of undue influence) and that property would pass intestate. RCW 11.12.160(3). Granted, such a situation would have the same net effect here with Myrna being the only beneficiary under the 1993 will and sole intestate heir to Margaret\u2019s estate. Yet that does not invalidate execution of the 1993 will, which would, as a matter of law, revoke the 1992 will. <em>In re Estate of Campbell, </em>46 Wn.2d 292, 296, 280 P.2d 686 (1955). Nonetheless, those beneficiaries would still be afforded the opportunity to revive the 1992 will through the doctrine of dependent relative revocation. <em>See generally In re Kerckhof\u2019s Estate, </em>13 Wn.2d 469, 472-73,125 P.2d 284 (1942). Thus, even \u00bf/Myrna was the other witness, execution of the will was sufficiently proved. But that possibility should not be considered in any event, as to conclude as much necessitates a finding that Reiter is not credible, which is wholly unacceptable in summary judgment proceedings absent evidence rebutting his assertions. <em>See Howell v.

However the declaration corroborates Myma\u2019s and Reiter\u2019s trip to visit Margaret in every other respect, and the beneficiaries do not describe what relevance testimony regarding execution of the will would have had to those guardianship proceedings, nor why such testimony would be included in those proceedings in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
