RCW 72.02.045(3) states that \u201c[w]hen convicted persons are released from the confines of the institution either on parole, transfer, or discharge, all. .. valuable personal property in the possession of the superintendent belonging to such convicted persons shall be delivered to them.\u201d In contrast, DOC Policy 440.000, section IX limits the amount of property that DOC will ship free of charge to two boxes along with state issued transport and clothing bags.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All excess property must be shipped at inmates\u2019 expense, donated, or destroyed. <em>Id. </em>Based on DOC\u2019s practices under Policy 440.000, Burton made additional claims <em>for </em>due process violations; fraud; conversion; violations of the Washington Criminal Profiteering Act (WCPA), chapter 9A.82 RCW; and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968. The superior court found that the term \u201ctransfer\u201d did not apply to intraDOC inmate movement and dismissed all of Burton\u2019s claims pursuant to a CR 12(b)(6) motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed on other grounds, holding that \u201ctransfer\u201d does include intra-DOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>movement but that inmates effectively receive \u201cconstructive delivery\u201d under Policy 440.000.</p>\n<author id=\"AcT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Owens, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b62 DOC Policy 440.000, section IX states that DOC will ship a limited amount of property free of charge when an inmate is transferred to another DOC facility and that any excess property must be shipped at the offender\u2019s expense, donated, or destroyed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Items such as typewriters, musical instruments, televisions, and stereo equipment are generally excluded from the two box limit. In contrast, RCW 72.02.045 states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">(3) The superintendent shall be the custodian of all funds and valuable personal property of convicted persons as may be in their possession upon admission to the institution, or which may be sent or brought in to such persons, or earned by them while in custody, or which shall be forwarded to the superintendent on behalf of convicted persons. . . .When convicted persons are <em>released from the confines of the institution </em>either <em>on </em>parole, transfer, or discharge, <em>all </em>funds and <em>valuable personal property in the possession of the superintendent belonging to such convicted persons shall be delivered to them.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b63 Burton\u2019s complaint alleges several transfers between DOC institutions where DOC required the payment of shipping costs for property in excess of the Policy 440.000 limit. The complaint requested class certification, alleging that DOC Policy 440.000 and its implementation violates the RCW 72.02.045(3) requirement that superintendents \u201cshall\u201d deliver all personal property to the inmate upon \u201ctransfer.\u201d Burton further alleged due process violations, fraud, conversion, violations of the WCPA, and violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>RICO. Burton requested several types of relief, including compensatory damages, punitive damages, treble damages, costs and attorney fees, statutory penalties, declaratory relief, an injunction, and pre- and postjudgment interest. Judge Daniel J. Berschauer granted the defendants\u2019 CR 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss before any discovery was conducted, concluding that RCW 72.02.045 did not require DOC to pay for the transport of property upon an inmate\u2019s transfer to another DOC institution. The court found the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in RCW 72.02.045 to be ambiguous and adopted DOC\u2019s view that \u201ctransfer\u201d means transfer to the street, rather than to another DOC institution. Because the court concluded that all of Burton\u2019s additional claims were dependent upon a violation of the statute, it did not address those claims individually, but rather dismissed the complaint entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b64 Burton appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed on other grounds. <em>Burton v. Lehman, </em>118 Wn. App. 307, 309, 76 P.3d 271 (2003). The court held that \u201ctransfer\u201d in RCW 72.02.045(3) was not ambiguous and \u201cclearly suggests\u201d transfers between DOC institutions. <em>Id. </em>at 312-13. However, the court went on to hold that the term \u201cdelivery\u201d was ambiguous because it could refer to actual or constructive delivery. <em>Id. </em>at 314. The Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201cconstructive delivery\u201d was the appropriate definition because RCW 72.02.045(3) states that the superintendent is the custodian of inmate property and WAC 137-36-030(3) allows the superintendent to determine the type and amount of inmate property. <em>Id. </em>Using the constructive delivery definition, the court held that DOC Policy 440.000 does not violate RCW 72.02.045(3) because constructive delivery occurs when inmates are given the option to (1) arrange for pickup by a nonincarcerated person, (2) pay to ship the property, or (3) leave the property to the transferring DOC institution for donation or destruction. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 314. Burton\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and this court granted review on June 2, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>II. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b65 1. Does DOC Policy 440.000, requiring inmates to either pay the shipping costs for some of their property or lose ownership of that property, violate the requirement in RCW 72.02.045(3) that DOC superintendents shall deliver inmate property upon transfer?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">f6 2. Were Burton\u2019s claims for constitutional rights violations, fraud, conversion, violations of the WCPA, and violations of RICO properly dismissed pursuant to CR 12(b)(6)?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b67 Whether a dismissal was appropriate under CR 12(b)(6) is a question of law that an appellate court reviews de novo. <em>Tenore v. AT&amp;T Wireless Servs., </em>136 Wn.2d 322, 329-30, 962 P.2d 104 (1998). Under CR 12(b)(6), dismissal is appropriate only if \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts which would justify recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. In undertaking such an analysis, \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s allegations are presumed to be true and a court may consider hypothetical facts not included in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Statutory interpretation is also a question of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>W. Telepage, Inc. v. City of Tacoma Dep\u2019t of Fin., </em>140 Wn.2d 599, 607, 998 P.2d 884 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">A. Statutory Violation of RCW 72.02.045(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u00b68 Where statutory language is plain and unambiguous, a court will not construe the statute but will glean the legislative intent from the words of the statute itself, regardless of a contrary interpretation by an administrative agency. <em>See Bravo v. Dolsen Cos., </em>125 Wn.2d 745, 752, 888 P.2d 147 (1995); <em>Smith v. N. Pac. Ry., </em>7 Wn.2d 652, 664, 110 P.2d 851 (1941). A statutory term that is left undefined should be given its \u201cusual and ordinary meaning and courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>may not read into a statute a meaning that is not there.\u201d <em>State v. Hahn, </em>83 Wn. App. 825, 832, 924 P.2d 392 (1996). If the undefined statutory term is not technical, the court may refer to the dictionary to establish the meaning of the word. <em>Heinsma v. City of Vancouver, </em>144 Wn.2d 556, 564, 29 P.3d 709 (2001). In undertaking this plain language analysis, the court must remain careful to avoid \u201cunlikely, absurd or strained\u201d results. <em>State v. Stannard, </em>109 Wn.2d 29, 36, 742 P.2d 1244 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b69 In contrast, an ambiguous statute requires judicial construction. A statute is ambiguous only if susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations, but a statute is not ambiguous merely because different interpretations are conceivable. <em>State v. Keller, </em>143 Wn.2d 267, 276, 19 P.3d 1030 (2001). If a statute is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, the court should construe the statute to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Davis v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing, </em>137 Wn.2d 957, 963, 977 P.2d 554 (1999). Only where the legislative intent is not clear from the words of a statute may the court \u201cresort to extrinsic aids, such as legislative history.\u201d <em>Biggs v. Vail, </em>119 Wn.2d 129, 134, 830 P.2d 350 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b610 Throughout this litigation, the parties\u2019 dispute has focused on the meaning of two undefined terms in RCW 72.02.045(3): \u201ctransfer\u201d and \u201cdeliver[y].\u201d Although varying interpretations of these terms are conceivable in the metaphysical sense, we conclude that a plain language analysis of each is both necessary and sufficient to dispose of the question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">1. Transfer</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b611 The dictionary succinctly defines \u201ctransfer\u201d as follows: \u201cto carry or take from one person or place to another: ... to move or send to a different location.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 2426-27 (2002). Similarly, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201ctransfer\u201d as a verb meaning \u201c[t]o convey or remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>from one place or one person to another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1536 (8th ed. 2004). The application of these ordinary definitions to the phrase \u201creleased from the confines of the institution . . . on . . . transfer\u201d requires us to give the terms \u201crelease\u201d and \u201cconfine [ment]\u201d their plain meaning as well. The term \u201crelease\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he action of freeing or the fact of being freed from restraint or confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315-16. In turn, \u201cconfinement\u201d is \u201c[t]he act of imprisoning or restraining someone; the state of being imprisoned or restrained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. When, as here, the statutory terms are plain and unambiguous, we assume the legislature meant exactly what it said and decline to construe the statute otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Keller, </em>143 Wn.2d at 276. Therefore, as the Court of Appeals correctly concluded, \u201ctransfer\u201d must at least include an inmate\u2019s release from the confines of one DOC institution and conveyance to another. <em>Burton, </em>118 Wn. App. at 312-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">2. Delivery</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b612 The term \u201cdelivery\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he formal act of transferring something. . .; the giving or yielding possession or control of something to another.\u201d Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 461. Although the law recognizes that delivery may be actual, constructive, or symbolic, the only reasonable definition, as applied to a transferred inmate, is \u201cconstructive\u201d because DOC superintendents are custodians of inmate property and may limit an inmate\u2019s actual possession. <em>See </em>RCW 72.02.045(3); WAC 137-36-030. \u201cConstructive delivery\u201d requires \u201c[a]n act that amounts to a transfer of title by operation of law when actual transfer is impractical or impossible.\u201d Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b613 The Court of Appeals correctly adopted the \u201cconstructive delivery\u201d definition, though it need not have</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>concluded that the statute was ambiguous to do so. <em>Burton, </em>118 Wn. App. at 314. The parties themselves have not contested the use of \u201cconstructive delivery\u201d as the correct definition, but rather they dispute its application. Burton is correct that the Court of Appeals incorrectly assumed that inmates have the option to arrange for a nonincarcerated person to retrieve excess property. <em>See id. </em>DOC Policy 440.000 makes no such allowance explicit, and there was no finding that Burton or any other inmate was allowed to make such arrangements. Moreover, an adoption of the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning would fail to take into account instances where inmates are both indigent and have no available nonincarcerated persons to take possession. Such inmates would necessarily lose possession and control over the disposition of their property\u2014a result that is incongruent with the mandate in RCW 72.02.045(3) that a transferred inmate\u2019s property \u201cshall be delivered to them.\u201d Rather, we conclude that constructive delivery requires significantly more.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b614 For purposes of RCW 72.02.045(3), the phrase \u201call. . . valuable personal property in the possession of the superintendent belonging to such convicted persons shall be delivered to them\u201d cannot be artificially limited. Nothing in the statute indicates that only <em>some </em>of an inmate\u2019s property shall be delivered, nor does it state that the property shall be delivered at <em>such convicted person\u2019s expense. </em>Yet this is clearly the effect of DOC Policy 440.000. Accordingly, we must conclude that the statute means exactly what it says; that is, whenever an inmate is moved between DOC institutions, DOC is responsible for ensuring that the property owned by convicted persons and held in the custody of DOC superintendents is physically relocated from the transferor institution to the transferee institution. This is the \u201cact. . . amounting] to a transfer of title\u201d required to satisfy constructive delivery in this particular context. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 461. We recognize that the question of whether the transferee superintendent ultimately gives an inmate actual possession of such property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>is a separate issue, dependent upon circumstances not addressed in RCW 72.02.045(3). However, DOC may not impose a requirement that inmates must choose between having to pay shipping costs or losing their ownership.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">B. Burton\u2019s Additional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b615 Burton\u2019s additional claims for due process violations, fraud, conversion, violations of the WCPA, and violations of RICO were initially dismissed by the superior court without discussion based on the incorrect conclusion that Policy 440.000 does not violate RCW 72.02.045(3). While many of these claims may continue to be without merit and subject to CR 12(b)(6) dismissal, remand is appropriate as Burton may wish to move to amend the complaint and conduct discovery, and DOC may wish to file a renewed motion based on the conclusion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b616 We hold that the dismissal of Burton\u2019s claim that DOC Policy 440.000 violates RCW 72.02.045(3) was improper under CR 12(b)(6). The term \u201ctransfer\u201d in RCW 72.02.045(3) includes transfers between DOC institutions. The phrase \u201cdelivered to them\u201d refers to constructive delivery and requires DOC to convey inmate property to the receiving institution free of charge. Thus, under RCW 72.02.045(3), DOC is required to physically convey all the personal property of convicted persons, which is held in the custody of DOC superintendents, to the receiving superintendent when such convicted persons are transferred between DOC institutions. We further hold that the superior court\u2019s dismissal of Burton\u2019s additional claims under CR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>12(b)(6) was inappropriate as it was based solely on an erroneous interpretation of RCW 72.02.045(3). Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Alexander, C.J., and C. Johnson, Sanders, and Chambers, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\"> Effective May 24, 2004, DOC amended its previous policy regarding disposition and transfer of offender property. The notable difference between the old and new versions of the policy is the inclusion of a new section, DOC Policy 440.020, which adds the allowance for personal transport and clothing bags and exempts medically issued items from the two box limit. Since Burton is alleging a continuing harm, as well as past harms, all references to DOC Policy will be to the 2004 policy as the new version does not affect the requirement that inmates pay to ship the items at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\"> An offender is limited to two shipping boxes under 25 pounds in weight that must include legal documents, the inmate\u2019s religious sacred items box, and a valuables envelope. DOC Policy 440.000 \u00a7 IX; DOC Policy 440.020. Medically issued items, a transport bag carrying toiletries, and a state issued clothing bag containing state issued clothing are also transported by DOC and not included in the two box limit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> DOC would have us look to the historical significance of the various statutes superseded by, and consolidated within, RCW 72.02.045(3). Undertaking an analysis of this vague and unpersuasive legislative history might have been an appropriate method of construction if \u201ctransfer\u201d were ambiguous, but it cannot become the cause of such ambiguity where the meaning of the term is already clear. <em>See Biggs, </em>119 Wn.2d at 134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\"> DOC argues that its interpretation of RCW 72.02.045(3) should be given deference as the administering agency. While deference is appropriate if the interpretation reflects a plausible construction of the language of the statute, \u201cthe court is the final authority on statutory construction and it need not approve regulations or decisions inconsistent with a statute.\u201d <em>Moses v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>90 Wn.2d 271, 274, 581 P.2d 152 (1978). DOC\u2019s interpretation is neither consistent with the plain language of RCW 72.02.045(3) nor an official interpretation of that statute. Thus, no deference is due.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b617 (concurring) \u2014 I concur in the result reached by the majority. If we take all facts alleged by the petitioners in their pleadings as true, as CR 12(b)(6) requires, petitioners may have stated a claim for which relief could be granted. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s dismissal was improper. I write separately, however, because I do not believe, as the majority holds, that RCW 72.02.045 requires the Department of Corrections (DOC) to pay for the transport of all inmate personal property upon an inmate\u2019s transfer to a new institution.</p>\n<author id=\"AJf\">Fairhurst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b618 RCW 72.02.045(3) requires the superintendent of each institution to \u201cdeliver [ ]\u201d an inmate\u2019s personal property upon transfer to another institution. It does not require that superintendents <em>pay for the shipment </em>of such property. On its own accord, DOC transports up to two boxes when an inmate is transferred to a new institution. Petitioners assert that DOC\u2019s failure to pay to ship their property in excess of two boxes constitutes a failure to deliver personal property. The heart of the controversy, then, rests on the definition of \u201cdelivered\u201d as it is used in RCW 72.02.045(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b619 I agree with the majority that there can be actual and constructive delivery and that the sort of delivery at issue in this case is constructive because the correctional facility superintendents remain the custodians of inmate personal property. My disagreement with the majority, however, is <em>when and how </em>that delivery occurs. The majority construes delivery to mean that DOC physically transports an inmate\u2019s property\u2014at DOC\u2019s own expense\u2014from one institution to the next. I believe that delivery in the constructive sense is allowing the owners of the property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>designate what happens to their property upon transfer from one facility to the next. Delivery does not require DOC to transport or pay for the shipment of all inmate personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b620 The majority appears to agree that it is the institution superintendents who continue to be the custodians of inmate property. The constructive delivery, then, is following the reasonable instructions of the owners in the potential relocation of their property. This happens at the point when inmates become aware that they will be transferred and continues for 6 or 12 months after the inmates arrive at their new institution. <em>See </em>WAC 137-36-040(3)(a). Inmates have several choices in determining how to manage the disposition of their property. Those choices include paying for the shipment of their property to the receiving institution, paying for shipment of their property to a non-incarcerated individual, deciding to leave their property at their former institution (while recognizing that it will be destroyed or donated within 6 or 12 months), or arranging for someone else to pick up their property within 6 months of transfer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b621 DOC has adopted a regulation providing procedures it must follow when disposing of inmate property that is deemed to be abandoned. WAC 137-36-040. Sufficient process is built into those procedures. <em>Id. </em>Property left unclaimed is not presumed abandoned until six months have passed after an inmate has been transferred. WAC 137-36-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>-040(3)(a). When inmates who have been transferred have no recorded next of kin or other individuals to which unclaimed property can be sent, property is not presumed abandoned for 12 months. <em>Id. </em>Inmates who are transferred have at least 6 months\u2014and in some cases 12 months\u2014to designate disposition of their property. <em>Id. </em>Once inmate property has been \u201cabandoned\u201d within the definitions set forth above, DOC may either destroy the property or donate it to a charitable nonprofit organization. WAC 137-36--040(3)(c). At least 30 days prior to such disposal, however, DOC must give written notice to the owner of its intent to dispose of the property. WAC 137-36-040(3)(e). Not only do inmates have 6 or 12 months to designate the disposition of their property upon transfer to a new institution, including raising money through wages, friends, or family to ship their property to their current location or elsewhere, they also get 30 days\u2019 notice prior to the donation or destruction of the abandoned property. This is sufficient for DOC to have constructively \u201cdelivered\u201d inmate property as set forth in RCW 72.02.045(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b622 Because petitioners allege that DOC forces the choice of payment for shipment or destruction of property and thereby does not allow the option of having friends or relatives pick up their personal property if they are transferred, I would remand the case to the trial court for a factual determination of the issue. If petitioners\u2019 allegations are found to be true, DOC may not have effectively delivered inmate property as required by statute. This is because, as the majority notes, there may be instances where inmates are indigent and unable to pay for the delivery of their property. Majority at 425. The majority also suggests there are instances where inmates would have \u201cno available nonincarcerated persons to take possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioners made no such allegation in their complaint. Regardless, WAC 137-36-040(3)(a) provides that individuals with no recorded next of kin or person to whom unclaimed property can be sent, have 12 months to come up with the funds to ship their property to their present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>institution. Presumably this would also allow inmates 12 months to designate or locate someone to pick up their property. This gives inmates enough control over the fate of their property to constitute constructive delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b623 The law does not require DOC to pay for the transport of inmate property; it merely allows inmates to designate the disposition of their property within reason. Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Madsen and Bridge, JJ., and Ireland, J. Pro Tern., concur with Fairhurst, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> The Court of Appeals found that friends and relatives of inmates were allowed to pick up inmate property but did not cite support for that finding. At oral argument, petitioners argued that friends and relatives were not being allowed to pick up property. DOC responded that it believed such conduct was being allowed, but it was not certain. This is an unresolved question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The parties also discussed during oral argument how inmate property is acquired. DOC asserted that all or almost all inmate property is acquired by inmates through their own funds while incarcerated (and not allowed to be brought to the institution by friends or relatives). The implication, therefore, is that inmates who have funds to purchase property while confined should have the money to ship their property when transferred to another institution. Again, this fact is not reflected in the record and should be developed during a factual hearing. I would hold merely that constructive delivery occurs by giving inmates reasonable choices in the disposition of their property, which does not require DOC to pay for shipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
