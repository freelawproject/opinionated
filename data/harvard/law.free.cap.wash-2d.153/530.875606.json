The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Department, holding the Dickgiesers had failed to establish the \u201cpublic use\u201d element of their inverse condemnation claim. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that the Department\u2019s logging of its land was a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d not a \u201cpublic use.\u201d We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">\u00b62 The Dickgiesers own approximately 12 acres in Jefferson County, adjacent to state forest lands managed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the Department. A stream runs downhill through the Department\u2019s upland property and then through the Dickgiesers\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u00b63 When the Dickgiesers learned that the Department was planning to log its land, the Dickgiesers expressed their concerns to the Department that the logging would cause the stream to flood and cause damage to their property. To allay these concerns and to prevent future problems, the Department agreed to construct safeguards<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the stream bed on the Dickgiesers\u2019 property in exchange for an easement across the Dickgiesers\u2019 property to allow better access to the Department\u2019s upland parcel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement required the Dickgiesers to maintain the stream bed improvements, including the removal of deposited sediments and gravel as needed. Although the Department did construct some safeguards in and around the stream on the Dickgiesers\u2019 property, the Dickgiesers allege that the Department did not do all it promised and that the work was inadequate and incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u00b64 During 1996, the Department logged or allowed logging on its property. During the winter following the logging, the stream on the Dickgiesers\u2019 property overflowed its banks and damaged three homes on their property, the septic system, and the domestic water supply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Dickgiesers claim that since the logging they have experienced flooding every winter and spring. The Dickgiesers\u2019 experts predict repeated, permanent, and chronic flooding of their property as a result of the logging.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u00b65 The Dickgiesers sued the Department for negligence, nuisance, waste, and inverse condemnation. However, because the statute of limitations had run on the negligence and nuisance claims the parties stipulated to the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>of those claims. The trial court dismissed the Dickgiesers\u2019 waste claim because it was time barred and, alternatively, because the pleadings failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. As to the inverse condemnation claim, the trial court observed that the Dickgiesers\u2019 submissions raised \u201cissues of fact regarding whether or not there\u2019s permanent or continuing damage and whether or not such would amount to a constitutional taking and whether there are issues of fact as to whether the State would have the defense provided by the common enemy, outlaw surface water doctrines and so on.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 178. However, the court granted summary judgment to the Department, holding that the Department\u2019s logging activity was not a public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b66 The Dickgiesers appealed the dismissal of their inverse condemnation claim. <em>Dickgieser v. State, </em>118 Wn. App. 442, 443, 76 P.3d 288 (2003). Relying on this court\u2019s analysis in <em>Manufactured Housing Communities of Washington v. State, </em>142 Wn.2d 347, 13 P.3d 183 (2002), the Court of Appeals concluded the Department\u2019s logging of its land provided a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d but was not a \u201c \u2018public use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dickgieser, </em>118 Wn.App. at 447. The court affirmed the summary judgment, holding the Dickgiesers failed to establish the \u201cpublic use\u201d element of its inverse condemnation claim as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 448. The Dickgiesers petitioned for discretionary review. The Building Industry Association of Washington, the Pacific Legal Foundation, and the Fitzpatrick Family have filed amicus briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">17 Washington\u2019s constitution provides that \u201c[n]o private property shall be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation having been first made.\u201d Const, art. I, \u00a7 16. The term \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d is used to describe an action alleging a governmental \u201ctaking\u201d or \u201cdamaging\u201d that is brought to recover the value of property which has been appropriated in fact, but with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>formal exercise of the power of eminent domain. <em>Phillips v. King County, </em>136 Wn.2d 946, 957, 968 P.2d 871, 876 (1998) (quoting <em>Lambier v. City of Kennewick, </em>56 Wn. App. 275, 279, 783 P.2d 596 (1989)); <em>Granite Beach Holdings, L.L.C. v.

App. 186, 205, 11 P.3d 847 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"> \u00b68 The elements required to establish inverse condemnation are: (1) a taking or damaging (2) of private property (3) for public use (4) without just compensation being paid (5) by a governmental entity that has not instituted formal proceedings. <em>Phillips, </em>136 Wn.2d at 957. The taking or damaging of property to the extent that it is reasonably necessary for the maintenance and operation of other property devoted to a public use is a taking or damaging for a public use and subject to the provisions of article I, section 16, of the Washington State Constitution. <em>Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, </em>55 Wn.2d 400, 413, 348 P.2d 664 (1960), <em>overruled on other grounds by Highline Sch. Dist. No. 401 v. Port of Seattle, </em>87 Wn.2d 6, 548 P.2d 1085 (1976); <em>Boitano v. Snohomish County, </em>11 Wn.2d 664, 668, 120 P.2d 490 (1941); <em>Decker v. State, </em>188 Wash. 222, 227, 62 P.2d 35 (1936). In this case the trial court granted summary judgment to the Department because it found the Department\u2019s logging activities did not constitute a public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\u00b6 9 This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here, the Dickgiesers. <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local Union No. 46 v. Trig Elec. Constr. Co., </em>142 Wn.2d 431, 434-35, 13 P.3d 622 (2000); <em>Folsom v. Burger King, </em>135 Wn.2d 658, 663, 958 P.2d 301 (1998). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. CR 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"> \u00b610 The \u201cquestion whether the contemplated use be really public shall be a judicial question.\u201d Const. art I, \u00a7 16; <em>Miller v. City of Tacoma, </em>61 Wn.2d 374, 384, 378 P.2d 464, 470 (1963). Although the legislature may declare that a particular use of property is a \u201cpublic use,\u201d that determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>nation is not dispositive. <em>Hallauer v. Spectrum Props. Inc., </em>143 Wn.2d 126, 139, 18 P.3d 540 (2001). The \u201cwords \u2018public use\u2019 are neither abstractly nor historically capable of complete definition. The words must be applied to the facts of each case in the light of current conditions.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>61 Wn.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u00b611 In affirming the trial court\u2019s conclusion that logging is not a public use, the Court of Appeals reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">[t]he logs themselves were not put to a public use; the land was not used for a public use; the stream revisions were not for a public use (for example, a road or park). Rather, like <em>Manufactured Housing and [In </em>re] <em>City of Seattle, </em>[96 Wn.2d 616, 638 P.2d 549 (1981)], the logging provided a public benefit but was not a public use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\"><em>Dickgieser, </em>118 Wn. App. at 447. \u201cViewed another way,\u201d the court said, \u201cthe Department logged this property to produce income and manage its assets. It did not log the property to create an area for public use. Thus, the logging was not a public use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u00b612 Initially, we note that the Department does not dispute that logging of state forest lands is a public use. Further, the parties did not rely on <em>Manufactured Housing, </em>142 Wn.2d 347 or <em>In re Petition of City of Seattle, </em>96 Wn.2d 616, 638 P.2d 549 (1981) in briefing to the Court of Appeals. In <em>Manufactured Housing </em>we considered whether chapter 59.23 RCW, granting tenants of mobile home parks a right of first refusal when park owners sought to sell, constituted a public use for which compensation should be paid. We held that securing housing for a segment of society might be a public benefit but it did not qualify as a public use since members of the public would be excluded from the park, which would be privately owned by the residents. Although the right to exclude others was discussed, <em>Manufactured Housing </em>does not stand for the proposition that an inverse condemnation occurs only if individual members of the public are entitled to actually use the subject land. To the contrary, public use has been found where the property taken was not open for use to the public. There are many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>examples of public use that do not involve physical use of land by members of the public including: public utilities and the production of hydroelectric power, <em>City of Tacoma v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., 57 </em>Wn.2d 257, 258, 356 P.2d 586 (1960); <em>State ex rel. Northwestern Electric Co. v. Superior Court, </em>28 Wn.2d 476, 183 P.2d 802 (1947); appropriation of water and facilities to generate electrical power to sell to the public, <em>Public Utility District No. 1 of Chelan County v. Washington Water Power Co., </em>43 Wn.2d 639, 262 P.2d 976 (1953); operation of a gravel pit on state lands, <em>Boitano, </em>11 Wn.2d at 668; operation and maintenance of a garbage incinerator, <em>Jacobs v. City of Seattle, </em>93 Wash 171, 177, 160 P. 299 (1916); and construction and operation of sewage disposal plants, <em>Snavely v. City of Goldendale, </em>10 Wn.2d 453, 117 P.2d 221 (1941); <em>Aliverti v. City of Walla Walla, </em>162 Wash. 487, 298 P. 698 (1931); <em>Southworth v. City of Seattle, </em>145 Wash. 138, 259 P. 26 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b613 In contrast to <em>Manufactured Housing </em>and <em>In re City of Seattle, </em>the logging activities in this case were taking place on public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources. Public lands include state forest lands. RCW 79.02.010(9). RCW 79.02.010(10) defines \u201c[s]tate forest lands\u201d as \u201clands acquired under RCW 79.22.010, 79.22.040 and 79.22.020.\u201d Former RCW 79.01.004 (2000) provides that such lands \u201care lands belonging to or held in trust by the state.\u201d Further, RCW 79.22.010 authorizes the Department to acquire land for reforestation and provides that \u201csuch lands shall be held in trust, protected, managed, and administered upon, and the proceeds therefrom disposed of, under RCW 79.22.040.\u201d The Department may contract for timber harvesting and is authorized to sell timber from this process. RCW 79.22.040; RCW 79.15.500. Although members of the public do not physically use state forest lands, and the timber harvested from state forest lands may not be used in building government structures in the same manner as the gravel in <em>Boitano </em>was used to construct roads, the sale of timber is authorized by statute and the proceeds are placed in a contract harvesting revolv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ing account in the custody of the state treasurer and used for state purposes. <em>See generally </em>ch. 79.15 RCW.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u00b614 More importantly, <em>Manufactured Housing </em>and <em>In re City of Seattle </em>are inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. <em>Manufactured Housing </em>involved a constitutional challenge to the statute that granted a right of first refusal to tenants of mobile home parks. The State argued that, rather than invalidating the statute, the appropriate remedy was to require that just compensation be paid for the taking. 142 Wn. 2d at 371. This court rejected the State\u2019s argument, holding the statute resulted in the State\u2019s transferring ownership of the property from one private owner, the park owner, to another private owner, the tenants of the park. This, we held, did not constitute a public use. In <em>In re City of Seattle, </em>96 Wn.2d 616, the City sought to condemn private property to erect an \u201curban shopping center\u201d with facilities that would be leased for private use as retail establishments, restaurants, or theaters. <em>Id. </em>at 633, 634. This court held that the project was primarily a private undertaking and the use was essentially a private one. <em>Id. </em>at 629. We said that while the project provided a public benefit, it did not constitute a public use, and therefore, the City\u2019s power of eminent domain could not be invoked. <em>Id. </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\u00b615 Unlike the circumstances in <em>Manufactured Housing </em>or <em>In re City of Seattle, </em>the Department in this case did not condemn property for the purpose of logging, which it had no authority to do. Rather, the taking alleged here is damage to neighboring land that necessarily resulted from the Department\u2019s logging operations on its own lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">fl6 It is well settled that inverse condemnation can occur where damage to private property results from governmental activity reasonably necessary to the proper maintenance of other property already devoted to a public use, thus satisfying the public use element of the claim. In <em>Decker, </em>188 Wash, at 224, the State cut a roadway across the plaintiff\u2019s property in order to provide water to the State hospital on the adjoining property. This court determined that use of the plaintiff\u2019s property was reasonably neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>sary to the operation and maintenance of the hospital and, thus, a taking for a public use. <em>Decker, </em>188 Wash, at 227. Similarly, in <em>Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, </em>where the court determined that the continuous and frequent low flights over Ackerman\u2019s land amounted to a taking, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">Having the power to acquire an approach way by condemnation, the Port, allegedly, failed to exercise that power, with the result that the appellants\u2019 private airspace is allegedly being used as an approach way, without just compensation first having been paid to them. Clearly, an adequate approach way is as necessary a part of an airport as is the ground on which the airstrip, itself, is constructed, if the private airspace of adjacent landowners is not to be invaded by airplanes using the airport. The taking of an approach way is thus reasonably necessary to the maintenance and operation of the airstrip.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>Ackerman, </em>55 Wn.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u00b617 Finally, in <em>Boitano, </em>this court examined whether Snohomish County had effected a taking of property through its operation of a gravel pit from which it obtained materials for road construction. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">[t]he use of land for a gravel pit by a county of this state is undoubtedly a public use, for, by Rem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \u00a7 6450-9. . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201cWhenever it is necessary to secure any lands . . . for any borrow pit, gravel pit, quarry or other land for the extraction of material for county road purposes or right of way for access thereto, the board of county commissioners is authorized to acquire such lands on behalf of the county by gift, purchase, or condemnation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Boitano, </em>11 Wn.2d at 668. In its analysis, the court discussed several cases in which the operation of an enterprise for the public benefit resulted in damage to adjacent property and thus a compensable taking under article I, section 16. <em>Id. </em>at 672-77. These activities included the operation of an incinerator on public land which caused damage to the adjacent land when garbage was burned, <em>Jacobs, </em>93 Wash. 171, and the operation of sewage treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ment plants near privately owned land, <em>Suavely, </em>10 Wn.2d 453, <em>Southworth, </em>145 Wash. 138, and <em>Aliverti, </em>162 Wash. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u00b618 After concluding that the use of land for a gravel pit by the county constituted a public use, the court addressed the question of whether the flooding of the Boitano property was reasonably necessary to the operation of the County\u2019s gravel pit. <em>Boitano, </em>11 Wn.2d at 671.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">In using appellant\u2019s land for the disposal of the water from its own premises, the county was devoting that land to a public use incidental to its operation of the gravel pit in order to obtain material necessary for the construction and maintenance of its highways. In proceeding as it did, the county was not acting tortiously, or in a negligent manner, but was exercising its power of eminent domain, even though it did not take legal steps to condemn the land before damaging it for a public use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\"><em>Boitano, </em>11 Wn.2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">119 In each of these cases, the damage occurring to private property was reasonably necessary to the proper maintenance of other property already devoted to a public use, and thus, the requirement that the property be taken for a public use was satisfied. Analogous to the statute noted in <em>Boitano, </em>RCW 79.36.310 authorizes the Department to acquire by gift, purchase, exchange, or condemnation, property or use of a road the State considers necessary in order to gain access to state timber lands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This statute indicates that the legislature contemplated the need to use private lands adjacent to state forest lands in order to carry on activities such as logging. We conclude that damage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>private property that is reasonably necessary to log state lands is for a public use, requiring compensation under article I, section 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">\u00b620 The Department argues, however, that the Dickgiesers claimed only that the Department was negligent in logging its own land, and they have not argued that the damage to their property was reasonably necessary to effectuate a public use. The Department says that if the Dickgiesers property was negligently damaged by the careless logging practices of the Department, then the negligent damaging was not a taking of land for anyone\u2019s use because the Department\u2019s interference with the Dickgiesers\u2019 property was not a necessary incident of the state\u2019s activities. Citing <em>Olson v. King County, </em>71 Wn.2d 279, 428 P.2d 562 (1967), the Department argues that every trespass or tortious damaging of real property does not become a constitutional taking or damaging merely because the government is involved. Rather, a taking occurs only if the state\u2019s interference with another\u2019s property is a \u201cnecessary incident\u201d to the public use of the State\u2019s land. <em>Id. </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\u00b621 The Department is correct that governmental torts do not become takings simply because the alleged tortfeasor is the government. <em>N. Pac. Ry. v. Sunnyside Valley Irrigation Dist., </em>85 Wn. 2d 920, 540 P.2d 1387 (1975). However, the Dickgiesers have not simply raised a negligence claim. Although the Department quotes portions of the Dickgiesers\u2019 complaint that, read in isolation, suggest that the Dickgiesers claimed their damages resulted from the Department\u2019s negligent logging of its land, the record as a whole shows their claim of negligence relates to the Department\u2019s alleged negligence in conducting stream bed work on the Dickgiesers\u2019 property, not negligence in logging its own land. The Department\u2019s contention that the Dickgiesers\u2019 inverse condemnation claim is merely a negligence action is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">|22 Moreover, the record contains evidence that the Department did not conduct its logging in a negligent manner and that the increased volume and rapid water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>runoff from the logged land onto the Dickgiesers\u2019 property was an inevitable consequence of logging. The declaration of Joan Dickgieser states that the Department told her it would not address the drainage problems expected as a result of the logging if the Dickgiesers\u2019 did not sign an easement and that the Dickgiesers\u2019 property would be flooded worse than before. In addition, it is undisputed that the logging created changes to surface flows. As the Richard Dyrland affidavit submitted by the Dickgiesers noted, the removal of timber vegetation increased surface runoff by altering the subsurface drainage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">The subsurface drainage was disturbed in the upper part of the watershed by removal of mature tree cover and by ground disturbance through logging by the State of Washington. Removing vegetation from the upper watershed increased the saturation level of soil and subsurface materials in the watershed that was inherently unstable. Increased saturation levels coupled with sustained rainfall further increased the risk of high runoff, slope failure, stream channel erosion and scour.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">CP at 57, Decl. of Dyrland.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\u00b623 The Dickgiesers\u2019 have raised a factual question as to whether the resulting damage to the Dickgiesers\u2019 property was reasonably necessary in order for the Department to log its land.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u00b624 Next, the State contends that because the Dickgiesers\u2019 claim for inverse condemnation is based on surface water flooding, the Dickgiesers also must produce evidence demonstrating that the Department artificially collected, channeled, and discharged surface water onto their property in a manner different from the natural flow, thereby causing substantial injury to the land, citing <em>Phillips v. King County, </em>136 Wn.2d 946, 958-59, 968 P.2d 871 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\u00b625 A governmental body ordinarily is not liable for consequential damages to neighboring properties due to increased surface water flows if the damages arise only from changes in the character of the surface resulting from the opening of streets and public facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 958. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>However, the government may be liable if it concentrates and gathers water into artificial drains or channels and discharges it upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow. 18 Eugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations \u00a7 53.144, at 538 (3d rev. ed. 1963). Further, the flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow on the other\u2019s property. <em>Phillips, </em>136 Wn. 2d at 959. In <em>Wilber Development Corp. v. Les Rowland Construction, Inc., </em>83 Wn. 2d 871, 876, 523 P.2d 186 (1974) this court held that if water is \u201ccollected and deposited upon the land in a different manner\u201d than before development, compensation to the property owner may be required. Thus, in the proper case, damage caused by surface water may support an inverse condemnation action. <em>B&amp;W Constr., Inc. v. City of Lacey, </em>19 Wn. App. 220, 223, 577 P.2d 583 (1978). The record here shows that there are material facts in dispute regarding whether the Department\u2019s logging activity concentrated and gathered water into artificial channels or drains and discharged it onto the Dickgiesers\u2019 land in quantities greater than or in a different manner than the natural flow. <em>See, e.g., </em>CP at 57, Decl. of Dyrland.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\u00b626 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u00b627 Finally, the Dickgiesers\u2019 request reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to RAP 18.1, RCW 8.25.070(4), and <em>Sintra, Inc. v. City of Seattle, </em>131 Wn.2d 640, 666, 668, 935 P.2d 555 (1997). RCW 8.25.070 allows a condemnee to recover attorney and expert witness fees after a trial is held fixing the amount of fees to be awarded. Here, a trial was never held to determine whether the Department took the Dickgiesers\u2019 property, or the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of the fees to be awarded; rather, the trial court dismissed the Dickgiesers\u2019 inverse condemnation claim on summary judgment because it concluded the Department\u2019s logging of public lands was not a public use. Thus, we decline to consider attorney fees at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\u00b628 The Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Alexander, C.J.; C.
