Mohr and Mohr &amp; Company, Inc., d/b/a Kitchen Interior Showcase (hereinafter Mohr or KIS), filed a defamation suit alleging that a series of newscasts aired by petitioners, KXLY-TV and reporter Tom Grant (hereinafter KXLY and Grant), were defamatory because they contained false statements and omitted material facts. The trial court granted KXLY and Grant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Mohr failed to establish falsity with convincing clarity because the newscasts did not contain false statements and the newscasts were substantially true. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Mohr presented sufficient evidence as to whether material omissions rendered the newscasts defamatory. We reverse and grant KXLY and Grant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"A-m\">Fairhurst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">f 2 A lawyer informed Grant that the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office was prosecuting a developmentally disabled man who appeared incapable of understanding the proceedings against him. Grant learned that the man was Glen Burson, a 40 year old with Down\u2019s syndrome who possessed the mental capacity of a 5 year old. Grant reviewed Burson\u2019s court file and photocopied the incident history and incident reports contained therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He used on-line resources to check for pending cases involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Burson, but found none. He spoke with the defense attorney and the disability advocate working on the case. He interviewed Burson as well as his mother, brother, and sister. He contacted the prosecutor working on the case, her supervisor, and Mohr, but they all refused to discuss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">\u00b63 On November 16, 1998, KXLY aired an initial newscast. It opened with references to equal protection and Burson\u2019s having Down\u2019s syndrome. It then turned to the events leading to Burson\u2019s arrest and the negative effects of the prosecution on Burson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">MR. GRANT: Glen walked up to Kitchen Interiors Showcase last April. He had washed windows here before for free, but the owner complained that Glen smudged the glass and told Glen to stay away. Here\u2019s Glen\u2019s account of what happened when he returned in April.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">MR. GLEN BURSON: He did my arm, okay. He did that, (indicating). Then he started to hit me. \u201cGo away.\u201d I am not like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">MR. GRANT: This is the account from the police report. The store owner says that Glen came in wanting candy and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>refused to leave. When the store owner finally got him to go outside Glen was angry and he crossed his throat like this. That scared the owner so they called [the] police. And the police charged him with criminal trespass and harassment, charges that Glen really doesn\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">MR. HOMER BURSON: It kind of bewilders him. He knows that he is in trouble, he is not sure for what. But he knows he can\u2019t go back up there and he won\u2019t ever go back up there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">MR. GLEN BURSON: No, I won\u2019t go there anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">MR. GRANT: Yet even though Burson has no previous criminal history the courts won\u2019t let him go. At one point prosecutors wanted this boy, who has never been away from his mother, locked up for a 14 day evaluation at Eastern State Hospital. As eight months of court dragged by, the usually pudgy Glen lost more than 20 pounds, and he lost all sense of worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">MR. GLEN BURSON: I try to help. I can\u2019t no more, (crying).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 116-18. In the closing segments of the newscast, a former defense attorney commented on the prosecutor\u2019s office and its pursuit of cases that should not be prosecuted. Burson explained that he did not understand the role of a judge. Although the newscast did not identify Mohr by name, it identified KIS and displayed its storefront.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">\u00b64 The day after the initial newscast, Mohr went to work and found three voice mail messages from KXLY viewers who were very upset about his treatment of Burson. Upon receiving approximately 30 similar calls, Mohr scheduled an interview with Grant for that afternoon. During the interview, which lasted about 30 minutes, Mohr explained that Burson had attempted to wash the KIS windows numerous times in the past year and one-half; he asked Burson to stop because he already had a window cleaner, and Burson\u2019s efforts smeared the windows; Burson made many threats of violence against Mohr and his wife; and he was very concerned for the safety of his wife, his customers, and himself. Mohr also explained that he did not have anything against Burson or people with Down\u2019s syndrome and that he tried to drop the charges against Burson.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>\u00b65 KXLY aired a follow-up broadcast on November 17, 1998. It began with a description of the events leading to Burson\u2019s arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">MS. MISHIMA: As news 4 reported last night Glen Burson went to Kitchen Interiors Showcase in the Spokane Valley last April. Burson says he simply asked for some candy but it ended up with some pushing and shoving, leading to Burson\u2019s arrest. Burson who had the mental ability, has the mental ability of a 5 year old describes what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">MR. GLEN BURSON: He got my arm. Okay. He did that. Then he started to hit me. \u201cGo away.\u201d I am not like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">CP at 120. It then discussed Mohr\u2019s side of the story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">MS. MISHIMA: Eliot Mohr, owner of kitchen [sic] Interiors Showcase, declined to discuss the matter prior to the story but since it aired last night he has changed his mind. And he says that Glen came to the store on several occasions and threatened to \u201cPut a bullet in his head,\u201d and he says he was afraid for his wife\u2019s safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-9\">MR. MOHR: All I\u2019ve been trying through all of this is to please have him restrained from being on this property because I was in fear that he could come in when I am not here, and if he had access to a gun or knife or something, that he might be able to do harm to my wife or, Heaven forbid, kill her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">CP at 120-21. In the final segment of the newscast, the newscaster noted that Mohr asked the prosecutor\u2019s office whether he could drop the charges against Burson, but was told it was not possible. The newscast identified Mohr and KIS by name and displayed the KIS storefront.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">\u00b66 KXLY ran a third newscast on November 18, 1998. Burson\u2019s employer commented on Burson\u2019s nonviolent nature. Mohr explained that he attempted to drop the charges against Burson. The newscast identified Mohr and KIS by name and displayed the KIS storefront.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">\u00b67 KXLY ran a final newscast on December 31, 1998. The newscaster explained that the court found Burson incompetent to stand trial and dismissed all charges. The newscast did not identify Mohr or KIS by name, but it displayed the KIS storefront.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">\u00b68 Mohr filed a defamation claim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against KXLY and Grant, alleging that the November 16, 1998, November 17, 1998, and December 31, 1998, newscasts were defamatory because they contained false statements and omitted material facts. The complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">Grant, while acting in the course and scope of his employment as a KXLY employee and KXLY were negligent and acted recklessly when they failed to describe as part of these telecasts the previous incidents and threats that had been made by Burson. <em>Said negligence and reckless conduct constitute defamation, the omission of material facts and is libel by implication by KXLY and Grant regarding the reason Glen Burson was arrested.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">CP at 11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">\u00b69 KXLY and Grant sought summary judgment because the newscasts were substantially true, and they did not act negligently or with actual malice. Mohr responded that the sting of the newscasts was false and that KXLY and Grant acted with negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">\u00b610 Mohr also sought partial summary judgment that the newscasts contained false statements and Mohr is a private person. KXLY and Grant responded that the newscasts contained no false statements. In addition to his own affidavit, Mohr filed a statement by the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the declaration of Greta Boyer, a</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>KXLY viewer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\u00b611 The trial court granted Mohr\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment in part, finding that Mohr was \u201cneither a public nor a vortex public figure.\u201d CP at 188. It denied Mohr\u2019s motion in part, finding that KXLY and Grant did not publish false statements. However, the trial court granted KXLY and Grant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the newscasts did not contain false statements and were substantially true. Mohr appealed. <em>Mohr v. Grant, </em>117 Wn. App. 75, 68 P.3d 1159 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">\u00b612 The Court of Appeals affirmed that the newscasts did not contain false statements but reversed because, \u201cMr. Mohr presented sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on the issue of whether material omissions rendered the otherwise true story false and defamatory with respect to Mr. Mohr.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88. We accepted discretionary review. <em>Mohr v. Grant, </em>noted at 150 Wn.2d 1032 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">III. ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">\u00b613 Whether otherwise true statements created a false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>impression by omission of material facts and therefore resulted in defamation by implication</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">\u00b6 14 \u201cWe review an order of summary judgment de novo and perform the same inquiry as the trial court.\u201d <em>Mulcahy v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash., </em>152 Wn.2d 92, 98, 95 P.3d 313, 316 (2004). Summary judgment is proper if the evidence viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party shows there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. CR 56(c). \u201c[C]onstruing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the court asks whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of that party.\u201d <em>Herron v. KING Broad. Co., </em>112 Wn.2d 762, 767-68, 776 P.2d 98 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">\u00b615 Our court has recognized that summary judgment plays a particularly important role in defamation cases: \u201c \u2018Serious problems regarding the exercise of free speech and free press guaranteed by the First Amendment are raised if unwarranted lawsuits are allowed to proceed to trial. The chilling effect of the pendency of such litigation can itself be sufficient to curtail the exercise of these freedoms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mark v. Seattle Times, </em>96 Wn.2d 473, 485, 635 P.2d 1081 (1981) (quoting <em>Tait v. KING Broad. Co., </em>1 Wn. App. 250, 255, 460 P.2d 307 (1969)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>\u00b616 To survive a defense motion for summary judgment, a defamation plaintiff must allege facts that would raise a genuine issue of fact for the jury as to each element. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 486. The elements a plaintiff must establish in a defamation case are falsity, an unprivileged communication, fault, and damages. <em>Herron, </em>112 Wn.2d at 768; <em>Bender v. City of Seattle, </em>99 Wn.2d 582, 599, 664 P.2d 492 (1983); <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 486; <em>Alpine Indus. Computers, Inc. v. Cowles Publ\u2019g Co., </em>114 Wn. App. 371, 378, 57 P.3d 1178, 64 P.3d 49 (2002); <em>Clardy v. Cowles Publ\u2019g Co., </em>81 Wn. App. 53, 57, 912 P.2d 1078 (1996); <em>Camer v. Seattle PostIntelligencer, </em>45 Wn. App. 29, 36, 723 P.2d 1195 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">117 Case law is unclear as to whether a private plaintiff* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> facing a defense motion for summary judgment must make a prima facie showing of all of the elements of defamation with convincing clarity or by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case does not require us to clarify the issue because the parties before the Court of Appeals agreed that the evidentiary standard is preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The preponderance of the evidence standard requires that the evidence establish the proposition at issue is more probably true than not true. <em>In re Welfare of Sego, </em>82 Wn.2d 736, 739 n.2, 513 P.2d 831 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u00b618 Even under the preponderance of the evidence standard, Mohr has failed to meet his burden as to falsity\u2014the first element of defamation. Falsity in a classic defamation case is a false statement. We are not presented with a classic defamation case because the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s determination on summary judgment that the newscasts contained no false statements. Mohr did not cross-appeal so that issue is not before us. RAP 13.7(b). The Court of Appeals focused on material omissions and concluded that Mohr could proceed to trial because the broadcasts could be found to have had a more \u201cnegative effect\u201d or been \u201cmore damaging\u201d due to the omission of certain facts that may have portrayed Mohr as \u201cless arbitrary and insensitive.\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>117 Wn. App. at 86, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\u00b619 Instead of focusing on material omissions as a new type of defamation, we ask whether under these facts there can be defamation by implication and, if so, what is the proper standard? Questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Sunnyside Valley Irrigation Dist. v. Dickie, </em>149 Wn.2d 873, 880, 73 P.3d 369 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\u00b620 Defamation by implication occurs where \u201cthe defendant juxtaposes a series of facts so as to imply a defamatory connection between them, or creates a defamatory implication by omitting facts.\u201d Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts \u00a7 116, at 117 (W. Page Keeton ed., 5th ed. 1984, Supp. 1988) (footnote omitted). Although the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[n]o Washington case directly addresses the problem of material omissions,\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>117 Wn. App. at 85, this court has recognized instances of defamation by implication.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>\u00b621 We used implication language in <em>Chase v. Daily Record, Inc., </em>83 Wn.2d 37, 515 P.2d 154 (1973). Chase, a port commissioner, was asked to repay funds he received for a trip he never took. <em>Id. </em>at 38. When Chase learned that the defendant intended to print an article on the repayment matter, he issued a statement explaining that he had not received funds for a trip he did not take. <em>Id. </em>The defendant printed the article but omitted Chase\u2019s assertion that he never received money for a trip he never took. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 40. We reversed, finding that Chase presented sufficient evidence as to falsity and fault. <em>Id. </em>at 45. As to falsity, we stated, \u201c[t]he article, taken as a whole, leaves the reader with the clear implication of defalcation of public port monies by a public official,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 44, and the \u201cuse of the word \u2018repayment\u2019 carries a possible implication of an improper receipt and use of public funds and subsequent repayment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u00b622 In another case, we used implication language in establishing the negligence standard for defamation cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">[A] private individual, who is neither a public figure nor official, may recover actual damages for a defamatory falsehood, concerning a subject of general or public interest, where the substance makes substantial dangers to reputation apparent, on a showing that in publishing the statement, the defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>that the statement was false, <em>or would create a false impression in some material respect.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-6\"><em>Taskett v. KING Broad. Co., </em>86 Wn.2d 439, 445, 546 P.2d 81 (1976) (some emphasis omitted). We repeated this implication language in <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">\u00b623 We also used implication language in <em>Herron. </em>There, the defendant published an article falsely asserting that Herron, a county prosecutor, received approximately half of his campaign contributions from bail bondsmen. <em>Herron, </em>112 Wn.2d at 765. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant, finding no jury question was presented on the issue of falsity. <em>Id. </em>at 767. We reversed, finding that the statement that Herron received half of his campaign contributions from bail bondsmen \u201cadded a distinct and separate implication that Herron had bargained away his ethics and integrity in exchange for campaign contributions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 772, and \u201cimplied that Herron had taken a bribe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">\u00b624 This court has stated the plaintiff must show the statement is provably false, either in a false statement or because it leaves a false impression. <em>See Chase, 83 </em>Wn.2d at 38 (false statement); <em>Herron, </em>112 Wn.2d at 774 (false statement); <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 496 (false statement); <em>Taskett, </em>86 Wn.2d at 445 (false statement and in dicta, \u201cor <em>would create a false impression in some material respect\u201d)', Schmalenberg v. Tacoma News, Inc., 87 </em>Wn. App. 579, 590, 943 P.2d 350 (1997) (\u201cFalsity can be express or implied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\"> \u00b625 With respect to falsity, Washington does not require a defamation defendant to \u201cprove the literal truth of every claimed defamatory statement.\u201d <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 494. \u201cA defendant need only show that the statement is substantially true or that the gist of the story, the portion that carries the \u2018sting\u2019, is true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe \u2018sting\u2019 of a report is defined as the gist or substance of a report when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Herron, </em>112 Wn.2d at 769. In applying this test, we require plaintiffs to show that the false statements caused harm distinct from the harm caused by the true portions of a communication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Moreover, Mark has provided no evidence that the inaccurate statements caused him any further damage than has resulted from the conviction and sentence on a grand larceny charge. While we have considerable sympathy with Mark\u2019s wish to protect his reputation, we are of the opinion that the errors here under review did not materially add to the damage suffered by Mark by reason of the truthful publication of matters relating to the charge and conviction for grand larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 496 (footnote omitted). Stated another way, \u201c[w]here a report contains a mixture of true and false statements, a false statement (or statements) affects the \u2018sting\u2019 of a report only when \u2018significantly greater opprobrium\u2019 results from the report containing the falsehood than would result from the report without the falsehood.\u201d <em>Herron, </em>112 Wn.2d at 769 (quoting <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">\u00b626 In his briefing Mohr asserted (without citation) that the sting is a question for the jury. The Court of Appeals agreed, citing a case from another jurisdiction. <em>Mohr, </em>117 Wn. App. at 86 (citing <em>Fleckenstein v. Friedman, </em>266 N.Y. 19, 23, 193 N.E. 537 (1934)). However, this court or the trial court, not the jury, determined the gist of reports in at least two seminal defamation cases. <em>See Herron, </em>112 Wn.2d at 769-70; <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 495-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\u00b627 The parties disagree about the gist or the sting of the newscast. Mohr asserted that the gist of the newscast was \u201cthat Eliot Mohr caused the arrest of a developmentally disabled individual because the individual came into Eliot Mohr\u2019s store to ask for candy.\u201d He states this leaves a false impression. Answer of Eliot Mohr and Mohr &amp; Co., Inc., to Br. of Amici Curiae at 2. Grant asserted that \u201c[t]he gist of the story. . . [was] that the County was using taxpayer resources to prosecute a developmentally disabled man, based on charges brought by the owners of the Kitchen Interior Showcase business.\u201d CP at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">\u00b628 Mohr argues that his actions would be more understandable or sympathetic if omitted facts had been included. The Court of Appeals in reversing stated, \u201c[w]e cannot say that no reasonable jury could find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>omitted facts would have placed the events of April 30 in a context in which the Mohrs\u2019 conduct would appear less arbitrary and insensitive than in the story as broadcast.\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>117 Wn. App. at 88. Arbitrariness and insensitivity are not the test. What is necessary is a provably false impression which is contradicted by inclusion of omitted facts. Even adopting Mohr\u2019s gist, the inclusion of the facts of the prior history between Burson and Mohr that were known or reasonably known to Grant would not necessarily contradict the alleged false impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u00b629 To survive a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing as to all the defamation elements. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 486. In a defamation by omission case, the plaintiff must show with respect to the element of falsity that the communication left a false impression that would be contradicted by the inclusion of omitted facts. Merely omitting facts favorable to the plaintiff or facts that the plaintiff thinks should have been included does not make a publication false and subject to defamation liability. The Fifth Circuit rejected a defamation plaintiff\u2019s claim that a news report was misleading because the broadcaster did not include all the potentially relevant information about the plaintiff. <em>Green v. CBS Inc., </em>286 F.3d 281 (5th Cir. 2002). The <em>Green </em>court found that since \u201cCBS accurately reported the facts, albeit not all of the facts, whether or not the story painted [the plaintiff] in an attractive light is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285. The court held that even though including more facts would have led to a more balanced report, the broadcast did not create a false impression and thus was not defamatory. <em>Id.; see also Peter Scalamandre &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Kaufman, </em>113 F.3d 556, 563 (5th Cir. 1997) (omission of footage that would have portrayed subject in a more favorable light insufficient to establish actionable falsity because it \u201cis common knowledge television programs . . . shoot more footage than necessary and edit the tape they collect down to a brief piece.\u201d); <em>Janklow v. Newsweek, Inc., </em>759 F.2d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 1985) (rejecting claim to hold magazine liable \u201cfor omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>of those additional facts that [the plaintiff! believes should have been published, but whose omission did not make what was published untrue\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d on reh\u2019g, </em>788 F.2d 1300 (1986); <em>UTV of San Antonio, Inc. v. Ardmore, Inc., </em>82 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. Ct. App. 2002) (no defamatory false impression where television report omitted facts favorable to plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">\u00b630 A prime example of defamation by implication caused by certain material omissions is found in the case of <em>Memphis Publishing Co. v. Nichols, </em>569 S.W.2d 412, 419 (Tenn. 1978). There, the Tennessee Supreme Court found that a newspaper\u2019s report that a woman shot her husband and another woman after finding them together in the second woman\u2019s living room was defamatory because its \u201cclear implication\u201d was that the two were having an affair. <em>Id. </em>The report omitted the fact that the two were not alone and that several others were in the same room during the wife\u2019s attack. The court stated, \u201c[t]he proper question is whether the <em>meaning </em>reasonably conveyed by the published words is defamatory, \u2018whether the libel as published would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420 (quoting <em>Fleckenstein, </em>266 N.Y. at 23). In applying this rule, the court held that \u201c[t]he publication of the complete facts could not conceivably have led the reader to conclude\u201d that the plaintiff was having an affair. <em>Id. </em>at 420. In <em>Nichols, </em>the implication was clear and it was false. The omitted information would have negated the defamatory implication in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u00b631 Here, the omitted information would not have negated the asserted defamatory implication in its entirety. Mohr argues that the November 16, 1998, November 17, 1998, and December 31, 1998, newscasts caused a clear false implication based on Boyer\u2019s declaration and the statement from the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. His reliance on these documents is misplaced for two reasons. First, both documents are based solely on the</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>November 16, 1998, newscast.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The subsequent newscasts negated any such impression because they reported Mohr\u2019s side of the story, along with many of the facts mentioned in Boyer\u2019s declaration and the statement of the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. In the November 17, 1998, newscast, for example, a reporter explained that Burson came to KIS on several occasions, Burson threatened to put a bullet in Mohr\u2019s head, and Mohr was concerned for his wife\u2019s safety. Mohr also explained that his goal was to have Burson merely restrained from coming to KIS because he was afraid that Burson might harm his wife. In the closing segments, a reporter noted that Mohr asked whether he could drop the charges against Burson but was told that it was not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">\u00b632 Second, Mohr\u2019s reliance on Boyer\u2019s declaration and the statement of the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office is misplaced because both documents rely on events that Grant was unaware of at the time of the first newscast. Before the first newscast aired, Grant contacted the prosecutor working on the case, her supervisor, and Mohr, but they all refused to discuss the case. Accordingly, the only information Grant had, and the only information we can reasonably find him accountable for, is the information contained in the court file and interviews he was able to conduct. Those sources did not reveal many of the events referenced in Boyer\u2019s declaration and the statement of the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. They did not state that Burson attempted to strike Mohr one year before the arrest, did not explain that Burson physically attacked Mohr\u2019s truck, and did not reveal seven or eight incidents in which Burson came to KIS and became confrontational.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">\u00b633 Mohr has not made a prima facie showing that the communication left a false impression that would be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>tradicted by the inclusion of omitted facts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Court of Appeals\u2019 standard of \u201cless arbitrary and insensitive\u201d is not the correct test by which to measure defamation by implication caused by omitted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">\u00b634 Mindful of the competing interests underlying defamation cases, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment to KXLY and Grant because Mohr has not made a threshold showing of defamation by implication because he did not show falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Sanders and Owens, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\"> The incident history and incident reports reflected three complaints made by Mohr and his wife Louise. On October 9, 1997, Louise complained that Burson came to KIS, wanted to take a picture of her, got very aggressive, called her names, made assault threats, and refused to leave. Louise told the responding officer that Burson visited KIS on a regular basis and bothered people. She requested that an officer tell Burson to stop coming to KIS. An officer found Burson near his home. The officer advised Burson that the Mohrs did not want him cleaning their windows and that he could be arrested for criminal trespass if he returned to KIS. Burson stated he understood he could go to jail. The officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>entered the call into the incident history but did not prepare an incident report or cite or arrest Burson.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">On January 8, 1998, Mohr complained that he saw Burson cleaning the KIS windows when he pulled into the KIS parking lot. When Mohr turned his headlights on Burson, Burson rode away on his bicycle. Mohr saw signs that Burson had cleaned his windows several times since October, but this was the first time he actually saw Burson cleaning the windows. The incident report noted that Burson had cleaned the windows several times in the past and that Mohr had told him many times not to do so because his efforts smudged the windows. The incident history states that Burson has trespassed in the past, refers to him as \u201cthe retarded person who goes around washing windows with out permission,\u201d and who has \u201cthreatened [Mohr\u2019s] life.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 50. The incident report characterized Burson\u2019s actions as second degree criminal trespass, but the responding officer did not cite or arrest Burson.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">On April 30, 1998, Mohr complained that Burson entered the KIS showroom and ignored requests that he leave. When Louise said she was going to call the police, Burson said he did not care, and he was \u201cgoing to get even.\u201d CP at 48. Burson went outside, threw his bicycle on the ground, made slashing motions across his throat, and reentered the IQS showroom. Mohr again told him to leave. When the responding officer arrived, the Mohrs explained that Burson previously threatened to put a bullet in Mohr\u2019s head, they were alarmed and frightened by Burson\u2019s threats, and they were uncertain what Burson might do. Burson said he knew he should not be at KIS, and he threatened the Mohrs because he was mad. The officer arrested Burson, cited him with harassment and first degree trespass, drove him home, and filed an incident report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-10\"> His complaint also included a false-light invasion of privacy claim which Mohr subsequently waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b857-11\"> The prosecutor\u2019s office issued a statement on November 17, 1998, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMQ\">It is unfortunate that this case, which is far from being resolved, has become distorted by a news-report which can only be characterized as one-sided. Had the report accurately noted the underlying facts of the charge, including the death threats involving the use of a gun, perhaps the fears of the victims and the concerns of the prosecutor\u2019s office about pubhc safety would have been better shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">CP at 176-77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\"> Boyer visited KIS on November 17, 1998, and spoke with Mohr in order to determine why he feared a person with Down\u2019s syndrome. According to her affidavit, Boyer\u2019s discussion with Mohr left her with a different impression:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">8. When I arrived a[t] Kitchen/Interior Showcase I learned a much different account of the events that lead to the arrest of Mr. Burson. I learned immediately that my impression from the November 16, 1998 telecasts were false. I learned that Mr. Mohr did not have a fear of Down\u2019s Syndrome but that he was emotionally tom between restraining Mr. Burson from his property and protecting his and his wife\u2019s personal safety. I learned of the numerous threats Mr. Burson had made against Mr. Mohr including the threats to put a bullet in his head, to cut his throat, to kill him, and to get even. I learned that Mr. Burson had attempted to strike Mr. Mohr just over one year earlier, and that Mr. Burson had physically attacked Mr. Mohr\u2019s truck on a prior occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">9. I was surprised to learn that the Mohrs had contacted the sheriff\u2019s department with regard to Mr. Burson\u2019s threats on two prior occasions in 1997 and 1998, neither of which resulted in arrest. I was surprised to learn that Mr. Burson was trespassed from [sic] the business property by the sheriff\u2019s department, but that he returned on April 30, 1998, nonetheless. KXLY and Tom Grant\u2019s omission of these facts created a false impression in my mind. Had I been privy to the actual history between the [sic] Glen Burson and the Mohr\u2019s [sic] I would not have been so upset with Eliot Mohr.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">CP at 158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\"> Competing interests underlie all defamation cases. The protection of First Amendment freedoms of speech and press compete with the protection of an individual\u2019s reputation via state defamation law. The United States Supreme Court articulated the tension between these interests in cases involving public issues, for example, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">[Cases of the Court] establishing First Amendment protection for defendants in defamation actions surely demonstrate the Court\u2019s recognition of the Amendment\u2019s vital guarantee of free and uninhibited discussion of public issues.

Given the agreement on the evidentiary standard, the parties necessarily did not make this argument below nor are they making it before this court. We save for another day our review of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\"> Similarly, while the United States Supreme Court has not explicitly recognized defamation by implication, the Court pointed toward its actionability in <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 18-19. In <em>Milkovich, </em>the respondent published an article implying that the petitioner lied under oath during a judicial proceeding. 497 U.S. at 3. The Court characterized the issue as \u201cwhether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statements in the [article] imply an assertion that petitioner Milkovich perjured himself in a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. The Court answered this question affirmatively, stating, \u201c[t]his is not the sort of loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language which would negate the impression that the writer was seriously maintaining that petitioner committed the crime of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Nor does the general tenor of the article negate this impression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">At least one federal court and one state court have relied on <em>Milkovich </em>for the proposition that the United States Supreme Court recognizes defamation by-implication. <em>See Toney v.

KING Broad. Co., </em>86 Wn.2d 439, 458, 546 P.2d 81 (1976) (Horowitz, J., dissenting). The defendant, however, could raise two affirmative defenses: truth or privilege. <em>Taskett, </em>86 Wn.2d at 458; <em>see also </em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts 802, 815 (W. Page Keeton ed., 5th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">\u00b639 In 1964 the United States Supreme Court concluded that the first amendment to the United States Constitution gave a higher degree of protection to free speech than was consistent with common law defamation. <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 280, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964). Under <em>New York Times, </em>a public official may not recover damages for defamation unless \u201cactual malice\u201d (which includes knowledge or reckless disregard of the falsity of the alleged defamatory statement) is proved. <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 280. The Supreme Court drew a large circle around speech to protect the right to speak freely; however, certain defamatory speech fell outside the circle of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">\u00b640 Since <em>New York Times, </em>courts have struggled to balance the First Amendment rights of the press with the appropriate protection of private individuals harmed by false and irresponsible reporting. In <em>Gertz, </em>the Court articulated the appropriate approach when a private person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>brings a defamation action against a publisher. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974). The Court concluded that the First Amendment did not require a private person to show actual knowledge of falsehood, or even mere recklessness to the truth, before an injury to reputation caused by negligent publishing could be redressed in a defamation suit. <em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 342, 347-48. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reinstated a jury verdict in a defamation action brought by an attorney against a national newspaper. <em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 329, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\u00b641 In <em>Gertz, </em>the newspaper had published a story asserting the attorney was part of a worldwide communist conspiracy to destroy local police and substitute a national police force as part of an alleged planned communist take over of the United States. However, the article was a flight of fancy, apparently rooted in the bare fact that the attorney represented a family in a wrongful death action against a police officer who had been convicted of murder. <em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 325-27. While the attorney could not prove that the publisher had actual malice (since the publisher said he accepted the article without checking any of the facts), he could prove that the allegations were patently false and published negligently. The Supreme Court concluded that the First Amendment did not require a private person to prove actual malice to prevail. <em>See Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\u00b642 In the absence of an actual malice standard, courts and legislatures have articulated a variety of standards perceived necessary to balance the interests of a free and vigorous news media against the individual\u2019s right to be free from false and defamatory reports. This court articulated the governing principles in <em>Mark v. Seattle Times, </em>96 Wn.2d 473, 635 P.2d 1081 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">\u00b643 <em>Mark, </em>a case similar to the one before us today, involved the reporting by Seattle media on charges concerning Medicaid fraud. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 476. The media, which had been invited to a press conference by the prosecutor, reported the fraud indictment and trial widely and relied in part upon affidavits of probable cause and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>court documents. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 476-81. Mark, who was found guilty of Medicaid fraud after several of the widely publicized charges were dropped, brought a defamation action against several publishers. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 476-82. We concluded that a private person, resisting a defense motion for summary judgment in a defamation case, must establish a prima facie case by convincing clarity. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 487, 489. This heightened standard is the concession defamation law makes to the First Amendment. <em>See Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 485. I do not read the majority to alter that standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Once falsity is established by convincing clarity, the burden is upon the media defendant to \u201cshow that the statement is substantially true or that the gist of the story, the portion that carries the \u2018sting\u2019, is true.\u201d <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 494 (citing William L. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts 798 (4th ed. 1971)); <em>Taskett, </em>86 Wn.2d at 443 (statement defamatory only if the \u201csubstance of the statement\u201d is likely to harm a reputation).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"> \u00b644 I agree with my colleagues that falsity may be established by implication and that the omission of facts may result in defamation by implication. <em>See </em>majority at 823, 826-27. But I agree with the Court of Appeals that Eliot Mohr points to numerous discrete historical facts which, if believed, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that KXLY-TV knew and purposely omitted facts from its story that slanted coverage. Under the story told by KXLY, it appeared that a developmentally challenged man wandered into Mohr\u2019s store seeking to wash windows, and Mohr\u2019s response was to assault the man and prosecute him for criminal trespass and harassment. <em>See Mohr v. Grant, </em>117 Wn. App. 75, 86, 68 P.3d 1159 (2003); <em>cf. </em>majority at 815 n.1. If the facts relied upon by Mohr are believed, he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>established the element of falsity by convincing clarity. The burden would then shift to KXLY to establish that the gist or sting of the story was true. <em>Mark, </em>96 Wn.2d at 494. I disagree with the majority that this is a question of law when reasonable minds can differ. <em>Contra </em>majority at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">\u00b645 KXLY does not show, as a matter of law, that the gist of this story was true. It does not meet its burden. KXLY relies only on the truth of the factual statements made to argue that its reports were factually accurate, even in their implications. Mohr\u2019s evidence is sufficient to defeat summary judgment on the issue of whether material omissions rendered the otherwise true story false and defamatory, and KXLY has failed to show that the gist or sting of the story was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\u00b646 Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals and reverse summary judgment.
