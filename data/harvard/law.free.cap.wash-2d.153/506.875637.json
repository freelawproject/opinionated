We hold that Kitsap County Code (KCC) 17.445.070(C), as applied to the Mattress Outlet raincoats, is an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech. Therefore, we reverse the superior court and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the citation issued to Mattress Outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b62 Petitioner Mattress Outlet operates a retail mattress business in various locations throughout the state, including a store in Silverdale in Kitsap County. Kevin Gould is the director of operations and the general manager responsible for the Silverdale store. One of Mattress Outlet\u2019s advertising techniques is to pay independent contractors, who wear yellow, oversized raincoats that display Mattress Outlet\u2019s name, address, and telephone number, to stand on public sidewalks and wave to passersby. Mattress Outlet also sells these raincoats at its stores, along with hats, t-shirts, and other items advertising Mattress Outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b63 On October 24, 2001, a Kitsap County Code Enforcement Officer cited Mattress Outlet for using raincoat-clad workers as \u201can offsite sign without a permit\u201d in violation of KCC 17.445.010 and 17.445.070(C). Clerk\u2019s Papers 49-52, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u00b64 The district court found the sign ordinances unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, as well as an unconstitutional restriction of free speech as applied to the raincoats used by Mattress Outlet. The district court dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>violations. The county appealed to the superior court, which reversed, ruling that the statute was not vague, that Mattress Outlet did not have standing to challenge the ordinance on overbreadth grounds, and that the commercial speech restrictions were constitutional as applied to Mattress Outlet. We granted Mattress Outlet\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b65 Municipal ordinances are interpreted using the same rules as state statutes. <em>City of Spokane v. Douglass, </em>115 Wn.2d 171, 177, 795 P.2d 693 (1990). The constitutionality of a statute or ordinance is an issue of law, which we review de novo. <em>Ino Ino, Inc. v. City of Bellevue, </em>132 Wn.2d 103, 114, 937 P.2d 154, 943 P.2d 1358 (1997). A duly enacted ordinance is presumed constitutional, and the party challenging it must demonstrate that the ordinance is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Douglass, </em>115 Wn.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b66 Mattress Outlet contends that under the plain language of the sign code, its raincoats are not signs and, therefore, are not subject to the sign ordinance. Kitsap County contends that the raincoats are signs, as described by the nonexclusive list of portable signs regulated by the sign ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b67 The Kitsap County ordinance defines a \u201csign\u201d as \u201ca collection of letters, numbers or symbols which calls attention to a business, product, activity, person, or service.\u201d KCC 17.110.675. A \u201cportable sign\u201d is defined as one \u201cwhich has no permanent attachment to a building or the ground which include [s], but is not limited to, A-frame, pole attachment, banners and reader board signs.\u201d KCC 17.110.620.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u00b68 The ordinance requires a permit to display a sign, unless the sign is exempt. KCC 17.445.010. Signs exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>from the regulations include traffic, street, and legal signs; \u201cfor sale\u201d and \u201cfor rent\u201d signs; official community festival signs; and certain signs placed by governmental agencies. KCC 17.445.080. Other signs are conditionally exempt from the sign code, and they include \u201chelp wanted\u201d signs, restroom signs, political campaign signs, garage and yard sale signs, subdivision signs, and certain A-board signs. KCC 17.445.090. The sign code prohibits offsite signs, providing that \u201c[bjillboards and signs not directing attention to products or services available on the premises where the sign is situated are prohibited.\u201d KCC 17.445.070(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b69 Mattress Outlet argues that its raincoats are not signs under the ordinance. Mattress Outlet contends that the raincoats are apparel, and apparel is not regulated by the ordinance. Mattress Outlet points out that the ordinance\u2019s examples of portable signs are <em>fixtures to land, </em>such as an A-frame or a pole. Mattress Outlet argues that the ordinance does not speak to something <em>worn </em>by a person. Kitsap County, on the other hand, argues that the raincoats worn by Mattress Outlet workers are not ordinary clothing and \u201care nothing more than a sandwich board sign,\u201d which falls within the nonexclusive list of portable signs such as A-frame and reader board signs. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">f 10 Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoats are not ordinary raincoats. The raincoats display the name, phone number, and address of Mattress Outlet in large letters and also state, \u201c1/2 PRICE MATTRESS SALE.\u201d The parties agree that the raincoats display a collection of letters and numbers, as referenced in the ordinance\u2019s definition of a sign. Unlike ordinary raincoats, these coats are reinforced to make them rigid and flat for the purpose of making the message more readable. The wearer appears to be encased in a large, rectangular structure rather than to be wearing a piece of clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b6[11 The wearers are paid contractors hired for the sole purpose of displaying the Mattress Outlet advertising message. The parties agree that the raincoats are intended \u201cto call attention to\u201d the Mattress Outlet store, as stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ordinance\u2019s definition of a \u201csign.\u201d KCC 17.110.675. The Mattress Outlet raincoats are worn in all types of weather; their purpose is unrelated to the purpose of ordinary apparel. Therefore, the raincoats fit within the definition of a sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">f 12 In addition, the raincoats reasonably fall within the definition of a portable sign, which includes A-frame and reader board signs. Even if the raincoats did not fall within the specific classifications of A-frames and reader board signs, the list of portable signs in the code is expressly nonexclusive. The raincoat is designed to function as a retail sign, and mounting the advertising message on the raincoat rather than cardboard or other material does not obscure the raincoat\u2019s character as a sign. Therefore, we hold that the Mattress Outlet raincoats are signs subject to the Kitsap County sign ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b613 We now turn to the question of whether KCC 17.445.070(C) is an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech as applied to Mattress Outlet. The First Amendment to the federal constitution (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment) provides that \u201c[c]ongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. I. Our state constitution protects freedom of speech, guaranteeing that \u201c[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.\u201d Const., art. I \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b614 Commercial speech \u201cpropose [s] a commercial transaction.\u201d <em>United States, v. Edge Broad. Co., </em>509 U.S. 418, 426, 113 S. Ct. 2696, 125 L. Ed. 2d 345 (1993). It is \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\u201d <em>Cent. Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 U.S. 557, 561, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980). The constitution allows greater governmental regulation of commercial speech because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>commercial speech has a great potential to mislead and because the state has an interest in protecting the public from those seeking to obtain the public\u2019s money. <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., </em>514 U.S. 476, 495, 115 S. Ct. 1585, 131 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1995); <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Retired Persons v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>120 Wn.2d 101, 114, 838 P.2d 680 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b615 On the other hand, society has a strong interest in preserving the free flow of commercial information. <em>Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 763, 96 S. Ct. 1817, 48 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1976). As the Court has stated, a \u201c \u2018particular consumer\u2019s interest in the free flow of commercial information . . . may be as keen, if not keener by far, than his interest in the day\u2019s most urgent political debate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coors Brewing, </em>514 U.S. at 481-82 (quoting <em>Va. Citizens Consumer Council, </em>425 U.S. at 763). The \u201cgeneral rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented.\u201d <em>Edenfield v. Fane, </em>507 U.S. 761, 767, 113 S. Ct. 1792, 123 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b616 A four-part test determines whether commercial speech restrictions are permissible. <em>Cent. Hudson, </em>447 U.S. 557. The <em>Central Hudson </em>test asks (1) whether the speech concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading, (2) whether the government\u2019s interest is substantial, (3) whether the restriction directly and materially serves the asserted interest, and (4) whether the restriction is no more extensive than necessary. The party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it. <em>Thompson v. W. States Med. Ctr., </em>535 U.S. 357, 122 S. Ct. 1497, 152 L. Ed. 2d 563 (2002); <em>Ino Ino, </em>132 Wn.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b617 In this case, the first two prongs are undisputed. The parties agree that the first prong is satisfied because the mattress sales are lawful and the advertisement is not misleading. They also agree that the second prong is satisfied because the government has a substantial interest in traffic safety and aesthetics. <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 507-08, 101 S. Ct. 2882, 69 L. Ed. 2d 800 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b618 The parties disagree as to the third and fourth prongs of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. These prongs involve a consideration of the \u201cfit\u201d between the legislature\u2019s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends. <em>Edge, </em>509 U.S. at 427-28 (quoting <em>Posadas de Puerto Rico Assocs. v. Tourism Co. of P.R., </em>478 U.S. 328, 341, 106 S. Ct. 2968, 92 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b619 The third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test requires Kitsap County to show that the ordinance directly and materially serves the governmental interests. <em>Edenfield, </em>507 U.S. at 767. The burden is not satisfied by \u201c \u2018mere speculation and conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, </em>533 U.S. 525, 555, 121 S. Ct. 2404, 150 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2001) (quoting <em>Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 173, 188, 119 S. Ct. 1923, 144 L. Ed. 2d 161 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b620 Mattress Outlet contends this case is similar to <em>City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., </em>507 U.S. 410, 113 S. Ct. 1505, 123 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1993), in which the Supreme Court struck down a municipal regulation as an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech. Discovery Network published a free magazine advertising adult programs, which was dispensed from freestanding newsracks placed on city sidewalks. The city ordered Discovery Network to remove its newsracks pursuant to an ordinance prohibiting distribution of commercial handbills on the public right of way. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 415. The city stated that the goal of the regulation was to ensure safe streets and regulate visual blight.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b621 The Supreme Court held that the prohibition of commercial newsracks failed the third and fourth prongs of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. The Court noted that of the approximately 1,500 to 2,000 newsracks in the city, only 62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>were commercial racks prohibited by the regulation. Therefore, the regulation would have only a minimal effect on safety and aesthetics. While the Court agreed with the city\u2019s argument that an incremental decrease in newsracks provides an incremental increase in aesthetics and safety, that \u201cpaltry\u201d benefit was not material enough to justify the restriction of Discovery Network\u2019s First Amendment rights. A minimal benefit will not support a restriction of free speech. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b622 The Court also held that the regulation was not a reasonable means of achieving its stated goals of safety and aesthetics. The commercial newsracks were no more harmful than the noncommercial newsracks. The Court cautioned against placing too much importance on the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech, especially where the distinction bears no relationship to the particular interests asserted by the city. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 424. Because commercial and noncommercial newsracks were equally offensive and dangerous, the commercial/noncommercial distinction was an impermissible basis upon which to regulate the newsracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b623 Here, as in <em>Discovery Network, </em>prohibiting persons from wearing signage provides minimal, if any, benefit in aesthetics and safety. There is no evidence that the Mattress Outlet signs have any effect on traffic safety. Mere speculation of harm will not justify a limitation on the exercise of the right of free speech. <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of N.Y., </em>447 U.S. 530,100 S. Ct. 2326, 65 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1980). As to the goal of aesthetics, the raincoat-clad workers are not the type of signage generally thought of as contributing to visual blight. Accordingly, the county has failed to affirmatively establish that its restriction materially and directly advances its interests in aesthetics and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">f 24 Likewise, we hold that the Kitsap County ordinance fails to meet the fourth prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. Under the fourth prong, we examine the means chosen to accomplish the government\u2019s asserted interest. <em>Discovery </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>Network, </em>507 U.S. at 416. The county bears the burden of establishing that the restrictions are no more extensive than necessary to serve the county\u2019s stated interests. <em>Cent. Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 566. The restriction must be narrowly tailored. <em>Bd. of Trs. v. Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 480, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 106 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1989). While the means chosen need not be the least restrictive means, the fit between the means chosen and the interests asserted must be reasonable. <em>Coors Brewing, </em>514 U.S. at 491. The existence of numerous and obvious less burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech is relevant in reviewing the reasonability of the means chosen. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 416 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b625 Here, as in <em>Discovery Network, </em>the Kitsap County ordinance distinguishes between commercial and noncommercial speech, although that distinction does not bear any relationship to the county\u2019s interests in aesthetics and safety. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 424. As in <em>Discovery Network, </em>the offsite signs prohibited by the Kitsap County ordinance are no more hazardous to traffic and no more aesthetically offensive than many of the signs exempted from the ordinance, such as farm produce signs, yard sale signs, and special event signs for holiday bazaars.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b626 The Kitsap County sign ordinance reaches further than necessary to achieve goals of aesthetics and safety. The total ban of offsite advertising under KCC 17-.445.070(C) does not reflect any method of narrowly tailoring the restriction to meet the specific goals of increased safety and aesthetics. For example, if traffic safety is a concern, then the county can designate restrictions as to place and time, without completely prohibiting this method of advertising. At a minimum, the county restrictions could be narrowly tailored so as to accommodate the reasonable use of apparel displays. As it is, the offsite advertising ban burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b627 The county has failed to demonstrate that a total ban of offsite advertising is a reasonable method of achiev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ing its goals. Therefore, we hold that KCC 17.445.070(C) fails the fourth prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b628 Accordingly, we hold that KCC 17.445.070(C) of the Kitsap County sign ordinance is an unconstitutional restriction of free speech as applied to the commercial speech of Mattress Outlet. The decision of the superior court is reversed. The citation was against Mattress Outlet were properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Sanders, Chambers, and Owens, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\"> Justice Faith Ireland is serving as a justice pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Washington State Constitution article TV, section 2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> Although our state constitution may be more protective of free speech than the federal constitution, it is unnecessary to consider a state constitutional analysis because KCC 17.445.070(C) fails the minimum protection provided under the federal constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> Because of our holding, it is unnecessary to decide Mattress Outlet\u2019s arguments that the ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b629 (concurring in result) \u2014 I concur in the result the majority reaches. I write separately simply to express my view that it is unnecessary for us to reach the constitutional issue that the majority and dissent discuss at length. I reach this conclusion because it is apparent from the record that Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoats do not fall within the definition of a \u201cportable sign.\u201d Such a sign is defined in Kitsap County\u2019s ordinance as one \u201cwhich has no permanent attachment to a building or the ground which include [s], but is not limited to, A-frame, pole attachment, banners and reader board signs.\u201d Kitsap County Code (KCC) 17.110.620. While I readily concede that the raincoats in question are not permanently attached to any building or the ground, they do not resemble any of the specific items listed in the ordinance. This is significant because there is a well known canon of construction known as \u201cejusdem generis,\u201d which provides that when a general term is in sequence with specific terms, the general term is restricted to items similar to the specific terms.</p>\n<author id=\"Anx\">Alexander, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b630 While one could posit that I am engaging too narrow a reading of Kitsap County\u2019s sign ordinance, I would respond that the majority\u2019s broad interpretation of the term \u201cportable sign\u201d is problematic. This is so because it is common today to see persons wearing all manner of clothing that conspicuously contains the name or trademark of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the manufacturer or that of another business enterprise such as a sporting enterprise\u2014a NASCAR<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> driver\u2019s uniform comes readily to mind. While this type of clothing may impart a more subtle commercial message than do Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoats, the effect is the same and that is to call \u201cattention to a business, product, activity, person or service.\u201d KCC 17.110.675. I believe that we can reasonably assume from the wording of the Kitsap County ordinance that it was not intended to sweep within its reach so much commonly worn apparel.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b631 In sum, because the Mattress Outlet raincoats are not signs under the ordinance in question, the wearing of them is not unlawful.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b632 (concurring) \u2014 I concur.

Spears, </em>134 Wn.2d 141, 159, 949 P.2d 347 (1998) (citing <em>City of Spokane v. Douglass, </em>115 Wn.2d 171, 182, 795 P.2d 693 (1990)); <em>cf. Bd. of Trs. v. Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 106 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1989) (examining when statutes aimed at regulating commercial free speech may be challenged as over-broad). Our state and federal constitutions require that government write laws that the people can understand and that provide ascertainable standards to guide the enforcement of the law. <em>State v. Williams, </em>144 Wn.2d 197, 203, 26 P.3d 890 (2001); <em>State v. Halstien, </em>122 Wn.2d 109, 117, 857 P.2d 270 (1993). Vaguely worded ordinances do not meet this constitutional requirement. Still, even when free speech principles are implicated, scientific precision is not required. As long as persons of common intelligence can reasonably determine the meaning and applicability of the statute, the statute is not vague. <em>Douglass, </em>115 Wn.2d at 178; <em>Halstien, </em>122 Wn.2d at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00b634 In this case, the ordinance defines a sign as \u201ca collection of letters, numbers or symbols which calls attention to a business, product... or service.\u201d Kitsap County Code (KCC) 17.110.675. A portable sign is defined broadly as one \u201cwhich has no permanent attachment to a building or the ground.\u201d KCC \u00a7 17.110.620. Arguably, my mother\u2019s ball cap, sweat shirt, and windbreaker are all portable signs. Her shopping bag, boldly advertising the name of her favorite department store, is even more suspect.

The same governmental interests asserted here were advanced by the city of San Diego. The Court applied the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, beginning with the observation that it \u201cis far too late\u201d to contend that either traffic safety or aesthetics is not a substantial governmental goal. <em>Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 507-08.

The Court held that as a matter of law an ordinance prohibiting advertising designed to be viewed from the street relates to traffic safety. <em>Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 508-09 (adopting the reasoning in the lower court decision, <em>Metromedia v. City of San Diego, </em>26 Cal. 3d 848, 610 P.2d 407, 164 Cal. Rptr. 510 (1980)). In fact, the Court expressly stated that \u201cthe prohibition of offsite advertising is directly related to the stated objectives of traffic safety and esthetics.\u201d <em>Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b641 Citing <em>Metromedia, </em>the Ninth Circuit similarly held in a case involving a Seattle billboard ordinance that \u201c[a]s a matter of law Seattle\u2019s ordinance, enacted to further the city\u2019s interest in aesthetics and safety, is a constitutional restriction on commercial speech <em>without detailed proof </em>that the billboard regulation will in fact advance the city\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Ackerley Communications of N.W., Inc. v.

State, </em>73 Wn.2d 405, 421, 439 P.2d 248 (1968). Because, as a matter of law, restricting the use of billboards and signs directly advances a substantial government interest in traffic safety, this court should hold that the ordinance at issue here satisfies the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b642 However, instead of a straightforward application of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, the majority relies on <em>Discovery </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Network </em>for what it believes is a \u201cminimal benefit\u201d approach. The majority proposes that the \u201cminimal benefit\u201d of \u201cprohibiting persons from wearing signage\u201d is a reason why the ordinance fails to directly advance the county\u2019s interest in traffic safety. Majority at 514. However, this reasoning both misapplies <em>Discovery Network </em>and mistakenly incorporates the fourth prong of <em>Central Hudson </em>into the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b643 <em>Discovery Network </em>did not concern the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. Instead, the Court analyzed the degree of benefit resulting from the ordinance at issue when deciding whether its restriction was more extensive than necessary, i.e., the fourth prong of <em>Central Hudson. Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 416 n.12, 417, 428. In <em>Discovery Network, </em>the Court found unconstitutional a city of Cincinnati ordinance prohibiting the distribution of commercial handbills on public property, under which the city ordered removal of \u201ccommercial\u201d newsracks but not racks containing newspapers. The fatal flaw in the ordinance at issue in <em>Discovery Network </em>was not that it failed to advance a legitimate interest, but rather that it did so in an impermissible manner. Application of the ordinance led to removal of only 62 newsracks while about 1,500-2,000 remained in place. This benefit, the Court agreed, was \u201cminute\u201d and \u201cpaltry.\u201d <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 417-18. The Court also determined that the categorical ban on commercial newsracks placed too much importance on a distinction between commercial speech and noncommercial speech, given that much of the content of ordinary newspapers is commercial speech. The distinction, the Court said, bore \u201cno relationship <em>whatsoever\u201d </em>to Cincinnati\u2019s interests in safety and aesthetics. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 423, 424. As the dissent in <em>Discovery Network </em>noted, \u201c[although the Court does not say so, there can be no question that Cincinnati\u2019s prohibition against respondents\u2019 newsracks \u2018directly advances\u2019 its safety and esthetic interests because, if enforced, the city\u2019s policy will decrease the number of newsracks on its street corners.\u201d <em>Discovery </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Network, </em>507 U.S. at 440 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). The Court did not suggest that the degree of benefit is relevant to the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b644 In this case, the ordinance at issue directly reduces the number of signs at street corners that may distract motorists. Thus, there is no question that it advances the interest in traffic safety. In short, regardless of the <em>degree </em>of benefit, the ordinance directly advances the county\u2019s legitimate interest in traffic safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b645 The majority also relies on <em>Edenfield v. Fane, </em>507 U.S. 761, 113 S. Ct. 1792, 123 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1993) and <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, </em>533 U.S. 525, 121 S. Ct. 2404, 150 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2001) for the proposition that for this court to sustain the restriction on offsite advertising, Kitsap County must demonstrate that the harms the ordinance addresses are real and materially alleviated by the restriction. Majority at 513. While the majority quotes this standard from <em>Lorillard, </em>it instills in it a stricter meaning than the United States Supreme Court did. Significantly, the Court also said in <em>Lorillard:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">We do not, however, require that \u201cempirical data come . . . accompanied by a surfeit of background information. . . . [W]e have permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether, or even, in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions based solely on history, consensus, and \u2018simple common sense.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>Lorillard, </em>533 U.S. at 555 (quoting <em>Fla. Bar v. Went For It, Inc., </em>515 U.S. 618, 628, 115 S. Ct. 2371, 132 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1995)). Thus, <em>Lorillard </em>confirms that consensus and common sense can be significant factors in assessing whether harms are real and a given restriction will alleviate them, or, conversely, that the restriction will not alleviate the harms. For example, the Court found in <em>Lorillard </em>that a ban of in-store tobacco advertising below five feet did not advance the State\u2019s interest in preventing minors from using tobacco on the commonsense grounds that some children are over five feet tall and others may look up (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>thus could still view advertisers\u2019 messages). <em>Lorillard, </em>533 U.S. at 566. <em>Edenfield </em>is distinguishable because there the Court found that a rule prohibiting direct solicitation by certified public accountants did not directly advance the governmental interest asserted because two studies expressly contradicted the Board of Accountancy\u2019s contention that personal solicitation by certified public accountants creates a danger of fraud, overreaching, or compromised independence. <em>Edenfield, </em>507 U.S. at 771-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b646 Much more importantly, neither <em>Lorillard </em>nor <em>Eden-field </em>contradicts <em>Metromedia\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u201cthe prohibition of offsite advertising is directly related to the stated objectives of traffic safety and esthetics.\u201d <em>Metro-media, </em>453 U.S. at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b647 In <em>Central Hudson </em>itself, the Court found the asserted governmental interest in energy conservation was advanced by an order requiring electric utilities in New York State to cease all advertising that promoted the use of electricity. The Court held that the order directly and materially served the legitimate government interest in energy conservation, acknowledging \u201can immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity.\u201d <em>Central Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 569. Indeed, the Court reasoned that appellant Central Hudson \u201cwould not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court did not consider, nor require, empirical evidence to satisfy the third <em>Central Hudson </em>prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b648 Here, Mattress Outlet would not use its raincoat-signs to advertise if the signs did not, as Mattress Outlet admits, call drivers\u2019 attention away from the roadway. Because the ordinance at issue here removes raincoat-signs from sidewalks adjacent to passing motorists, an immediate connection exists between that regulation and the county\u2019s interest in traffic safety. On the basis of the county\u2019s substantial interest in traffic safety alone, the ordinance satisfies the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u00b649 The majority next dismisses Kitsap County\u2019s interest in aesthetics as a justification for its ordinance without citing a single case in support of its conclusion. Majority at 514-15. The majority says that the signs are only in place temporarily and are not of a type usually thought of when aesthetics are considered. Majority at 514-15. Again the majority fails to recognize that <em>Metromedia </em>is directly to the contrary, as are other decisions by the United States Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b650 In <em>Metromedia, </em>the Court concluded that a local government\u2019s interest in avoiding visual clutter is sufficient to justify a prohibition of billboards and signs. <em>Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 507-08, 510. The Court made the same observation in <em>Members of City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 806-07, 104 S. Ct. 2118, 80 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984) (expressly reaffirming the majority in <em>Metromedia). </em>The Ninth Circuit also recognizes that a substantial interest in aesthetics can justify a ban on billboards. <em>Ackerley Communications, </em>108 F.3d at 1099. This court likewise recognizes aesthetic values as an independent basis for regulating outdoor advertising. <em>Markham, </em>73 Wn.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b651 The majority also provides no support for its conclusion that raincoat-signs are not the type of signs that contribute to visual blight. To the contrary, large, yellow, portable raincoat-signs lie wholly within the scope of signage considered to be visual blight. Billboards visible from streets and highways contribute to visual blight. <em>Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 510. Signs measuring 15 by 44 inches posted on utility poles are visual blight. <em>Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 792, 810. Signs posted by homeowners in their yards contribute to visual clutter. <em>City of Ladue v. Gilleo, </em>512 U.S. 43, 54, 114 S. Ct. 2038, 129 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994) (striking the city ordinance on other grounds). Federal and state courts have specifically identified portable signs as contributing to visual blight. <em>E.g., Lindsay v. City of San Antonio, </em>821 F.2d 1103, 1109 (5th Cir. 1987); <em>Harnish v. Manatee County, </em>783 F.2d 1535, 1540 (11th Cir. 1986) (superseded on other grounds by federal rule of civil procedure); <em>Barber v. Mu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>nicipality of Anchorage, </em>776 P.2d 1035, 1038 (Alaska 1989). Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoat-signs, like numerous other forms of visual clutter, contribute to visual blight. By prohibiting the use of the raincoat-signs as offsite commercial advertising, the ordinance directly advances Kitsap County\u2019s substantial interest in alleviating visual blight. The ordinance thus also satisfies the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test on the basis of aesthetic interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b652 Contrary to the majority, I would apply well-established case law and in doing so conclude that the ordinance meets the third prong of <em>Central Hudson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b653 The Kitsap County ordinance is also sufficiently tailored to meet the fourth prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. <em>See Board of Trs. v. Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 476-81, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 106 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1988); <em>United States v. Edge Broad. Co., </em>509 U.S. 418, 429, 113 S. Ct. 2696, 125 L. Ed. 2d 345 (1993). As to this prong, Mattress Outlet\u2019s challenge succeeds only if it establishes that its raincoat-signs fall outside the confines of a properly drawn prohibition. See <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 482 (\u201c[t]he person invoking the commercial-speech narrow-tailoring rule asserts that the acts of his that are the subject of the litigation fall outside what a properly drawn prohibition could cover\u201d (emphasis omitted)). As the majority states, the ordinance is not tested facially, but as applied to Mattress Outlet\u2019s particular form of commercial speech. <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 482; <em>see </em>majority at 508. The question before this court is therefore properly framed as whether Mattress Outlet\u2019s use of raincoat-signs as offsite advertising may be prohibited in the interests of traffic safety and aesthetics. The majority erroneously views the issue as whether the ordinance \u201ccould be narrowly tailored so as to accommodate the reasonable use of apparel displays.\u201d Majority at 515. Like the use of commercial billboards in <em>Metromedia </em>and political posters in <em>Vincent, </em>Mattress Outlet\u2019s use of raincoat-signs may be prohibited to promote traffic safety and aesthetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b654 <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>fourth prong requires a \u201creasonable fit\u201d between a regulatory prohibition and the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that it serves. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 416. A reasonable fit is \u201cnot necessarily [a] perfect\u201d fit, \u201cbut one whose scope is \u2018in proportion to the interest served,\u2019. . . not necessarily the least restrictive means but... narrowly tailored.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 480 (quoting <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 203, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1982)). As such, \u201calmost all of the restrictions disallowed under <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>fourth prong have been substantially excessive, disregarding \u2018far less restrictive and more precise means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 479 (quoting <em>Shapero v.

Ed. 2d 475 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b655 The majority mistakenly believes that <em>Discovery Network </em>is analogous and that under <em>Discovery Network </em>Kitsap County\u2019s ordinance is unconstitutional under the fourth prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. Majority at 514. However, the majority fails to heed the cautionary words of the Court in <em>Discovery Network </em>when it distinguished <em>Metromedia. </em>The Court said that unlike the ordinance at issue in <em>Metromedia, </em>the ordinance in <em>Discovery Network </em>was applied in a way that unjustifiably discriminated between commercial and noncommercial speech. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 425 n.20. The city of Cincinnati sought to ban newsracks used to distribute commercial handbills comprised mostly of advertising, while at the same time it allowed identical newsracks used to distribute ordinary newspapers containing up to 70 percent advertising. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 419-20, 420 n.16. The ordinance failed because, without any legitimate basis for doing so, it discriminated against newsracks that were no more harmful than those permitted. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 418. The Court in <em>Discovery Network </em>accordingly found the distinction between commercial handbills and ordinary newspapers unjustified. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 419-20. In contrast, the ordinance at issue here does not make such a distinction; it simply prohibits offsite bill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>boards and signs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> KCC 17.445.070(C). Restated, unlike the city in <em>Discovery Network, </em>Kitsap County has not attempted to distinguish \u201clow value\u201d commercial speech for purposes of a selective ban or to permit signs that are as disruptive of traffic as those prohibited. The analogy drawn by the majority is thus inaccurate and inappropriate. Government regulations may distinguish between different categories of commercial speech. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 425 n.20. <em>Discovery Network </em>provides no basis here for finding a First Amendment violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b656 The majority also erroneously reasons that the Kitsap County ordinance fails the <em>Central Hudson </em>test because, the majority says, the ordinance \u201cburdens substantially more speech than is necessary.\u201d Majority at 515. That, however, is not the narrow tailoring test defined in <em>Central Hudson. </em>The <em>Central Hudson </em>test as explained in <em>Fox </em>merely looks for a reasonable fit between an ordinance\u2019s prohibition of commercial speech and the government interest served. <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 480. The Court in <em>Discovery Network, </em>for example, found a poor fit between the ordinance in question and the city\u2019s interest in aesthetics because the ordinance was applied in a discriminatory fashion to remove only 62 of 1,500 unsightly newsracks. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 417-18. The Court determined that the ordinance as applied bore \u201cno relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>whatsoever\u201d </em>to the city\u2019s interest in safety and aesthetics and thus was \u201can impermissible means of responding to the city\u2019s admittedly legitimate interests.\u201d <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 423, 424. <em>Discovery Network </em>did not establish a rule against removing all newsracks from sidewalks. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 427-28. In suggesting as much, the majority conflates the <em>Central Hudson </em>test with overbreadth and vagueness challenges which Mattress Outlet cannot sustain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While Mattress Outlet has speculated about the possibility that the ordinance might be applied to prohibit normal apparel, the hypothetical case of a pedestrian cited for wearing a shirt with a company\u2019s name or logo is not before this court. Further, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Fox, </em>Mattress Outlet may not claim infringement of noncommercial speech interests. <em>See Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 482-84. As the majority says, Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoat-signs fall squarely within the scope of the Kitsap County ordinance. Majority at 510-11. Ordinances like KCC 17-.445.070(C) which prohibit offsite commercial advertising are consistently upheld as constitutional. <em>See Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 512; <em>Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 806-07 (affirming Me<em>tromedia); Outdoor Sys., Inc. v.

Comm\u2019r, </em>120 Wn.2d 101, 119, 838 P.2d 680 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\"> The speech in question, Mattress Outlet\u2019s advertising raincoat-signs, concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading, thus satisfying the first prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, and the government has a substantial interest in traffic safety and aesthetics, thus satisfying the second prong. <em>See Cent. Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 U.S. 557, 566, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\"> There are several opinions in <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 101 S. Ct. 2882, 69 L. Ed. 2d 800 (1981). All of my references to <em>Metromedia </em>will be to that part of the four-member plurality opinion joined by Justice Stevens, thus comprising a decision of the majority of the Court. <em>See Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 541 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part, joining parts I through IV of the lead opinion). I note that other members of the Court also agreed with relevant parts of the plurality in separate opinions, although I do not specifically cite all of the opinions on each point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\"> Notably, the Kitsap County ordinance is very much like other ordinances found to apply only to commercial speech. The Kitsap County Code regulates signs that \u201ccall[ ] attention to a business, product, activity, person, or service.\u201d KCC 17.110.675. The municipal ordinance at issue in <em>Suffolk v. Hulse </em>prohibited offsite signs which direct attention to a business, community, service, entertainment, or attraction. <em>Suffolk Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Hulse, </em>43 N.Y.2d 483, 373 N.E.2d 263, 402 N.Y.S.2d 368 (1977), <em>cited in Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 499. Moreover, the conditionally exempted temporary signs noted by the majority may be distinguished from Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoat-signs. Farm produce and holiday bazaar sandwich board signs must be onsite; other holiday bazaar signs require a permit; yard sale signs are limited to four square feet, making them much smaller than Mattress Outlet\u2019s raincoat-signs. KCC 17.445.090. Additionally, these signs are likely to be temporary or seasonal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> It is also interesting to note that even as to distinguishing between commercial and noncommercial speech, the Court described its holding in <em>Discovery Network </em>as \u201cnarrow\u201d and said that it did not reach the question whether under other facts and circumstances a community might be able to justify differential treatment of commercial and noncommercial newsracks. <em>Discovery Network, </em>507 U.S. at 428.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-5\"> \u201cA successful attack upon a commercial-speech restriction on narrow-tailoring grounds .. . does not assure a defense to those whose own commercial solicitation <em>can </em>be constitutionally proscribed.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 483 (citing <em>Cent. Hudson, </em>447 U.S. 557; <em>Shapero v. Ky. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>486 U.S. 466, 108 S. Ct. 1916, 100 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1988)); <em>see also Fox </em>492 U.S. at 481 (stating that the alleged overbreadth applied to Fox\u2019s noncommercial speech).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
