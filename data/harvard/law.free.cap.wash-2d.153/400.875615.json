Graham argues that, rather than charging her with one count of reckless endangerment for each of her surviving three passengers, the State should have been limited to charging her with a single count of reckless endangerment for her conduct in causing one automobile accident.

We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">f 3 On March 16, 2001, 16-year-old Audrey Graham left Vashon High School, driving her parents\u2019 2000 Hyundai Tibur\u00f3n. Her classmate Katie Bos rode in the front passenger seat. Despite her awareness that the backseat was equipped with only two seat belts, Graham invited three other friends to join hex: and Bos. Ashley Fix sat in the backseat between Sydney Shelton and Jake Wittmier, neither of whom used the available seat belts.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b64 Before leaving the school grounds, Graham drove to a nearby gravel parking lot in order to spin the car around in a circle at high speed. Graham drove back onto the pavement and accelerated out of the parking lot, causing the car to fishtail. Soon after they left the school, Shelton saw that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the speedometer was at 60 mph. After Graham turned onto Monument Road, which has a posted speed limit of 40 mph three-tenths of a mile from school, Wittmier observed that the speedometer read 80 mph. Rocking the steering wheel back and forth several times to make the car swerve, Graham said, \u201c\u2018Look, I can drive like Thomas [Porro],\u2019 which was a reference to her boyfriend and his driving.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 245, Finding of Fact (FF) 7. Graham lost control of the car when she looked down to adjust the stereo. The car slid across the roadway, hit a ditch, rolled several times, and came to a stop 407 feet from the first skid marks on the roadway. All three of the backseat passengers were ejected. Shelton and Wittmier were injured, and Fix died instantly. At the scene, Graham approached King County Deputy Sheriff Chris Kahrs and said, \u201c \u2018It\u2019s my fault... I was going too fast.\u2019 \u201d CP at 245, FF 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b65 On July 12, 2001, the State charged Graham in juvenile court with one count of vehicular homicide for the death of Ashley Fix. The State amended the information on December 4, 2001, to add three counts of reckless endangerment for Graham\u2019s three other passengers. Testimony taken at the fact-finding hearing in December 2001 established that Graham had taken a driver\u2019s education course before the crash and had learned that exceeding the speed limit and driving inattentively or recklessly was dangerous. Graham also admitted that Porro\u2019s excessively fast driving had frightened her in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b66 The court found Graham guilty on all four counts. Graham appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a partially published decision. <em>State v. A.G., </em>117 Wn. App. 462, 72 P.3d 226 (2003). We granted Graham\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b67 (1) For the offense of reckless endangerment, set forth in RCW 9A.36.050(1), is the unit of prosecution each person endangered or each endangering act?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u00b68 (2) Did the juvenile court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusion of law that Graham had acted \u201crecklessly,\u201d as that term is defined in RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c)?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b69 <em>Standard of Review. </em>Graham raises a question of statutory interpretation and challenges one of the juvenile court\u2019s conclusions of law. Appellate review of both issues is de novo. <em>State v. Thomas, </em>150 Wn.2d 666, 670, 80 P.3d 168 (2003) (citing <em>State v. Ammons, </em>136 Wn.2d 453, 456, 963 P.2d 812 (1998); <em>State v. J.P., </em>149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> \u00b610 <em>Unit of Prosecution for Reckless Endangerment. </em>Graham argues that her three convictions for reckless endangerment violated double jeopardy. The double jeopardy clauses of the Washington State Constitution, article I, section 9, and the fifth amendment to the federal constitution \u201cprotect against multiple punishments for the same offense, as well as against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or conviction.\u201d <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Orange, </em>152 Wn.2d 795, 815,100 P.3d 291 (2004) . Where a defendant contends that his sole act has been punished twice under separate criminal statutes, the question is \u201cwhether, in light of legislative intent, the charged crimes constitute the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the relevant statutes do not disclose legislative intent, the reviewing court will apply the \u201csame evidence\u201d or <em>Blockburger </em>test,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by which two charged crimes will not be deemed the same offense if each statute requires proof of a fact not required by the other statute. However, as this court recognized in <em>State v. Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d 629, 633, 965 P.2d 1072 (1998), \u201c[w]hen a defendant is convicted for violating one statute multiple times, the same evidence test will <em>never </em>be satisfied,\u201d since the multiple convictions \u201cwill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>always be the same in law, but. . . never .. . the same in fact.\u201d Consequently, the double jeopardy analysis for multiple convictions for violating the same statute requires a determination of \u201cwhat act or course of conduct. . . the Legislature defined as the punishable act\u201d: \u201cWhen the Legislature defines the scope of a criminal act (the unit of prosecution), double jeopardy protects a defendant from being convicted twice under the same statute for committing just one unit of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. Where the legislature has not clearly indicated the unit of prosecution in a criminal statute, the \u201clack of statutory clarity favors applying the rule of lenity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b611 RCW 9A.36.050(1) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of reckless endangerment when he or she recklessly engages in conduct not amounting to drive-by shooting but that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u201d Graham contends that the unit of prosecution is the alleged act of reckless conduct (here, her reckless driving), whereas the State maintains that the legislature intended to criminalize a defendant\u2019s reckless endangerment of a particular individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b612 Graham relies on <em>State v. Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d 607, 40 P.3d 669 (2002), wherein we concluded that the unit of prosecution for second degree arson is the defendant\u2019s act of setting the fire, not each item of property damaged by the fire. As the Court of Appeals explained in the present case, <em>see </em>117 Wn. App. at 469, the statute at issue in <em>Westling </em>does not predicate guilt on damage to a particular piece of property but criminalizes the setting of a fire that \u201cdamages a building, or <em>any </em>structure or erection appurtenant to or joining <em>any </em>building, or <em>any </em>wharf, dock, machine, engine, automobile, or other motor vehicle, watercraft, aircraft, bridge, or trestle, or hay, grain, crop, or timber, whether cut or standing or <em>any </em>range land, or pasture land, or <em>any </em>fence, or <em>any </em>lumber, shingle, or other timber products, or <em>any </em>property.\u201d RCW 9A.48.030(1) (emphasis added). The analysis in <em>Westling </em>was straightforward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">[T]he statute refers, in relevant part, to the causing of <em>\u201ca </em>fire\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that damages \u201cany automobile.\u201d \u201cAny\u201d means \u201cevery\u201d and \u201call.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>117 Wn.2d 263, 271, 814 P.2d 652 (1991). Thus, under the plain language of the statute, one conviction is appropriate where one fire damages multiple automobiles, i.e., by use of the word \u201can/\u2019 the statute speaks in terms of \u201cever/\u2019 and \u201call\u201d automobiles damaged by the one fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">145 Wn.2d at 611-12. The Court of Appeals in the present case observed that, in contrast to the arson statute, the reckless endangerment statute proscribes conduct that places at risk not simply <em>any </em>person but <em>\u201canother </em>person.\u201d RCW 9A.36.050(1) (emphasis added). In <em>State v. DeSantiago, </em>149 Wn.2d 402, 68 P.3d 1065 (2003), we applied the <em>Westling </em>analysis to the use of \u201ca,\u201d rather than \u201cany,\u201d in weapon enhancement statutes to support our holding that the plain language of the statutes required a sentence enhancement for each weapon carried during an offense. <em>Id. </em>at 419. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that, by the plain language of RCW 9A.36.050(1), \u201cthe legislature intended one unit of prosecution per victim.\u201d 117 Wn. App. at 470; <em>see Commonwealth v. Frisbie, </em>506 Pa. 461, 466, 485 A.2d 1098 (1984) (concluding that reckless endangerment statute, which prohibited conduct jeopardizing \u201c \u2018another person,\u2019 \u201d \u201cwas written with regard to <em>an individual person </em>being placed in danger of death or serious bodily injury, and that a separate offense is committed for each individual person placed in such danger\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b613 While the plain language analysis of <em>Westling </em>supports the conclusion of the Court of Appeals in the present case, significant additional support may be derived from a broader consideration of the nature of reckless endangerment. Likewise faced with determining the unit of prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tion in a statute prohibiting conduct recklessly endangering \u201canother person,\u201d the Maryland Court of Special Appeals took \u201ca moment to stand on the mountaintop and look down on the larger field of the criminal law in perspective.\u201d <em>Albrecht v. Maryland, </em>105 Md. App. 45, 58, 658 A.2d 1122 (1995). Recalling the common categorization of crimes into those against property, habitation, public morals, and persons, the Maryland court defined reckless endangerment as \u201cquintessentially a crime against persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reached that conclusion by considering the relationship between reckless endangerment, an inchoate crime, and \u201cthe entire range of consummated crimes from which . . . [it] is either one step removed (no actual harm) or two steps removed (neither actual harm nor intent to harm).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. As the <em>Albrecht </em>court observed, those consummated crimes\u2014\u201chomicides and batteries and assaults, simple and aggravated, intended and unintended\u201d\u2014\u201care classically crimes against the person\u201d; thus, \u201c[i]t is even so with this newest inchoate addition to that inherently dangerous family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with this principle that an inchoate crime draws its essential character from the consummated form of the crime, the State argued that reckless endangerment should be treated the same as vehicular homicide or vehicular assault. As the State observed, reckless endangerment makes a defendant responsible for subjecting another person to the <em>risk </em>of death or serious injury, whereas the consummated crimes of vehicular homicide or vehicular assault are chargeable when the reckless behavior actually <em>causes </em>a person\u2019s death or serious injury. <em>See </em>RCW 9.94A.589. In the State\u2019s view, given that \u201cmultiple counts of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault may be charged where multiple victims occupy the same vehicle,\u201d it would be anomalous to conclude, as Graham would have this court do, that only one count of reckless endangerment may be charged where multiple vehicle occupants have been put at substantial risk. <em>State v. Bourne, </em>90 Wn. App. 963, 973, 954 P.2d 366 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b614 In light of the plain language of RCW 9A.36.050(1), as well as the nature of reckless endanger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ment as a crime against the person, we hold that the legislature has authorized the imposition of multiple sentences where a defendant\u2019s reckless act endangers multiple individuals. Because the unit of prosecution for the crime of reckless endangerment is each person endangered, not each endangering act, the State was entitled to charge Graham with three counts of reckless endangerment. We affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b615 <em>Graham\u2019s Challenge to Juvenile Court\u2019s Finding of Recklessness. </em>As set forth above, \u201c[a] person is guilty of reckless endangerment when he or she <em>recklessly </em>engages in conduct. . . that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u201d RCW 9A-.36.050(1) (emphasis added). RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c) provides that \u201c[a] person <em>is reckless or acts recklessly </em>when he knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his disregard of such substantial risk is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable man would exercise in the same situation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the conclusion that whether \u201can act is reckless depends on both what the defendant knew and how a reasonable person would have acted knowing these facts,\u201d the statutory definition has been described as \u201cincluding] a subjective and objective component.\u201d <em>State v. R.H.S., </em>94 Wn. App. 844, 847, 974 P.2d 1253 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b616 With regard to the three charged counts of reckless endangerment, the juvenile court concluded that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Graham \u201cacted recklessly.\u201d CP at 246. Graham contends, however, that the findings failed to establish the subjective component of the statutory definition. The relevant factual findings are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">12. Prior to the accident, the respondent had passed driver\u2019s education, in which the respondent had been instructed as to the hazards of driving at excessive speeds, in an inattentive manner, and recklessly. <em>She knew that not following these instructions created a dangerous situation. </em>She had driven on numerous occasions, and was considered a safe driver. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>respondent testified that prior to March 16, 2001, she had on occasion been a passenger in her boyfriend\u2019s car while he was speeding down straight roads, and that his excessive speed on those instances made her fearful. Given the instruction she received, her previous history of safe driving, and her prior experiences, <em>the respondent knew the risks inherent in driving fast or in an unsafe manner.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">13. Although <em>the respondent knew that driving at high speeds, not paying attention to the road, and playing games with the wheel were unsafe and could cause an </em>accident, the Court cannot find that she had actual knowledge of the risks inherent in the <em>particular </em>dangerous situation she created on March 16th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">14. A reasonable person in a similar situation would have recognized the risks inherent in the driving behavior in which the respondent engaged. As such, even if she did not have actual knowledge of the <em>specific </em>risks, she had constructive knowledge of those risks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">CP at 245-46, FF 12-14 (emphasis added). The juvenile court thus explicitly found that Graham <em>\u201cknew </em>that\u201d driving at high speeds, inattentively, or recklessly \u201ccreated a dangerous situation\u201d; that she <em>knew </em>the risks inherent in driving fast or in an unsafe manner\u201d; and that she <em>\u201cknew </em>that driving at high speeds, not paying attention to the road, and playing games with the wheel were unsafe and could cause an accident.\u201d CP at 245-46, FF 12-13 (emphasis added). The findings that Graham \u201cknew\u201d that her conduct \u201ccreated a dangerous situation\u201d and \u201ccould cause an accident\u201d satisfy the knowledge component of the statutory definition of recklessness: \u201cA person . . . acts recklessly when he knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur.\u201d RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">f 17 Graham incorrectly claims that \u201c[t]he juvenile court found that [she] did not understand the risks involved in her driving.\u201d Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 14; <em>see also </em>Pet. for Review at 12 (stating that \u201cthe juvenile court specifically found that [Graham] was not aware of the risks involved in her conduct\u201d); Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 38 (referring to \u201c[t]he juvenile court\u2019s factual finding that [Graham] did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>know the risks of her dangerous driving\u201d). Graham\u2019s characterization of the juvenile court\u2019s findings rests on the court\u2019s unnecessary distinction between, on the one hand, Graham\u2019s actual knowledge of the risks inherent in high-speed, inattentive, and foolhardy driving and, on the other hand, Graham\u2019s lack of actual knowledge as to how \u201cthe <em>particular </em>dangerous situation she created on March 16th\u201d would unfold. CP at 246, FF 13 (emphasis added). In other words, while RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c) requires actual knowledge \u201cthat a wrongful act [here, the loss of control over the automobile] may occur,\u201d the statute does not require actual knowledge that the loss of control will result in the skidding and rolling of the car and the violent ejection of its passengers. The juvenile court provided the unnecessary conclusion that, even if it could not find that Graham knew the \u201cspecific risks,\u201d \u201c[a] reasonable person in a similar situation would have recognized the risks inherent in the driving behavior in which the respondent engaged.\u201d CP at 246, FF 14. For purposes of the subjective knowledge component of recklessness, this additional finding that Graham also had constructive knowledge of the \u201cparticular\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d accident is not essential. It has no effect on the very clear findings that Graham \u201cknew\u201d that her conduct\u2014\u201cplaying with the steering wheel. . . coupled with her speed and inattention to the road\u201d\u2014\u201ccould cause an accident.\u201d CP at 245, 246, FF 8, 13. Such knowledge meets the statutory requirements of RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b618 By prohibiting conduct that recklessly endangers \u201canother person,\u201d the legislature indicated that the unit of prosecution for reckless endangerment is not the endangering conduct but the particular person placed at risk. Establishing that Graham \u201cknew\u201d that her conduct \u201ccreated a dangerous situation\u201d and \u201ccould cause an accident,\u201d CP at 245-46, FF 12-13, the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings support its conclusion of law that Graham acted \u201creck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>lessly,\u201d as that term is defined in RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c).

The reckless endangerment statute, RCW 9A.36.050(1), provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of reckless endangerment when he or she recklessly engages in conduct not amounting to drive-by shooting but that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u201d Approving the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning, the majority concludes that the language of the reckless endangerment statute, unlike the second degree arson statute, criminalizes conduct that places \u201canother person\u201d at risk, not \u201cany person.\u201d Majority at 406-07. Thus, the majority determines that, as in <em>Westling, </em>the plain language of the statute indicates the unit of prosecution is each person endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b623 <em>Westling </em>does not support the majority\u2019s holding. First, the majority reads <em>Westling </em>much too broadly. <em>Westling </em>itself cautions that the word \u201cany\u201d when used in a statute has to be read in context; the court refused to recognize an absolute meaning of the word for all statutes. <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 612 n.2. Moreover, <em>Westling </em>does not turn solely on the word \u201cany.\u201d Instead, the court was very clear in explaining that the use of the terms \u201ca fire\u201d and \u201cany\u201d vehicle indicated legislative intent that the unit of prosecution is \u201cthe causing of \u2018a fire\u2019 that damages \u2018any automobile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 611. It was just as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>important to the analysis that the legislature spoke of \u201cone fire.\u201d <em>Westling, </em>145 Wn.2d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b624 Second, and more importantly, <em>Westling </em>is of little guidance because the reckless endangerment statute does not use either the word \u201cany\u201d or \u201ca\u201d to describe the person or persons endangered. Instead, RCW 9A.36.050(1) states the crime is committed when \u201c[a] person . . . recklessly engages in conduct. . . that creates a substantial risk ... to <em>another </em>person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is appropriate to consider dictionary definitions of the word \u201canother.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint of Tortorelli, </em>149 Wn.2d 82, 91, 66 P.3d 606 (2003); <em>Concerned Ratepayers Ass\u2019n v. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1, </em>138 Wn.2d 950, 951, 983 P.2d 635 (1999). Relevant definitions of \u201canother\u201d include \u201cdifferent or distinct from the one first named or considered\u201d (\u201canother\u201d as an adjective), and \u201cone other than oneself\u2019 (\u201canother\u201d as a pronoun). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 89 (1993). In context, therefore, the reference to \u201canother person\u201d in RCW 9A.36.050(1) means the risk is created to one other than the actor engaging in the conduct (who is the first person identified in the statutory definition of the crime). That is, the offense is not committed when the only person endangered is the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b625 The majority next \u201c \u2018stand[s] on the mountaintop and look[s] down on the larger field of the criminal law in perspective,\u2019 \u201d relying on a Maryland intermediate appellate court case, <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>105 Md. App. 45, 58, 658 A.2d 1122 (1995). Majority at 407. The majority agrees with the Maryland court that reckless endangerment is an inchoate crime and that when examined in relationship to the range of consummated crimes that are one or two steps removed, it is apparent that reckless endangerment is a crime against persons and should be treated the same as the consummated crimes. Majority at 407. Thus, just as two homicides can be charged where vehicular homicide is committed and two persons are killed, or two vehicular assaults charged where two persons are injured, so should multiple counts of reckless endangerment be sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>where there are multiple persons endangered. Majority at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b626 The Maryland court\u2019s opinion does not support the majority\u2019s holding. First, the analysis is fundamentally flawed because it assumes that the \u201cinchoate\u201d crime necessarily equates to a consummated \u201cchoate\u201d crime a step or two removed. But the \u201cinchoate\u201d crime never develops into a completed \u201cchoate\u201d crime and thus the assumption rests on speculation. Second, this speculation becomes more apparent upon recognition that reckless endangerment is quite distinct from crimes like vehicular homicide and vehicular assault because in the latter cases, the victims of the crimes suffer actual injury. In contrast, RCW 9A-.36.050(1) does not contain any requirement of harm to the person or persons endangered. Indeed, the offense of reckless endangerment can be committed without the person endangered even being aware of the risk of death or serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b627 Finally, an appellate court\u2019s responsibility when determining the unit of prosecution under a statute is to ascertain what the <em>legislature </em>intended, and this is a matter of statutory construction. A court should not determine the unit of prosecution based upon its examination of the \u201clarger field of criminal law\u201d and criminal theory and should not use its own view of how a particular crime fits into the entire scheme of criminal law as the basis for defining the unit of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b628 The unit of prosecution for a crime may be an act or a course of conduct. <em>United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 225-26, 73 S. Ct. 227, 97 L. Ed. 260 (1952); <em>State v. Root, </em>141 Wn.2d 701, 710, 9 P.3d 214 (2000); <em>State v. Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d 629, 634, 965 P.2d 1072 (1998). Here, the court should hold that the unit of prosecution for reckless endangerment is a course of conduct recklessly endangering another. It makes no difference whether one other person is endangered or more than one. First, as explained, RCW 9A.36.050(1) supports this result because it refers to a person creating a substantial risk of death or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>serious physical injury to <em>another </em>person. The statute\u2019s plain language shows legislative intent that someone other than the defendant must be placed at risk. Second, as also noted, the statute does not require that the person or persons endangered be aware of the risk of death or injury. Thus, the legislature has proscribed the <em>conduct </em>that creates a substantial risk of death or serious injury; the focus of the statute is on the defendant\u2019s conduct creating the risk, not on the effect of the defendant\u2019s conduct on another person or persons. Third, if the unit of prosecution is each person endangered, then multiple convictions can result where the defendant\u2019s conduct is identical, his or her mental state is identical, the effect experienced by the other person or persons is identical (because they need not even know of the risk), and the only difference is the fortuity of the number of persons endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b629 Holding that the unit of prosecution is a course of endangering conduct would not mean that a defendant who engages in conduct amounting to reckless endangerment could never be convicted of multiple counts. For instance, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals explained in <em>State v. Ramsey, </em>903 S.W.2d 709, 713 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995) that it was unnecessary to adopt \u201ca blanket rule that provides that a defendant\u2019s continuous operation of a vehicle may <em>only </em>result in one act of reckless endangerment\u201d because factual circumstances differ. For example, the distances involved and the time between acts comprising the reckless conduct could indicate either a single course of conduct or more than one course of conduct. <em>Id. </em>The trier of fact would have to make the determination whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted one or more courses of conduct, i.e., one or more crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b630 It is important that, when determining what constitutes the unit of prosecution for an offense, a court avoid coloring the analysis with policy considerations that are rightfully the province of the legislature and avoid substituting its own judgment for that of the legislature. A court must also avoid construing the relevant statute in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>that allows \u201coverzealous prosecutors seeking multiple convictions\u201d to charge and obtain convictions for multiple violations of the same statute based on distinctions that are not warranted by the statute. <em>Adel, </em>136 Wn.2d at 635 (citing <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 169, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977)). Unfortunately, the majority\u2019s holding allows for multiplying charges based solely on the number of persons endangered even though a fair reading of the reckless endangerment statute does not lead to the conclusion that the unit of prosecution is each person endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b631 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Sanders and Chambers, JJ., concur with Madsen, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> RCW 9A.48.030G) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Aperson is guilty of arson in the second degree if he knowingly and maliciously causes a fire or explosion which damages a building, or any structure or erection appurtenant to or joining any building, or any wharf, dock, machine, engine, automobile, or other motor vehicle, watercraft, aircraft, bridge, or trestle, or hay, grain, crop, or timber, whether cut or standing or any range land, or pasture land, or any fence, or any lumber, shingle, or other timber products, or any property.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
