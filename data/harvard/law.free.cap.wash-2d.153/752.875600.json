They also stipulated to certain facts surrounding each count. Consequently, the hearing focused entirely on the issue of the sanction to be imposed. Schwimmer was the only person who testified at this hearing and he reiterated there that he did not dispute the allegations in the complaint. The hearing officer thereafter entered findings of fact, which included all of the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\u00b615 The hearing officer also made findings and conclusions regarding the appropriate sanction. Although the hearing officer determined that the presumptive sanction for count 9 was disbarment, he concluded that the presumptive sanction was mitigated by the following: (1) Schwimmer made a timely good faith effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct by reimbursing his client, PRMC, within a month of the time the client requested he do so; (2) Schwimmer had no prior record of discipline; (3) Schwimmer was experiencing personal and emotional problems around the time the misconduct alleged in count 9 occurred; (4) the client did not complain to the WSBA about the misappropriation; and (5) Schwimmer was abusing alcohol and drugs during the time material to the misconduct alleged in count 9 and that he was physically and mentally impaired during this time. The hearing officer also concluded that Schwimmer \u201cknowingly misused client property rather than intentionally stole client property.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>at 66. The hearing officer ultimately recommended to the Disciplinary Board that Schwimmer be suspended from the practice of law for two years followed by a two-year period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\u00b616 Without additional comment, a majority of the Disciplinary Board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation. Five members of the 12 member board dissented, expressing their opinion that Schwimmer should be disbarred. The dissenters set forth their view that this court has rejected alcohol and drug use as an extraordinary mitigating factor. They also reasoned: \u201cBy not disbarring Mr. Schwimmer the message we send to both the public and the bar is that stealing clients [\u2019] funds from your trust account and that lying under oath to hide what you have done can be mitigated by drug and alcohol abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">\u00b617 The WSBA sought discretionary review of the Disciplinary Board\u2019s decision in this court pursuant to Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (ELC) 12.4, arguing, as it had to the hearing officer and Disciplinary Board, that Schwimmer should be disbarred rather than suspended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">\u00b618 Although this court gives great weight to the conclusions of the Disciplinary Board regarding the recommended sanction, this court \u201cretains ultimate authority for determining the appropriate sanction for an attorney\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Kagele, </em>149 Wn.2d 793, 816, 72 P.3d 1067 (2003) (citing <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Haskell, </em>136 Wn.2d 300, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>317, 962 P.2d 813 (1998)). Initially, the hearing officer makes findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation to the Disciplinary Board. The Board is then free to adopt, modify, or reverse the hearing officer\u2019s findings, conclusions, or recommendation. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Carmick, 146 </em>Wn.2d 582, 593-94, 48 P.3d 311 (2002). This court accepts as true all findings of fact that are not challenged on appeal. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Curran, </em>115 Wn.2d 747, 759, 801 P.2d 962 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"> \u00b619 In determining the sanction to be imposed for misconduct, we utilize the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(1991 &amp; Supp. 1992) as a basic, but not conclusive, guide. Under these standards, we first determine the presumptive sanction by considering (1) the ethical duty that the attorney violated, (2) the attorney\u2019s mental state, and (3) the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the attorney\u2019s misconduct. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Kuvara, </em>149 Wn.2d 237, 252, 66 P.3d 1057 (2003) (citing <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Halverson, </em>140 Wn.2d 475, 492, 998 P.2d 833 (2000); Standards std. 3.0(a)-(c)). We next determine whether there are any aggravating or mitigating factors that may heighten or reduce the presumptive sanction. <em>Halverson, </em>140 Wn.2d at 493; Standards std. 3.0(d)). Finally, if raised by the attorney who is being disciplined, we determine the appropriateness of the sanction by considering what have become known as the <em>Noble </em>factors. <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Noble, </em>100 Wn.2d 88, 95-96, 667 P.2d 608 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">A. Presumptive Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">\u00b620 In determining the appropriate sanction for Schwimmer\u2019s professional misconduct, we focus on count 9, which is the most serious instance of misconduct. We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>that because the \u201c \u2018 \u201cultimate sanction imposed should at least be consistent with the sanction for the most serious instance of misconduct among a number of violations.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Romero, </em>152 Wn.2d 124, 135, 94 P.3d 939 (2004) (quoting <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Petersen, </em>120 Wn.2d 833, 854, 846 P.2d 1330 (1993) (quoting Standards at 6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\u00b621 As noted above, Schwimmer stipulated that he committed the misconduct alleged in count 9 and that this misconduct amounted to a violation of RPC 8.4(b), RPC 8.4(c), and/or former RLD 1.1(a) (currently RPC 8.4(i)). In addition, he stipulated to the following facts regarding count 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">30. On or about October 27, 2000, Respondent deposited to his IOLTA account a check for $5,606.16 made payable to Prairie Ridge Maintenance Company c/o Respondent as attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">32. The $5,606.16 deposit was in fact money belonging to Respondent\u2019s client PRMC, and reflected a settlement payment in <em>PRMC v. McDonald/Bergdahl. </em>Respondent knowingly or intentionally did not notify PRMC of his receipt of those funds at the time that he received them[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">34. Between October 27 and November 28,2000, Respondent intentionally misappropriated over $2,500 in funds belonging to PRMC by writing 21 checks out of his IOLTA account, for the benefit of himself or others (not PRMC), without authorization from PRMC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">DP at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">\u00b622 Notwithstanding Schwimmer\u2019s stipulation to the charge that he misappropriated client funds and the hearing officer\u2019s finding of fact that he did so intentionally, the hearing officer concluded that Schwimmer merely \u201cknowingly misused\u201d client funds. <em>Id. </em>at 66. As noted above, that determination contributed to the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation that Schwimmer be suspended rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>disbarred, the officer stating that \u201c[suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\u00b623 We believe there are several flaws in this reasoning of the hearing officer that were apparently adopted by the Disciplinary Board. The most obvious flaw is that the conclusion that Schwimmer \u201cknowingly misused\u201d client funds conflicts with the agreed upon finding that he intentionally misappropriated client funds. Furthermore, even if the conclusion that he knowingly misused client funds rather than intentionally misappropriating them is correct, we are of the view that the distinction is of no significance. This court has indicated that \u201ca lawyer\u2019s failure to preserve the integrity of client funds leads to disbarment, absent extraordinary mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Rentel, </em>107 Wn.2d 276, 286, 729 P.2d 615 (1986) <em>(citing Noble, </em>100 Wn.2d at 92; <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Moynihan, </em>97 Wn.2d 237, 238, 643 P.2d 439 (1982)); <em>see also In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Johnson, </em>114 Wn.2d 737, 748, 790 P.2d 1227 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"> \u00b624 Finally, we hold that the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the admitted misconduct was knowing misuse rather than intentional misappropriation rests on a faulty premise. The hearing officer apparently reached that conclusion because the client\u2019s money was not, in his view, misused for a \u201csignificant period of time,\u201d thus not foreclosing the possibility that the money would be returned. DP at 66. The hearing officer noted, in that regard, that Schwimmer reimbursed his client after a demand for reimbursement was made. This reasoning is unsatisfactory because, regardless of the characterization of Schwimmer\u2019s mental state, his conduct constitutes embezzlement, which does not require an intent to permanently deprive. Rather, embezzlement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201coccurs where property that is lawfully in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the taker\u2019s possession is fraudulently or unlawfully appropriated by the taker.\u201d <em>State v. Ager, </em>128 Wn.2d 85, 91, 904 P.2d 715 (1995). We have noted that \u201c[u]nlike theft by taking, embezzlement involves a violation of trust and does not require proof of intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property taken.\u201d <em>Id.; see also State v. Linden, </em>171 Wash. 92, 112, 17 P.2d 635 (1932) (noting that in a relationship or an association that involves trust, \u201cit [is] no defense that the defendant, at the time the money was appropriated, intended to restore or repay the same at some future time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\u00b625 Any attorney who dips into a trust account could seemingly rationalize his or her conduct by saying that there was no intent to permanently deprive the client of the money and that the attorney was merely borrowing the funds, which would be paid back perhaps out of future fees from the client. Even if an attorney reimburses the client for misappropriated funds, the repayment does not eviscerate his or her ethical violation. Indeed, we have ordered disbarment of attorneys who have repaid part or all of misappropriated funds. <em>See In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Petersen, </em>120 Wn.2d 833, 846 P.2d 1330 (1993); <em>Johnson, </em>114 Wn.2d 737; <em>Rentel, </em>107 Wn.2d 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\u00b626 In sum, we reject the determination of the hearing officer and Disciplinary Board that Schwimmer only knowingly misused client funds, rather than intentionally misappropriated the money. We also conclude that the distinction between knowing misuse and intentional misappropriation is immaterial. The plain fact is that Schwimmer\u2019s ethical lapse was serious, and it was compounded when Schwimmer lied about his misconduct under oath at a deposition on November 6, 2001, which was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>substance of count 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For reasons stated above, we reject the conclusion that Schwimmer merely knowingly misused client funds and conclude, instead, that he intentionally misappropriated client funds. The presumptive sanction for this misconduct is disbarment. Standards std. 4.11; <em>see also Rentel, </em>107 Wn.2d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">B. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">\u00b627 There are no extraordinary mitigating factors present in this case. Although Schwimmer has indicated that he has little recollection of actually taking client funds and that he had addiction problems with alcohol and drugs, this does not mitigate his professional misconduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Johnson, </em>114 Wn.2d at 753 (concluding that chronic alcoholism is not an extraordinary mitigating factor); <em>Rentel, </em>107 Wn.2d at 287-88 (concluding that drug and alcohol addictions are not extraordinary mitigating factors). Indeed, the hearing officer conceded this point in his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation when he said: \u201cThe Washington State Supreme Court has held that alcoholism and drug addiction are not extraordinary miti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>gating circumstances warranting a sanction less than disbarment for conversion of client funds.\u201d DP at 65-66 (citing <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against McLendon, </em>120 Wn.2d 761, 771, 845 P.2d 1006 (1993)). The fact that Schwimmer had no prior disciplinary record is also not significant. We say that because the misconduct charged in count 9 is serious and an attorney cannot shield himself or herself from the consequences of committing a serious ethical violation simply because it is his or her first offense. Finally, it is of no importance that none of Schwimmer\u2019s clients complained about his misappropriation of their funds. \u201c[F]ailure of [an] injured client to complain\u201d is not a factor that should be considered as either aggravating or mitigating. Standards std. 9.4(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">\u00b628 On the other hand, the following aggravating factors are present here: (1) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process (findings of fact 31, 33, 41); (2) a pattern of misconduct (finding of fact 34); and (3) dishonest or selfish motive (finding of fact 34). DP at 54-55. In addition, there are multiple offenses which reinforce the conclusion that Schwimmer should be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u00b629 Most significant among the other acts is Schwimmer\u2019s lying to a superior court judge, the misconduct charged in count 3. In finding of fact 15, the hearing officer found that Schwimmer \u201cknowingly or intentionally made false or misleading representations to the court about his physical and mental condition, and about efforts and attempts he made to obtain treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. Finding of fact 16 recites the false or misleading misrepresentations, made by Schwimmer, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>Id. </em>It is apparent that Schwimmer lied to a superior court judge to excuse his failure to appear for his client at an earlier scheduled criminal trial. The fact that he did not recall lying and that he was using alcohol and drugs at the time does not provide mitigation any more than it did to his misappropriation of client funds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>a.

Following our decision in <em>Kuvara, </em>there are two <em>Noble </em>factors that we must consider: (1) proportionality of the sanction to the misconduct and (2) the extent of agreement among the members of the Disciplinary Board. <em>Kuvara, </em>149 Wn.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\u00b631 Schwimmer points only to <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Tasker, </em>141 Wn.2d 557, 9 P.3d 822 (2000), to support his claim of disproportionality. However, <em>Tasker </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Tasker, </em>we were faced with a situation where the attorney commingled his funds with client funds and knowingly used funds from that account. Unlike the instant case, there was no allegation that the attorney fraudulently stole client funds. Furthermore, we concluded that there was such a \u201csubstantial. . . delay in prosecution,\u201d and a compelling showing of rehabilitation that disbarment was inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 570. Schwimmer has shown neither the existence of substantial delay in the disciplinary proceeding nor compelling rehabilitation on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">\u00b632 While there is reluctance to reject the recommendation of a unanimous Disciplinary Board, we are less hesitant to reject the recommendation of a divided board. <em>Noble, </em>100 Wn.2d at 96. Here, as we have observed above, the Disciplinary Board was split, with five of its members favoring disbarment. We, therefore, accord its recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>dation less deference and conclude that the Disciplinary Board\u2019s recommendation of a two-year suspension should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">\u00b633 Schwimmer concedes that he intentionally misappropriated client funds and lied about it during the WSBA\u2019s investigation of the matter. This misconduct, alone, warrants disbarment. Although we have made little or no mention of any of the other acts of misconduct admitted by Schwimmer, the existence of these acts reinforces our ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">f34 We, therefore, order that Alec Schwimmer be disbarred from the practice of law and that his name be stricken from the roll of attorneys in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">C.
