Zuver. Zuver appeals a superior court order granting Airtouch\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. She principally argues that the arbitration agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, and thus, this court should strike down the entire arbitration agreement. Conversely, Airtouch claims that the arbitration agreement is neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable; however, in the event that we find any of the agreement\u2019s provisions substantively unconscionable, Airtouch asserts that the agreement\u2019s severability clause requires this court to sever the offending provisions and enforce the remainder. We hold that the provisions of the agreement pertaining to confidentiality and limitation of remedies are substantively unconscionable but agree with Airtouch that the agreement\u2019s severability clause requires us to sever these provisions and enforce the remainder of the agreement.</p>\n<author id=\"Aas\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Bridge, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b62 On April 10, 1997, Airtouch offered Zuver employment as a sales support representative at the yearly salary of $21,000. As part of its offer of employment, Airtouch required that Zuver accept certain conditions. One of these conditions was that Zuver sign an agreement to arbitrate her disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b63 The arbitration agreement states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">AGREEMENT FOR ARBITRATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">Any claim, controversy or dispute between you and U.S. West,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] unless otherwise covered by a collective bargaining agreement, whether sounding in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, discrimination or any other legal theory, including, but not limited to, disputes relating to the interpretation of this Attachment; . . . whenever brought shall be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>solved by arbitration. . . . You hereby waive and release all rights to recover punitive or exemplary damages in connection with any common law claims, including claims arising in tort or contract, against U.S. West. By signing this Attachment, you voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive any right you may otherwise have to seek remedies in court or other forums, including the right to a jury trial and the right to seek punitive damages on common law claims. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\u201cFAA\u201d) shall govern the arbitrability of all claims, provided that they are enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act.... Additionally, the substantive law of Colorado, only to the extent it is consistent with the terms stated in this Agreement for Arbitration, shall apply to any common law claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct the arbitration under the applicable rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d). Any dispute that relates to your employment with U.S. West or to the termination of your employment will be conducted under the AAA Employment Dispute Resolution Rules. . . . All arbitration proceedings, including settlements and awards, under the Agreement will be confidential. The parties shall share equally the hourly fees of the arbitrator. U.S. West shall pay the expenses (including travel and lodging) of the arbitrator. The prevailing party in any arbitration may be entitled to receive reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. ... If any party hereto files a judicial or administrative action asserting claims subject to this arbitration provision, and another party successfully stays such action and/or compels arbitration of such claims, the party filing said action shall pay the other party\u2019s costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay and/or compelling arbitration, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">SEVERABILITY AND SURVIVAL OF TERMS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">In case any one or more of the provisions of this Attachment shall be found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained in this Attachment will not be affected. . . .

Zuver signed the arbitration agreement on April 25, 1997. She claims that she was not offered an option to negotiate the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b64 Zuver had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in November 1996. After she accepted Airtouch\u2019s offer of employment, her condition worsened. As a result of her increasing fatigue and chronic pain, she requested accommodation from Airtouch in March 1999. Specifically, she requested that \u201cshe be allowed to work part-time and to telecommute, working at home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Although Airtouch allegedly permitted other similarly situated employees to telecommute, it denied Zuver\u2019s request but permitted her to work part-time beginning in June 1999. Zuver began her part-time work schedule in June 1999, but by July 1999, she could no longer work even part-time because of her disability. Consequently, she went on medical leave until April 6, 2000, when Airtouch terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b65 On June 3, 2002, Zuver filed a complaint in superior court alleging that Airtouch violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, by discriminating against her because of her disability and by failing to accommodate her disability. Airtouch answered Zuver\u2019s complaint on June 24, 2002, denying her allegations, but failing to mention the arbitration agreement. Both Zuver and Airtouch first learned of the arbitration agreement in April 2003 after Zuver had contacted Verizon Wireless, who, after acquiring Airtouch, now controlled Airtouch\u2019s former employees\u2019 personnel files, to request a copy of her file. After learning of the agreement, Airtouch informed Zuver of its discovery, and on May 21, 2003, moved to compel arbitration. On May 30, 2003, the superior court granted Airtouch\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stayed further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b66 Pursuant to RAP 2.3(b)(2), Zuver filed a motion for discretionary review to this court asserting that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b67 The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, applies to all employment contracts except for employment contracts of certain transportation workers. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 119, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001). Section 2 of the FAA provides that written arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of <em>any </em>contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[s]ection 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Moses H.

Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967)). \u201cThe effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both state and federal courts must enforce this body of substantive arbitrability law. <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 489, 107 S. Ct. 2520, 96 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1987) (citing <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 11-12, 104 S. Ct. 852, 79 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1984)); <em>see also Garmo v. Dean, Witter, Reynolds, Inc., </em>101 Wn.2d 585, 590, 681 P.2d 253 (1984). Courts must indulge every presumption \u201cin favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d <em>Moses H.

However, courts may not refuse to enforce arbitration agreements under state laws that apply only to such agreements, <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, </em>517 U.S. at 687 (citing <em>Allied-Bruce, </em>513 U.S. at 281); <em>see also Southland, </em>465 U.S. at 16; <em>Garmo, </em>101 Wn.2d at 590, or \u201crely on the <em>uniqueness </em>of an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>482 U.S. at 493 n.9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"> \u00b69 We engage in de novo review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to compel or deny arbitration. <em>Ticknor v.

Equity Investors, L.P., </em>81 Wn.2d 886, 912-13, 506 P.2d 20 (1973). Zuver argues that she should be exempt from the terms of the contract with her employer here because it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. \u201cThe existence of an unconscionable bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>gain is a question of law for the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Nelson v.

In Washington, we have recognized two categories of unconscionability, substantive and procedural. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Schroeder v. Fageol Motors, Inc., </em>86 Wn.2d 256, 260, 544 P.2d 20 (1975)). \u201cSubstantive unconscionability involves those cases where a clause or term in the contract is alleged to be one-sided or overly harsh.\u201d <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260. \u201c \u2018Shocking to the conscience\u2019, \u2018monstrously harsh\u2019, and \u2018exceedingly calloused\u2019 are terms sometimes used to define substantive unconscionability.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>127 Wn.2d at 131 (quoting Montgomery <em>Ward &amp; Co. v. Annuity Bd. of S. Baptist Convention, </em>16 Wn. App. 439, 444, 556 P.2d 552 (1976)). Procedural unconscionability is \u201cthe lack of meaningful choice, considering all the circumstances surrounding the transaction including \u2018 \u201c[t]he manner in which the contract was entered,\u201d whether each party had \u201ca reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract,\u201d and whether \u201cthe important terms [were] hidden in a maze of fine print.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131 (quoting <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260 (quoting <em>Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., </em>350 F.2d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 1965))). We have cautioned that \u201cthese three factors [should] not be applied mechanically without regard to whether in truth a meaningful choice existed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Procedural Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">f 11 As noted, to determine whether Zuver and Airtouch\u2019s arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable, we look to the following circumstances surrounding their transaction to determine whether Zuver lacked meaningful choice: \u201c \u2018[t]he manner in which the contract was entered,\u2019 whether [Zuver] had \u00a3a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract,\u2019 and whether \u2018the important terms [were] hidden in a maze of fine print.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 260 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>350 F.2d 449).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"> \u00b612 First, Zuver asserts that the arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract, which she contends justifies a finding of procedural unconscionability. We have adopted the following factors to determine whether an adhesion contract exists: \u201c(1) whether the contract is a standard form printed contract, (2) whether it was \u2018prepared by one party and submitted to the other on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis,\u2019 and (3) whether there was \u2018no true equality of bargaining power\u2019 between the parties.\u201d <em>Yakima County (W. Valley) Fire Prot. Dist. No. 12 v. City of Yakima, </em>122 Wn.2d 371, 393, 858 P.2d 245 (1993) (quoting <em>Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. Perkins, </em>347 F.2d 379, 383 n.5 (9th Cir. 1965)). In <em>Yakima County Fire Protection District, </em>we noted that \u201cto the extent that the characterization of a contract as an adhesion contract has any relevance to determining the <em>validity </em>of a contract, it is only in looking for procedural unconscionability.\u201d 122 Wn.2d at 393. However, the fact that an agreement is an adhesion contract does not necessarily render it procedurally unconscionable. <em>See Yakima County Fire Prot. Dist., </em>122 Wn.2d at 393. <em>See also Mendez v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., </em>111 Wn. App. 446, 459, 45 P.3d 594 (2002); <em>Luna v. Household Fin. Corp., </em>236 F. Supp. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>1166, 1175 (W.D. Wash. 2002); <em>Walters v. A.A.A. Waterproofing, Inc., </em>120 Wn. App. 354, 362, 85 P.3d 389 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b613 Zuver and Airtouch\u2019s arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract. First, all Airtouch employees received the standard form printed arbitration agreement. Airtouch informed Zuver that she must sign the agreement as a condition of its offer of employment, i.e., on a \u201ctake it or leave it basis.\u201d Presumably, Zuver could not negotiate the terms of the agreement with Airtouch. Thus, there was \u201c \u2018no true equality of bargaining power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yakima County Fire Prot. Dist., </em>122 Wn.2d at 393 (quoting <em>Standard Oil, </em>347 F.2d at 383 n.5). Nonetheless, the fact that Zuver and Airtouch\u2019s arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract does not end our inquiry. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b614 Zuver further asserts that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable because her unequal bargaining power precluded her from \u201c \u2018enjoying a meaningful opportunity to negotiate and choose the terms of the contract.\u2019 \u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 24 (quoting <em>Ingle v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1165, 1171 (9th Cir. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1160 (2004)). Airtouch, however, argues that the mere presence of unequal bargaining power does not render the agreement procedurally unconscionable. Airtouch claims that it provided Zuver with a reasonable opportunity to consider the terms of the agreement and that its terms were fully disclosed. Thus, Airtouch reasons that Zuver had a meaningful choice to sign the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b615 We agree with Airtouch. Washington courts have long held that the fact that unequal bargaining power exists will not, standing alone, justify a finding of procedural unconscionability. <em>See Yakima County Fire Prot. Disk, </em>122 Wn.2d at 392-93; <em>Tjart, </em>107 Wn. App. at 898-99; <em>Pub. Employees Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp., </em>59 Wn. App. 641, 650, 800 P.2d 831 (1990), <em>review denied, </em>116 Wn.2d 1013 (1991); <em>Mendez, </em>111 Wn. App. at 459. Rather, the key inquiry for finding procedural unconscionability is whether Zuver lacked meaningful choice. <em>See Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>at 260. As described in detail below, the facts here show that Zuver had a meaningful choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">f 16 First, Airtouch sent Zuver a letter on April 10, 1997, explaining that it was extending her an offer of employment for a sales support representative position provided that she sign six documents, one of which was the arbitration agreement. Airtouch did not demand that Zuver return the agreement immediately. In fact, Zuver did not sign the agreement until April 25, 1997, 15 days after Airtouch first contacted her. She had ample opportunity to contact counsel or even Airtouch with any concerns or questions she might have had about the terms of the agreement. <em>See Luna, </em>236 F. Supp. 2d at 1176 (three-day rescission period provided parties with a reasonable opportunity to consider the terms of the agreement). She did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b617 Additionally, the important terms of the arbitration agreement were not hidden in a \u201c \u2018maze of fine print.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schroeder, 86 </em>Wn.2d at 260 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>350 F.2d at 449). Although Zuver received the agreement with five other attachments, the agreement was clearly labeled \u201cARBITRATION AGREEMENT,\u201d underlined, bolded, and in capital letters. CP at 36. <em>See M.A. Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp., </em>140 Wn.2d 568, 588, 998 P.2d 305 (2000) (holding that the fact that a license agreement\u2019s terms were in capital letters did not support the party\u2019s argument that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable). Lastly, the agreement\u2019s terms were in normal typeface and font, and the agreement itself was only one page long. CP at 36-37. <em>See Luna, </em>236 F. Supp. 2d at 1176 (holding that one-page-long arbitration agreement with terms in newspaper size typeface did not support a finding that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b618 In the end, Zuver relies solely on her lack of bargaining power to assert that we should find the agreement procedurally unconscionable. This will not suffice. At minimum, an employee who asserts an arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable must show some evidence that the employer refused to respond to her questions or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>cerns, placed undue pressure on her to sign the agreement without providing her with a reasonable opportunity to consider its terms, and/or that the terms of the agreement were set forth in such a way that an average person could not understand them. <em>See Nelson, </em>127 Wn.2d at 135-36; <em>Schroeder, </em>86 Wn.2d at 261-62; <em>M.A. Mortenson Co., </em>140 Wn.2d at 588. Indeed, as the Fourth Circuit aptly reasoned, if a court found procedural unconscionability based solely on an employee\u2019s unequal bargaining power, that holding \u201ccould potentially apply to [invalidate] every contract of employment in our contemporary economy.\u201d <em>Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., </em>303 F.3d 496, 501 (4th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Substantive Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b619 Next, Zuver argues that the arbitration agreement\u2019s fee-splitting, attorney fees, confidentiality, and remedies limitations provisions are substantively unconscionable. Airtouch, however, asserts that Zuver improperly relies on California and the Ninth Circuit, and that, in any event, none of the cited provisions are substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>Fee-Splitting Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b620 Zuver claims that the fee-splitting provision in the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because \u201c \u2018[t]he arbitration process cannot generally require the employee to bear any <em>type </em>of expenses that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she was free to bring the action in court.\u2019 \u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 10 (quoting <em>Armendariz v.

Zuver contends that requiring her to split the arbitrator\u2019s fees would make the costs of her suit prohibitively expensive. Airtouch, on the other hand, argues that pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 91-92, Zuver has failed to meet her burden to produce evidence showing that this fee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>splitting provision makes arbitration prohibitively expensive. Airtouch also argues that, since it has offered to pay the arbitrator\u2019s fees in full, Zuver\u2019s argument is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b621 In <em>Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>the United States Supreme Court considered an argument similar to Zuver\u2019s. 531 U.S. at 91-92. There the petitioner, Randolph, argued that an arbitration agreement\u2019s fee-splitting provision effectively denied her a forum to vindicate her discrimination claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 90. The Court acknowledged that arbitration fees could prohibit employees from bringing their discrimination claims but held that \u201cwhere ... a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"> \u00b622 Like Randolph, Zuver offers no specific information about the arbitration fees she will be required to share and why such fees would effectively prohibit her from bringing her claims. Instead, she urges us to adopt the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Mendez, </em>111 Wn. App. 446. In that case the court considered whether a fee-splitting provision in an arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable. Applying the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>the court first held that the party seeking to avoid arbitration, Mendez, must provide evidence showing that arbitration would impose prohibitive costs. <em>Id. </em>at 461-62. At the trial court, Mendez had produced an affidavit describing his difficult financial circumstances and provided information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>obtained from the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (AAA) Seattle office, which stated that parties must generally pay a $2,000 initial filing fee for arbitrations. <em>Id. </em>at 465. The Court of Appeals found that this evidence sufficiently established that the fee-splitting provision was substantively unconscionable since it effectively barred Mendez from pursuing his $1,500 claim against the respondent, Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. <em>Id. </em>at 467-68. Notably, the court also stated that \u201c[office prohibitive costs are established, the opposing party must present contrary offsetting evidence to enforce arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. The court acknowledged that such evidence could include an offer to \u201cdefray the cost of arbitration pending the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Phillips v. Assocs. Home Equity Servs., Inc., </em>179 F. Supp. 2d 840, 846 (N.D. Ill. 2001); <em>Camacho v. Holiday Homes, Inc., </em>167 F. Supp. 2d 892, 897 n.3 (W.D. Va. 2001); <em>Zumpano v.

Pa.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b623 We agree with the <em>Mendez </em>court\u2019s approach for determining the conscionability of fee-splitting provisions insofar as it analyzes a fee-splitting provision in the context of the particular circumstances of the parties to the arbitration agreement, rather than finding such a provision to be per se unconscionable. <em>Accord Alexander v. Anthony Int\u2019l, L.P., </em>341 F.3d 256, 268-69 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that plaintiff must produce evidence showing an inability to pay and information regarding arbitration costs); <em>Shankle v.

Mgmt. of Colo., Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1230, 1235 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that plaintiff produced sufficient evidence showing that he could not afford the arbitrator\u2019s fees); <em>Bradford v. Rockwell Semiconductor Sys., Inc., </em>238 F.3d 549, 557-58 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding that plaintiff must produce specific evidence showing that he could not afford the arbitrator\u2019s fees). Nonetheless, although Zuver urges us to apply <em>Mendez </em>to her case, she has failed to provide any evidence here comparable to the affidavits and information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>produced by Mendez.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, even if Zuver had provided such evidence, Airtouch has offered to \u201cdefray the cost of arbitration\u201d by paying arbitration fees. <em>Mendez, </em>111 Wn.

Zuver argues that this provision is substantively unconscionable because it would dissuade individuals who have endured discrimination from pursuing their claims because an arbitrator might make them pay the employer\u2019s attorney fees if they failed to prevail. Zuver further asserts that in the event she does prevail, the arbitrator is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>obligated to award her attorney fees as would be required under RCW 49.60.030(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Airtouch, however, argues that this court cannot assume that the arbitrator would fail to abide by RCW 49.60.030(2), and that \u201cnothing in the Arbitration Agreement reduces Zuver\u2019s right to recover attorney\u2019s fees if she were to prevail on the merits.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b625 In instances such as this, where parties dispute the potential but unknown effect of a particular provision in an arbitration agreement, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pacificare Health Systems, Inc. v. Book, </em>538 U.S. 401, 123 S. Ct. 1531, 155 L. Ed. 2d 578 (2003), provides guidance. There the Court considered an arbitration agreement which stated \u201c \u2018[t]he arbitrators . . . shall have no authority to award any. . . punitive or exemplary damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405 (quoting App. 212). But the party opposing arbitration, Book, alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), which provides for treble damage awards. <em>Id. </em>at 406. Book argued that the arbitration agreement\u2019s prohibition on punitive damages would effectively deny him the relief he was entitled to under RICO, i.e., treble damages. <em>Id. </em>at 404. The Court, however, noted that it had construed RICO\u2019s treble damages to be both punitive <em>and </em>remedial in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 406. Consequently, it reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[W]e should not, on the basis of \u201cmere speculation\u201d that an arbitrator might interpret these ambiguous agreements in a manner that casts their enforceability into doubt, take upon ourselves the authority to decide the antecedent question of how the ambiguity is to be resolved. In short, since we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties\u2019 agreements unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 406-07 (footnote and citation omitted) (quoting <em>Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. v.

Thus, the Court compelled arbitration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b626 Similar to the punitive damages provision in <em>Pacificare, </em>the effect of the attorney fees provision in Zuver and Airtouch\u2019s agreement is, at this point, purely speculative. The provision does not use the directive \u201cshall\u201d but rather, uses the permissive word \u201cmay.\u201d CP at 36. Thus, Zuver <em>merely speculates </em>that an arbitrator might construe this provision to deny her attorney fees if she prevails on her discrimination claim. <em>See Pacificare, </em>538 U.S. at 406-07. Likewise, it is mere speculation to assume that the arbitrator would disregard case law holding that a prevailing defendant may receive attorney fees only if a plaintiff\u2019s discrimination claim was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S. Ct. 694, 54 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1978), <em>cited with approval in Wash. State Republican Party v. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n, </em>141 Wn.2d 245, 289, 4 P.3d 808 (2000). Consequently, we conclude that this attorney fees provision is not substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Confidentiality Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b627 Relying on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ting v. AT&amp;T, </em>319 F.3d 1126, 1151-52 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 811 (2003), and a federal district court decision applying Washington law, <em>Luna, </em>236 F. Supp. 2d at 1180-81, Zuver asserts that the confidentiality provision unduly favors Airtouch and thus is substantively unconscionable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Ting, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that an arbitration agreement\u2019s confidentiality provision was unconscionable because \u201cAT&amp;T ha[d] placed itself in a far superior legal posture by ensuring that none of its potential opponents have access to precedent while, at the same time, AT&amp;T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>accumulates a wealth of knowledge on how to negotiate the terms of its own unilaterally crafted contract.\u201d 319 F.3d at 1152. <em>See also Torrance v. Aames Funding Corp., </em>242 F. Supp. 2d 862, 875 (D. Or. 2002) (holding that confidentiality provision in an arbitration agreement appended to a mortgage contract would give mortgagors \u201ca vastly superior legal posture\u201d). Similarly, in <em>Luna, </em>the court there held that a confidentiality provision in an arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable since \u201crepeat arbitration participants enjoy advantages over one-time participants [and] the . . . confidentiality provision magnifies the effect of those advantages.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 236 F. Supp. 2d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b628 In response, Airtouch urges us to adopt the analysis articulated by the California Court of Appeal in <em>Woodside Homes of California, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>107 Cal. App. 4th 723, 731-32, 132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 35 (2003). There the court considered whether a confidentiality provision in a contract between two sophisticated parties was substantively unconscionable. The party seeking to void the contract argued that the confidentiality provision would impair the public\u2019s interest in open proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 732. The court rejected its argument, reasoning that \u201c[t]hese concerns have nothing to say about the fairness or desirability of a secrecy provision with respect to the parties themselves, and we see nothing unreasonable or prejudicial about it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b629 However, unlike the party in <em>Woodside Homes, </em>Zuver does not argue that the public interest in open arbitration proceedings <em>alone </em>renders this provision substantively unconscionable. Rather, she contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>effect of this confidentiality provision is harsh and blatantly benefits only Airtouch because it \u201cserves no purpose other than to tilt the scales of justice in favor of the employer by denying access to any information about other claims against the employer to other potential victims of discrimination.\u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 20. Consequently, we do not find the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Woodside Homes </em>compelling in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b630 Airtouch alternatively argues that since confidentiality provisions are routinely included in arbitration agreements, such provisions cannot be substantively unconscionable. <em>See State Bd. of Labor Relations v. Freedom of Info. Comm\u2019n, </em>244 Conn. 487, 500, 709 A.2d 1129 (1998) (holding that arbitration proceedings before a public mediation board could be confidential); <em>Lloyd v. Hovensa LLC, </em>243 F. Supp. 2d 346, 351-52 (D.V.I. 2003) (noting that AAA rules provide that arbitrations can be confidential), <em>overruled on other grounds by </em>369 F.3d 263 (3d Cir. 2004). Indeed, this court has acknowledged that arbitrations are often confidential. <em>See Barnett v. Hicks, </em>119 Wn.2d 151, 159, 829 P.2d 1087 (1992) (noting that confidential proceedings in arbitrations are an exception to the state constitutional requirement that judicial proceedings be public). Parties in labor arbitrations also routinely include confidentiality provisions in their collective bargaining agreements. <em>See Cole v. Burns Int\u2019l Sec. Servs., </em>105 F.3d 1465, 1477 (D.C. Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b631 Nonetheless, although courts have accepted confidentiality provisions in many agreements, it does not necessarily follow that <em>this </em>confidentiality provision is conscionable. As the court aptly noted in <em>Cole,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">[W]hile a lack of public disclosure of arbitration awards is acceptable in the collective bargaining context, because both employers and unions monitor such decisions and the awards rarely involve issues of concern to persons other than the parties, in the context of individual statutory claims, a lack of public disclosure may systematically favor companies over individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1477. The effect of the provision here benefits only Airtouch. As written, the provision hampers an employee\u2019s ability to prove a pattern of discrimination or to take advantage of findings in past arbitrations. Moreover, keeping past findings secret undermines an employee\u2019s confidence in the fairness and honesty of the arbitration process and thus potentially discourages that employee from pursuing a valid discrimination claim. Therefore, we hold that this confidentiality provision is substantively unconscionable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\n<em>Remedies Limitation Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b632 Citing Armendariz, 24 Cal. 4th at 119-20, Zuver also argues that the agreement\u2019s provision stating, \u201cyou hereby waive and release all rights to recover punitive or exemplary damages in connection with any common law claims, including claims arising in tort or contract, against U.S. West,\u201d is substantively unconscionable because it applies only to her, i.e., the provision is unilateral.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> CP at 36. In <em>Armendariz, </em>the California Supreme Court held that an arbitration provision which required that the employee arbitrate his wrongful discharge claims but did not require the employer \u201cto arbitrate all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences,\u201d is not bilateral and is thus substantively unconscionable. 24 Cal. 4th at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b633 Similar to the employee in <em>Armendariz, </em>Zuver contends that the provision in her agreement pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>punitive or exemplary damages fails to equally apply to Airtouch, e.g., Airtouch could still seek punitive or exemplary damages against her for claims based on disclosure of confidential information in Colorado,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which pursuant to the agreement is the substantive law governing all common law claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Rubenstein v.

NCR Corp., </em>254 F. Supp. 2d 847 (S.D. Ohio 2003), Airtouch contends that complete mutuality of remedies is not required in arbitration agreements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b634 In <em>Raasch, </em>a federal district court considered Raasch\u2019s assertion that her arbitration agreement did not impose mutual obligations since it excluded disputes over confidentiality, noncompete agreements, or intellectual property rights. 254 F. Supp. 2d at 855. The court rejected Raasch\u2019s claim, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Mutuality requires only that both Raasch and NCR be bound to the terms of any dispute that is required to be submitted to the arbitrator. . . . That is all that is required insofar as mutuality of obligation is concerned; nothing in that doctrine requires that just because both parties agree to arbitrate discrimination disputes and the like they must also agree to arbitrate every other type of dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 856-57. <em>See also In re FirstMerit Bank, N.A., 52 </em>S.W.3d 749, 757 (Tex. 2001); <em>Harris v.

Park Dist. of Tacoma v. Griffith, </em>106 Wn.2d 425, 434, 723 P.2d 1093 (1986) (\u201cA supposed promise is illusory when its provisions make its performance optional or discretionary on the part of the claimed promisor.\u201d) (citing <em>Wharf Rest., Inc. v.

We agree.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, this provision appears to heavily favor Airtouch. It bars Zuver from collecting any punitive or exemplary damages for her common law claims but permits Airtouch to claim these damages for the only type of suit it would likely ever bring against Zuver, that is, for breach of her duty of nondisclosure of Airtouch\u2019s confidential information. The remedies limitation provision blatantly and excessively favors the employer in that it allows the employer alone access to a significant legal recourse. Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>quently, we conclude that this provision is substantively unconscionable in these circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\n<em>Attorney Fees Provision\u2014Nonarbitration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b637 Lastly, Zuver challenges the attorney fees provision requiring that a party who files a judicial action must pay attorney fees and costs to the opposing party who successfully stays such action and/or compels arbitration.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> She asserts that this provision is substantively unconscionable because it \u201cdiscourage [s] an employee from bringing a discrimination claim,\u201d and in her case, she \u201cis faced with the prospect of having to pay Respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, which could well be tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 32. However, as Airtouch aptly notes, this provision permits <em>either </em>party to recover fees on a successful motion to stay an action and/or compel arbitration. Thus, it does not appear to be so one-sided and harsh as to render it substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">SEVERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b638 Zuver argues that the taint of the unconscionable provisions requires us to declare the entire arbitration agreement unenforceable despite its severability clause. Conversely, Airtouch argues that pursuant to the agreement\u2019s severability clause, we should simply strike any unconscionable provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number> \u00b639 We agree with Airtouch. Courts are generally loath to upset the terms of an agreement and strive to give effect to the intent of the parties. <em>See Tanner Elec. Coop. v. Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., </em>128 Wn.2d 656, 674, 911 P.2d 1301 (1996). Consequently, when parties have agreed to a severability clause in an arbitration agreement, courts often strike the offending unconscionable provisions to preserve the contract\u2019s essential term of arbitration. <em>See </em>Daniel P. O\u2019meara, Arbitration of Employment Disputes \u00a7 4.22 (2002) (citing <em>Wright v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>82 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1287 (N.D. Ala. 2000); <em>Etokie v. Carmax Auto Superstores, Inc., </em>133 F. Supp. 2d 390, 394 (D. Md. 2000)); <em>see also Spinetti v. Serv. Corp. Int'l, </em>324 F.3d 212, 221-22 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that unconscionable fee-splitting and attorney fees provisions could be severed from the agreement even in the absence of a severability clause); <em>Morrison v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>317 F.3d 646, 675 (6th Cir. 2003) (holding that unconscionable fee-splitting and remedies provisions could be severed); <em>Gannon v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>262 F.3d 677, 683 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding that unconscionable damages provision could be severed to preserve the parties\u2019 \u201ccontractual intent to arbitrate\u201d). Although some courts have declined to sever unconscionable provisions where those provisions pervade an agreement, here we are faced with only two unconscionable provisions. <em>Cf. Alexander, </em>341 F.3d at 271 (\u201cThe cumulative effect of so much illegality prevents us from enforcing the arbitration agreement.\u201d); <em>Ingle, </em>328 F.3d at 1180 (\u201cAny earnest attempt to ameliorate the unconscionable aspects of Circuit City\u2019s arbitration agreement would require this court to assume the role of contract author rather than interpreter.\u201d). We can easily excise the confidentiality and remedies provisions but enforce the remainder. Indeed, the parties have explicitly expressed their intent for us to do so by agreeing to a severance clause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, we sever the confidentiality and remedies provisions from the agreement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>otherwise affirm the trial court\u2019s order to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">ADDITIONAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"> \u00b640 Zuver also argues that the arbitration agreement deprives her of her state constitutional right to access the courts; the WLAD requires a judicial forum to litigate discrimination claims; her state constitutional right to a jury trial was violated; and, Airtouch waived its right to arbitrate. Zuver, however, failed to raise these issues to the trial court or in her motion for discretionary review to this court. As such, we decline to consider these issues here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See John Doe v.

Initially, a review of petitioner\u2019s briefs leaves me in doubt that Zuver\u2019s argument is as the majority states. In any event, the majority ultimately determines that the term is substantively unconscionable because it is one-sided. The majority says that the only common law claim that employer Airtouch would ever be likely to bring against Zuver is for breach of a duty of nondisclosure of confidential information, and punitive or exemplary damages are available for that claim. Majority at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b648 Although couched in terms of unconscionability, the majority effectively reasons that the provision is invalid because the employee must forgo punitive or exemplary damages, while the employer does not forgo such damages in the only likely case where the employer might bring a common law claim. In other words, the clause is invalid for lack of reciprocal obligations, i.e., lack of mutuality of obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b649 Because mutuality of obligation is not required as a matter of state contract law, the absence of such mutuality is not a legitimate basis for invalidating an arbitration clause in this state. The FAA\u2019s purpose, the United States Supreme Court has said, is \u201cto place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts.\u201d <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 33, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991). Arbitration agreements must be enforced \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, since lack of mutuality of obligation is not a basis on which to invalidate contracts in Washington, it is not a basis on which an arbitration clause can be invalidated. And a claim of lack of mutual obligations, here, mutual remedies, should not be a basis for overturning an arbitration clause merely because it is recast as a claim of substantive unconscionability. In the end, the majority\u2019s analysis circumvents the FAA\u2019s requirement that arbitration agreements be assessed under the same state law principles applying to contracts generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b650 By finding substantive unconscionability here, the majority\u2019s decision opens the gates to claims of unconscionability in employment arbitration agreements whenever a one-sided clause is alleged, regardless of the arbitration agreement as a whole and the employment contract as a whole. The United States Supreme Court has made it clear, however, that employment arbitration agreements are enforceable, except for those covering workers engaged in transportation. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00b651 Perhaps more disturbing, the majority\u2019s conclusion is inconsistent with the doctrine of substantive unconscionability. This court has stated that substantive unconscionability requires a determination that the clause or term in the contract is \u201cone-sided or overly harsh.\u201d <em>Schroeder v. Fageol Motors, Inc., </em>86 Wn.2d 256, 260, 544 P.2d 20 (1975). This statement, however, should not be invoked to impose a requirement of mutuality of obligation; mere one-sidedness of a term resulting from one party\u2019s incurring an obligation where no reciprocal obligation is incurred by the other party should not be enough to conclude that a clause is substantively unconscionable. Other terms used to describe substantive unconscionability provide guidance. The term must be \u201coverly harsh,\u201d or, as has also been stated, \u201c \u2018[s]hocking to the conscience\u2019, \u2018monstrously harsh\u2019, [or] \u2018exceedingly calloused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. McGoldrick, </em>127 Wn.2d 124, 131, 896 P.2d 1258 (1995) (quoting <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Annuity Bd. of S. Baptist Convention, </em>16 Wn. App. 439, 444, 556 P.2d 552 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b652 This arbitration agreement prohibits recovery of punitive or exemplary damages for successful claims under Colorado\u2019s common law. While there are clearly common law claims that an employee might bring against an employer, where a Washington employee is concerned, there are also numerous potential statutory claims that must be brought under Washington law and for which no punitive or exemplary damages are available. Comparing the employee\u2019s potential claims against Airtouch, including statutory claims, against the limited category of claims where Airtouch might recover punitive or exemplary damages under Colorado common law, I cannot agree that the remedies limitation provision is overly harsh or shocking to the conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b653 Next, the majority correctly rejects Zuver\u2019s argument for a special standard applicable to employment arbitration agreements. Majority at 315 n.12 (rejecting apparent claim that a standard analogous to that for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>consumer transactions should apply); <em>see </em>Reply Br. of Pet\u2019r at 16-17. However, Zuver makes another argument that should also be rejected. She suggests that the arbitration process will not provide her an appropriate forum allowing her to fully and effectively vindicate her rights because under the arbitration agreement, she is precluded from an award of punitive or exemplary damages, and therefore the remedies limitation provision is substantively unconscionable. She cites <em>Gilmer </em>and other similar cases. In <em>Gilmer, </em>the Court held that an age discrimination claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621--634, was subject to compulsory arbitration pursuant to an agreement in a securities registration application. The Court observed, in a passage relied on by Zuver, that \u201c \u2018[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilmer, </em>500 U.S. at 26 (quoting <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b654 It is unnecessary to decide in this case whether an employee can ever waive statutory rights in an arbitration agreement because Gilmer\u2019s discussion of statutory rights clearly does not support Zuver\u2019s argument. The arbitration clause waives only the right to punitive and exemplary damages in common law actions under Colorado law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b655 Zuver also relies on <em>State ex rel. Dunlap v. Berger, </em>211 W. Va. 549, 562, 567 S.E.2d 265, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Friedman\u2019s, Inc. v. West Virginia ex rel. Dunlap, </em>537 U.S. 1087 (2002), where the court said that a \u201cno punitive damages\u201d provision deprived the plaintiff of the \u201cright to invoke and employ an important remedy provided by law to punish and deter illegal, willful, and grossly negligent misconduct.\u201d <em>Dunlap, </em>211 W. Va. at 562. The court held that \u201cexculpatory provisions in a contract of adhesion that if applied would prohibit or substantially limit a person from enforcing and vindicating rights and protections or from seeking and obtaining statutory or common-law relief and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>remedies\u201d under state law existing for \u201cthe benefit and protection of the public are unconscionable.\u201d <em>Dunlap, </em>211 W. Va. at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b656 Zuver fails to acknowledge, however, that in Washington an exculpatory clause is valid unless, among other things not relevant here, it violates public policy. <em>Scott v. Pac. W. Mountain Resort, </em>119 Wn.2d 484, 492, 834 P.2d 6 (1992). A contract provision forgoing punitive damages is not against public policy in this state. <em>See, e.g., Spokane Truck &amp; Dray Co. v. Hoefer, </em>2 Wash. 45, 25 P. 1072 (1891) (punitive damages not awardable in personal injury action); <em>Farrar v. Tribune Publ\u2019g Co., </em>57 Wn.2d 549, 552-53, 358 P.2d 792 (1961) (defamation claim; exemplary damages unknown to Washington law); <em>Fisher Props., Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., </em>106 Wn.2d 826, 852, 726 P.2d 8 (1986) (punitive damages are not awardable unless authorized by the legislature).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b657 Further, the policy bases in the case that Zuver relies on, punishment and deterrence, <em>Dunlap, </em>211 W. Va. at 562, do not support invalidation of the remedies limitation provision on grounds of substantive unconscionability under Washington law. In <em>Barr v. Interbay Citizens Bank of Tampa, Fla., </em>96 Wn.2d 692, 635 P.2d 441, 649 P.2d 827 (1981), the plaintiff brought an action for conversion of an automobile, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and outrageous conduct, as a result of events that flowed from a bank\u2019s issuance of clear title to the prior owner of the automobile rather than to the purchaser. The plaintiff sought punitive damages under Florida law, where the vehicle was purchased and the bank was located. The trial court ruled that Washington, not Florida, law would apply to the claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b658 This court affirmed. The court observed that Florida\u2019s interest in a punitive damage award is punishment of the defendant and deterrence to similar misconduct. <em>Barr, </em>96 Wn.2d at 699. The court reasoned, however, that Florida\u2019s interest in allowing punitive damages to deter similar misconduct would not be furthered where the acts said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>warrant punitive damages had not occurred in Florida, but instead had occurred in Washington and Nevada. <em>Id. </em>The court reiterated the rule that punitive damages are not allowed in Washington unless expressly authorized by the legislature. <em>Barr, </em>96 Wn.2d at 699. Quoting <em>Spokane Truck &amp; Dray Co., </em>2 Wash, at 52-53, the court also explained that exclusive of punitive damages, the plaintiff \u201c \u00a3is made entirely whole\u2019 \u201d through full compensation for all injury done and all losses sustained. <em>Barr, </em>96 Wn.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b659 As <em>Barr </em>demonstrates, Washington does not have the same interest that West Virginia has in punitive damage awards to punish and deter wrongdoing. Accordingly, <em>Dunlap </em>is unpersuasive. Moreover, as <em>Barr </em>also indicates, any similar interest Colorado may have in punishment and deterrence would not be furthered by invalidating this remedies limitation provision which applies to a Washington resident and events occurring in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b660 It simply does not matter that the common law claims potentially affected by the remedies limitation provision would be brought under Colorado common law. The question that Zuver raises is whether under this state\u2019s contract law the remedies limitation provision is unconscionable because it insulates Airtouch from paying punitive damages on common law claims and is, therefore, against public policy. On this question, the reasoning of the West Virginia court that Zuver advances is not in accord with this state\u2019s law on exculpatory clauses or punitive damages.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b661 I dissent, in part, from the majority opinion because it invalidates the remedies limitation provision as substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Johnson, J., concurs with Madsen, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> The majority also invalidates the confidentiality provision of the arbitration agreement on unconscionability grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\"> The <em>Restatement </em>also addresses the doctrine of \u201cmutuality of remedy,\u201d under which courts will not order an equitable remedy unless it is available to both, stating: \u201cthe law does not require that the parties have similar remedies in case of breach, and the fact that specific performance or an injunction is not available to one party is not a sufficient reason for refusing [to apply] it to the other party.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second) op Contracts \u00a7 363 cmt. c (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> The term \u201cmutuality of obligation\u201d is to be distinguished from the requirement that the parties to a contract make mutual promises to each other and the requirement that there be mutual assent to a contract. <em>See </em>Arthur M.

Ed. 2d 76 (1995) (applying principles of contract interpretation to decide whether an arbitration contract precluded an award of punitive damages and concluding it did not); <em>Volt Info.
