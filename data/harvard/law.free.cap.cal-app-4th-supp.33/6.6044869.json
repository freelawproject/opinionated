Absent the survey, we conclude that the officer is incompetent to testify as to the speed of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, even if his testimony is confined to his visual determination of that speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">Officer Bivens of the City of Orange Police Department testified that he visually estimated defendant Michael A. Conzelman\u2019s speed as exceeding the posted 35-mile-per-hour speed limit <em>before </em>using his hand-held radar unit. The defendant objected to further testimony as to his speed because Officer Bivens had not produced either the original or a copy of the engineering and traffic survey for the relevant portion of Tustin Avenue. Officer Bivens thereafter testified that he issued the citation to the defendant based on his independent determination of the defendant\u2019s speed, not on his use of the hand-held radar unit. He stated that, based on the knowledge from his many years of experience as a police officer, he was able to determine by observation that the defendant\u2019s speed was 51 miles per hour. The defendant was convicted of violating Vehicle Code section 22350.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">This is the classic speed trap prosecution: The citing officer had used a hand-held radar unit to enforce a posted speed limit and subsequently issued a speed citation. At trial, the People did not demonstrate that the posted speed limit was justified by a current engineering and traffic survey as required by Vehicle Code sections 40802, subdivision (b) and 40803, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">In support of the judgment, the People argue that the speed trap laws (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40801-40808) do not apply to this prosecution, since the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>court found the defendant guilty of driving at 51 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone derived only from Officer Bevins\u2019s visually based opinion of defendant\u2019s speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Vehicle Code sections 40801-40808 illustrate the Legislature\u2019s antipathy toward speed traps (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 56, 58-59 [285 Cal.Rptr. 553] and, in view of that disapproval, it seems inappropriate for the People to assert that the enforcement provisions of the speed trap laws can be avoided so long as the citing officer testifies that he visually estimated a speed in excess of the posted limit\u2014even where there is no question that radar was being used to enforce a posted speed limit and even where the People do not demonstrate that the posted speed limit is justified by a current traffic and engineering survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">Such an argument is inconsistent with the plain language of the statutes. Vehicle Code section 40801 provides that \u201c. . . nor shall any speed trap be used in securing evidence as to the speed of any vehicle for the purpose of an arrest or prosecution under this code.\u201d Vehicle Code section 40802, subdivision (b) defines a \u201cspeed trap\u201d as a section of roadway where enforcement of a prima facie speed limit that is not justified by a current traffic and engineering survey \u201cinvolves the use of radar.\u201d Vehicle Code section 40803, subdivision (a) prohibits the admission, in a prosecution for speeding, of any \u201cevidence as to the speed of a vehicle . . . when the evidence is based upon or obtained from or by the maintenance or use of a speedtrap.\u201d Vehicle Code section 40803, subdivision (b) requires the People to establish, as part of their prima facie case, that the testimony or evidence presented in the prosecution of a speeding offense is not based upon a speed trap where enforcement \u201cinvolves the use of radar.\u201d Vehicle Code section 40804, subdivision (a) makes a witness incompetent to testify in a speeding prosecution \u201cif the testimony is based upon or obtained from or by the maintenance or use of a speed trap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">We conclude that a speed trap is \u201cmaintained or used\u201d and radar is \u201cinvolved\u201d when an officer monitors traffic in a posted speed zone with a radar unit and the posted speed is not justified by a valid traffic survey. The speed trap does not disappear whenever that officer makes a visual estimate of a vehicle\u2019s speed. It would not make sense if all the legislative restrictions of the speed trap laws could be avoided so long as the officer using the radar could testify that he visually estimated a vehicle\u2019s speed before citing the driver for exceeding a posted speed limit, notwithstanding the involvement of the radar speed detectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Goulet </em>(1992) 13 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 801], the citing officer testified that he visually estimated Ms. Goulet\u2019s speed at 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>to 55 miles per hom: and testified that his radar unit established her speed as 52 miles per hour. Concluding that the speed trap laws applied whenever a posted speed limit was enforced with radar, even where there was an independent visual observation of a defendant\u2019s speed, the <em>Goulet </em>court said, at Supplement pages 6-7: \u201cWe are aware that, in unpublished decisions, other panels of this appellate department have distinguished <em>[People </em>v. <em>Halopoff </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 (131 Cal.Rptr. 531) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Sterritt </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 (135 Cal.Rptr. 522)] on that basis. We conclude that such a distinction is in error. Sections 40802, subdivision (b) and 40803, subdivision (b) both apply \u2018where enforcement <em>involves </em>the use of radar.\u2019 (Italics added.) These sections do <em>not </em>say that they apply <em>only </em>where enforcement is <em>exclusively </em>based on the use of radar.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">An opinion from the Appellate Department of the Ventura Superior Court is not binding in Orange County <em>(People </em>v. <em>Corners </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139, 146 [122 Cal.Rptr. 387]; also see 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal \u00a7 777, p. 747).  However, we agree with the <em>Goulet </em>court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">In the present case, radar was involved in the enforcement of a posted speed limit and the People failed to demonstrate that the posted speed limit was justified by a current traffic and engineering survey. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40802, subd. (b) &amp; 40803, subd. (b).) Officer Bevins was therefore incompetent to testify as to appellant\u2019s speed. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40804, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">McDonald, Acting P.
