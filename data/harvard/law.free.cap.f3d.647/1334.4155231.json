Specifically, a Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) severed veteran Keith A. Roberts\u2019s benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) after an investigation revealed that Roberts provided fraudulent statements in connection with his claim. Those fraudulent statements related to the sole in-service stressor the RO identified when awarding benefits in 1998. As it relates to this appeal, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) found that the severance was proper, and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d), sitting en banc, affirmed. <em>See Roberts v. Shinseki, </em>23 Vet.App. 416 (2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">Because Roberts, represented by counsel, challenges only discrete aspects of the Veterans Court decision, the issues on appeal are narrow. The first is whether the VA and the Board erred by severing Roberts\u2019s benefits in accordance with the VA\u2019s regulations rather than pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (\u201cPFCRA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801 <em>et seq. </em>The second is whether the VA was required to review Roberts\u2019s medical records for alternate stressors before severing his benefits, when the only stressor cited in his ratings decision, and the underlying PTSD examination, was found to be fraudulent. Because the Veterans Court correctly decided that the Board did not err in its decision on either issue, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Roberts served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1968 to December 1971, spending the majority of his service stationed at a Naval Air Facility in Naples, Italy. During a March 1991 psychiatric examination at a VA medical center, Roberts reported that he witnessed the death of a friend, Gary Holland, in an accident at an airplane hangar while they were stationed together in Naples. The accident occurred on February 4, 1969. According to the medical report, Roberts indicated that part of a plane fell on and crushed Holland, and that Roberts \u201cwas arrested for damaging the plane while trying to extricate his friend.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJA\u201d) 1062. The examiner noted that \u201cnothing appears in the service records about this incident.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Roberts also reported during the same examination that, in a separate incident on December 13, 1969, he was \u201carrested, placed in a straight jacket and restraints by shore patrol.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Roberts\u2019s clinical records corroborate that incident, indicating that, after having a few drinks, Roberts became annoyed when shore patrol asked him questions and for identification, fled and fell into a ditch, and then became \u201ccombative and assaultive\u201d when taken to the dispensary. JA 969. The examiner diagnosed Roberts as having dysthymia with irritability and mixed personality disorder with antisocial and borderline features.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">A. <em>Roberts\u2019s Award of Disability Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In August 1993, Roberts submitted a claim for disability compensation for an acute personality disorder, which he amended in February 1994 to include service connection for PTSD. In support of his claim, he submitted a letter to the RO in which he detailed the events of the death of his \u201cvery good friend\u201d Gary Holland in 1969. JA 1185-86. In the letter, Roberts reported that Holland was working on a plane when Holland\u2019s coat became entangled on a safety pin on the plane, releasing the safety pin and causing a piece of the plane to fall on and crush Holland. Roberts went on to write the following;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">I proceeded to sound the alarm, ran over to the plane to assess the situation at which time I found Gary still conscious and coherent. I informed him I would get him out and then proceeded to run next door to the Ground Support Unit, informed a chief petty officer of the situation and ordered him to bring a cherry picker to the front of the hanger [sic] to lift the plane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">As I was returning to the hanger [sic] I confronted my 1st class superior and informed him to place a ladder at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>rear hatch of the plane and load men into the tail section to relieve the front[.] I then proceeded to the front of the plane and instructed the [ground support engineering] chief to puncture the radome of the plane to lift it up[.] [A]t this time a [lieutenant commander] who informed me he was the safety officer ordered me to stop [and] when I refused, he had me placed on arrest by a Marine guard[.] The [lieutenant commander] then proceeded to have air bags placed under the plane to lift it (this took approx 10-12 minutes, my method would have taken only a few minutes). The [lieutenant commander] stated that it was more important to save the plane than it was to save the man. When the plane had risen enough [...], I broke away from the guard and I and another shipmate proceeded under the plane and extradited [sic] Gary to an awaiting corpsman who gave Gary a shot of Adren[a]lin[e] in the heart and revived him. He was then transported by chopper to the NATO Hospital where he passed away the next day (brain dead).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">I have always believed Gary would have lived had I not be[en] thwarted in my rescue attempts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">JA 1185-86. In March 1998, Roberts underwent a VA PTSD examination and again reported the death of Gary Holland as a traumatic stressor. The examiner diagnosed Roberts with, among other things, chronic PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">A few months later, in May 1998, the RO awarded Roberts a 50% disability rating for service-connected PTSD, effective August 4,1993. The Rating Decision cited only one stressor to support its determination that Roberts\u2019s PTSD was directly related to military service \u2014 Roberts\u2019s presence at and role in the accident that caused Gary Holland\u2019s death. JA 1285-91. Roberts disagreed with the disability rating, and, in May 1999, the VA awarded him a 100% disability rating for PTSD with dysthymia and depression, effective August 4, 1993. The Rating Decision noted that \u201c[t]he veteran reported that he thinks about the traumatic event of his friend\u2019s death three to four times each month at the minimum and when he is reminded of the event he can think of the events weekly or more.\u201d JA 1308. Roberts also stated that \u201che is preoccupied with the trauma for six to seven days at a time,\u201d and he reported \u201cincreased problems with anger control and that he has nightmares of the death of his friend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 2002, Roberts requested reconsideration of his effective date. Ultimately, the RO changed his effective date to July 16, 1992, a date with which Roberts again disagreed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">B. <em>The OIG Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACs\">In January 2004, Roberts complained by telephone to the VA Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) that the VA had mishandled his claim. Thereafter, in July 2004, the OIG investigated Roberts\u2019s claim and issued a lengthy report, which found that Roberts\u2019s statements about his presence at and involvement in the accident that caused Gary Holland\u2019s death were not supported by the record. Specifically, the OIG found that the Navy Judge Advocate General (\u201cJAG\u201d) Corp report of the 1969 accident did not list Roberts\u2019s name anywhere, and that Roberts was not men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>tioned in any of the nineteen witness statements about the accident. Several of the witnesses the OIG interviewed stated that Roberts worked in a different shop and was not present at the accident. Holland\u2019s roommate reported that neither he nor Holland were friendly with Roberts. The OIG also interviewed Roberts in connection with its investigation, and reported that Roberts maintained his version of the events and \u201cbegan to yell and curse\u201d when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statements. JA 2554. The OIG provided the investigation report to the RO, the VA Secretary\u2019s office, and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">C. <em>Severance of Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On August 18, 2004, the RO sent Roberts a notification proposing to sever his benefits on the basis of fraud. The letter outlined the findings contained in the OIG report and informed Roberts that the RO found Roberts\u2019s statements regarding Gary Holland\u2019s death to be fraudulent. In response, Roberts submitted a statement requesting that the VA refrain from severing his benefits until the proposed severance can be appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals. On November 10, 2004, the RO issued a decision severing Roberts\u2019s benefits on the basis of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Roberts appealed the RO\u2019s decision to the Board, which affirmed the decision to sever benefits pursuant to a two-step inquiry. First, it found fraud on the basis of the OIG investigation, such that Roberts\u2019s benefits were subject to severance even though they were in effect for more than 10 years. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.957 (benefits in effect for more than 10 years \u201cwill not be severed except upon a showing that the original grant was based on fraud ... \u201d). Next, under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.105(d), the Board found that the government established that there was CUE in the original RO decision granting benefits. The Board also rejected Roberts\u2019s argument that the VA should have considered his December 1969 shore patrol incident as a possible stressor before severing benefits. It found that \u201cno additional stressors were in fact presented to the VA in connection with the veteran\u2019s initial claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.\u201d JA 931. It also noted that the May 1998 rating decision cited only the death of Gary Holland as a stressor, as did the March 1998 examination report on which the rating decision was based. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">On April 23, 2010, the Veterans Court issued an en banc decision with two separate opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part. <em>See Roberts v. Shinseki, </em>23 Vet.App. 416 (2010) (en banc). The majority affirmed the severance of benefits based on fraud but found that the CUE analysis of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.105(d) does not apply to severance proceedings alleging fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 424-29. In the absence of any specific regulation governing severance based on fraud, the court found that general due process safeguards of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.103 set out the applicable procedures. As it pertains to this appeal, the Veterans Court was unanimous in rejecting Roberts\u2019s argument that the VA was required to refer allegations of fraud to an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>to the PFCRA. <em>Id. </em>at 424. The court found that, \u201cunder \u00a7 42 of the implementing regulation, no allegations of liability may be referred to an ALJ if the false claims or false statements resulted in a monetary gain of more than $150,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.6(a)(2) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(c)(1)). Because Roberts received over $320,000 in VA benefits, the Veterans Court found no error in not referring this case to an ALJ under the PFCRA. <em>Id. </em>The Veterans Court also upheld the Board\u2019s determination that the VA was not required to consider evidence of alternate stressors before severing Roberts\u2019s benefits, noting that Roberts failed to provide evidence of additional stressors within the 60-day period to do so. <em>Roberts, </em>23 Vet.App. at 429-30. The court also noted that Roberts could pursue a separate claim based on any additional stressors, but that, in this case, \u201cthe Board did not adjudicate a claim for service connection for PTSD based on stressors <em>other than </em>the stressor found to be fraudulent (e.g., the shore patrol incident) and was not required to do so as part of the severance proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, n. 6 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">D. <em>Criminal Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Contemporaneous with the VAs proceedings to sever Roberts\u2019s benefits, Roberts was indicted on five counts of wire fraud, based on allegations that he \u201cdid knowingly devise and participate in a scheme to defraud the VA of compensation benefits,\u201d and that, \u201c[a]s a result, Roberts wrongfully obtained from the VA in excess of $320,000.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>Case No. 05cr118, 2005 WL 4896936 (E.D.Wis. Sept. 13, 2005) (superseding indictment, ECF No. 32-2). A jury convicted Roberts on all five counts, and the district court sentenced Roberts to 48 months imprisonment and ordered restitution in the amount of $262,943.52. <em>Id. </em>at ECF Nos. 150, 171. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, rejecting, among others, Roberts\u2019s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Veterans Court possesses exclusive jurisdiction to review Board decisions. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>534 F.3d 560, 567-68 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Our review of Veterans Court decisions is limited by statute. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may review \u201cthe validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d Unless the appeal presents a constitutional issue, we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). We review legal determinations by the Veterans Court under a de novo standard. <em>See Arzio v. Shinseki, </em>602 F.3d 1343, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The Veterans Court\u2019s decision that the PFCRA does not require the VA to refer this matter to an ALJ is a decision involving a statutory interpretation and, thus, is within our jurisdiction to review. In addition, the question of whether the VA, in the context of a severance proceeding, must consider evidence of alternate stressors before severing benefits that were awarded on the basis of a single, fraudulent stressor, is a challenge to a rule of law that is also within our jurisdiction to review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ACf\">A. <em>The PFCRA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The PFCRA was enacted in 1986 to allow administrative agencies to pursue remedies for false or fraudulent claims for benefits or payments. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802; <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United, States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U.S. 765, 786, n. 17, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000); <em>Orfanos v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Sens., </em>896 F.Supp. 23, 24-25 (D.D.C.1995). The statute subjects violators to a civil penalty of $5,000 per claim and to an assessment, in lieu of damages, of up to twice the amount of such claim. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.3(a). According to the VAs implementing regulations, allegations of liability under the PFCRA are referred to the VA OIG, who conducts an investigation and reports to the VA General Counsel. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.4. If the General Counsel believes there is adequate evidence of liability, the General Counsel can only issue a complaint under this regulatory scheme after providing written notice to the Attorney General of its intentions and after receiving a statement of approval from the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 42.5, 42.6. After the General Counsel issues a complaint and receives an answer, the matter is referred to an ALJ for a hearing. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The PFCRA is a \u201csister scheme\u201d to the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) and is \u201cdesigned to operate in tandem with the FCA.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>529 U.S. at 786, n. 17, 120 S.Ct. 1858. The legislative history of the PFCRA indicates that it was intended to address \u201csmall-dollar cases\u201d of fraud against the government because, in such cases, the \u201ccost of litigation generally exceeds the amount recovered, thus making it economically impractical for the Justice Department to go to court.\u201d <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 99-1012, at 257-59 (1986) (Conf.Rep.), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3868, 3902-04. Consistent with that purpose, the PFCRA does not apply to allegations of liability where the fraudulent claims at issue are for more than $150,000. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(c)(1); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.6(a)(2). The legislative history refers to this figure as a \u201cjurisdictional cap.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-1012, at 259, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3904.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Roberts\u2019s fundamental argument on appeal is that the PFCRA is \u201ccontrolling law,\u201d such that \u201c[o]nce an allegation of fraud has been made the PFCRA must be followed.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br., pp. 5, 40, 49. He contends that VA employees \u201cmay not conduct fraud adjudications,\u201d because such adjudications are quasi-criminal in nature, are unsuitable for ex parte adjudication, and are inconsistent with the VAs veteran-friendly claims process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Roberts contends that, if the VA referred this matter to an ALJ pursuant to the PFCRA, Roberts would have had \u201cproper notice, a neutral forum, and due process as provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution.\u201d Reply Br., p. 1. In effect, Roberts argues that the VA\u2019s <em>only </em>course of action to sever his benefits because of fraud was through the PFCRA, and because the VA did not follow that course, it improperly severed Roberts\u2019s benefits and violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">There are several reasons why Roberts\u2019s position is without merit. Most significantly, the PFCRA is not an exclusive remedy. The remedies it provides are \u201cin addition to any other remedy that may be prescribed by law.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802(a)(1). Even if the VA were required to act pursuant to the PFCRA, that would have no effect on the VA\u2019s ability to sever Roberts\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Veterans Court also correctly concluded that the jurisdictional cap in the PFCRA precluded the VA from pursuing a complaint under that statute. <em>Roberts, </em>23 Vet.App. at 424. The PFCRA does not apply when more than $150,000 \u201cis requested or demanded in violation of [31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802]\u201d in a fraudulent claim or a group of related fraudulent claims. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(c)(1); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.6(a)(2). As indicated above, the legislative history expressly refers to this restriction as a \u201cjurisdictional cap.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 99-1012, at 259, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3904. Here, the record clearly reflects that Roberts\u2019s fraudulent claims exceeded the $150,000 jurisdictional threshold of the PFCRA. Indeed, Roberts appears to concede as much. Reply Br., p. 14. That the jurisdictional threshold was exceeded is confirmed by the results of Roberts\u2019s criminal proceeding, in which Roberts was ordered to pay over $260,000 in restitution. Thus, putting aside whether the PFCRA was the <em>required </em>procedure, it clearly was not <em>available </em>given the amount of penalties and assessments at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Roberts contends that the $150,000 amount is not jurisdictional, citing <em>Orfanos v. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>896 F.Supp. 23 (D.D.C.1995). In that case, however, the petitioner fraudulently obtained only $13,400 in violation of the statute, far below the jurisdictional cap. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Although the district court affirmed an award of $196,800 under the PFCRA, the vast majority of that was based on an assessment of $170,000 in penalties and an additional $13,400 as a result of double damages, amounts which are not considered for purposes of the jurisdictional limit. That case, therefore, did not implicate the PFCRAs jurisdictional cap and does not support Roberts\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Finally, even if the amount at issue was less than $150,000, there is nothing in the relevant statutory or regulatory language that compels the VA to act pursuant to the PFCRA in lieu of utilizing its own procedures. Roberts\u2019s assertion that the VA is not permitted to act on matters relating to fraud is inconsistent with the statutes and regulations that specifically refer to severance of service connection based on fraud. <em>See, e.g., </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159 (service connection for disability or death in effect for ten or more years shall not be severed \u201cexcept upon a showing that the original grant of connection was based on fraud\u201d); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.957 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">To the extent Roberts challenges the VA\u2019s ability to <em>recoup </em>benefits through avenues other than the PFCRA (as distinct from severing them), that argument is without merit. The Government has several mechanisms at its disposal to recover benefits resulting from fraudulent claims, and the PFCRA specifically contemplates parallel criminal proceedings. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(b)(3) (providing that a proceeding under the PFCRA shall be stayed if the Attorney General believes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>\u201cmay adversely affect <em>any pending or potential criminal or civil action </em>\u201d (emphasis added)); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.4 (contemplating deferring a report to a reviewing official \u201cto avoid interference with a criminal investigation or prosecution\u201d). Indeed, the very purpose of requiring agencies to obtain approval from the Attorney General before instituting an administrative proceeding under the PFCRA is to permit the Attorney General to pursue an action at his election. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 99-1012, at 258, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3903 (\u201cThis procedure ensures that the [Justice] Department will have an opportunity to review the charges and elect, if it so chooses, to litigate in federal court\u201d). In this case, the Government instituted a criminal proceeding, and Roberts concedes that there is a valid and enforceable criminal restitution order in place.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Moreover, the VAs severance of benefits based on fraud does not improperly displace other mechanisms to recoup benefits because severance simply cuts off benefits prospectively, it does not result in the automatic recovery of past payments. While it is true that the effective date of a \u201cdiscontinuance or reduction\u201d of benefits based on an act of commission or omission by the payee is the effective date of the award, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)(9); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.500(b)(1), that only establishes that there has been an overpayment of benefits. The Government can recoup that overpayment through several avenues, including through a criminal proceeding, the PFCRA, if applicable, or the FCA. Here, the Government pursued a criminal proceeding, which, as discussed above, is entirely compatible with the PFCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Roberts also contends that the VA violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by failing to refer the matter to an ALJ pursuant to the PFCRA. Specifically, he asserts that he \u201cwas denied a copy of the OIG report, a full statement of the allegations against him, and the opportunity to challenge them.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br., p. 6. To the extent this argument reiterates his contention that the VA was required to act pursuant to the PFCRA, we reject it for the reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">We do not see any other support for Roberts\u2019s contention that his constitutional rights were violated. In August 2004, the VA provided notice to Roberts of its proposed severance of his service connection with a cover sheet explaining his rights to submit evidence within sixty days, to request a personal hearing, and to legal representation. The notice referred to the OIG investigation (about which Roberts was aware because he was interviewed in connection with that investigation), included five paragraphs detailing the findings of the investigation, and the reasons why the VA found Roberts\u2019s prior statements regarding Holland\u2019s death to be fraudulent. On appeal, the Board conducted a hearing in June 2005, at which Roberts and his wife testified and during which he was represented by counsel. The Veterans Court correctly concluded that these procedures satisfied the VAs procedural due process safeguards.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.103 (\u201cEvery claimant has the right to written notice of the decision made on his or her claim, the right to a hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>and the right of representation\u201d). Accepting Roberts\u2019s position on this point would require this court to find that the VA\u2019s procedural safeguards, even when followed faithfully, do not satisfy the requirements of constitutional due process. We find no justification for such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">B. <em>Consideration of Other Stressors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Roberts also argues that the Board erred in failing to consider additional stressors, such as the December 1969 shore patrol incident described above, before severing his benefits based on fraud. The Board rejected this argument, finding that: (1) no additional stressors were presented to the VA in Roberts\u2019s initial claim of service connection for PTSD; (2) the May 1998 rating decision cited only the death of Gary Holland as a stressor; and (8) the March 1998 examination report on which the rating decision was based cited only Gary Holland\u2019s death as a stressor. The Board also observed that \u201cit appears that the veteran raised the purported additional stressors only after service connection for PTSD was granted and the veteran\u2019s role in the Gary H. incident was being questioned, evidently in an effort to shore up a claim which was in the process of falling apart.\u201d JA 931. The Veterans Court upheld the Board\u2019s determination, noting that Roberts could pursue a separate claim based on any additional stressors, but that the Board here did not adjudicate a claim for service connection on stressors other than the one found to be fraudulent. Accordingly, it held that the Board was not required to consider other stressors \u201cas part of the severance proceeding.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>23 Vet.App. at 430, n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We agree with the Veterans Court. Roberts presented only one stressor as part of his initial claim, which the Board ultimately determined to be fraudulent. Under those circumstances, the Board did not err in severing Roberts\u2019s benefits before considering other potential stressors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the Veterans Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AKAT\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">. We express no opinion on those portions of the opinion that the parties have not challenged on appeal. Specifically, we pass no judgment on the Veterans Court's holding that severance of benefits based on fraud is not subject to a clear and unmistakable error (\"CUE\u201d) analysis under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.105(d). <em>See Roberts v. Shinseki, </em>23 Vet.App. 416, 424-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>29 (2010). Roberts, through counsel, expressly disclaimed that he was appealing that ruling, both in his brief and at oral argument. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br., pp. 37, 41 (stating that \" \u00a7 3.105(d) has no role in a benefits fraud case other than the implementation of the order from an ALJ or District Court under the PFCRA,\u201d and \u201d[w]hen benefits fraud is alleged, CUE is not available to the government, the allegation must be adjudicated under the PFCRA\u201d); <em>see also </em>Oral Arg. at 11:12-11:28 and 12:58-13:23, <em>available at </em>http:// www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argumentrecordings/2010-7104/all (at oral argument, when asked whether he was appealing the Veterans Court\u2019s holding that the CUE analysis does not apply in this case, Roberts\u2019s counsel responded twice that CUE does not apply). For the same reasons, we do not address Roberts\u2019s argument that there was not, in fact, any CUE in the Board\u2019s original grant of benefits. Because the Veterans Court's majority opinion did not address the propriety of the Board's CUE finding, and because Roberts concedes that CUE does not apply to severance based on fraud, the Board\u2019s CUE analysis is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">. Around this time, Roberts also claimed service connection for other medical conditions secondary to his service-connected PTSD as well as for dysthymia and depression separate from PTSD. The RO denied these claims. Those decisions, and the Veterans Court\u2019s decision to remand Roberts\u2019s separate claim for dysthymia and depression, are not at issue on appeal. <em>See infra, </em>n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\">. As noted above, this holding is not at issue on appeal, and we do not address it. <em>See supra, </em>n. 1. The majority also concluded that the Board erred in denying Roberts\u2019s separate claim for dysthymia and depression. <em>Roberts, </em>23 Vet.App. at 430-31. It remanded the matter for the Board to conduct that analysis and consider additional evidence from Roberts on this point. <em>Id. </em>at 430. On appeal, the Secretary does not challenge the Veterans Court's decision to remand this aspect of the case. <em>See </em>Oral Arg. at 17:40-17:50, <em>available at </em>http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argumentrecordings/2010-7104/aIl.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. Although it is unclear, Roberts appears to challenge the underlying determination that he committed fraud. The question of whether Roberts\u2019s statements were fraudulent, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>er, is a factual question over which we lack jurisdiction. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>Flores v.

Notably, Roberts\u2019s position before this court directly contradicts his position during his criminal proceeding. In that proceeding, Roberts moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the VA was the appropriate agency to make determinations about veterans benefits because of its \"specialized knowledge, expertise and connection with the regulation of Veterans\u2019 Benefits.\" <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>Case No. 05crll8 (E.D.Wis. May 9, 2006) (Motion to Dismiss the Indictment on Grounds of Violation of Separation of Powers Doctrine, ECF No. 103, p. 5).

As noted above, Roberts also was convicted of fraud in a criminal proceeding in federal district court under a much higher \"beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard and with the benefit of the accompanying constitutional safeguards inherent in such a proceeding.
