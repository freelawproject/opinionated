The affidavit of the Appellant\u2019s probation officer alleged violations of standard conditions of probation numbers 1, 2, 7 and 9, as well as a special condition of probation pertaining to a fine and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">After reviewing the Record on Appeal and the appellate briefs filed in the case, this Court is of the opinion that the trial court\u2019s revocation of the Appellant\u2019s probation is supported by competent, substantial evidence that the Appellant violated the special condition of probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>and standard conditions 2 and 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the Appellant\u2019s Judgment and Sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">DATE OF DECISION OCTOBER 3, 1991.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"APC\"> The trial court\u2019s determination that the Appellant violated standard condition 1 requiring that the Appellant procure the consent of his probation officer prior to changing his residence is erroneous, inasmuch as the Appellant had no control over his whereabouts while incarcerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
