W. Hutton. The will was executed on the 21st- day of June, 1919, and the codicil thereto on the 17th day of November, 1922. The testatrix was possessed of a large estate, consisting of realty and personalty, and had at the time of the. execution of the will and at the time of her death three children, a son, Reginald W. Hutlon, and t.wo daughters, Elsie O. Hutton and Lucette M. Prichard. At the time of the execution of the will and at her death the testatrix owned a parcel of real estate situated on Fremont and Hollins Streets in Baltimore City, known as \u201cAlexanclroffskv,\u201d and also a tract or parcel of real estate located in Baltimore City, formerly Baltimore County, known as \u201cCrimea,\u201d and another small portion of land described in the will as a, lot of ground on Franklin Turnpike Road, with improvements thereon formerly occupied as a toll-gatehouse. By items four and five of the will she devised as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ9\">\u201cItem IY. I give and devise to my daughters, Elsie C. Hutton and Lucette M. Prichard, for and during the full term of their natural lives, each an undivided one-half equal part of, in and to all my lauds and estate situate in the City of Baltimore, State of Maryland, fronting on Baltimore Street, Fremont Street, and Hollins Street, and known as \u2018Alexandroffsky\u2019 (also known as No. 838 Hollins Street), together with all the buildings and improvements upon said property, with full power to my said two daughters or such of them as may survive me, with the written consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, a corporation, to sell the whole or any part or parts thereof, and by good and sufficient deed or deeds convey the same to the purchaser or purchasers thereof without any obligation upon the part of the purchaser or purchasers to see to the application of the purchase money; the proceeds of said sale or sales to be received by my trustee hereinafter named and held by said trustee upon the same trusts and for the same persons and purposes and subject to the same rights and powers of my said daughters respectively in and over the same, principal and income, as are hereinafter mentioned and declared respecting my daughters\u2019 shares respectively of the rest and residue of my estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cWith further power to each of my said two daughters to devise and dispose of by last will and testament, duly executed according to the laws of the State of Maryland, each an undivided one-half part of so much or such part of my property known as 'Alexandra if sky\u2019 as may not have been sold and conveyed as hereinbefore authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cShould, at the death of the last survivor of my said two daughters, the whole or any part of 'Alexandroffsky\u2019 remain unsold and conveyed by virtue of the power hereinbefore given or remain undisposed of by their respective last wills and testaments as herein-before authorized, then I authorize and direct that Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, a corporation, sell at public or private sale the whole or such part of my said property known as \u2018AlexandrofEsky\u2019 as may not have been sold and conveyed by my daughters or such of them as may survive me, as above authorized or disposed of by their respective last wills and testaments as hereinbefore authorized and by good and sufficient deed or deeds to convey the same to the purchaser or purchasers thereof without any obligation upon the part of the purchaser or purchasers to see to the application of the purchase money, and to pay over the proceeds of such sale or sales to the then living descendants of such of my said two daughters who may not have disposed of, as above authorized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>their respective interests in said property, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cI have made no disposition herein of the household and kitchen furniture and other contents of every description of what kind soever of the buildings at \u2018Alexandroffsky,\u2019 and the tools and implements there located and being, as prior to the execution hereof I gave the same to my said two daughters, to whom I also gave prior to the execution hereof all my jewelry, laces and personal adornments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cItem Y.

whereupon my said trustee is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to deduct from and retain out of the share of my estate held in trust for my said son such sum as may be tbe difference between one-third of the combined value so ascertained of \u2018Crimea\u2019 and said toll-gate bouse property and \u2018Alexandroffsky,\u2019 and the value so ascertained of \u2018Crimea\u2019 and said tollgate house property, and to that extent reduce the share of my residuary estate held in trust for my son as above set forth. The amount so deducted from my son\u2019s share of my residuary estate is to be retained by my trustee and beld upon tbe same trusts and for the-same persons and purposes and subject to the same rights and powers of my said daughters respectively in and over the same, principal and income, as are hereinbefore mentioned and declared respecting my daughters\u2019 shares respectively of the rest and residue of my estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">It will he seen by the fifth paragraph of item seven that the testatrix directed the trustee named in the will, as soon as convenient 'after her death, to appraise and value her estate known as \u201cCrimea,\u201d including the lot with improvements formerly occupied as a toll-gate house, and also ap^ praise her estate known a's \u201cAlexandroffsky.\u201d She then authorized and directed the trustee to deduct from -and retain, out of the share of her estate held in trust for her son, such</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>a sum as is the difference between one-third, of the combined appraised values of \u201cCrimea\u201d and the toll-gate house property and \u201cAlexaadroffsky,\u201d and the value of \u201cCrimea\u201d and the toll-gate house property so ascertained, and to that extent reduce the share of her residuary estate held in trust for her son. Or in other words, by this paragraph the testatrix directed that the trustee, as soon as convenient after her death, appraise \u201cAlexandroffsky,\u201d \u201cCrimea\u201d and the tollgate property; add together these appraisements and divide this sum by three; then take the sum shown as the result of this division and subtract it from the appraised value of \u201cCrimea\u201d and the toll-gate property, thus fixing the amount of owelty, and being the sum which was to be deducted from the son\u2019s portion of the residuary estate held by the trustee. The codicil to the will is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201cI, Celeste M. W.

Hutton, the above named testatrix, as and for a codicil to her last will and testament, in the presence of us, who, at her request, in her presence, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses this day of November, 1922.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201cAdeline Grade,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">\u201cGeo. Worthington.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Between the execution of the will and the making of the codicil the testatrix sold eighty acres of the tract known as \u201cCrimea\u201d for the sum of $108,750. The appellees contend that the legacy of $100,000 bequeathed to the son by the codicil is in lieu of the eighty acres of land sold from \u201cCrimea,\u201d and therefore the sum of $100,000 should be added to the appraised value of \u201cCrimea\u201d in order to arrive at the proper owelty; while the appellants contend that the $100,000 legacy left to the son in the codicil is an independent specific bequest, and should not be considered as a part of \u201cCrimea\u201d or taken into account in determining the owelty. The trustee, shortly after the death of the testatrix, appraised \u201cAlexandroffsky\u201d at $163,000, and what was then remaining of \u201cCrimea\u201d \u2014 that is to say, without taking' into account the eighty acres theretofore sold by tbe testatrix\u2014 together with the toll-gate property, at $145,000. Reducing the contentions of the respective parties to figures, as to what should be the owelty, we find that the appellant contends that the owelty should be arrived at by adding $145,000, the value of \u201cCrimea\u201d and the toll-gate lot, and $163,000, the value of \u201cAlexandroffsky,\u201d making a total of $308,000; that this sum of $308,000 should be divided by three, the result being $102,667, and this being subtracted from $145,000, the appraised value of \u201cCrimea,\u201d would leave $42,333 as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>owelty; the appellees contending, and the lower court so deciding, that to the $308,000, the appraised value of \u201cAlexandroffsky\u201d and \u201cCrimea,\u201d should be added the sum of $100,-000, the amount of the legacy left to the son in the codicil, and representing, as they claim, the eighty acres of \u201cCrimea\u201d theretofore sold by the testatrix, thus making the sum of $408,000 to be divided by three, and showing, after such division, $136,000, which should be taken from the appraised value of \u201cCrimea.,\u201d $145,000, plus the $100,000 legacy, and leaving as a remainder $109,000 as the proper owelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">A careful scrutiny of \u2022 the entire will in this case convinces us that the general scheme of the testatrix was equality among her three children with respect to the property devised or bequeathed by the will and codicil. There is some testimony contained in the record, offered by the appellant, to show that the testatrix, prior to the making of the will, had, by a deed of trust of some $300,000, made a larger provision for the daughters than for the son. This deed of trust, which was executed more than two and a half years before the will, gave each of the daughters (there being then three) two-sevenths of the trust fund created by that instrument, while the son received one-seventh. It does not appear from the record whether or not the son, prior to the execution of the will, had gotten any other advancement from his mother, but it is certain that the inequality, produced by the execution of the deed of trust referred to, existed at the time of the execution of the will, and the testatrix at the time of making the will was fully cognizant of this inequality. It is also contended that in the will itself inequality is shown by the bequest to the two daughters of the testatrix\u2019 jewelry, laces and wearing apparel, and that the bequest to the daughters of the furniture within the mansion house on \u201cAlexandroffsky\u201d was of much greater value that the furniture in the mansion house on \u201cCrimea\u201d which was bequeathed to the son, and that by reason of these alleged inequalities the testatrix, by the codicil in which she bequeathed to the son the sum of $100,000, had in mind and it was her purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>to correct such inequality by said legacy of $100,000 to the son. We are of the opinion that the bequest of jewelry, laces and wearing apparel to the daughters does not destroy the scheme of equality as evidenced by the whole will. Eemale wearing apparel, laces and jewelry, belonging to the testar trix and used for her personal adornment, naturally would be given to the daughters, and the fact that the household furnitures at \u201cAlexandroffsky\u201d and \u201cCrimea\u201d were not of equal value is not sufficient to overthrow the very apparent scheme of the whole will of equality. At the time of the execution of the will, \u201cCrimea,\u201d which was devised to the son, contained eighty acres more land than at the time of the execution of the codicil. The testatrix, some time shortly before tbe execution of the codicil, or at least between the time of the making of the will and the making of the codicil, sold and conveyed eighty acres of \u201cCrimea.\u201d It is perfectly apparent from a reading of the codicil that this sale of eighty acres of \u201cCrimea\u201d was the fact which induced the testatrix to make the codicil. The preamble to the codicil is as follows: \u201cHaving recently sold for the sum of $108,150 about eighty acres of my lands known as \u2018Crimea.\u2019 \u201d Then follows the bequest of $100,000 to her son upon his reaching tbe age of thirty-five years. This language is equivalent to the testatrix saying: \u201cHaving sold eighty acres of \u2018Crimea,\u2019 heretofore devised to my son, for that reason I hereby bequeath to my said son the sum of $100,000.\u201d The contention of the appellants that the bequest of $100,000 to the son is an independent legacy and is not a substitution or in lieu of the eighty acres of \u201cCrimea\u201d theretofore sold by the testatrix, cannot be sustained unless we disregard entirely the preamble to the codicil. The general rule of construction requires us to give a meaning and purpose to every part of the will and codicil. The language of the preamble to the codicil is entirely meaningless and would have to be rejected as surplusage unless it is held to mean that the testatrix, having sold a part of \u201cCrimea,\u201d which by the will was devised to her son, intended by the codicil to substitute, in place of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>eighty acres so sold for something over $100,000, the legacy of $100,000. This, we think, was the intent of the testatrix, as gathered from a construction of the whole codicil; and this is in accord with the general scheme of equality expressed in and gathered from the entire will. It is also to be observed that in the codicil the testatrix in all other1 respects ratifies, republishes and reaffirms the will. This language indicates that at the time of the making of the codicil the testatrix did not desire to change or interfere with the general plan and scheme of the will, except in so far as the codicil was inconsistent therewith. It will also be noted that by the provisions of item five of the will the son is given full power at any time during his life, with the written consent of the trustee, to sell the whole or any part of \u201cCrimea\u201d and retain the proceeds of said sale or sales, provided he shall then have reached the age of thirty-five years; otherwise the proceeds of' said sale or sales are to be retained by the trustee and held upon the same trusts and for the same persons and purposes and subject to the same rights and powers of the son in and over the same, both principal and income, as are mentioned and declared respecting the son\u2019s share of the rest and residue of the estate. The direction as to the son\u2019s share of the residue of the estate is to the effect that: \u201cShould my said son attain the age of thirty-five years, my said trustee may from time to time, after my said- son reaches said age, pay over and deliver to him the remaining one-third of the corpus or principal of the trust estate a's may then be in possession of my said trustee, or such part or parts thereof as my said son may from time to time, after he reaches said age of thirty-five years, in writing designate.\u201d The will then makes provision for the disposition of any part of the residuary estate belonging to the son in case he should die before he reaches the age of thirty-five, as also any portion of said residuum remaining in the hands of the trustee and not paid over to the son during his lifetime. The codicil gives the $100,000 legacy to the son absolutely upon his arrival at the age of thirty-five years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and then provides that if the son dies before be reaches the age of thirty-five the $100,000 should be held by the trustee in the same manner as the son\u2019s share of the rest and residue of the estate. It will thus be seen that the directions contained in the codicil in respect to the $100,000 legacy are identical with the provisions contained in the will in respect to \u201cCrimea,\u201d with the single exception that the son receives the $100,000 when he reaches thirty-five years of age without having to obtain the consent of the trustee. In other words, if the testatrix had not sold any part of \u201cCrimea\u201d after making the will, and the eighty acres had been sold by the son after her death, it would have been necessary for him to get the consent of the trustee to make the sale, and the proceeds would have been held by the trustee until lie became thirty-five years of age, at which time, upon application by him in writing to the trustee, it would have been turned over to him ; while under the provisions of the codicil, the mother having' made the sale during her lifetime, the approximate proceeds of said sale are placed in tho hands of the trustee to be paid to the son upon his arrival at thirty-five years of age, without making it necessary for tho son to apply in writing' for the consent of the trustee; the testatrix, by the codicil, in effect, substituting her consent that it be paid over at the son\u2019s arrival at the age of thirty-five, in the place of the trustee\u2019s consent. If no sale of any part of \u201cCrimea\u201d had been made by the testatrix, it would have been the duty of the trustee, at her death, to appraise \u201cCrimea\u201d as it then stood, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the owelty; and as the testatrix, in effect, by her codicil said that because she had sold a part of \u201cCrimea\u201d during her lifetime, she was therefore bequeathing her son a legacy of $100,000 payable when he arrived at the age of thirty-five, to take the place of that portion of \u201cCrimea\u201d so sold, we think that it was the manifest intention of the testatrix that this legacy should be charged to tho son as if it were a part of the appraised value of \u201cCrimea,\u201d in determining the owelty. It is objected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>appellant that this construction renders the codicil meaningless ; or in other words, that the amount received by tho-son from his mother\u2019s estate without any codicil would bo the same as he would now receive under the above construction. Even if this were true, to give it any other construction would be to disregard the intent of the testatrix as expressed by the language of the preamble to the codicil, and destroy the manifest purpose of equality among her children in the distribution of the property disposed of by the will; and this we-are unwilling to do. The intent of a testator is the law of wills, unless it.conflicts with some settled rule of law or of property. This principle, in varying language, has-been expressed in almost every case comingi before this court wherein wills were to be construed. In <em>Chew v. Chew, 1 </em>Md. 163, it is said: \u201cThe rule of contraction in all testamentary instruments is that the intention of the testator, as expressed by the language of the will, shall prevail if consistent with the-settled rules of law, and the most liberal and enlarged interpretation will be given to all such instruments in oi\u2019der to effectuate the manifest design of the testator.\u201d In <em>Woman\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society v. Mitchell, </em>93 Md. 199, tibeprincipie is thus expressed: \u201cThe cardinal canon around .which all others center is this, that the intention of the testator when ascertained from the whole instrument, or from the instrument as read in tho light of surrounding circumstances existing at the date of its execution, must 'be given effect if that intention does not antagonize or conflict with some rule of law or of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">An equally well settled rule of construction is to the effect that a will and its codicil shall be construed together. In <em>Loyola College v. Dugan, </em>137 Md. 552, it was said: \u201cIt is a settled rule of construction that a will and its codicils must be interpreted as one instrument, and the provisions of the will are to be given effect except to the extent only to which they are revoked by the codicils, whether in terms or by a clear inconsistency between the earlier and later expressions of the testator\u2019s intention.\u201d To the same effect are <em>Lewis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Payne, </em>113 Md. 127 ; <em>Buchanan v. Lloyd, </em>88 Md. 642 ; <em>Hutchins v. Pearce, </em>80 Md. 434 ; <em>Halsey v. Convention, </em>75 Md. 275 ; <em>Thomas v. Levering, </em>73 Md. 451 ; <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Pinckney, </em>55 Md. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In our opinion the testatrix by her codicil substituted the legacy of $100,000, payable when Reginald W. Hutton reaches thirty-five years of age, for the eighty acres of \u201cCrimea\u201d sold by her during her lifetime; but this does not mean that for the purpose of determining the owelty the sum of $3 00,000, the amount of the legacy, should be used, for the reason that what the testatrix substituted for the land sold by her, for the purpose of owelty, was the value of the legacy at the time of the appraisement by the trustee of \u201cAlexandroffsky\u201d and \u201cCrimea.\u201d This legacy of $100,-000 is payable when Reginald W. Hutton reaches the age of thirty-five years, and means that at that time he shall receive $100,000, no more and no less. It is a legacy of $300,000 payable at a definite stated time, and, under the authority of this Court, does not bear interest until after the date specified for its payment. <em>Budd v. Garrison, </em>45 Md. 418 ; <em>Von der Horst v. Von der Horst, </em>88 Md. 127 ; <em>Webb v. Webb, </em>92 Md. 101. It will therefore be seen that the payment of interest to Reginald W. Hutton, as provided by the decree of the lower court, is erroneous, as being in conflict with the decided law of this state. Neither can there be found any such intention on the part of the testatrix, either from, the will or codicil. We are therefore of the opinion that, for the purpose of determining the amount of owelty, the trustee .should add together the appraised value of \u201cAlexandroffsky,\u201d $3 63,000, the appraised value of the remaining part of \u201cCrimea\u201d and the toll-gate property, $145,000, and such a sum as invested at six per cent, compound interest, on the date of the appraisement heretofore made, will produce $100,-000 when Reginald W. Hutton reaches the age of thirty-five, which sum we will designate as <em>\u201cx\u201d; </em>divide the sum thus obtained by three; then subtract the result of this division from the appraised value of \u201cCrimea,\u201d $145,000, plus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>sum <em>\u201cx,\u201d </em>which will give the correct owelty; the owelty thus arrived at to he deducted hy the trustee from the share of Eeginald W. Hutton of the residuary estate of the testatrix, and retained hy the trustee and held upon the same trusts and for the same persons and purposes and subject to the same rights and powers of the two daughters of the testatrix respectively in and over the same, principal and income, as are mentioned and declared in item seven of the testatrix\u2019 will respecting the shares of her two daughters respectively of the rest and residue of the estate of the testatrix; and that no interest should be allowed Eeginald W. Hutton on the legacy of $100,000 provided for by the codicil, but that the exact sum of $100,000 should be promptly paid him upon his arrival at the age of thirty-five. From the views herein expressed it will be seen that the chancellor erred in the first, second and third paragraphs of the decree appealed from. We find no error in the fourth paragraph of said decree, and the same will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed in pao't and reversed in part, and case remanded, that a decree may he passed in accordance with the views expressed in this opinionj the costs in this court to he paid hy the executors out of the residuary personal estate of the testatrix.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
