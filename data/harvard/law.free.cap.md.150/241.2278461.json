Bruce, </em>87 Md. 256 <em>; Walker v. Richmond, </em>173 Ky. 26 ; 7 R. C. L., p. 677. Whether the renewals provided for could have been enforced it is not necessary to inquire. The definite period of twenty years was not unreasonable. <em>Westminster Water Company v. Westminster, </em>98 Md. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(b) These matters are not involved in the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The important questions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">1. Was the provision of the ordinance for the purchase of the plant at the valuation of appraisers, without any provision for submission to the people, <em>ultra, vires?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">2. If so, was the ordinance ratified by chapter 116 of the Acts of 1922 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">3. Was the appraisal of the plant and property of the \u2022company approved by the Mayor and City Council?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The learned chancellor, who decided this case below, in a forceful opinion, answered the first question in the affirmative and the last two in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">We agree with his conclusion on the first proposition. It is conceded by appellant that, under the charter, submission to the people was necessary, and that there is no express provision in the ordinance for such submission, and no proviso that the purchase of the plant by the city shall depend upon the approval of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">But -it is strongly urged that the ordinance was made subject to chapter 12Y, section 152, of the Acts of 1902, and that the ordinance and the act must be read together; that the charter power of the city as contained in that act should be read into and considered a part of the ordinance; that the \u2022ordinance only went so far as to fix a method of ascertaining the actual cash value of the plant, if the city should \u25a0decide in 1923 to exercise its option to purchase, and is consistent with and complementary of the approval by the voters required by the charter. But we are unable to agree with this contention. It is not consistent with the unconditional provision in the ordinance that \u201cthe award of said appraisers or the valuation of said property so made by them shall be payable within sixty days after written notice to the said Mayor and City Council of such award or decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Besides it would be subscribing to a very dangerous principle to hold that everything necessary to the validity of an \u2022ordinance may be read into it, on the assumption that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ordinance was intended to be subject to <em>all </em>charter requirements. It can readily be seen what this would lead to in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We are unable to concur in the chancellor\u2019s answers to the second and third questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In our opinion, chapter 176 of the Acts of 1922 was a conditional ratification of Ordinance Ho. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In <em>Ches. and Pot. Telephone Co. v. Baltimore, </em>89 Md., at page 714, referring to certain rights which the city had granted the telephone company, the grant of which was alleged to have been <em>ultra vires, </em>it was said, Judg'e Pearce writing the opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u201cWhether the Mayor and City Council had the power to grant these rights and privileges at the time that contract was made, it is not necessary to inquire, because chapter 200 of 1892 must be taken as a legislative ratification and confirmation of that contract, with ail its rights and privileges. Cooley, in his work on <em>Constitutional Limitations, </em>6th Ed. 466, speaking of contracts by municipal corporations, which, when made, were in excess of their authority, but subsequently have been confirmed by legislative action, says: \u2018If the contract is one which the Legislature might originally have authorized, the right of the Legislature to confirm it must be recognized.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In <em>Baltimore and Potomac R. R. v. Reaney, </em>42 Md. 117, the Act of 1870, ch. 80, while containing no express terms of ratification of the ordinance under which a tunnel hid been built by the railroad company, used in one section \u201cterms equivalent to terms of express ratification,\u201d and this Court said through Judge Alvey: \u201cThe authority given by the city to make the tunnel is recognized, and there is power given to charge additional profits and tolls for its own use. This is a clear ratification or grant of authority, at least by implication, and it is settled that such authority may be granted by implication. <em>Springfield v. Conn. R. R. Co., </em>4 Cush. 63.\u201d See also <em>O'Brien v. Co. Com., </em>51 Md. 24 ; <em>Pompton v. Cooper Union, </em>101 U. S. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The conditions in the said act not found in the ordinance, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">1. That the appraisal of the plant and property of the water company he approved by the Mayor and City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">2. That before said bonds shall be issued and the plant and property of said company actually purchased, the question shall be submitted to the legal and qualified voters of said city at the regular city election in May, 1923, and the purchase of the plant and the issue of the bonds approved by a majority of the votes cast on said question.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The first condition was, in our opinion, complied with by the passage of Ordinance Ho. 307. The second, by the submission of the question, as provided by said Ordinance Ho. 307, to- the people at said election and the affirmative vote thereon by a majority of the votes oast.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We are not impressed by the argument of appellee that the approval of the Mayor and City Council must be had <em>after </em>the submission to the people. That argument is based on the language of section 340 of 'article 13, Code Public Local Laws, Harford County, Havre de Grace, as re-enacted by chapter 174 of the Acts of 1922, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201cWhenever the Mayor and City Council of Havre de Grace, having first obtained the approval of and consent of a majority of the legally qualified voters of said city, as herein provided for, shall determine to purchase or erect any * <em>* * </em>water plant * * * they are hereby authorized and empowered to borrow on the credit of said city a sum of money necessary for such purchase or erection and to issue bonds therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The words \u201cas herein provided\u201d refer to section 152 of said article, which provides for the submission of the question of the purchase or erection of a water plant to the legally qualified voters of the city before the city \u201cshall proceed to erect or purchase.\u201d Therefore, the words in section 340, \u201chaving first obtained the approval * * * as herein provided for\u201d mean that the approval of the people of a plan to purchase or erect a plant must first be obtained be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>fore the city shall <em>actually </em>erect or purchase such plant and issue bonds to pay tberefor. They have no reference to the' provision in chapter 176 of the Acts of 1922, codified as section 340A, that \u201cthe appraisal of the plant and property of said company he approved by the Mayor and City Council.\u201d It is section 340A, and not section 340, which controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">And we are unable to agree with the chancellor that \u201cthe approval of the appraisal of the plant and property cannot be inferred from the passage of Ordinance Ho. 307.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The act, in pursuance of which the ordinance purports to have been passed, expressly makes such approval a condition ; and we think, in view of this, it is fair to assume that the city council did not pass the ordinance and the mayor approve it without approving' the proposition which they thus submitted for the final and irrevocable determination of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The suggestion is made, by appellee, but not seriously pressed, that notice of its intention to exercise its option was not given by the city until December 7th; whereas the Act of 1922 required such notice to be given on or before December 1st, 1922. But no point was made of this by the company. On the contrary, it accepted the notice and all parties proceeded to carry out the provisions of the ordinance and of the act. This is not an objection open to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\"><em>Decree reversed and cause </em>remanded, <em>with costs to appellant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
