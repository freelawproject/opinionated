ORS 811.182. Before trial, defendant filed notice of his intent to defend both charges by asserting that he was guilty but insane. ORS 161.295. The state moved that the defense be stricken. The court granted the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Defendant\u2019s only contention is that the court erred in striking the defense. The defense under ORS 161.295 is not available, because driving under the influence of intoxicants and driving with a suspended license are both strict liability offenses. <em>State v. Buttrey, </em>293 Or 575, 651 P2d 1075 (1982); <em>State v.

Accordingly, I dissent, because I believe that the court erred when it granted the state\u2019s motion to strike that defense.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
