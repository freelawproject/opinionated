J.</author>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In this action for damages for personal injuries, plaintiff appeals from a summary judgment for defendant granted on the ground that defendant is immune from liability by reason of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. ORS 656.018. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">At the time of plaintiffs injury, defendant was the general contractor for renovation of a hospital. Associated Sheet Metals, Inc., (Associated) subcontracted directly with defendant to do sheetmetal work on the project for $60,500. Defendant also contracted with Bowen Brothers, Inc., as a subcontractor to do the major part of the renovation. Bowen Brothers, Inc., then also subcontracted with Associated for other sheetmetal work at a unit price of approximately $233,000. Associated agreed to maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employes.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Plaintiff was employed by Associated and alleged that he was injured while working for Associated on the hospital job site when a set of wooden steps that he was ascending gave way. He alleged that defendant had constructed the stairway and was in charge of and had control of the work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Defendant filed various motions pursuant to ORCP 21, and some of them were allowed. It did not file an answer, but moved for summary judgment, contending that it was immune from liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. The only evidence material to that issue that was submitted by defendant in two affidavits describing the subcontracts executed by defendant and Associated, copies of the various subcontracts and certificates that Associated had workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Plaintiff did not file a written response or any evidence. There was a hearing on the motion that is not a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Plaintiffs essential argument is that defendant is not his employer and, therefore, does not qualify for statutory immunity. He contends that there is a fact issue as to whether he is a subject worker of defendant under ORS 656.005(13) and ORS 656.005(27). Defendant initially argues that plaintiff did not preserve the challenge that he makes on appeal, because the record does not show that he made any factual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>legal challenge to defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant had the burden to establish that summary judgment was appropriate because there is no issue as to a material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiffs failure explicitly to challenge the factual basis and the issue of law below does not preclude him from arguing on appeal that defendant did not meet its burden. <em>McKee v. Gilbert, </em>62 Or App 310, 661 P2d 97 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">ORS 656.018(1) provides that workers\u2019 compensation is an employer\u2019s only liability for a compensable injury to a \u201csubject worker,\u201d and ORS 656.018(2) provides generally that benefits under the act are an injured worker\u2019s exclusive remedy against \u201cthe worker\u2019s employer\u201d for a compensable injury. The exclusivity of the remedy and the limitation of liability is applicable when a worker-employer relationship exists. The two elements necessary to create the relationship, <em>i.e., </em>to make plaintiff a \u201csubject worker\u201d of defendant, are whether defendant had contracted to pay \u201ca remuneration for and secure the right to direct and control the services\u201d of plaintiff. ORS 656.005(13); ORS 656.005(27).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Defendant points to its contract with Associated and argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s payment of the subcontractor price to Associated, who in turn paid plaintiff for his services, was sufficient remuneration by the defendant for the services of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Although the lack of a direct transfer of funds between the parties is not determinative, \u201cremuneration\u201d contemplates a more direct <em>quid pro quo </em>between payment and services than the possibility that plaintiffs compensation as a worker will ultimately come from the contract payment to his employer. <em>See Childress v. Short, </em>71 Or App 150, 691 P2d 109 (1984). Defendant presented no evidence regarding payment other than the contract between it and Associated, which called for certain work to be done by Associated for a single stated price. Under this state of facts, defendant was not plaintiff\u2019s employer and plaintiff was not a subject worker of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Defendant argues in the alternative that it should have the same immunity as plaintiffs employer, because it is potentially liable for workers\u2019 compensation for plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>under ORS 656.029 and ORS 656.556.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It argues that, if it is secondarily liable for compensation to a worker, it should also have the immunity from civil action accorded the worker\u2019s primary employer. Whatever might be the virtues of such a policy, immunity is based on an employer-worker relationship, and neither statute creates that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\"> ORS 656.029(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cIf a person awards a contract involving the performance of labor where such labor is a normal and customary part or process of the person\u2019s trade or business, the person awarding the contract is responsible for providing workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for all individuals * * * who perform labor under the contract unless the person to whom the contract is awarded provides such coverage for those individuals before labor under the contract commences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">ORS 656.556 is to a similar effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
