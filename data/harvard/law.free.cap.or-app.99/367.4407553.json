We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Claimant\u2019s attorney appeared for the hearing without claimant and moved for a postponement. The motion was denied. He moved to dismiss claimant\u2019s request for a hearing without prejudice. That motion was also denied. Finally, he requested that claimant be allowed to proceed on the record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to give her testimony over the telephone. The referee denied the motion and granted SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice because of claimant\u2019s failure to appear personally and to make herself available for cross-examination. Claimant argues that the referee was without authority to deprive her of the opportunity to put on evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">At the time of the hearing, OAR 438-06-071 provided:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c(1) A request for hearing may be dismissed if a referee finds that the party that requested the hearing has abandoned the request for hearing or has engaged in conduct that has resulted in an unjustified delay in the hearing of more than 60 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c(2) Unjustified failure of a party or the party\u2019s representative to attend a scheduled hearing is a waiver of appearance. If the party that waives appearance is the party that requested the hearing, the referee shall dismiss the request for hearing as having been abandoned unless extraordinary circumstances justify postponement or continuance of the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">SAIF does not argue that there is a jurisdictional requirement for appearance of a claimant who has requested a hearing, but argues that ORS 656.283(7), which provides that hearings shall be conducted \u201cin any manner that will achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>substantial justice,\u201d authorizes a referee to dismiss with prejudice, if the claimant does not personally appear. SAIF argues that \u201csubstantial justice\u201d includes an opportunity to confront and cross-examine an adverse party before there can be a factual decision on that party\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">However, ORS 656.283(7) also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the right of a worker, insurer or self-insured employer to present evidence at hearing * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">ORS 656.283(7) ensures that all parties will have the opportunity to present their evidence. Although a claimant may choose to present evidence through her own testimony, her choice not to do so does not prevent the insurer from presenting its evidence in defense of her claim. OAR 438-06-071 contemplates that a request for a hearing may be dismissed with prejudice if neither a claimant nor a claimant\u2019s attorney appear for hearing. Nothing in the rule authorizes the referee to dismiss the request simply because the claimant does not appear. Under the Board\u2019s rules, claimant was entitled to offer the remainder of her evidence, even if she chose not to testify personally. The referee erred when it denied her that opportunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\"> The record contained 38 documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-12\"> OAR 438-06-071 became effective within days before claimant\u2019s hearing. Previously, the applicable rule provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">\u201cFailure of a party to appear at a hearing without good cause constitutes a waiver of appearance. If the party failing to appear is the party that requested the hearing, the request for hearing may be dismissed unless good cause is shown and the other party is not prejudiced thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> We need not address claimant\u2019s other assignments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
