Goodsell, on June 6, 1978, filed a certificate of candidacy for the office of County Executive of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. The appellant, the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Prince George\u2019s County, refused to accept the certificate or place his name on the ballot, maintaining that he did not meet the qualifications for the office set forth in the County Charter. Goodsell then brought this action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a writ of mandamus. After a hearing, the court ordered that a writ of mandamus be issued, directing the Board to accept Mr. Goodsell\u2019s certificate of candidacy and to place his name on the ballot for the upcoming September 1978 primary election. The Board took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Because of the importance of the matter and the need for expedition, we issued a writ of certiorari prior to a decision by the Court of Special Appeals. On July 28, 1978, we filed a per curiam order affirming the decision of the circuit court, and we now state our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The issue in this case concerns \u00a7 405 of Art. IV of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he County Executive shall have been a <em>qualified voter </em>of Prince George\u2019s County for at least five years immediately preceding his election.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Mr. Goodsell became a resident of Prince George\u2019s County on August 1, 1972, and has resided there continuously since, a period in excess of five years. On April 23,1976, he registered to vote in Prince George\u2019s County and has remained registered since that time. Thus, at the time he tried to file for office, he had been a registered voter of the county for just slightly more than two years. Goodsell had satisfied all other requirements relating to his eligibility as a candidate for County Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In the circuit court, the Board contended that Goodsell was not entitled to be a candidate for County Executive because he was not a \u201cqualified voter\u201d of Prince George\u2019s County for the five years immediately preceding the election. The Board\u2019s position was that registration was one of the qualifications to vote, and that, therefore, one could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>a qualified voter for five years unless he had been a registered voter for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Goodsell, on the other hand, argued that there was a distinction between a qualified voter and a registered voter, and that a qualified voter was one who possessed the citizenship, age and residency qualifications to be entitled to register and vote. Alternatively, Goodsell argued that if the Prince George\u2019s County Charter required that one be a <em>registered </em>voter for the five years immediately preceding the election, such requirement would deny him the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The circuit court, in deciding that Goodsell was entitled to be on the ballot, held that \u00a7 405 of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter does not mean that a person must be a registered voter of the County for five years to be eligible to run for the office of County Executive. The court stated that the purpose of registration is \u201cto compile a list of qualified voters for the administrative purpose of avoiding last-minute confusion concerning who is qualified to vote. Thus, registration is not a prerequisite to one qualifying to vote; it is merely an administrative process which lists those voters who are already qualified to vote.\u201d Because of the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of Art. IV, \u00a7 405, of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter, it was unnecessary for the court to discuss Goodsell\u2019s alternate equal protection argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In this Court, the parties make the same arguments as below. Thus, the appellant Board, relying upon various provisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter, argues that the framers of the Charter intended that the phrase \u201cqualified voter\u201d in Art. IV, \u00a7 405, refers to a person who has the legal capacity to vote and has in fact been registered to vote for at least five years. The Board further argues, relying upon cases upholding substantial <em>residency </em>requirements to be a candidate for public office, that a five year <em>registration </em>requirement does not deprive one in Goodsell\u2019s position of the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The appellee Goodsell, on the other hand, in arguing that there is a distinction between a \u201cqualified voter\u201d and a \u201cregistered voter,\u201d and that to be a qualified voter one need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>not be registered, relies upon provisions of the Maryland Constitution and the State Election Code, Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.), Art. 33. These provisions seem to indicate that registration is not one of the \u201cqualifications\u201d for voting but is a mechanism for evidencing which voters have the requisite qualifications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to these Maryland constitutional and statutory provisions, Goodsell relies upon cases in other jurisdictions in support of his argument that registration is not a qualification within the meaning of the phrase \u201cqualified voter.\u201d <em>McComb v. Robelen, </em>13 Del. Ch. 157, 116 A. 745 (1922); <em>Gilbert v. Breithaupt, </em>60 Nev. 162, 104 P. 2d 183 (1940); <em>Alston v. Mays, </em>152 N.J. Super. 509, 378 A. 2d 72 (1977); <em>In re Ray, </em>26 N.J. Misc. 56, 56 A. 2d 761 (1947); <em>In re Sullivan, </em>307 Pa. 221, 160 A. 853 (1932); <em>Hindman v. Boyd, </em>42 Wash. 17, 84 P. 609, 613 (1906). <em>But cf. Lane v. Henderson, </em>39 Ariz. 457, 7 P. 2d 588 (1932); <em>State ex rel. Burke v. Campbell, </em>542 S.W.2d 355, 357-358 (Mo. Ct. App. 1976); <em>Southerland v. Town of </em>Goldsboro, 96 N. C. 49, 1 S. E. 760 (1887); <em>Defilipis v. Russell, </em>52 Wash. 2d 745, 328 P. 2d 904 (1958). Goodsell also reiterates his argument that, if the Prince George\u2019s County Charter does require that a person be a registered voter for five years to be eligible to run for County Executive, such requirement unconstitutionally discriminates against residents of Prince George\u2019s County who have not been registered to vote for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We assume, without deciding, that registration is not one of the qualifications to vote as the term \u201cqualified voter\u201d is <em>generally </em>interpreted, and that Art. I of the Maryland Constitution and \u00a7 3-4 of the Election Code reflect this general meaning. However, the issue in this case is not the meaning of the phrase \u201cqualified voter\u201d generally or the meaning of that phrase in some other context. The issue is what was the intent of those who framed and adopted the Prince George\u2019s County Charter. It is true that, in the absence of any indication in the Charter that the language was being used in a special sense, we would assume that the phrase was intended to have its general meaning. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Com\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 670, 392 A. 2d 1114, 1118 (1978); <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 593, 598, 380 A. 2d 1052 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U. S. 997, 98 S. Ct. 1650, 56 L.Ed.2d 86 (1978); <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elect. Co. v. Board, </em>278 Md. 26, 31, 358 A. 2d 241 (1976); <em>Blue Cross v. Franklin Sq. Hosp., </em>277 Md. 93, 105, 352 A. 2d 798 (1976); <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund Bd., </em>275 Md. 165, 169, 338 A. 2d 248 (1975). Nevertheless, in our view, the provisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter make it clear that the phrase \u201cqualified voter\u201d means one who, among other things, is registered to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The words \u201cqualified voter\u201d are used in different places in the County Charter. The meaning of the phrase is most clearly shown by Art. Ill, \u00a7 319, of the Charter. It provides that, with certain exceptions, any law enacted pursuant to the Charter may, upon a petition containing the signatures of 10,000 \u201cqualified voters,\u201d be submitted to the electorate for referendum. The section goes on to state that \u201c[a] minor variation in the signature of a petitioner between his signature on a petition and that on the voter registration records shall not invalidate the signature.\u201d Obviously, this provision contemplated that \u201cqualified voters\u201d were those whose signatures were on the voter registration records. The next sentence of the section provides that the appellant Board of Supervisors of Elections should verify the qualifications of each petitioner. The only way in which the Board could verify the qualifications of 10,000 or more signatories would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>be to check the signatures against the voter registration records. But if one did not have to be registered to be a \u201cqualified voter,\u201d and thus eligible to sign a petition, it would be impossible for the Board to carry out its verification responsibilities. <em>See Board of Supervisors Carroll Co. v. Smith, </em>111 U. S. 556, 565, 4 S. Ct. 539, 28 L. Ed. 517 (1884); <em>Southerland v. Town of Goldsboro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The referendum section also provides that \u201c[i]f such a petition is filed, the law to be referred shall not take effect until thirty calendar days after its approval by a majority of the qualified voters of the County voting thereon at the next\u201d regular election. In using the phrase \u201cqualified voters,\u201d the framers were likely referring to registered voters, as only registered voters would be \u201cvoting thereon\u201d at the next election.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Article III, \u00a7 303, and Art. IV, \u00a7 403, of the Charter provide that members of the County Council and the County Executive \u201cbe nominated and elected by the qualified voters of the entire County....\u201d However, under Art. I of the Maryland Constitution, no one may vote in any election unless that person is a registered voter. When the term \u201cqualified voters\u201d in the Charter is viewed in light of this constitutional requirement it would seem clear that under the Prince George\u2019s County Charter, in order to be a qualified voter one must be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In sum, we agree with the appellant Board that the phrase \u201cqualified voter\u201d in the Prince George\u2019s County Charter means one who possesses the present capacity to vote, and therefore he must be registered. Consequently, the provision in Art. IV, \u00a7 405, of the Charter, that the County Executive must be a \u201cqualified voter\u201d of the County for at least five years immediately preceding his election, includes a five year <em>registration </em>requirement. We must, therefore, deal with Goodsell\u2019s alternate argument that a five year registration requirement to be a candidate for County Executive unconstitutionally discriminates against those registered for a lesser period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The first step in dealing with a contention that a particular classification denies to members of one class the equal protection of the laws is to determine the appropriate standard for reviewing the classification. <em>Bullock v. Carter, </em>405 U. S. 134, 142, 92 S. Ct. 849, 855, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972); <em>Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 601-602. The usual standard of judicial review is the so-called rational basis test, which involves a high degree of deference to the legislative judgment. Under it, a classification made by law is presumed to be reasonable; the person assailing it has a heavy burden of showing that it is essentially arbitrary; and \u201cif any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u201d <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U. S. 61, 78-79, 31 S. Ct. 337, 340, 55 L. Ed. 369 (1911); <em>Montgomery Co. v. Fields Road, </em>282 Md. 575, 579-580, 386 A. 2d 344 (1978); <em>Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 602-603, and cases there collected. On the other hand, \u201c[w]hen fundamental rights or a suspect class are involved, the classification must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny and must be justified by a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 601. In the present case, the validity of the requirement that a candidate for Prince George\u2019s County Executive be a registered voter for five years may well depend upon which standard of judicial review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The appellant Board, citing <em>Bullock v. Carter, supra, </em>argues that \u201cthe pursuit of public office is [not] a fundamental right,\u201d and that, therefore, the rational basis test is applicable here. The Court in <em>Bullock </em>did point out that it \u201chas not heretofore attached such fundamental status to candidacy as to invoke a rigorous standard of review.\u201d 405 U. S. at 142-143. Nevertheless, the <em>Bullock </em>case does not support the Board\u2019s argument that no fundamental right is implicated by the charter provision here at issue. In <em>Bullock v. Carter, supra, </em>several prospective candidates for local office in Texas brought an action to have a state statutory scheme, requiring very high filing fees in primary elections, declared invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although, as previously noted, the Court indicated that the right to run for public office is itself not a fundamental right, the Court went on (405 U. S. at 143, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cHowever, the rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation; laws that affect candidates always have at least some theoretical, correlative effect on voters. Of course, not every limitation or incidental burden on the exercise of voting rights is subject to a stringent standard of review----Texas does not place a condition on the exercise of the right to vote, nor does it quantitatively dilute votes that have been cast. Rather, the Texas system creates barriers to candidate access to the primary ballot, thereby tending to limit the field of candidates from which voters might choose. The existence of such barriers does not of itself compel close <em>scrutiny.... In approaching candidate restrictions, it is essential to examine in a realistic light the extent and nature of their impact on voters.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The Court then stated that the high filing fees give the Texas system an \u201cexclusionary character,\u201d that many potential office seekers would as a practical matter be precluded from running for office, that the effect on voters \u201cis neither incidental nor remote,\u201d and that the voters are \u201csubstantially limited in their choice of candidates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143-144. Because of this impact upon voter choice, the Court concluded that the Texas filing requirements were subject to the same \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d test which is applicable to laws placing barriers upon the right to vote. <em>Id. </em>at 144. <em>See Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U. S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972); <em>Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, </em>383 U. S. 663, 86 S. Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Recently the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit applied the <em>Bullock </em>principles in a case like the instant one, concluding that a durational registration requirement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>subject to strict scrutiny. <em>Henderson v. Fort Worth Independent Sch. Dist., </em>526 F. 2d 286 (5th Cir. 1976), was an attack upon a Texas law requirement that candidates for the Fort Worth school board be \u201cqualified voters\u201d in the district for three years. The court initially pointed out that, under Texas law, this provision meant that a candidate had to be a registered voter for three years, 526 F. 2d at 289. After quoting from <em>Bullock v. Carter, supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit observed that \u201cthe extent and nature of the impact on voters, examined in a realistic light, is the key to the\u201d appropriate standard for judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 291. The court then concluded: \u201cNot unlike the exorbitant filing fees in <em>Bullock v. Carter,... </em>[the three year registration requirement] denies access to what must be assumed is a significant number of potential school board candidates, and on that basis the statute's impact on voters is substantial____We conclude that ... [the statute] must withstand strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">If a three year registration requirement for local office has a substantial impact upon voter choice as held in the <em>Henderson </em>case, it follows that a five year requirement like the one in the case at bar will have an even greater impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">It has often been pointed out that our society today is extremely mobile. Moreover, it is likely that there is much greater movement among counties within a state than between different states. Using Prince George\u2019s County as an example, the 1970 population of the County was 661,719.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the most recent United States Census Bureau information, in the five year period between 1965 and 1970, 229,448 people immigrated into Prince George\u2019s County. Within that same period of time, 129,855 people moved out of the county. Consequently, the total movement of the population both into and out of Prince George\u2019s County for this five year period was 359,303, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>extremely large figure in relation to total population.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With this type of movement into a county like Prince George\u2019s, and out of Prince George\u2019s County into other areas, it is obvious that a requirement of five years\u2019 registration in a metropolitan Maryland county, in order to run for a local office, will render a large number of residents ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">With respect to Prince George\u2019s County specifically, the 229,448 persons who moved into the County between 1965 and 1970, more than one-third of the County\u2019s population, would have been ineligible to run for County Executive under the five year registration provision. The potential impact upon voter choice is clearly substantial. Consequently, under <em>Bullock v. Carter, supra, </em>\u00a7 405 of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter must be judged by the strict scrutiny standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Under this strict review standard, it is incumbent upon the appellant Board to show that the five year registration requirement is \u201creasonably necessary to the accomplishment of legitimate\u201d governmental objectives, <em>Bullock v. Carter, supra, </em>405 U. S. at 144, 146-149, or \u201cnecessary to promote a <em>compelling </em>governmental interest,\u201d <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U. S. 618, 634, 89 S. Ct. 1322, 1331, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969). <em>See also Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 601; <em>Henderson v. Fort Worth Independent Sch. Dist., supra, </em>526 F. 2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The Board, relying on cases upholding durational residency requirements to run for public office, argues that the five year qualified voter provision in \u00a7 405 of the Charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>attempts to ensure that only persons who are \u201cthoroughly informed\u201d and have \u201ca deep seated awareness of the County\u201d will serve as County Executive. Assuming without deciding that this would be a sufficient governmental interest to justify a substantial <em>residency </em>requirement, we are here dealing with a durational <em>registration </em>requirement. If residency in the County for five years is needed to make a County Executive \u201caware\u201d of the County, Mr. Goodsell meets this test, as he has been a continuous resident for more than five years. The Board has suggested no relationship between mere registration and \u201cawareness of the County.\u201d And we can perceive little additional familiarity, a long-time resident of the County would have with local issues simply by being registered to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Board also claims that the five year registration condition \u201cis a measuring stick of an individual\u2019s commitment to Prince George\u2019s County\u201d and that it prevents \u201cthe proliferation of frivolous candidacies.\u201d However, this same asserted interest was not deemed sufficient in <em>Bullock v. Carter, supra, </em>to withstand the strict scrutiny test, the Supreme Court there saying: \u201cTo say that the filing fee requirement tends to limit the ballot to the more serious candidates is not enough.\u201d 405 U. S. at 145. Moreover, we doubt very much that a six year resident of Prince George\u2019s County who has been a registered voter for two years is any more likely to be a \u201cfrivolous\u201d candidate than a six year resident who has been a registered voter for five years. Regardless, in a democracy, the appropriate judges of which candidates are frivolous, and which candidates have the greater commitment to the County, are the voters on election day.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Finally, even shorter durational registration provisions have been stricken down by the courts. In <em>Henderson v. Fort Worth Independent Sch. Dist., supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a three year voter registration requirement, in order to seek election to a local school board, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The justification for the requirement was identical to that advanced in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>case. In rejecting this, the Fifth Circuit stated (526 F. 2d at 292):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cThe argued justification for section 7 is the state\u2019s interest in a ballot composed of knowledgeable and qualified candidates for the increasingly complex job of school board member. However, voter registration for a period of three years is, at best, a crude index of the capabilities of a potential candidate. The background, experience, and political views of the potential candidate are, among others, the indicia of merit and capability. No one contends, or could, that the state is empowered to impose qualifications or requirements in these areas. On the contrary, the power to make necessarily subjective discriminations on the basis of background, experience, or political philosophy rests with the voters of the Fort Worth School District. It can be assumed that opposing candidates will bring deficiencies in any of these areas to the attention of the voters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey, in <em>Gangemi v. Rosengard, </em>44 N. J. 166, 207 A. 2d 665 (1965), held that a two year voter registration requirement for the office of Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, was unconstitutionally discriminatory. In distinguishing a prior decision, <em>Stothers v. Martini, </em>6 N. J. 560, 79 A. 2d 857 (1951), upholding the legislative right to impose \u201creasonable\u201d qualifications for office, Chief Justice Weintraub for the court pointed to the difference between a <em>residency </em>qualification and a <em>registration </em>qualification (207 A. 2d at 668):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cHence while Stothers would support so much of Chapter 84 as requires two years of residence on the thesis that residence assures a rudimentary understanding of local conditions, it does not bear upon the validity of the further requirement of a two-year period of registration. On the contrary, since the required period of residence would supposedly provide an opportunity to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>familiar with local problems, the further demand for a two-year period of registration becomes the more baffling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The New Jersey Supreme Court then rejected the same type of rationale for a lengthy durational registration provision which the appellant Board offers in the present case, saying (207 A. 2d at 669):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cThe unusual nature of the qualification before us is evident.... Age, citizenship and residence are familiar in this area. Presumably they offer evidence respectively of maturity, loyalty, and either an acquaintance with local problems or a stake in their solution.... Other qualifications may arise out of the specialized demands of a particular office. It would be reasonable to require a candidate to be a lawyer, physician, or engineer if the duties of the elective office called for such professional skill. But it is another matter to measure qualifications for elective office by the depth of a candidate\u2019s interest in or understanding of public matters whether the test be the length of his registration record or some sophisticated quiz. One can quickly see the room for knavery if that proposition were accepted. As we have said, individual fitness is something the voters decide and the intensity of a candidate\u2019s interest is part and parcel of that subject. The Legislature cannot take that issue from them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Finding ourselves largely in agreement with the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Henderson </em>and the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>Gangemi, </em>we hold that the five year registration requirement for County Executive set forth in the Prince George\u2019s County Charter fails to withstand the applicable strict scrutiny standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It therefore discriminates against those county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>residents who are registered for a lesser period of time, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Due Process Clause, Art. 23, of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-5\">. Art. 1, \u00a7 1, of the Maryland Constitution sets out the qualifications of voters in this State, and these relate to citizenship, age and residency. Registration is not listed in \u00a7 1 as a \u201cqualification. Section 5 of Art. 1, renumbered \u00a7 2 as a result of a constitutional amendment approved in November 1978, deals with the registration of voters, stating in part that \u201c[t]he General Assembly shall provide by law for a uniform Registration of the names of all the voters in this State, who possess the qualifications prescribed in this Article, which Registration shall be conclusive evidence to the Judges of Election of the right of every person, thus registered, to vote at any election____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Election Code, Art. 33, \u00a7 3-4, also prescribes \u201cqualifications\u201d for voting, listing the constitutional qualifications as well as two others. Registration is not one of the listed qualifications, although it is dealt with as follows in subsection (a): \u201cOnly persons, constitutionally qualified to vote in the precinct or district, as the case may be, shall be registered as qualified voters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit also observed that a majority of courts have utilized a standard of strict scrutiny \u201cwhen examining less restrictive, but somewhat analogous durational requirements.\u201d Henderson v. Fort Worth Independent Sch. Dist., 526 F. 2d 286, 292 (5th Cir. 1976), and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">. U. S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Series P-25, No. 739, Current Population Reports, table 8, page 55 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">. U. S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Series P-25, No. 701, Current Population Reports, Gross Migration by County: 1965 to 1970, page 58 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">. It should be emphasized that our application of the strict scrutiny test is in the context of a local office such as County Executive. It may well be that a five year registration requirement would not likely have much impact on voter choice with respect to other types of offices. For example, considering a major statewide office such as Governor or Lieutenant Governor, it may be that normally almost all candidates would have been politically active or held public office previously and would likely have been registered voters in Maryland for five years. Moreover, a requirement that one be a registered voter in the State for five years does not have the same exclusionary impact as a requirement that one be a registered voter of a particular county for five years. We do not here mean to intimate any opinion one way or the other regarding a substantial registration requirement for other offices; we merely wish to make it clear that the application here of a higher standard than the rational basis test is limited to the type of office involved in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">. Two other reported decisions may appear to support a contrary result, although both cases are clearly distinguishable from the one at bar. Hendrix v. State ex rel. Oklahoma State Elec. Bd., 554 P. 2d 770 (Okla. 1976), and State ex rel. Burke v. Campbell, 542 S.W.2d 355 (Mo. Ct. App. 1976). In <em>Hendrix, </em>a divided Supreme Court of Oklahoma upheld a six month registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>requirement to run for the state legislature. In <em>Campbell, </em>a divided intermediate appellate court in Missouri upheld a two year \u201cqualified voter\u201d provision, which included a registration requirement, to be a candidate for the state legislature. However, in <em>Campbell, </em>the candidate failed to satisfy the two year <em>residency </em>condition as well as the registration directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We are aware of no decision upholding, against an equal protection challenge, a durational registration requirement for a local office as long as five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">. Although the Maryland Constitution does not contain an express equal protection clause, the Supreme Court has held that the concept of equal protection is embodied in the due process requirement of the United States Constitution, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 74 S. Ct. 693, 98 L. Ed. 884 (1954), and we have long equated Art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights with the Due Process Clauses of the Federal Constitution, Westchester West No. 2 v. Mont. Co., 276 Md. 448, 465 n. 11, 348 A. 2d 856, 866 (1975), and cases there cited. Moreover, we have regularly proceeded upon the assumption that the principle of equal protection of the laws is included in Art. 23 of the Declaration of Rights. Attorney General v. Johnson, 282 Md. 274, 306 n. 30, 385 A. 2d 57 (1978); Governor v. Exxon Corp., 279 Md. 410, 438 n. 8, 370 A. 2d 1102, 1118 n. 8 (1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>437 U. S. 117, 98 S.
