She came under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the court at the age of 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>years. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 3-804 (a). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-804 (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 20 September 1972 the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City filed a petition in the court showing that she was delinquent for the reason that on the day before she \u201cfeloniously, wilfully and of deliberately premeditated malice aforethought did murder [a child] age 3.\u201d She was duly found to be delinquent upon a determination that she had committed an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult and that she required supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation. Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) art. 26, \u00a7 70-1 (g) and (h).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">It is no more than fair to say that every attempt was made during the succeeding six years to supervise, guide, treat and rehabilitate Johanna. We give a compendium of those efforts. On 24 November 1972 she was committed to the Department and sent to the Montrose School pending placement. On 28 August 1973 she was placed in the Edgemeade Rehabilitation Center, Mountain Home, Idaho. She absconded from that facility on 6 January 1974. She was apprehended and returned to Montrose School on 5 February 1974. By order of 9 January 1975, the court committed her to the Department for placement at Elan One. She completed the initial treatment phase of its program and advanced to \u201ca semi-independent living situation.\u201d She became pregnant and the pregnancy was medically aborted. She became extensively involved in the use of drugs. She attempted to commit suicide. In June 1977, she absconded from Elan One.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The following September Johanna was taken into custody in Baltimore City where she was working as a \u201clive-in baby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>sitter.\u201d She was interviewed by Dr. Ivan Laurich of the Medical Office of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City. He opined that she was not in need of institutionalization at that time. She was enrolled in the Maryland Business School for GED/Secretarial Training and placed in a foster home. That placement and several following placements in foster homes were terminated at the request of the foster parents due to Johanna\u2019s resistance to abiding by rules of conduct. She was placed at the Youth Hostel, but that \u201cwas terminated for creating conflict among the other residents.\u201d She again became involved with drugs and her attendance at school was spasmodic. Efforts were made to place her in a psychiatric halfway house with out-patient therapy, but she refused to attend therapy sessions. She \u201ceffectively sabotaged\u201d interviews for admission to St. Paul House and Fellowship House with the result that she was not accepted. In April 1978 arrangements were made with an agency to finance an apartment for her provided she attend school and refrain from the use of drugs. Shortly thereafter she failed to comply with those conditions. Her use of drugs increased to the point where all her spending money was being used to obtain them. Frequent complaints were received from the manager and tenants of the apartment in which she was residing about the disturbances she was causing. In May of 1978 she was committed to Springfield Hospital following an overdose of drugs. She was released two weeks later and attempted suicide that same night. Unsuccessful in her attempt to be recommitted to Springfield, she was referred to Second Genesis but was not accepted because of the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Other resources being exhausted, Elan One was contacted and agreed to take Johanna back into its program. On 30 June 1978, before this could be effected, she ran away, and a warrant was issued for her apprehension on charges of \u201cbeing in violation of court order by running away and refusing to cooperate with the court.\u201d About two weeks later' she was located in Columbia, South Carolina and made another attempt to commit suicide. She was brought back to Baltimore the next day. Upon determination by the court that it was necessary to detain her pending a hearing she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>placed in the custody of the Department until 18 July on order of the court issued 13 July. On 17 July a probation worker of the Department of Juvenile Services petitioned the court to take action on the matter. At a hearing on 18 July the case was postponed by the court because no parent was present nor had the Public Defender\u2019s Office been notified, and by order the same day the custody of the Department pending a hearing was extended to a period not exceeding 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On 26 July there was a plenary hearing before the court at which Johanna had the assistance of counsel. Testimony was received by the District Supervisor of Committee Programs for the Department of Juvenile Services, the probation worker who had petitioned the court to take action (referred to in the proceeding as a \u201cjuvenile counsellor\u201d), a medical doctor and a psychologist from the Medical Office of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, Johanna\u2019s mother and Johanna. The judge rendered an opinion from the bench. He found that Johanna was \u201cno longer a hazard to public safety,\u201d which he \u201crejoiced in\u201d as \u201cindeed a substantial development, a welcome development.\u201d He also found, however, that Johanna needed \u201cmuch more rehabilitation,\u201d which he deemed \u201ca matter of serious concern.\u201d He observed that for a year she had the chance to go back to her mother, but \u201c[i]t has not worked out from both ends. Her mother has rejected her daughter, and the daughter has rejected her mother.\u201d On the other hand, he believed that, on balance, Elan One \u201cdid an enormous help,\u201d and although it did not solve all the problems in two and a half years, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can diminish what the accomplishments were.\u201d The judge declared that realistically there were only two alternatives with respect to the current disposition of Johanna \u2014 community placement or institutional placement. It was the unanimous view of the medical doctor, the psychologist and the juvenile counsellor that community placement was not appropriate in the circumstances. It was the opinion of the medical doctor and the psychologist that institutional placement in other than Elan One \u201cwould be a caretaking procedure only,\u201d and that, the judge observed, \u201cis what we are not interested in....\u201d The major concern was further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>steps toward rehabilitation. The order of 26 July 1978 committing Johanna to the custody of the Department for placement at Elan One followed. It set out the basis for the court\u2019s action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">WHEREAS, Johanna ... has been adjudged a delinquent and has been made a ward of this Court at an adjudicatory hearing duly held on the 20th day of November 1972; and this cause having come on for disposition at a hearing duly scheduled on notice to all parties; and the testimony of witnesses and argument having been heard; and the Court having considered the respondent\u2019s age and physical and mental condition; the availability and respondent\u2019s amenability to treatment, training and a program of rehabilitation best suited to the physical, mental and moral welfare of the respondent consistent with the public interest; the nature of the offense alleged to have been committed or participated in by the respondent; and the public safety; and it appearing to the Court that the best interests of both the respondent and the public would be served by removing the respondent from her present environment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Johanna claims now, as she claimed below, that the court lacked jurisdiction to order that she be returned to Elan One.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Section 3-804 spells out when the court has exclusive original jurisdiction over a child and when it does not have jurisdiction over a child. It has exclusive original jurisdiction over a child alleged to be delinquent, \u00a7 3-804 (a), unless that child was 14 years old or older and the allegation to show delinquency was that he had committed an act, which, if committed by an adult, would be punishable by death or life imprisonment, \u00a7 3-804 (d) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is plain, therefore, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>court obtained exclusive original jurisdiction over Johanna by virtue of the petition filed in 1972. Although the act which she was alleged to have committed would have constituted murder in the first degree if committed by an adult, she was then only 13 years of age. Section 3-806 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">If the court obtains jurisdiction over a child, that jurisdiction continues until that person reaches 21 years of age unless terminated sooner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Thus, the jurisdiction obtained by the court over Johanna would continue until she became 21 years old, unless terminated sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Johanna urges that the court\u2019s jurisdiction over her terminated under the provisions of \u00a7 3-825:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), an order vesting legal custody in an individual, agency, or institution is effective for an indeterminate period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">(b) An order providing for custody of a child adjudicated delinquent or in need of supervision may not exceed three years from the date entered. However, the court may renew the order upon its own motion, or pursuant to a petition filed by the individual, institution, or agency having legal custody after notice and hearing as prescribed by the Maryland Rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">(c) An order under this section is not effective after the child becomes 21 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Johanna points to the fact that when the court on 26 July 1978 ordered her committed to the custody of the Department for placement at Elan One, the original order under which she had been placed at Elan One had expired under the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>of \u00a7 3-825 (b) by the lapse of three years from the date it was entered. She argues that \u00a7 3-825 (b) operated to divest the court of jurisdiction over her upon the expiration of the original order. In other words, she contends that as soon as she could no longer be contained at Elan One under the original order, the jurisdiction of the court over her, which it had obtained by the 1972 allegation of delinquency, was finally terminated. Jurisdiction could be regained, she urges, only upon a fresh allegation, duly made, as required by \u00a7 3-804 (a), namely that she was delinquent, in need of supervision, or in need of assistance. We do not see it that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">After the allegation against a child under the jurisdiction* of the court has been proved at an adjudicatory hearing, \u00a7 3-819, the disposition of that child shall be determined at a separate hearing, \u00a7 3-820 (a). \u201cThe overriding consideration in making a disposition is a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation best suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child consistent with the public interest.\u201d \u00a7 3-820 (b). The disposition of the child which the court may make is not unbridled, however. With respect to an award of custody, the question must arise \u201cin connection with a matter which is within its exclusive jurisdiction under Sections 3-804 and 3-805 (a) of the Courts Article,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and the determination of the question [must be] necessary to make an appropriate disposition.\u201d Maryland Rule 917 (a). If this test is met, the court may commit the child, as it did here, to the custody of the Department for placement in a designated institution, \u00a7 3-820 (b) (2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> subject to certain limitations on the place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>commitment set out in \u00a7 3-823. And, as we have seen, an order providing for custody of a child adjudicated delinquent may not exceed three years from the date entered, \u00a7 8-825 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">It is clear that jurisdiction and custody are separate and distinct. The statutes and rules regarding them are unambiguous and in no way conflicting. Section 8-825 (b) only qualifies the court\u2019s power regarding custody. The running of the period which a custody order may not exceed serves only to bring an end to that order; the jurisdiction of the court over the person still exists. The jurisdiction which the court gained by an allegation and an adjudication that a child is delinquent remains inviolate, completely unaffected by the lapse of a custody order. In short, the jurisdiction of the court is not terminated because the custody order terminated upon the passage of three years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, in this case, the sole effect of the termination of the custody order on 9 January 1978 by the lapse of three years from the time it was entered<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was to put custody of Johanna in limbo. She was then an adult,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but was under the age of 21 years, so that her rights as an adult were subject to the jurisdiction of the court, and that jurisdiction, as provided by \u00a7 8-806 (a), continues until she becomes 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>It is quite apparent, therefore, that the court had the power on 26 July 1978 to commit Johanna to the custody of the Department for placement in Elan One. The court had jurisdiction over her. The question of custody arose in connection with a matter which was within the court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction under \u00a7 3-804, and its determination was necessary to make an appropriate disposition. Commitment to the Department was expressly permitted by \u00a7 3-820 (b) (2). The placement in Elan One was not prohibited by \u00a7 3-823.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We see nothing in the provision of \u00a7 3-825 (b) granting the court authority to renew an order for custody which requires that the renewal be within three years from the entry of the original order. The purpose of the three year limitation on a custody order is patently to preclude a person\u2019s remaining in custody for an indefinite time without the opportunity to have the need for commitment reconsidered by the court. The section establishes three years as a proper time for such reconsideration. It does not impose a sanction and most certainly does not divest the court of jurisdiction. It is immaterial whether the second placement of Johanna at Elan One be considered a renewal of the order originally placing her in that facility or whether it be deemed a new disposition of her, albeit it is a facility which had previously been engaged in efforts to rehabilitate her. The order of 26 July 1978 was not only come by under prescribed procedures, its issuance was within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Johanna moved this Court to strike the Appendix to her brief in light of an agreed statement of facts included in the State\u2019s brief. The motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant\u2019s motion to strike Appendix to her brief granted; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-13\">. The custody order designated the facility as \u201cElon I\u201d and gave its address as \u201cPortland Springs, Maine.\u201d We understand that the correct name is \u201cElan One,\u201d and that it is located in Poland Springs, Maine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">. To avoid confusion, we cite to the statutes as presently codified. In 1972 juvenile causes were covered by Code (1967, 1973 Repl. Vol.) art. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 51-71. Art. 26 was repealed by Acts 1973, 1st Sp. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 1. Juvenile causes were placed in Code (1974) \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 to 3-842 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings article. Acts 1975, ch. 554 repealed those sections and enacted new \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 to 3-833 in lieu thereof. Throughout the revisions there were no changes in substance as to the statutes relevant to the appeal before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, references to sections are to the Courts and Judicial Proceedings article of the 1974 Code, 1978 Cumulative Supplement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">.
