Mayes, Jacquelyn Mayes, and John W. Gooding. <em>State v. Mayes, </em>39 Md. App. 635, 387 A. 2d 794 (1978). Finding that the three indictments were not validly obtained under the federal wiretap law and, consequently, were properly dismissed, we will affirm that court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Prior to a discussion of the reasons for our decision in this case, we think it helpful to digress briefly and set forth at least a thumbnail sketch of the workings and interrelationship of the federal and Maryland statutory provisions dealing with electronic surveillance that play a central role here. When it became clear in the wake of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Berger v. New York, </em>388 U. S. 41, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1967), and <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U. S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), that there are constitutional strictures on both the state and national governments\u2019 right to conduct electronic surveillance, Congress decided to confront the problem. Relying on its plenary power to control interstate commerce under section eight of article one of the United States Constitution, it enacted as a portion of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, tit. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 801-804, 82 Stat. 197, what is now popularly referred to as Title III. In seeking to protect the privacy of the individual while at the same time aiding in the enforcement of the criminal laws, <em>see </em>S. Rep. No. 1097,90th Cong., 2d Sess. 66-69 (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>[1968] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2112, 2153-56, the Congress insured that a uniform national standard would govern the use of electronic surveillance by including within Title Ill\u2019s provisions standards for the use of wiretaps that the states, if they chose to allow their law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>enforcement officials to undertake such surveillance, must, at a minimum, comply with but which they may, if they desire, make more restrictive. <em>See State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 271, 292 A. 2d 86, 94 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The provisions of Title III, which now stand substantially as they did when the wiretaps in this case were executed, presently are codified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 (1976). In Maryland, from 1956 until 1977, electronic surveillance was permitted by the General Assembly under Md. Code (1974), \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 to 408 of the Courts Article (previously codified as Md. Code (1957), Art. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 92-99). These requirements were subsequently revised so that effective July 1, 1977, new provisions, now found at Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 to 412 of the Courts Article, control. Although there is some question in this case about which set of state statutory provisions should be applied \u2014 the earlier being in effect at the time of the application for and execution of the initial wiretap order, while the latter were in force at the time the parties presented to the circuit court the questions we find dispositive here \u2014 we need not determine the issue because we think that our conclusion is compelled by the minimum standards enunciated in the federal legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Examining the statutory sections of importance here, we find that under the terms of Title III an order issued by a state judicial officer authorizing a wiretap must enumerate the offenses for which there is probable cause to conduct surveillance, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 (3) (a) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-408 (c) (l)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> those crimes for which taps can be initiated being circumscribed by the statute itself. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (2) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-406). It was recognized by the Congress, however, that in the course of an authorized wiretap, evidence of \u201cother offenses\u201d not named in the original order might surface. To provide for this contingency, in line with the act\u2019s purpose of limiting the use of unauthorized wiretaps, it was statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>mandated that such evidence could be used as testimony in any state \u201cproceeding\u201d only if the government \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d sought and obtained judicial authorization for such further use. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (3), (5) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-407 (c), (e)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Against this background, we now turn to our analysis of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Acting in response to a petition by the State\u2019s Attorney, Judge William B. Bowie, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, issued an ex parte order on October 27, 1976, authorizing the county police to use wiretaps to intercept the telephone conversations of James I. Mayes and others that allegedly were being made from a designated location and related to \u201cillegal sports bookmaking and narcotics.\u201d Based on the information from these taps, acquired between October 28 and November 18, 1976, a search warrant was obtained from Judge Bowie and executed on November 19, 1976. The evidence procured as a result of this search, as well as the logs of the previously intercepted communications, was then presented to the grand jury and on March 23, 1977, that body returned indictments charging the respondents and others with various drug and gambling offenses, including possession of marihuana and phencyclidine (POP) and keeping a gaming table.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Following the filing of the indictments, each of the respondents answered with a motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the November 19 search on the grounds that the initial wiretap order was invalid. At the circuit court hearing on the motions in August 1977, Judge Howard S. Chasanow denied the requests, but at the same time suggested to the parties that Judge Bowie\u2019s original order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>may not have been sufficiently broad to have authorized the disclosure to the grand jury of conversations dealing with marihuana, PCP, and gambling offenses other than sports bookmaking. The State responded to this intimation by filing a Petition for Disclosure with Judge Bowie pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (5) (1976), Md. Code (1974), \u00a7 10-406 of the Courts Article, and Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-407 (e) of the Courts Article in which it acknowledged that the subject of the intercepted conversations possibly related to crimes other than those of illegal sports bookmaking and the sale of narcotics specified in the initial wiretap order and asked that it be given authority to use all evidence of illegal activities garnered from the taps. Judge Bowie conducted a hearing on this motion on October 18, 1977, and, after interpreting his October 1976 order as not contemplating the interception of conversations dealing with nonnarcotic drugs such as marihuana and PCP or conversations relating to illegal gambling of a kind other than sports bookmaking, declined to grant the Petition for Disclosure. As the basis of his refusal, Judge Bowie declared that the prosecution\u2019s section 2517 (5) disclosure request, made nearly a year after the wiretap interceptions and after their use before the grand jury, had not been made \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d as required by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (5) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-407 (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Encouraged by this ruling, respondents renewed their motions to suppress, this time incorporating with them requests that the indictments be dismissed. On November 2, 1977, Judge Chasanow, after concluding that he was bound by Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling as to both the scope of the original order and the timeliness of the government\u2019s disclosure petition, determined that the dismissal of all counts of the indictments was required. Such a sanction was in order, according to the judge, because the State conceded that the grand jury had before it and could have utilized the intercepted conversations dealing with marihuana, PCP, and illegal gambling other than sports bookmaking when it considered each of the alleged violations that resulted in each of the counts of the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Claiming authority under Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 12-302 (c) (1) of the Courts Article to appeal the dismissal rulings, before the Court of Special Appeals the State urged reversal for three reasons: 1) Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling was in error, 2) Judge Chasanow was incorrect in stating that he was obliged to follow Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling, and 3) dismissal of the indictments was not the proper sanction for this type of violation of the wiretap statute. In affirming the circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals concluded, as to the first contention, that because the State did not appeal Judge Bowie\u2019s October 1977 ruling within thirty days of its entry, as that court held it was statutorily entitled to do under Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-408 (i) (3) of the Courts Article, it was bound by that order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State v. Mayes, supra, </em>39 Md. App. at 641-42, 387 A. 2d at 797-98. In addressing the second contention, the appellate court found that Judge Chasanow was likewise bound by Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling on the Petition for Disclosure because denial of the petition was tantamount to granting a motion to suppress from which there was no de novo review at the trial court level. <em>Id. </em>at 642 [798] (applying Maryland Rule 736 f 2). Finally, the Court of Special Appeals held that dismissal of the indictments was the correct remedy in this case for the State\u2019s improper use of the conversations not authorized to be seized under the original wiretap order. <em>Id. </em>at 643-45 [798-99],</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Before this Court the State has urged the same grounds for reversal it did before the intermediate appellate court, but in reaching what we conclude to be the correct disposition of the matter we do not consider either the extent to which Judge Chasanow was bound by Judge Bowie s determination <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the appealability, at the instance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>State, of the two circuit court rulings. Rather, we will simply assume, without deciding, that such an appeal does lie and move on to a consideration of whether, under section 2517 (5), additional judicial authorization was needed prior to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In this regard, the State contends that because the evidence relating to PCP and marihuana was not evidence relating to \u201coffenses other than those specified in the order of authorization or approval,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (5) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-407(e)), there was no reason for obtaining subsequent section 2517 (5) authorization prior to its use before the grand jury and, as a consequence, the failure to obtain such authority has no impact on this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of this assertion the Attorney General first contends that the marihuana and PCP offenses were encompassed within the initial wiretap authorization of October 27, 1976. Referring to that document, the State points out that in its preamble and again in its conclusion the order alludes to violations of the laws dealing with \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This, it asserts, shows that Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Bowie authorized the seizure of conversations relating to marihuana and PCP because even though neither is a \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d each comes within the statutory definition of a \u201ccontrolled dangerous substance.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802 (6), (16), 812 (c) (1976); Md. Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Yol. &amp; 1976 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 277 (f), (q), 279. In further support of this contention, the State asks us to examine the police affidavit that was submitted to procure the initial wiretap order in which, it urges, it was made clear that the authorities were seeking evidence as to crimes dealing with controlled dangerous substances rather than only those relating to narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">After examining in full Judge Bowie\u2019s October 1976 order together with the State\u2019s supporting affidavit, we accept his determination that this order was not designed to encompass the seizure of conversations relating to all controlled dangerous substances and gambling offenses but only to the investigation of criminal conduct involving violations of the narcotics laws and illegal sports bookmaking. In reaching this conclusion we begin with the premise that an unambiguous wiretap order does not require interpretation and any expansion or contraction of its scope at the expense of its plain meaning will not be permitted. Here, however, a construction of the order was authorized because, we conclude, ambiguity exists as to its reach. This is demonstrated by a comparison of the earlier referred to language relied on by the State, note 6 <em>supra, </em>with the following pivotal provision of the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">IT IS, THEREFORE, This 27th day of October, 1976, ORDERED that pursuant to the attached Petition of the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, [the Prince George\u2019s County Police were authorized] ... to intercept and record telephonic wire communications ... dealing with violations of the laws regulating <em>illegal sports bookmaking and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>narcotics____Authority under this Order shall not terminate automatically upon obtaining or intercepting the first of the described conversations, there being probable cause to believe that repeated communications will occur with many other persons concerning the <em>illegal sports bookmaking operation and narcotics law violations </em>and the conspiracy to violate the above laws, and other matters related to violations of the laws regulating <em>illegal sports bookmaking and narcotics laws. </em>[(Emphasis supplied.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Nor is this ambiguity resolved by reference to the affidavit used to obtain the order. While to a limited extent an affidavit used in applying for authorization to conduct wiretap surveillance, if it is incorporated by reference or more fully defines a term or terms used in the order, might be of some aid in interpreting the initial order, here the affidavit only compounds the ambiguity because it likewise uses both the terms \u201cnarcotic\u201d and \u201ccontrolled dangerous substance\u201d without further particularization or explanation. When, as here, ambiguity exists as to the extent of the authority granted by the wiretap order, we think the trial judge\u2019s interpretation is entitled on appeal to great weight in resolving such an ambiguity (again assuming appellate review is permissible at the instance of the State), particularly when the reviewing judge was the author of the original order. Thus, we accept Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling that the offenses for which authorization to tap was given were limited to those involving narcotics and did not encompass marihuana, PCP, and other nonnarcotic drugs. Moreover, the result reached here, by confining the scope of the order to the narrower of the two possible interpretations, comports with the legislative purpose of protecting the privacy of the individual. <em>See </em>Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, tit. Ill, \u00a7 801 (b), (d), 82 Stat. 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Possibly anticipating this determination, the State argues in the alternative that the term \u201cnarcotics\u201d should be read broadly to allow for the use of conversations with respect to any related drug crime, including marihuana and PCP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>possession and sale, without the necessity of further judicial authorization under section 2517 (5). We, however, decline to accept this suggested expansion of the scope of the October 1976 order, for to do so would undermine the protection afforded individual privacy by the requirements of Title III. The Congress certainly indicated its intent that, within certain limits, state judges could broadly delineate the offenses for which they were granting authorization to tap, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (2) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-406),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> yet, in doing so, we do not think Congress was seeking to limit the extent to which a judge, in an initial order, could curb the general scope of a wiretap which is statutorily permitted so that the seizure of any evidence relating to an offense other than that specifically named could not be used in a state proceeding prior to obtaining further judicial authorization. Supporting this conclusion is the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States v. Brodson, </em>528 F. 2d 214 (7th Cir. 1975). In <em>Brodson </em>the government had sought and obtained authorization to intercept conversations dealing only with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, which prohibits the operation of an illegal gambling business in interstate commerce. Subsequently, the wiretap evidence intercepted pursuant to that order was used by the government to obtain an indictment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>defendant for transmitting wagers and wagering information in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, on motion of the defendant, dismissed the indictment because the government had not obtained authorization under section 2517 (5) to use the evidence in charging the section 1084 violation. On appeal, the government contended that no authorization was necessary \u201cbecause the evidence secured under the Section 1955 order and authorization and used in that prosecution applied equally well to the Section 1084 prosecution.\u201d 528 F. 2d at 216. The federal Seventh Circuit, however, found it to be \u201cof no consequence ... because the two offenses are wholly separate and distinct; they involve dissimilar elements and require different evidence, even though some of it might overlap because both concern illegal gambling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The basis for this more restrictive definition of \u201cother offenses\u201d under section 2517 (5), the court stated, was \u201cto carry out the purpose of the Congress and make certain that the privacy of the individual is protected [as provided in Title III].\u201d <em>Id.; accord, United States v. Marion, </em>535 F. 2d 697, 705-06 (2d Cir. 1976). We think this federal precedent portends a similar result here. While the Attorney General, no doubt, would crave a more lenient, less literal interpretation of what constitutes an \u201cother crime,\u201d wiretap evidence of which has to be judicially authorized under section 2517 (5) before it can be used, we can but agree with the <em>Marion </em>court when it cogently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">Strict compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 2517 (5) and the other strictures imposed by Title III is ... essential. Congress carefully circumscribed utilization of the occasionally useful but potentially dangerous law enforcement tools of electronic surveillance in an effort to comply with the Fourth Amendment and to \u201cprotect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications [and] the integrity of court and administrative proceedings.\u201d To ignore or gloss over these restrictions, or view them as mere technicalities to be read in such a fashion as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>render them nugatory, then, is to place in peril our cherished personal liberties. [535 F. 2d at 706 (citations and footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><em>See State v. </em>Siegel, 266 Md. 256, 273-74, 292 A. 2d 86, 95-96 (1972). <em>But see </em>C. Fishman, <em>Wiretapping and Eavesdropping </em>\u00a7 166, at 246-49 (1978) <em>(Brodson </em>and <em>Marion </em>courts\u2019 interpretations \u201cunnecessarily rigid and formalistic\u201d). Consequently, in accord with <em>Brodson </em>and <em>Marion, </em>we now hold that, without further authorization under section 2517 (5), Judge Bowie\u2019s initial order, being limited to the seizure of communications dealing with specific types of drug and gambling violations, only authorized the State to use the evidence gained from the wiretap in the prosecution of crimes involving narcotics and illegal sports bookmaking.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">It follows from what we have just said that if the State desired to use the evidence pertaining to PCP and marihuana offenses to gain indictments, it was obligated \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d to acquire subsequent judicial authorization under section 2517 (5). This, as Judge Bowie determined, the State obviously did not do for the Petition for Disclosure was not presented to the judge until nearly one year after the conversations were intercepted. Moreover, we think the State in this case was precluded, at the time it attempted to do so, from gaining section 2517 (5) authority because, at a minimum, such permission must be sought prior to use in a \u201cproceeding,\u201d here the grand jury, of the evidence pertaining to \u201cother crimes.\u201d To procure such a section 2517 (5) order, the Congress spelled out the government\u2019s burden as one of \u201cshowing that the original order was lawfully obtained, that it was sought in good faith and not as [a] subterfuge search, and that the communication was in fact incidentally intercepted during the course of a lawfully executed order.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 100 (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>[1968] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2112, 2189. Thus, the Congress has made evident its intention that section 2517 (5) should serve the purpose of preventing the government from evading the restrictions put upon the original application (e.g., showing probable cause, enumerating the offense, showing the ineffectiveness of other investigative techniques) by naming one crime while anticipating the interception of evidence of another offense for which it could not meet the requirements for securing an initial wiretap authorization. <em>United States v. Marion, supra, </em>535 F. 2d at 701. In this case, by supplying to the grand jury the wiretap conversations relating to PCP and marihuana prior to seeking judicial authorization, the government totally frustrated the purpose of and intent behind section 2517 (5), conduct which should not be legitimated by a court. <em>See United States v. Marion, supra, </em>535 F. 2d at 707; <em>United States v. Brodson, supra, </em>528 F. 2d at 215-16; <em>United States v. Aloi, </em>449 F. Supp. 698, 722 (E.D.N.Y. 1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In concluding that Judge Bowie correctly determined that the State should have sought judicial approval prior to using the evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d before the grand jury, we find that we have not exhausted all the issues in this appeal that require our attention for we are still confronted with Judge Chasanow\u2019s action dismissing the indictments, which ordinarily constitutes an appealable judgment under Md. Code (1974,1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 12-302 (c) (1) of the Courts Article. In this regard, though conceding that the indictments were, at least to a degree, the product of the grand jury\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the wiretap communications whose disclosure Judge Bowie refused to authorize, the State nonetheless contends that since the facial validity of these accusations is not at issue here, the fact that such evidence was submitted to the grand jury and used by it as a basis for returning the indictments does not mandate their dismissal; rather, according to the State, the remedy, if any, afforded the defendants for such an improper use is a civil damage suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520 (1976) and Md. Code (1974,1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-410 of the Courts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The Attorney General is quite correct in asserting that, ordinarily, the nature of the evidence before a grand jury, even if that evidence was illegally seized or for some other reason would not be admissible at trial, does not destroy the validity of an indictment. <em>Sec, e.g., United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U. S. 338, 344-45, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974) (evidence from illegal search and seizure); <em>United States v. Costello, </em>350 U. S. 359, 363, 76 S. Ct. 406, 100 L. Ed. 397 (1956) (hearsay evidence); <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 486, 488, 337 A. 2d 100, 116 (1975) (evidence from illegal search and seizure). In the context of this case, however, that rule has been modified by statute to prohibit the unauthorized use of communications relating to crimes not named in the initial wiretap authorization in \u201cany proceeding\u201d held under the authority of a state, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2515,2517 (3), (5) (1976) (Cts. Art. (1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-406, -407(c), (e)), a far-reaching ban that includes use by a grand jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Marion, supra, 535 </em>F. 2d at 703; <em>United States v. Brodson, supra, </em>528 F. 2d at 215-16. Further, we have heretofore made clear that the dismissal of an indictment, based solely on wiretap evidence which use is not properly authorized, is an appropriate sanction. <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 274, 292 A. 2d 86, 95 (1972). In <em>Siegel </em>this Court upheld the dismissal of an indictment based on evidence seized under an invalid order authorizing a wiretap, stating: \u201cThe [wiretap] statute sets up a strict procedure that <em>must </em>be followed and we will not abide any deviation, no matter how slight, from the prescribed path.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); <em>accord, United States v. Marion, supra, </em>535 F. 2d at 706; <em>United States v. Brodson, supra, </em>528 F. 2d at 216; <em>see United States v. Aloi, supra, </em>449 F. Supp. at 721-23. While the directive contained in this language has not been eroded by any decision of this Court over the intervening seven years, and we here today reaffirm the propriety of the dismissal of the indictment in that case, nonetheless we must point out a potentially important distinction between that case and the one presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In <em>Siegel, </em>the wiretap involved initially was authorized for the seizure of conversations dealing with violations of state lottery laws, and the single-count indictment that followed, which charged the defendant with conspiracy to violate those laws, was obtained solely on the basis of the conversations seized during the tap later determined by this Court to be invalid from its inception. 266 Md. at 258-59, 272-74, 292 A. 2d at 87-88, 95-96. Thus, the entire charge was dismissed because the conversations seized in the illegal wiretap and used by the grand jury were germane to and the sole foundation for the only count contained in the indictment. Here, however, where the question is whether evidence seized in the course of a properly authorized and executed wiretap can be utilized, a somewhat more involved analysis may be required because all of the indictments contain multiple counts and two have several counts, such as possession of the narcotic drug cocaine, that could have been founded solely on conversations that would have been authorized for seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>and use under Judge Bowie\u2019s October 1976 order. It is, therefore, at least arguable that, if there were conversations relating to narcotic drug offenses, then the counts of the indictments pertaining solely to those offenses need not have been dismissed if the intercepted evidence of nonnarcotic drug crimes could in no way form a basis for those charges. Certainly, a contrary result is not mandated by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Siegel. </em>Moreover, even if there were no intercepted conversations relating to narcotic drug crimes, there was other evidence obtained through the execution of the search warrant which was before the grand jury and could have been the sole basis for the narcotic drug offense counts of the indictments. It is also arguable that if it could be shown that the search warrant here was valid even though the affidavit used to obtain it contained \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence lacking section 2517 (5) authorization \u2014 and there is some federal authority that evidence that could not be used before a grand jury without section 2517 (5) authorization can be used to obtain a valid search warrant, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>539 F. 2d 181, 187 n. 24 (D.C. Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U. S. 1061 (1977); <em>United States v. Vento, </em>533 F. 2d 838, 854 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>cf. United States v. Licavoli, </em>456 F. Supp. 960, 965-66 (N.D. Ohio 1978) (arrest warrant) \u2014 those counts of the indictment procured solely on evidence of narcotic drug offenses seized under authority of the warrant need not have been dismissed. In this context we now determine only that when there is evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d obtained from a wiretap and presented to the grand jury without prior judicial authorization, any count to which it may relate must be dismissed even though there exists independent evidence before that body to support that charge. Other than this, we do not reach in this case the interesting issues just posed because here the State has conceded that the unauthorized evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d pertains to each of the counts set out in the indictments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, we will not disturb the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>circuit court\u2019s dismissal of all counts of each of the three indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">While the facts and circumstances of this case mandate our conclusion that the State should have punctually sought authorization to use the conversations relating to nonnarcotic drugs and illegal gambling other than sports bookmaking before the grand jury and its failure to do so requires, on the record before us, the dismissal of all counts of each of the three indictments, we cannot help but hope that this is the last time such action will be mandated. The requirements for obtaining judicial permission in accord with section 2517 (5) are not overly technical or strenuous, <em>see </em>p. 637 <em>supra, </em>and thus we cannot see why, almost as a matter of routine, a state\u2019s attorney would not promptly submit <em>all </em>conversations seized under a wiretap order for such further authorization, thereby avoiding the pitfall that developed here. Certainly, such a simple and straightforward preventive measure is preferable to swallowing the result that this Court now is being required to administer as a cure for the State\u2019s failure to act when it turned out that as a prerequisite to use, section 2517 (5) compelled further judicial endorsement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Prince George's County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">. Inasmuch as this State\u2019s current wiretap law is strikingly similar to Title III, in this opinion we will cross-reference the federal sections cited to those of our current Code; however, in doing so we intimate no conclusion as to whether we would construe those provisions as being identical to their federal counterparts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\">.

In the preamble of his October 1976 order, Judge Bowie recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">The aforegoing Petition of Arthur A.

[(Emphasis supplied.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">In the closing paragraphs of the order, Judge Bowie directed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-13\">Also these wire communications will be between the aforementioned persons and their co-conspirators in the alleged scheme to distribute <em>controlled dangerous substances </em>and narcotic drugs and the wire communications to be intercepted will concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-14\">(a) the identity, telephone numbers, places of residence, places of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>purchases, places of delivery, manner of delivery and purchase of <em>controlled dangerous substances </em>by these co-conspirators to and from the aforementioned persons. [(Emphasis supplied.)]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">. Section 2516 (2) provides that interceptions may be initiated by State officers only to gain evidence of \u201cIhe commission of the offense of murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in narcotic drugs, marihuana or other dangerous drugs, or other crimes dangerous to life, limb, or property, and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, designated in any applicable State statute authorizing such interception, or any conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing offenses.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (2) (1976). Though that section\u2019s provision allowing the placing of taps for crimes \u201cdangerous to life, limb, or property\u201d is quite broad, the Maryland General Assembly, as indicated by the current counterpart to section 2516 (2), has apparently decided not to use that clause to its fullest extent for the legislature has allowed the inception of wiretaps only to gain evidence of \u201cthe offense of murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in controlled dangerous substances, or any conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing offenses.\u201d Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-406 of the Courts Article. It should be added that this limitation on the number of criminal acts for which wiretaps can be initiated does not limit the number of offenses for which there can be prosecutions based on wiretap evidence so long as that evidence is gained in the course of an otherwise proper wiretap and its disclosure and use are authorized in accord with section 2517 (5). <em>See </em>United States v. Pacheco, 489 F. 2d 554, 564 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U. S. 909 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. Although the State cites several other federal cases that it asserts compel a different result here, we find the portions of those authorities it relies on to be either inapposite, United States v. Grant, 462 F. 2d 28, 33 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U. S. 914 (1972), distinguishable as involving the interpretation of a statutory provision other than section 2517 (5), United States v. Moore, 513 F. 2d 485, 500-02 (D.C. Cir. 1975), or dicta, United States v. Masciarelli, 558 F. 2d 1064, 1067 (2d Cir. 1977); United States v.

In agreeing with Judge Bowie\u2019s conclusion that the State\u2019s Petition for Disclosure was not filed in a timely manner, we note that the State has not contended that the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the conversations dealing with marihuana and PCP as part of that court\u2019s determination to grant the search warrant used in this case, which came immediately after the wiretap here was ended, could serve as a section 2517 (5) authorization, <em>cf. </em>United States v. Tortorello, 480 F. 2d 764, 781-83 (2d Cir.) (renewal of wiretap order after reviewing conversations seized, including those relating to \u201cother crimes,\u201d was authorization for use in accord with section 2517 (5)), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U. S. 866 (1973), and therefore we express no opinion about whether the judicial approval of a search warrant in reliance on an affidavit containing \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence could act in some circumstances as such an authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. In urging that the grand jury could use the unauthorized wiretap communications in question here, the State argues that a grand jury proceeding is not a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of section 2517 of Title III. In support of this contention, the <em>government </em>points out that prior to 1970 section 2517 (3) provided for the exclusion of any wiretap evidence of another crime not authorized for use as testimony under section 2517 (5) \u201cin any criminal proceeding ... of any State ... or in any ... State grand jury proceeding,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (3) (Supp. IV 1967-69), and that by amending this provision in 1970 to exclude the use of such evidence only before \u201cany proceeding\u201d of a State, Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-452, tit. IX, \u00a7 902 (b), 84 Stat. 922 (currently codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (3) (1976)), Congress, in not making specific mention of grand juries as before, sought to allow them to use such evidence. The answer to the State\u2019s contention is found in the report of the committee of the United States House of Representatives that considered the 1970 amendment. That report indicates that the words \u201cany proceeding\u201d only were substituted to include civil cases within the scope of tbe existing statutory exclusion. H.R. Rep.
