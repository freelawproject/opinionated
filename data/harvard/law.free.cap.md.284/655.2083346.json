Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 33 (c)-(d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applies to a pension benefit received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>an employee from a contributory pension plan. Because we conclude that a pension received under such a plan is a \u201cbenefit provided by the employer\u201d and because we agree with the ruling of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission \u2014 a final determination to that effect being a statutorily mandated condition precedent to a denial of additional payments \u2014 that the pension benefits provided to the employee here are \u201cequal to or better than any benefit provided [by workmen\u2019s compensation],\u201d we affirm the Circuit Court for Baltimore County\u2019s finding that the commission correctly applied section 33 (c)\u2019s offset provision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The petitioner, Lieutenant George A. Frank, was employed by Baltimore County as a police officer when, on July 27, 1975, he suffered an injury in the line of duty. During the next six months, while receiving full salary, petitioner began to lose time from work because of his injury. Subsequently, on February 6 of the following year Lt. Frank retired with a work related disability attributable to the July injury and, pursuant to Baltimore County Code (1968 <em>&amp; </em>1976 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 20-78 to 79, immediately began to receive pension benefits from his employer at a rate of one-half of his regular pay. This benefit initially amounted to $841.42 per month but, in accord with the county code, has been adjusted periodically to reflect increases in the salary for active officers of the same rank that Lt. Frank had obtained at the time of his retirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 20-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">As a result of his injury, at the time of his retirement Lt. Frank filed a claim with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission requesting payment for a permanent partial disability. On January 7, 1977, the commission determined that the officer had sustained a twenty percent industrial loss of the use of his body, with fifteen percent of the disability being reasonably attributable to the accidental injury of July 27, 1975, and five percent being due to a preexisting condition. The commission accordingly awarded compensation to the petitioner in the amount of $2,625 to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>paid at the rate of $54.83 per week beginning from the date of Lt. Frank\u2019s retirement. The commission further found, however, that this obligation had been fully discharged under section 33 of Article 101 of the Maryland Code because the pension benefits that were provided by Baltimore County were \u201cequal to or better than any benefit\u201d that could have been provided to Lt. Frank under the workmen\u2019s compensation statute. Petitioner appealed this commission decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (a), and, based on an agreed statement of facts in a de novo trial, that court (Cicone, J.), interpreting the applicable statutes in the same manner as did the commission, granted a directed verdict in favor of the county, thus affirming the administrative body\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In reviewing this ruling we, as was the circuit court, are to be guided by the general statutory command that \u201cthe decisions] of the Commission [are] entitled to prima facie correctness.\u201d <em>Md. Bureau of Mines v. Powers, </em>258 Md. 379, 382, 265 A. 2d 860, 862 (1970) (applying Md. Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (c)). A court, therefore, may reverse a commission ruling only upon a finding that its action was based upon an erroneous construction of the law or facts, <em>id. </em>at 383 [862]; Md. Code (1957,1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (c), the former being the sole issue presented for judicial determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. In scrutinizing the commission\u2019s application of this statute, we are mindful thatj our ultimate goal is to discern and effectuate the actual purpose of the legislature in enacting it. <em>See, e.g., Schweitzer v. Brewer, </em>280 Md. 430, 438, 374 A. 2d 347, 352 (1977); <em>Mazor v. State, Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360, 369 A. 2d 82, 86 (1977). To reach that objective, we rely primarily upon the language chosen by the General Assembly to express its intention, <em>see, e.g., State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A. 2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U. S. 942 (1976), although if ambiguity or uncertainty exists, the history surrounding the statute\u2019s adoption can be used as an aid in its construction. <em>See, e.g, Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 495, 331 A. 2d 55, 62 (1975). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>in construing statutes, results that are unreasonable or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided whenever possible. <em>See, e.g., Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 511-12, 298 A. 2d 427, 433, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U. S. 915 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Upon reading section 88 the scheme that unmistakably emerges is that the General Assembly wished to provide only a single recovery for a single injury for government employees covered by both a pension plan and workmen\u2019s compensation. Consequently, this section not only provides that when disability pension benefits exceed workmen\u2019s compensation the latter shall be completely eliminated, but also directs that when pension benefits happen to be less than workmen\u2019s compensation, the employer is required to furnish additional benefits which, when added to it, will equal the compensation award. <em>See Feissner v. Prince George's Co., </em>282 Md. 413, 420-21, 384 A. 2d 742, 747 (1978). This construction, besides being supported by the legislative history of section 33, <em>see Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md. App. 348, 352-53, 345 A. 2d 134, 137 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 748 (1976), is also consistent with the generally recognized policy underlying all wage-loss legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">Wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker a portion ... of wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unemployment, and old age. The crucial operative fact is that of wage loss____Now if a workman undergoes a period of wage loss due to all three conditions, it does not follow that he should receive three sets of benefits simultaneously and thereby recover more than his actual wage. He is experiencing only one wage loss and, in any logical system, should receive only one wage-loss benefit. [4 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 97.10, at 18-9 (1979) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-10\"><em>Accord, Mazor v. State, Dep\u2019t of Correction, supra, </em>279 Md. at 363, 369 A. 2d at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">That Baltimore County was a statutorily defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>employer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that had established a pension plan providing benefits to Lt. Frank upon his retirement that were not only equal to but better than the benefits he would have received from the workmen\u2019s compensation award is not in dispute here. Petitioner nevertheless argues that properly construed, section 33 provides that a benefit collected from a pension plan maintained by both employer and employee contributions is not a \u201cbenefit provided by the employer\u201d to be setoff against a workmen\u2019s compensation award until after the employee\u2019s contributions are first returned to him. If such an interpretation is utilized, Lt. Frank contends, during the forty-eight weeks in which he would have received workmen\u2019s compensation, he was not furnished pension benefits provided by his employer but was only supplied a return of his own contributions to the pension plan and, therefore, could not be said to be receiving payments from his employer which were \u201cequal to or better than\u201d the workmen\u2019s compensation award established for this same time period. In sum, petitioner claims he is entitled to both his full pension and his workmen\u2019s compensation award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">While we agree with petitioner that his pension is not a benefit <em>entirely </em>provided by his employer since, as an employee, he also contributed to the plan, such a finding does not dictate a conclusion that the board improperly applied the offset provision of section 33 in this case. In the first place, the statute does not mandate that the pension benefit be one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201centirely\u201d supplied by the employer before the commission is required to make the comparison called for in section 33 (d), and, in the second place, the addition of such a requirement would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intention to minimize the burden on the public treasury that would result from providing duplicate benefits to public employees. When, as in this case, \u201cthe statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, the courts are not at liberty to insert or delete words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 617, 224 A. 2d 677, 682 (1966) (citing cases). We therefore hold that any employee benefit provided by a public employer, \u201cwhether as part of a [statutorily adopted] pension system or otherwise,\u201d is sufficient to bring section 33 into play, and that under the juxtaposition provided in that section there exists no reason why the employer should not be discharged from his compensation obligation whenever the total amount of any employee benefit, whether furnished entirely or partially by employer funds, is equal to or better than the workmen\u2019s compensation award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A second flaw in the petitioner\u2019s argument is the assumption that the benefits of the two plans are only to be compared for the period in which the two will be simultaneously due. This argument, however, would also require an addition to the statutory language because there is no provision in the act that places a time limitation upon the contrast that is to be made. The statute simply provides for a comparison of the two benefits and, after making such a comparison in this case, we agree with the commission that there is a complete offset. Moreover, even if the petitioner is correct in assuming that the benefits of the pension should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>be compared with the benefits of workmen\u2019s compensation for the period in which both are potentially available, the pension benefits provided \u2014 $841 per month \u2014 are still far in excess of the benefits provided by workmen\u2019s compensation, unless we adopt the assumption that the first $6,718 Lt. Frank received from the pension plan was a return of his contributions to the plan. The petitioner\u2019s only basis for urging that the first monies he receives are a return of his contribution to the pension plan is section 72 (d) of the federal Internal Revenue Code. This section states that if payments are received during the first three years of an annuity, purchased with both employer and employee funds, and those payments exceed the total amount of employee contributions, then no payments received are taxable until the employee has received an amount equal to his total contributions. We reject that approach as not being applicable here because, as was made plain by Congress, section 72 (d) was added solely for administrative reasons and not because that legislative body believed employee contributions were actually returned first. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1954), <em>reprinted in </em>[1954] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4621, 4640-41; H.R. Rep.No.1337 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1954), <em>reprinted in </em>[1954] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4017, 4034-35.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In our view, petitioner\u2019s assumption flies in the face of common sense and we decline to adopt it without evidence from the General Assembly that it desired such a result.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A more sensible description of the pension is that each monthly payment represents a prorated return of the employee\u2019s contributions augmented by employer generated funds. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>City of Los Angeles v. Industrial Accident Com\u2019n, </em>63 Cal. 2d 242, 404 P. 2d 801, 46 Cal. Rptr. 97 (1965), the California Supreme Court was faced with a similar argument, there made by a city, that employer contributions should be deemed to be received first by the employee so that any workmen\u2019s compensation award would be completely nullified under the California offset scheme. That court\u2019s answer is equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">The city, however, presents no reasoned approach as to why we should adopt this allocation. Both employee deductions and tax monies constitute sources for the pension fund. When a disability pension is paid, it in fact consists of money from both sources. Artificially to allocate all the employee deductions to the \u201cadditional\u201d amount and riot to the portion which discharges workmen\u2019s compensation liability is merely to choose the desired result. It does not solve the issue. [404 P. 2d at 806, 46 Cal. Rptr. at 102 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\"><em>Cf </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 72 (b) (annuitant\u2019s contributions are spread evenly over the annuitant\u2019s lifetime for purposes of calculating return on investment); 4 J. Rabkin &amp; M. Johnson, <em>Federal Income, Gift and Estate Taxation </em>\u00a7 63.01, at 6303 (1979) (every annuity payment is both a return of capital and a return on an investment).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Because we determine that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission correctly construed and applied the offset provision of section 33 in accordance with the intention of the legislature, we affirm the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, which had affirmed that commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by petitioner.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-12\">.

Section 21 (a) (2) defines \u201cemployer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">The State, any agency thereof, and each county, city, town, township, incorporated village, school district, sewer district, drainage district, public or quasi-public corporation, or any other political subdivision of the State that has one or more employees subject to this act. <em>[Id. </em>\u00a7 21 (a) (2).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. Besides the logical flaw in petitioner\u2019s argument, which we will develop shortly, there is also a mathematical flaw. Lt. Frank paid $6,713.66 into the pension plan during 25 years of service. On February 6, 1976, he began receiving a pension of $841.42 per month, which was raised to $850 per month on July 1, 1976. Based on these figures, petitioner would have received a return of his total pension contribution within 8 months, but his workmen\u2019s compensation payments would have continued for 48 weeks, or 11 months. Thus, even under petitioner\u2019s assumption he would be eligible for only 8 months of double benefits rather than the 11 he claimed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\">. The petitioner has brought to our attention decisions by the courts of some of our sister states in which they held that workmen\u2019s compensation benefits could not be offset by pension benefits generated by employee contributions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Myers v. State, 162 Colo. 435, 428 P. 2d 83 (1967); Dalton v. City of Yonkers, 262 App. Div. 321, 29 N.Y.S.2d 42, <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>287 N.Y. 592, 38 N.E.2d 387 (1941). We have examined these decisions and find that they involve the interpretation of statutes that are dissimilar to the one adopted by our State, thereby making those cases of little value in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">. \u201cSo employees will not have to make computations where small amounts of exclusions are involved, an individual receiving a pension financed in part by contributions from his employer ...
