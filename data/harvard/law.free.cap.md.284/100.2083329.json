Fisher, Fisher Trucking Corporation, and Russell Allen Taylor instituted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>declaratory judgment action against respondents Maxwell C. Tyler, Harvester Corporation, and Northland Insurance Company, seeking an adjudication of the rights and obligations of the parties under an automobile liability policy issued to Fisher Trucking by Northland. At the close of petitioners\u2019 case, which was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County, Judge Charles E. Edmonson, after directing a verdict for respondents, entered a declaratory judgment in their favor and that decision was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Fisher v. Tyler, </em>38 Md. App. 616, 382 A. 2d 338 (1978). We granted certiorari to review the propriety of these rulings. Since we are in agreement with the result reached by each of these courts, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The events that precipitated this suit occurred on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth of January 1973. Capsulized, they show that on the afternoon of the twenty-fifth Richard A. Fisher, president and principal stockholder of Fisher Trucking Corporation, received a telephone call at his office in Pocomoke City, Maryland, from the dispatcher at the bark plant division of Perdue, Inc., which is located near Salisbury, Maryland. The dispatcher inquired of Fisher whether he had a tractor \u201cavailable to pull [Perdue\u2019s] trailer [loaded with bark] to Webster, New York,\u201d from the Salisbury plant. Fisher, for a stated fee, agreed to provide the requested. service and accordingly sent Russell Allen Taylor, a Fisher employee, to the Salisbury plant with a tractor. Upon arrival Taylor hitched his tractor to the Perdue trailer, which had already been loaded with bark, and was proceeding to Webster, New York, when, in the early morning hours of January 26th, he was involved in a multi-car accident on the Capital Beltway that resulted in one fatality and several serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">At the time of the accident, Northland Insurance Company carried a liability insurance policy on the Fisher Trucking Corporation vehicles. Under the general terms of the policy, Fisher Trucking was insured against both bodily injury and property damage liability resulting from accidents such as occurred here. Northland, however, disclaimed responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>under the policy for the Beltway accident on the basis of the following provision found in the insurance contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aah\">This policy does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(e) under coverages A and B [(bodily injury and property damage liability)], while the automobile is used for the towing of any trailer, vehicle or machine unless such trailer, vehicle or machine is covered by like insurance in the [Northland] company____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Since the Fisher tractor was towing a Perdue trailer that was not insured by the company at the time of the accident, petitioners concede that the Northland policy, as it was actually written, did not provide them protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">At the trial in the circuit court, petitioners\u2019 cause of action was predicated solely on the narrow and limited theory that Maxwell C. Tyler as insurance agent, Hardester Corporation as insurance broker, and Northland Insurance Company as the underwriter, were all negligent or, in the alternative, breached their contractual obligation to petitioners by failing to attach a \u201chired automobile endorsement\u201d to the policy of insurance issued to Fisher Trucking by Northland through the insurance broker and its agent. This endorsement, had it been attached to the Fisher Trucking insurance policy, as it often is to other similar policies, would have provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">HIRED AUTOMOBILES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">1. Application of Insurance. The insurance applies to the maintenance or use ... of any hired automobile____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">6. Definitions. \u201cHired automobile\u201d means a land motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer used under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>contract in behalf of, or loaned to, the named insured....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Petitioners\u2019 claim is that their policy with Northland, had it included this hired automobile endorsement, would have provided them insurance coverage for the Capital Beltway accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The record reflects that at the close of petitioners\u2019 case, the trial court granted a motion made by respondents that a declaratory judgment be entered in their favor on the ground that, as a matter of law, the Northland policy, even with the hired automobile endorsement attached, would not have provided coverage to petitioners for the accident. It being axiomatic that such a ruling is proper only if \u201cit is manifest to the court that, on the plaintiff\u2019s own showing and the uncontradicted evidence in the case, there is no rational ground on which a verdict for the plaintiff can be based ...,\u201d <em>Barnes v. Housing Authority, </em>231 Md. 147, 152, 189 A. 2d 100, 102 (1963), it becomes our task to determine whether on this evidence there is any reasonable basis for concluding that the Perdue trailer was a \u201chired automobile\u201d within the meaning of the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In determining that the hired automobile endorsement, even if attached, would not have provided coverage to the petitioners, the trial court relied primarily on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; F. Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; I. Co., </em>310 F. 2d 618 (4th Cir. 1962), a case in which the hauling arrangement between the owners of the tractor and the trailer was quite similar to that present here. In <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen, </em>Tommie Drake, the owner of a tractor-trailer unit, agreed for a flat sum per mile to furnish to the Carolina Tank Corporation only his tractor and a driver to haul a Carolina trailer containing a cargo of gasoline tanks. The Drake tractor-Carolina trailer unit was involved in an accident and suit was instituted to determine the respective liabilities of the individual insurers of the tractor and the Carolina trailer. The Pennsylvania Threshermen policy, although otherwise insuring the tractor, excluded coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>when that vehicle was pulling a trailer \u201c \u2018owned or hired by the insured and not covered by like insurance in the company.\u2019 \u201d 310 F. 2d at 620. In seeking to avoid liability, Pennsylvania Threshermen, which stood in the same insuring posture as Northland does in the present case, argued that the trailer at the time of the accident was \u201chired\u201d by Drake and, therefore, the exclusion was applicable. In holding that Pennsylvania Threshermen was not relieved of its indemnity responsibility resulting from the accident because Drake did not \u201chire\u201d the trailer, Judge Soper, speaking for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">The mutual benefits flowing to the parties from this arrangement, it is said, caused the trailer to be a hired vehicle in Drake\u2019s hands. We find no substance in this argument. Drake paid no rental or other compensation for the use of the trailer.... There was no hiring on Drake\u2019s part.... The contract merely provided that Drake, for an agreed price, would furnish his tractor and a driver to haul Carolina\u2019s loaded trailer ..., and return the trailer to its owner. <em>[Id. </em>at 620-21 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Despite the factual similarities to which we just alluded, petitioners nonetheless contend, and we agree, that <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen </em>is not dispositive of this case for there are important lexical differences between the policy that was before the Fourth Circuit and that involved here. The specific distinguishing feature supporting this conclusion is the fact that the term \u201chired\u201d was not further defined in the contract of insurance involved in <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen </em>while the term \u201chired automobile\u201d is specifically defined in the Northland policy. The term \u201chired,\u201d not being otherwise defined within the policy in <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen, </em>conveyed the normal meaning of that word. <em>E.g., Kasten Constr. v. Rod </em>Enterprises, 268 Md. 318, 329, 301 A. 2d 12, 18 (1973) (citing cases). In that context, a \u201chired\u201d automobile is one whose temporary use has been engaged for a fixed sum. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1072 (unabr. ed. 1976); 12 G. Couch, <em>Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u00a7 45:263, at 289 (2d ed. 1964). On the other hand, the Northland policy spells out a more expansive interpretation of that term for it includes within its definition the phrase \u201cused under contract in behalf of, or loaned to,\u201d thereby giving the word \u201chired\u201d a broader and somewhat different meaning. Further, we observe that if there had been no intention to alter the ordinary import of the term, there would have been no reason to specifically define it. <em>See Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>122 F. Supp. 197, 202 (D. Minn. 1954). Therefore, we are required to examine the facts of this case in light of this broader definition to decide whether the hired car endorsement, if attached to Fisher Trucking\u2019s policy, would have provided petitioners with insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Our consideration of this issue begins with that portion of the endorsement\u2019s \u201chired automobile\u201d definition that provides coverage for vehicles \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d the insured. The import of this language has been considered by this Court on only one other occasion, <em>Consol. Ins. Co. v. Bankers Ins. Co., </em>244 Md. 392, 398, 223 A. 2d 594, 597-98 (1966), but in a situation that renders that decision not controlling here; however, the application of this policy provision in a factual posture similar to that presented here has been before the courts of our sister states. The decisions of these jurisdictions have special significance in this context because heretofore this Court has recognized that \u201clike a state which adopts, by copying, a foreign statute,... parties who adopt an insurance policy, which apparently has had nationwide use and has been judicially construed in five or six states, adopt with it the uniform judicial construction that it has received in other states.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Amer. Motorist Ins. Co., </em>195 Md. 180, 188, 73 A. 2d 1, 4 (1949) (citations omitted). In other words, while the contract term on its face may be ambiguous, which under other circumstances would ordinarily generate a jury question, <em>e.g., Peoples Life Ins. Co. v. Jerrell, </em>271 Md. 536, 542, 318 A. 2d 519, 523 (1974) (citing cases), the court in this situation may treat the term as unambiguous and, absent any factual dispute, adopt, as a matter of law, that construction placed on the language by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the courts of other states. <em>See Winterwerp v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>277 Md. 714, 717, 357 A. 2d 350, 352-53 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The several courts that have been faced with the task of construing the phrase \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d have held that the term \u201ccontract,\u201d in this context refers only to agreements to hire another\u2019s vehicle based on a monetary payment or some other consideration, as opposed to a gratuitous benefit, flowing to the owner of the hired vehicle. <em>See Miller v. National Fanners Union Property &amp; Gas. Co., </em>470 F. 2d 700, 705 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Farmers Mutual Ins. Co. v. United Pacific Ins. Co., </em>206 Or. 298, 292 P. 2d 492, 495 (1956); 12 G. Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45:265, at 290; <em>cf. Consol. Ins. Co. v. Bankers Ins. Co., supra, </em>244 Md. at 398, 223 A. 2d at 597-98. On the other hand, \u201cin behalf of\u201d refers to the individual who receives the direct benefit of the vehicle\u2019s use in that he requires the vehicle to perform his primary contractual obligation. Thus, to demonstrate that a vehicle was used \u201cin behalf of\u201d the insured, it must be shown that by its use he was the recipient of a benefit different from that he would receive as a party to the primary contract. This is more clearly illustrated when there is an independent contractor involved; if the vehicle is being used by an independent contractor engaged by the insured, courts have held that it is not a \u201chired automobile\u201d because the vehicle is being used \u201cin behalf of\u201d the independent contractor and not the insured, even though it was used in furtherance of the primary contract between the insured and the contractor. <em>See American Casualty Co. of Reading v. Denmark Foods, </em>224 F. 2d 461, 463 (4th Cir. 1955); <em>Johnson v. Royal Indemnity Co., </em>206 F. 2d 561, 562-64 (5th Cir. 1953); <em>Kelly v. Phoenix Assurance Company of New York, </em>225 F. Supp. 562, 565 (D. Md. 1964). <em>But see Fratis v. Fireman\u2019s Fund American Insurance Companies, </em>56 Cal. App. 3d 339, 128 Cal. Rptr. 391, 393-95 (1976). In light of these definitions of \u201ccontract\u201d and \u201cin behalf of,\u201d it would appear that a vehicle is \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d the named insured when the insured <em>hires </em>the vehicle, <em>i.e., </em>pays some form of compensation to the vehicle\u2019s owner for its use by the insured in fulfilling his obligation under the primary contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Petitioners nonetheless contend in regard to this portion of the endorsement definition that because either a mutual benefit bailment or a gratuitous bailment arises under the transaction between Fisher Trucking and Perdue, the trailer was \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d Fisher Trucking and, therefore, coverage would be provided under the policy if the hired car endorsement had been attached. While there is considerable uncertainty among the authorities as to whether a gratuitous bailment, being unsupported by consideration, is truly a contract, <em>compare </em>1 A. Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 121, at 520-23 (1963) <em>with </em>R. Brown, <em>The Law of Personal Property </em>\u00a7 10.1, at 210-11 (3d ed. 1975) <em>and </em>9 S. Williston, <em>The Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 1039, at 907-08 (3d ed. 1967), and thus even relevant in this situation, it is quite clear that a mutual benefit bailment is a contract. 9 S. Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1040, at 910. Even if the agreement between Fisher Trucking and Perdue was determined to be a mutual benefit bailment, this would still not aid petitioners for the fact that benefits flowed to both parties sufficient to constitute consideration for a contract does not necessarily make that contract into one of \u201chiring\u201d within the purview of the \u201chired automobile\u201d endorsement. The only class of mutual benefit bailment that could be said to have arisen on the facts of this case is one in which the bailor (Perdu\u00e9) employed the bailee (Fisher Trucking) to transport its trailer filled with bark. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1040, at 912.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, in order for the petitioners to show this was a contract \u201cin behalf of\u201d Fisher Trucking would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>require that they produce some evidence of the passing of some monetary consideration or other nongratuitous benefit from the bailee to the bailor for the use of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The relevant portions of the evidence adduced at trial, when viewed in a light most favorable to petitioners as it must be in considering the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action entering a declaration in respondents\u2019 favor, <em>Hensel v. Beckward, </em>273 Md. 426, 427-28, 330 A. 2d 196, 197 (1974), do not support the conclusion that any consideration or other nongratuitous benefit passed from Fisher Trucking to Perdue. The only evidence before the trial court concerning the nature of the transaction between Fisher Trucking and Perdue was provided by the testimony of the trucking company\u2019s president. On direct examination he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">Q. Mr. Fisher, I want to come down to the accident, very briefly____How did this trip, this particular trip on which the accident occurred originate? In other words, who contacted you and when and so forth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvK\">A. They called me on the 25th, about four o\u2019clock, and asked me if I had \u2014 Perdue called me \u2014 <em>if I had a tractor available to pull their trailer </em>to Webster, New York. I told them I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">Q. And the trailer that was being pulled was a Perdue owned trailer, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-12\">Q. Already loaded with bark or whatever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">On cross examination the nature of the transaction was further clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-15\">Q. They [Perdue] wanted to hire your tractor and driver, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-16\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Q. <em>They were the ones that were hiring your tractor, </em>is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">Q. How was the rate established... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">A. They called me and asked me if I would <em>pull their trailer </em>and told me the dollar figure. [(Emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">There can be no doubt that this testimony is describing a commercial transaction in which Perdue paid consideration to Fisher Trucking for the use of its tractor and driver to haul a trailer full of bark, and not vice versa. Thus, though a mutual benefit bailment contract may have arisen between the parties, the evidence does not support the inference that the Perdue trailer was \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d Fisher Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">We now turn our attention to that portion of the endorsement\u2019s hired automobile definition on which the petitioners chiefly relied \u2014 \u201c \u2018Hired automobile\u2019 means a ... trailer ... loaned to\u201d the named insured. In considering the issue of whether the Perdue trailer was \u201cloaned to\u201d Fisher Trucking so as to provide it with coverage for the accident, we initially recall the well-established rule of construction that \u201cin interpreting insurance contracts, words are to be given their customary and normal meaning.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Insur. v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 720, 261 A. 2d 747, 749 (1970). We find it impossible, based on the testimony of Mr. Fisher quoted earlier, for the Fisher Trucking-Perdue transaction to be included within any meaningful concept of the word \u201cloan.\u201d The commonly understood meaning of that word, in the context with which we are now concerned, is that relied on by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">(1) ... b: something lent for the borrower\u2019s temporary use on condition that it or its equivalent be returned. <em>[Fisher v. Tyler, </em>38 Md. App. 616, 621, 382 A. 2d 338, 342 (1978) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1326 (unabr. ed. 1971)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>See Black\u2019s La w Dictionary </em>1086 (4th ed. 1968) (\u201cloan for use\u201d is the gratuitous grant of an article to another for use).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The arrangement that Mr. Fisher described in his testimony was a commercial transaction in which Perdue paid consideration to Fisher Trucking for the use of its tractor and driver. Fisher Trucking did not borrow the trailer any more than, as we have already explained, it used the trailer \u201cunder contract in behalf of\u201d itself. A different result may well have been mandated if, instead of having contracted to transport a trailer loaded with bark to New York, Fisher Trucking only had agreed to supply the necessary equipment to take the bark but, as it developed, found it could not fulfill that contract without obtaining, gratuitously or otherwise, the use of Perdue\u2019s trailer. Then, even though Perdue as the lender would receive an indirect benefit from the transaction, it would be a \u201cloan\u201d within the endorsement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Boyington v. American Liberty Insurance Co., </em>284 Ala. 581, 226 So. 2d 640, 641-43 (1969) (truck owner hired to haul wood but truck was not equipped for such a load; owner of wood \u201cloaned\u201d trailer to truck operator to perform the job). For us to say that, under the facts of the present case, the delivery of the bark-filled trailer to a bailee so that he may perform services contracted for with respect to it, is a \u201cloan\u201d within the definition of the endorsement would attach an uncommon and unprecedented meaning to that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In urging that we reach a contrary conclusion, the petitioners principally rely on three cases they contend are convincing authority for the proposition that the trailer involved here was \u201cloaned\u201d to Fisher Trucking. <em>Miller v. National Farmers Union Property &amp; Cas. Co., </em>470 F. 2d 700, 702, 705 (8th Cir. 1972) (customary interchange of trucks by milk haulers was reciprocal borrowing agreement, showing trucks \u201cloaned to\u201d insured); <em>Michigan Mutual Liability Co. v. Hoover Bros., Inc., </em>96 Ill. App. 2d 238, 237 N.E.2d 754, 756, 758 (1968) (partnership\u2019s borrowing extra truck from corporation also owned by partners did not allow insurer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>avoid liability under endorsement defining hired automobile as one \u201cused under contract in behalf of, or loaned to, the named insured\u201d); <em>Rasmussen v. Western Casualty and Surety Co., </em>15 Utah 2d 333, 393 P. 2d 376, 378 (1964) (son\u2019s car \u201cloaned\u201d to father when son, while away on church mission, left automobile for father\u2019s use). We conclude, however, that a reading of these cases demonstrates such reliance is misplaced. None of them concerned a commercial transaction between the lender and the borrower, but rather, each involved a factual situation in which a vehicle was gratuitously loaned by one party to another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, these decisions do not provide us with a persuasive basis for holding that the Fisher-Perdue transaction, which the evidence shows was not in any way gratuitous, was a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Since, even if the hired automobile endorsement had been attached to the insurance policy, there still would exist no rational basis, under the evidence here, to support an inference that the Perdue trailer was \u201cloaned to\u201d petitioners or that the trailer was \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d them, we hold that the trial court was not in error in entering a declaratory judgment in favor of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the petitioners.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\">.

We further think it obvious that there would be a \u201cloan to\u201d Fisher if, in a situation like that hypothesized above, he obtained the trailer from a third party rather than Perdue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">. In Miller v. National Farmers Union Property &amp; Cas. Co., 470 F. 2d 700 (8th Cir. 1972), it could possibly be urged that the loan was not gratuitous, but was pursuant to a binding contractual obligation between the parties through a preexisting interchange agreement. During oral argument, the petitioners asserted that there was such an \u201cinterchange\u201d agreement between Perdue and Fisher here, and, consequently, the trailer was either \u201cloaned to\u201d Fisher, as in <em>Miller, </em>or was used pursuant to a contract between Fisher and Perdue. The record, however, refutes this contention as is demonstrated by the following testimony of Fisher Trucking\u2019s president:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Q.
