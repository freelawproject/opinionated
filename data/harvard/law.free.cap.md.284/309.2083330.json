The status in Maryland of the crime of misprision of felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\n<em>THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The evidence adduced at the trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> established that Demiko Lee Norris, three months old, died as a result of physical injuries inflicted by his mother, Melissa Vera Norris.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The abuse by the mother occurred over a period of several hours on a Sunday morning at Pope's home and in Pope\u2019s presence. Pope\u2019s involvement in the events leading to the child\u2019s abuse and death began on the preceding Friday evening when she and Melissa, with the child, were driven home by Pope\u2019s sister, Angela Lancaster, from a service held at the Christian Tabernacle Church. When they arrived at Melissa\u2019s grandparents\u2019 home, where Melissa was living, Melissa refused to enter the house, claiming that it was on fire, although in fact it was not. During the evening, Melissa had sporadically indicated mental distress. \u201cShe would at times seem caught up in a religious frenzy with a wild look about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>her, trying to pleach and declaring that she was God. She would as quickly resume her normal self without ever seeming to notice her personality transitions.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 531. Pope agreed to take Melissa and th\u00e9 child into her home for the night because she did not want to put them \u201cout on the street,\u201d and Angela would not let them stay in her home. Melissa had no money and Pope and Angela bought food and diapers for the baby. That evening Pope cleaned and dried the baby and inquired of Melissa about a bad rash he had. Melissa slept in Pope\u2019s bedroom. Pope kept the baby with her in the living room, telling Melissa: \u201c[Y]ou can go to sleep ... I\u2019ll be up, I\u2019ll just stay up, I\u2019ll watch the baby____\u201d She explained in her testimony: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why it was just, just a funny feeling that I had, you know, and ever since the baby was there I just kept it close to me for some reason.\u201d Pope fed the baby and fixed a bed for it in a dresser drawer. She stayed with the baby to care for him during the night because he was spitting up. She could not sleep while Melissa was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The next morning, awakened by the crying of the child, Pope fed him1. Throughout the day Melissa \u201cchanged back and forth.\u201d When Melissa was \u201cherself\u201d she took care of her child. When Melissa thought she was God, Pope undertook the maternal duties. Pope watched the child \u201clike it was my own,\u201d because \u201cI felt maybe [Melissa] could [hurt the child] when she confessed she was God____I felt close to the baby, maybe because, you know, I felt I haven\u2019t had a baby for so long, you know, I enjoyed taking care of the baby and watching it.\u201d At a baby shower Saturday evening at the home of Pope\u2019s mother, Melissa again reverted to being God, looking wild, speaking loudly, preaching and giving orders. Melissa and the baby returned to Pope\u2019s home. Melissa put the child in bed with her, but Pope thought it better that the child not remain there. She was afraid Melissa would roll over and \u201csmother it to death.\u201d She told Melissa: \u201cI\u2019ll just take the baby in [the living room]... I\u2019ll watch it, I\u2019ll get up and feed it... I don't mind.\u201d The next morning, Sunday, at about 4:30 o\u2019clock, Pope prepared the baby\u2019s bottle and fed him. When Melissa got up, Pope suggested that she go back to bed. Melissa behaved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>normally for awhile. Then her \u201cepisodes of \u2018changing to God\u2019 became more pronounced. She stomped and gestured as she strode back and forth, putting crosses on doors and demanding the departure of the evil which she claimed to see. She kicked and banged at the door of [Pope\u2019s] son, and fearful that by breaking in Melissa would frighten him, [Pope] unfastened the door to permit entry. Loudly exhorting Satan to leave the premises, Melissa \u2018anointed\u2019 [Pope\u2019s] son with oil, placing some of the oil in the child\u2019s mouth. She subsequently repeated the process with [Pope\u2019s] daughter. When dressed, [Pope\u2019s] children left the house expeditiously, lingering only long enough to embrace their mother.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">During a lucid period, Melissa prepared to go to church. She got a tub of water to bathe the baby. What next occurred is graphically described in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThen, from her suddenly changed voice and appearance, [Pope] knew Melissa had changed again to \u2018God.\u2019 Calling out that Satan had hidden in the body of her son, Melissa began to verbally exorcise that spirit and physically abuse the child by punching and poking him repeatedly about the stomach, chest and privates. After she undressed the child, that which ensued was hardly describable. In her religious frenzy of apparent exorcism, Melissa poked the child\u2019s vitals and beat the child about the head. She reached her fingers down its throat, wiping mucus and blood on diapers at hand, and even lifted the child by inserting her hands in its mouth, and shook him like a rag.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Continuing to talk and stomp, Melissa began to squeeze the baby. Then, holding the child by the neck with one hand, she took him into the bathroom, acting like she did not know that Pope was present. When she first started this abuse, Melissa, in her \u201cGod voice,\u201d called Pope and asked her: \u201cDidn\u2019t I give you eyes to see?\u201d Pope noticed that Melissa\u2019s finger nails were \u201creal long,\u201d and she said to Melissa: \u201c[H]ow do you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>handle a baby with such long nails,\u201d but Pope did nothing. She admitted that she knew at some point that Melissa was hurting the baby and was \u201cfearful, amazed and shocked at the \u2018unbelievable\u2019 and \u2018horrible\u2019 thing that was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Melissa\u2019s frenzy diminished. Angela came to the house to take them to church. Pope did not tell Angela what happened \u2014 \u201cI could not get it out.\u201d Angela asked her what was wrong, and Pope said: \u201c[I]t\u2019s Melissa, the baby....\u201d She locked the door at Angela\u2019s direction so Angela\u2019s children would stay in the yard with Pope\u2019s children. Angela wrapped the child in a towel, raised him over her head and prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Pope, Melissa and Angela left with the child to go to church. At Melissa\u2019s request they stopped by her grandfather\u2019s house, arriving about 2:00 p.m. Pope told him the child was dead, but he did not believe her because all three were acting so strangely. He refused to take or look at the baby. The three women with the child went to Bel Pre Health Center, picked up another member of the Christian Tabernacle congregation, telling her that \u201cGod has a job for you to do,\u201d and proceeded to the church. En route, they passed several hospitals, police stations and rescue squads. At the church, the child was given to, or taken by the Reverend Leon Hart, who handed him to Mother Dorothy King for her prayers. She discovered that the baby\u2019s body was cool and sent for ambulance assistance. Police and rescue personnel arrived and determined that the child was dead. There was expert medical testimony that the child had died sometime during the period of fifteen minutes to several hours after it was injured. The medical expert expressed no opinion as to whether the child could have been successfully treated if the injury had been reported sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The police questioned Melissa in Pope\u2019s presence. Pope did not contradict Melissa\u2019s denial of abusing the child. In fact, Pope, in response to inquiry by the police, said that the baby did not fall, and told them that she had not seen Melissa strike the baby. She explained this untruth in subsequent statements to the police: \u201c[I]t was her body in the flesh, but it wasn\u2019t her, because it was something else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Pope, Melissa and Angela attended the evening service at the church. Melissa reverted to God during the service and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Reverend Hart restrained her and attempted to convince her that she was not Jesus Christ. Melissa refused to go to her grandfather\u2019s home and returned home with Pope. The next morning Pope was again interviewed at the police station and wrote a full explanation of what had happened. She later made an oral statement which was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>THE CRIME OF CHILD ABUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>The Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The General Assembly first evidenced its concern with the mistreatment of children fifteen years ago when it added \u00a7 11A to Art. 27 of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> later codified as \u00a7 35A of that article,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> declaring an assault on a child to be a felony. The statute in its entirety provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cAny parent, adoptive parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody of a minor child under the age of fourteen years who maliciously beats, strikes, or otherwise mistreats such minor child to such degree as to require medical treatment for such child shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be sentenced to not more than fifteen years in the Penitentiary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The Legislature\u2019s increasing interest in child abuse is reflected in the amendment from time to time of the seminal statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The result is a comprehensive scheme to fulfill the legislative intent and purpose, expressed in 1973,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as \u201cthe protection of children who have been the subject of abuse by mandating the reporting of suspected abuse, by extending immunity to those who report in good faith, by requiring prompt investigations of such reports and by causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>immediate, cooperative efforts by the responsible agencies on behalf of such children.\u201d Md. Code (1957,1976 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 35A. All of these were, of course, imposed over the felonious crime of child abuse. <em>See </em>subsections (a) through (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>The Nature of Child Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">As we have seen, when the crime was first created by the General Assembly it comprised the malicious beating, striking or otherwise mistreating a child to such degree as to require medical treatment. We pointed out in <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 348 A. 2d 275 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U. S. 942 (1976), that by the terms of the enactment it did not reach acts \u201cnot constituting, in one form or another, an assault on a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423. Acts 1973, ch. 835 repealed the \u201cmaliciously beats, strikes or otherwise mistreats\u201d test of child abuse and substituted in its place a new and different measure of the offense. The 1973 \u2022 amendment added a definition subsection to \u00a7 35A. Subsection (b) 7 provided that whenever \u201cabuse\u201d was used in \u00a7 35A, it shall mean \u201cany physical injury or injuries sustained by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of malicious act or acts....\u201d Acts 1974, ch. 554 designated this meaning as item (A) of 11 7 and expanded the definition of child abuse by adding item (B) so as to include in the offense \u201cany sexual abuse of a child, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.\u201d The amendment also added 11 8 defining \u201csexual abuse\u201d to mean \u201cany act or acts involving sexual molestation or exploitation, including but not limited to incest, rape, carnal knowledge, sodomy or unnatural or perverted sexual practices on a child____\u201d Acts 1977, ch. 290, substituted \u201cor sexual offense in any degree\u201d for \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d in 11 8.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">We considered the scope of item A, subsection (b) 7 in <em>Fabritz. </em>Applying the rules of statutory construction, 276 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>at 421-423, we thought \u201cit evident that the Legislature plainly intended to broaden the area of proscribed conduct punishable in child abuse cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423-424. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201cIts use in the amended version of \u00a7 35A of the comprehensive phraseology \u2018who causes abuse to\u2019 a minor child, coupled with its broad two-pronged definition of the term \u2018abuse,\u2019 supports the view that the Legislature, by repealing the narrow measure of criminality in child abuse cases then provided in \u00a7 35A, and redefining the offense, undertook to effect a significant change of substance in the scope of the statute\u2019s prohibitions. In making it an offense for a person having custody of a minor child to \u2018cause\u2019 the child to suffer a \u2018physical injury,\u2019 the Legislature did not require that the injury result from a physical assault upon the child or from any physical force initially applied by the accused individual; it provided instead, in a more encompassing manner, that the offense was committed if physical injury to the child resulted either from a course of conduct constituting \u2018cruel or inhumane treatment\u2019 or by \u2018malicious act or acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We found that the failure of the mother to seek or obtain any medical assistance for her child, although the need therefor was obviously compelling and urgent, caused the child to sustain bodily injury additional to and beyond that inflicted upon the child by reason of the original assault by another. The act of omission by the mother \u201cconstituted a cause of the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to [the child\u2019s] death; and that in these circumstances [the mother\u2019s] treatment of [the child] was \u2018cruel or inhumane\u2019 within the meaning of the statute and as those terms are commonly understood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425-426. We therefore vacated the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which in <em>Fabritz v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 708, 332 A. 2d 324 (1975), had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>reversed the judgment of the trial court entered upon-the conviction of the mother of child abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>Responsibility for Abuse of a Child</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In <em>Fabritz </em>we went no farther than to determine that the Legislature intended that the \u201ccause\u201d of an injury may include an act of omission so as to constitute cruel or inhumane treatment, in that case the failure of the mother to seek or obtain medical assistance for her child who had been abused by another. <em>Fabritz </em>did not go to the class of persons to whom the statutory proscription applies, as the accused there was a \u201cparent,\u201d the victim\u2019s mother, expressly designated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>We have seen that the statute as originally enacted concerned \u201c[a]ny parent, adoptive parent or other person, who has the permanent or temporary care or custody of a minor child____\u201d Acts 1963, ch. 743. This has been once amended to bring within the ambit of the statute any person who has \u201cresponsibility for the supervision of a minor child.\u201d Acts 1966, ch. 221. Thus, since 1 June 1966,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201c[a]ny parent, adoptive parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor child under the age of eighteen years [<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] who causes abuse to such minor child shall be guilty of a felony. ...\u201d \u00a7 35A(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Persons subject to the statute are designated in those terms also in subsection (b) 7 (A) defining abuse and in subsection (b) 8 defining sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 389 A. 2d 341 (1978), we discussed the class of persons to whom \u00a7 35A applies, in rejecting the contention that the statute was vague and therefore constitutionally defective for the reason that it failed to define adequately that class. Bowers urged that the statute was too indefinite to inform a person who is not a parent or adoptive parent of a child whether he comes within the ambit of the statute. He argued that no one in such position is capable of ascertaining whether the statute is aimed only at persons who have been awarded custody by judicial decree or includes also those who may simply be caring for a child in place of the parent. We were of the view that the General Assembly intended that the statute apply to persons who stand in loco parentis to a child. We said: \u201cHad the Legislature wished to narrow application of the child abuse law to those who had been awarded custody or control by court order, it could readily have done so in explicit language to that end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130. We observed that Bowers\u2019 \u201cown testimony amply established that he had assumed \u2018the care or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>custody or responsibility for the supervision\u2019 of his stepdaughter, and thus stood in loco parentis with respect to her.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Bowers\u2019 challenge centered on the \u201ctemporary care or custody\u201d provision of the statute. It does not follow from our holding that \u201cpermanent or temporary care or custody\u201d is synonymous with \u201cresponsibility for the supervision of.\u201d Such was clearly not the legislative intent, because, as we have seen, the latter provision was added by amendment three years after the former had been written into the law. There would have been no need to do so had the Legislature deemed the two provisions to have the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The child abuse statute speaks in terms of a person who \u201chas\u201d responsibility for the supervision of a minor child. It does not prescribe how such responsibility attaches or what \u201cresponsibility\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d encompass. A doubt or ambiguity exists as to the exact reach of the statute\u2019s provision with respect to \u201chas responsibility for the supervision of,\u201d justifying application of the principle that permits courts in such circumstances to ascertain and give effect to the real intention of the Legislature. <em>See Fabritz </em>at 423; <em>Clerk v. Chesapeake Beach </em>Park, 251 Md. 657, 663-664, 248 A. 2d 479 (1968); <em>Domain v. Bosley, </em>242 Md. 1, 7, 217 A. 2d 555 (1966). <em>Bowers </em>equates \u201cpermanent or temporary care or custody\u201d with \u201cin loco parentis,\u201d but \u201cresponsibility for the supervision of\u201d is not bound by certain of the strictures required for one to stand in place of or instead of the parent. A person in loco parentis is \u201ccharged, factitiously, with a parent\u2019s rights, duties, and responsibilities.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951). \u201cA person <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child is one who means to put himself in the situation of the lawful father [or mother] of the child with reference to the father\u2019s [or mother\u2019s] office and duty of making provision for the child. Or, as defined by Sir Wm. Grant, Master of the Rolls, a person <em>in loco parentis </em>is one, \u2018assuming the parental character and discharging parental duties.\u2019 <em>Weatherby v. </em>Dixon, 19 Ves. 412. . . . There must be some: indication, in some form, of an intention to establish it. It is a question of intention.\u201d <em>Von der Horst v. Von der Horst, </em>88 Md. 127, 130-131, 41 A. 124 (1898).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018in loco parentis,\u2019 according to its generally accepted common law meaning, refers to a person who has put himself in the situation of a lawful parent by assuming the obligations incident to the parental relation without going through the formalities necessary to legal adoption. It embodies the two ideas of assuming the parental status and discharging the parental duties. <em>Niewiadomski v. United States, </em>159 P. 2d 683, 686 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, 331 U. S. 850 (1947).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201cThis relationship involves more than a duty to aid and assist, more than a feeling of kindness, affection or generosity. It arises only when one is willing to assume all the obligations and to receive all the benefits associated with one standing as a natural parent to a child.\u201d <em>Fuller v. Fuller, </em>247 A. 2d 767 (D.C. 1968), <em>appeal denied, </em>418 F. 2d 1189 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">A person may have the responsibility for the supervision of a minor child in the contemplation of \u00a7 35A although not standing in loco parentis to that child. \u201cResponsibility\u201d in its common and generally accepted meaning denotes \u201caccountability,\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d emphasizes broad authority to oversee with the powers of direction and decision. <em>See </em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1969); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1968). As in the case of care or custody of a minor child under the child abuse law, a judicial decree is not necessary to obtain responsibility for the supervision of a minor child under that statute. Had the Legislature wished to narrow application of that law to those who had been charged with responsibility for the supervision of a child by court order, it could readily have done so in explicit language to that end. <em>See Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 130. Absent a court order or award by some appropriate proceeding pursuant to statutory authority, we think it to be self-evident that responsibility for supervision of a minor child may be obtained only upon the mutual consent, expressed or implied, by the one legally charged with the care of the child and by the one assuming the responsibility. In other words, a parent may not impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>responsibility for the supervision of his or her minor child on a third person unless that person accepts the responsibility, and a third person may not assume such responsibility unless the parent grants it. So it is that a baby sitter temporarily has responsibility for the supervision of a child; the parents grant the responsibility for the period they are not at home, and the sitter accepts it. And it is by mutual consent that a school teacher has responsibility for the supervision of children in connection with his academic duties. On the other hand, once responsibility for the supervision of a minor child has been placed in a third person, it may be terminated unilaterally by a parent by resuming responsibility, expressly or by conduct. The consent of the third party in such circumstances is not required; he may not prevent return of responsibility to the parent. But, of course, the third person in whom responsibility has been placed is not free to relinquish that responsibility without the knowledge of the parent. For example, a sitter may not simply walk away in the absence of the parents and leave the children to their own devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Under the present state of our law, a person has no legal obligation to care for or look after the welfare of a stranger, adult or child.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201cGenerally one has no legal duty to aid another person in peril, even when that aid can be rendered without danger or inconvenience to himself....

The legal position is that \u201cthe need of one and the opportunity of another to be of assistance are not alone sufficient to give rise to a legal duty to take positive action.\u201d R. Perkins, Criminal Law 594-595 (2d ed. 1969). Ordinarily, a person may stand by with impunity and watch another being murdered, raped, robbed, assaulted or otherwise unlawfully harmed. \u201cHe need not shout a warning to a blind man headed for a precipice or to an absentminded one walking into a gunpowder room with a lighted candle in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>hand.

Those statutes, however, impose no requirement that assistance be rendered.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In the face of this status of the law we cannot reasonably conclude that the Legislature, in bringing a person responsible for the supervision of a child within the ambit of the child abuse law, intended that such responsibility attach without the consent criteria we have set out. Were it otherwise, the consequences would go far beyond the legislative intent. For example, a person taking a lost child into his home to attempt to find its parents could be said to be responsible for that child\u2019s supervision. Or a person who allows his neighbor\u2019s children to play in his yard, keeping a watchful eye on their activities to prevent them from falling into harm, could be held responsible for the children\u2019s supervision. Or a person performing functions of a maternal nature from concern for the welfare, comfort or health of a child, or protecting it from danger because of a sense of moral obligation, may come within the reach of the act. In none of these situations would there be an intent to grant or assume the responsibility contemplated by the child abusen statute, and it would be incongruous indeed to subject such persons to possible criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\n<em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The trial court found Pope guilty of the crime of child abuse as a principal in the first degree, and alternatively, as a principal in the second degree. A principal in the first degree is the one who actually commits a crime, either by his own hand, or by an inanimate agency, or by an innocent human agent. A principal in the second degree is one who is actually or constructively present when a felony is committed, and who aids or abets in its commission. <em>See Camphor v. State, </em>233 Md. 203, 205, 196 A. 2d 75 (1963); <em>Thornton v. State, </em>232 Md. 542, 544, 194 A. 2d 617 (1963); <em>Veney v. State, </em>225 Md. 237, 238, 170 A. 2d 171 (1961); <em>Agresti v.

The rule provides that when a criminal case is tried without the intervention of a jury, the Court of Special Appeals shall review both the law and the evidence but \u201cthe judgment of the [trial] court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the [trial] court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d The appellate court\u2019s function \u201cis merely to decide whether there was sufficient evidence, or proper inferences from the evidence, from which the trier of fact could properly draw the conclusion of the [accused\u2019s] guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Brooks v. State, </em>277 Md. 155, 161-162, 353 A. 2d 217 (1976), and cases therein cited. The trial court, as the trier of facts, is not only the judge of the witness\u2019s credibility, but is also the judge of the weight to be attached to the evidence. <em>Id. </em>Th.e Court of Special Appeals determined that the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain the conviction of Pope either as a principal in the first degree or a principal in the second degree. The evidence was deficient with regard to her being a principal in the first degree in that it was not sufficient for the trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she was within the class of persons subject to the prohibitions of the child abuse statute. Thus, the teaching of <em>Fabritz </em>regarding \u201ccausing abuse\u201d was in no event applicable. <em>Pope v. State, </em>38 Md. App. at 538. It was deficient with regard to her being a principal in the second degree because, despite her presence during the commission of the felony, it was not sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that she aided and abetted the actual perpetrator. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court on the evidence was clearly erroneous and had to be set aside. <em>Id. </em>at 539-541.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">As did the Court of Special Appeals, we find evidentiary insufficiency with respect to the conviction of Pope of child abuse, both as a principal in the first degree and as a principal in the second degree, so that the judgment of the trial court on the evidence was clearly erroneous. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We explain why we find that the evidence was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\n<em>Principal in the First Degree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As we have indicated, a person may be convicted of the felony of child abuse created by \u00a7 35A as a principal in the first degree upon evidence legally sufficient to establish that the person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">(1) was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">(a) the parent of, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(b) the adoptive parent of, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">(c) in loco parentis to, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(d) responsible for the supervision of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">a minor child under the age of eighteen years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9R\">AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">(2) caused, by being in some manner accountable for, by act of commission or omission, abuse to the child in the form of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">(a) physical injury or injuries sustained by the child as the result of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">i) cruel or inhumane treatment, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3r\">ii) malicious act or acts by such person,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-17\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-18\">(b) any act or acts by such person involving sexual molestation or exploitation whether or not physical injuries were sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">Under the teaching of <em>Fabritz, </em>Pope\u2019s lack of any attempt to prevent the numerous acts of abuse committed by the mother over a relatively protracted period and her failure to seek medical assistance for the child, although the need therefor was obviously compelling and urgent, could constitute a cause for the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to the child\u2019s death. In such circumstances, Pope\u2019s omissions constituted in themselves cruel and inhumane treatment within the meaning of the statute. <em>See Fabritz, </em>276 Md. at 425-426. It follows that Pope would be guilty of child abuse <em>if her status brought her within the class of persons specified by the statute. </em>It being clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that she was neither the child\u2019s parent nor adoptive parent, and there being no evidence sufficient to support a finding that she had \u201cthe permanent or temporary care or custody\u201d of the child as that status was construed in <em>Bowers v. State, supra, </em>so as to be in loco parentis to the child, the sole question is whether she had \u201cresponsibility for the supervision of\u201d the child in the circumstances. If she had such responsibility the evidence was legally sufficient to find her guilty of child abuse as a principal in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The State would have us translate compassion and concern, acts of kindness and care, performance of maternal functions, and general help and aid with respect to the child into responsibility for the supervision of the child. The crux of its argument is that although Pope was not under any obligation to assume responsibility for the supervision of the child at the outset, \u201conce she undertook to house, feed, and care for [the mother and child], she did accept the responsibility and came within the coverage of the statute.\u201d But the mother was always present.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Pope had no right to usurp the role of the mother even to the extent of responsibility for the child\u2019s supervision. We are in full accord with the view of the Court of Special Appeals that it could not \u201cin good conscience hold that a person who has taken in a parent and child is given the responsibility for the child\u2019s supervision and protection even while the child is in the very arms of its mother.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 538. It would be most incongruous that acts of hospitality and kindness, made out of common decency and prompted by sincere concern for the well-being of a mother and her child, subjected the Good Samaritan to criminal prosecution for abusing the very child he sought to look after. And it would be especially ironic were such criminal prosecution to be predicated upon an obligation to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>affirmative action with regard to abuse of the child by its mother, when such obligation arises solely from those acts of hospitality and kindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The evidence does not show why Pope did not intervene when the mother abused the child or why she did not, at least, timely seek medical assistance, when it was obvious that the child was seriously injured. Whether her lack of action was from fear or religious fervor or some other reason is not clearly indicated. As the Court of Special Appeals correctly stated \u201c[Pope\u2019s] testimony sought to indicate that her passivity was motivated by fear but other evidence belied that inference.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 532. The court observed that when Pope\u2019s sister arrived shortly after the acts of abuse and the mother\u2019s frenzy had diminished, Pope did not tell her sister what had occurred, although she claimed that she tried to but could not do so. But Pope\u2019s conduct, during and after the acts of abuse, must be evaluated with regard for the rule that although she may have had a strong moral obligation to help the child, she was under no legal obligation to do so unless she then had responsibility for the supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse statute. She may not be punished as a felon under our system of justice for failing to fulfill a moral obligation, and the short of it is that she was under no legal obligation. In the circumstances, the mother\u2019s acquiescence in Pope\u2019s conduct was not a grant of responsibility to Pope for the supervision of the child, nor was . Pope\u2019s conduct an acceptance of such responsibility. \u201c[Pope\u2019s] concern for the child [did] not convert to legal responsibility nor parental prerogatives.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 538. We hold that the evidence was not sufficient in law to prove that Pope fell within that class of persons to whom the child abuse statute applies. Thus it is that the judgment of the trial court that she was a principal in the first degree in the commission of the crime of child abuse was clearly erroneous and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The mental or emotional state of the mother, whereby at times she held herself out as God, does not change the result. We see no basis in the statute for an interpretation that a person \u201chas\u201d responsibility for the supervision of a child, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that person believes or may have reason to believe that a parent is not capable of caring for the child. There is no right to make such a subjective judgment in order to divest parents of their rights and obligations with respect to their minor children, and therefore, no obligation to do so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>Principal in the Second Degree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Pope was actually present when the felony was committed, but, we have determined, she was not a perpetrating actor. She would be a principal in the second degree if she aided or abetted in the commission of the crime. The principal in the second degree differs from the principal in the first degree in that he does not do the deed himself or through an innocent agent but in some way participates in the commission of the felony by aiding, commanding, counseling or encouraging the actual perpetrator.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> R. Perkins, Criminal Law 658-659 (2d ed. 1969); Clark &amp; Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes \u00a7 8.02 (7th ed. 1967). Unless he contributed actual aid it is necessary that his approval should be manifested by some word or act in such a way that it operated on the mind of the perpetrator. Even the secret acquiescence or approval of the bystander is not sufficient to taint him with the guilt of the crime. \u201cCounsel, command or encouragement may be in the form of words or gestures. Such a purpose \u2018may be manifested by acts, words, signs, motions, or any conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>which unmistakably evinces a design to encourage, incite, or approve of the crime.\u2019 Promises or threats are very effective for this purpose, but much less will meet the legal requirement, as where a bystander merely emboldened the perpetrator to kill the deceased.... One may also encourage a crime by merely standing by for the purpose of giving aid to the perpetrator if necessary, provided the latter is aware of this purpose. Guilt or innocence of the abettor ... is not determined by the quantum of his advice or encouragement. If it is rendered to induce another to commit the crime and actually has this effect, no more is required.\u201d Perkins at 659. \u201cTo be guilty as a principal in the second degree, a criminal intent is necessary.\u201d Clark &amp; Marshall \u00a7 8.02. \u201cAid or encouragement to another who is actually perpetrating a felony will not make the aider or encourager guilty of the crime if it is rendered without mens rea. It is without mens rea if the giver does not know or have reason to know of the criminal intention of the other.... In general it is the abettor\u2019s state of mind rather than the state of mind of the perpetrator which determines the abettor\u2019s guilt or innocence.... \u2018[I]ntention\u2019 includes not only the purpose in mind but also such results as are known to be substantially certain to follow.\u201d Perkins at 662-663.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">When the evidence here is viewed in the light of these criteria, it is patent that it was not legally sufficient to prove that Pope was a principal in the second degree. She neither actually aided the mother in the acts of abuse nor did she counsel, command or encourage her. The Court of Special Appeals pointed out the facts relied on by the trial court \u2014 that the events took place in Pope\u2019s home, that Pope responded to the commands of the mother, namely that she looked when told to look and came when called, that she voluntarily opened the door to her son\u2019s room so Melissa could reach him, and that she failed to interfere or question the mother\u2019s activity, even when the mother appeared rational \u2014 were simply not enough to meet the test. <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 538-541.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The State concludes the argument in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cAs is obvious from the evidence presented in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>case, [Pope] witnessed a terrible event. She stood by while Melissa Norris killed her three-month old son. [Pope\u2019s] conduct during the beating ... should be held to be culpable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The evidence certainly showed that Pope \u201cwitnessed a terrible event\u201d and that she \u201cstood by\u201d while the mother killed the child. But the culpability for her conduct during the abuse of the child must be determined strictly within the law or else the basic tenets of our system of justice are prostituted. There is an understandable feeling of outrage at what occurred, intensified by the fact that the mother, who actually beat the child to death, was held to be not responsible for her criminal acts. But it is the law, not indignation, which governs. The law requires that Pope\u2019s conviction of the felony of child abuse be set aside as clearly erroneous due to evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>THE CRIME OF MISPRISION OF FELONY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">As we have indicated, a person may be convicted of a felony upon proof establishing that he committed the offense as a perpetrating actor (principal in the first degree), or that, being actually or constructively present, he did not himself commit the offense but aided and abetted in the commission of it (principal in the second degree). \u201c \u2018If he be present,\u2019 said Sir Matthew Hale, \u2018and not aiding or abetting to the felony, he is neither principal nor accessory. If A and B be fighting and C, a man of full age, comes by chance, and is a looker on only, and assists neither, he is not guilty of murder or homicide, as principal in the second degree, but is a misprision, for which he shall be fined, unless he use means to apprehend the felon.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the case before us, both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>trial court and the Court of Special Appeals believed that the misdemeanor of misprision of felony exists in Maryland today. The Court of Special Appeals expressly he\u00edd \u201cthat misprision of felony was a crime at common law given life in Maryland by Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It rejected the contention that the crime \u201chas become obsolete or abandoned by disuse\u201d as \u201cwithout merit.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 527.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">There is no Maryland legislative enactment which is declarative of the common law crime of misprision of felony or which may be deemed to have created a comparable offense. Therefore, if misprision of felony is a crime in this State, it is only because it was part of the common law of England to which the inhabitants of Maryland were constitutionally entitled and has survived to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that misprision of felony was a crime under the common law of England, and that it became the law of this State pursuant to Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights. The question is whether it is to be deemed an indictable offense in Maryland today. In determining the question, we look first to what misprision of felony is. According to Blackstone, the crime at common law consisted merely in the \u201cconcealment of a felony which a man knows, but never assented to; for if he assented this makes him either principal or accessory.\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *121. <em>See </em>Clark &amp; Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes \u00a7 8.14 (7th ed. 1967); R. Perkins, Criminal Law 512 (2d ed. 1969); L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Hochheimer, Crimes and Criminal Procedure \u00a7 39 (1st ed. 1897).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">\u201c[TJhere is reason to believe that misprision of felony as defined by Blackstone is merely one phase of the system of communal responsibility for the apprehension of criminals which received its original impetus from William I, under pressure of the need to protect the invading Normans in hostile country, and which endured up to the Seventeenth Century in England. In order to secure vigilant prosecution of criminal conduct, the vill or hundred in which such conduct occurred was subject to fine, as was the tithing to which the criminal belonged, and every person who knew of the felony and failed to make report thereof was subject to punishment for misprision of felony. Compulsory membership in the tithing group, the obligation to pursue criminals when the hue and cry was raised, broad powers of private arrest, and the periodic visitations of the General Eyre for the purpose of penalizing laxity in regard to crime, are all suggestive of the administrative background against which misprision of felony developed. With the appearance of specialized and paid law enforcement officers, such as constables and justices of the peace in the Seventeenth Century, there was a movement away from strict communal responsibility, and a growing tendency to rely on professional police.\u201d 8 U. Chi. L. Rev. 338, 340-341 (1941) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Glazebrook, <em>Misprision of Felony </em>\u2014 <em>Shadow or Phantom?, </em>8 Am. J. of Legal History 189 and 283 (1964) cites eminent authority that in England the offense fell \u201cinto desuetude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. According to Glazebrook, there was no \u201creported decision during the four hundred years since the offence first crept into <em>a </em>book,\u201d and no book before J. Chitty, A Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law (2d ed., London 1826) contained <em>\u201ca </em>precedent of an indictment for misprision of felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In any event, if the crime had died, it was resurrected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>House of Lords in <em>H. L. Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecution, </em>[1961] 3 All E. R. 33. Lord Denning stated that \u201cit is plain that there is and always has been an offence of misprision of felony and that it is not obsolete.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 40. <em>Sykes </em>acknowledged only two necessary elements, knowledge and concealment. \u201c[M]isprision requires nothing active. The failure or refusal to disclose the felony is enough.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. This followed the Blackstone definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The \u201crevival\u201d in England of the crime of misprision of felony was not generally welcomed. \u201cResistance to the crime culminated in the Seventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee which recommended the abolition of the crime of misprision by eliminating all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors. Misprision was replaced in the report by a new crime of withholding information with regard to certain offenses for a consideration other than restitution. [An agreement not to prosecute a felon in consideration of the return or compensation for goods stolen constitutes the common law offense of compounding a felony.] The Criminal Law Act of 1967 [c. 58 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 5] adopted these two recommendations and has been interpreted as eliminating the crime of misprision of felony in England.\u201d Comment, <em>Misprision of Felony: A Reappraisal, </em>23 Emory L.

The status of the crime in the United States was summed up in Glazebrook, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>How Long, Then, Is The Arm Of The Law To Be?, </em>25 Mod.

In several states an attempt has been made to establish an offence intermediate between a simple concealment and that of the accessory after: e.g., <em>State v. Wilson </em>80 Vt. 249; 67 Atl. 533 (1907); <em>State v. Biddle 2 </em>Harr (Del.) 401; 124 Atl. 804 (1923);[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] <em>Carpenter v. State </em>62 Ark. 286; 36 S.

Graham </em>100 La. 669 (1938): \u2018... in the modern acceptation of the term, misprision of felony is almost if not exactly the same as that of an accessory after the fact\u2019 (p. 680). The utility of such an offence has not, however, been demonstrated: \u2018... perhaps not a single case can be cited in which punishment for such connection with a felony has been inflicted in the U.S.\u2019 \u2014 2 McClain <em>Criminal Law, </em>s. 938, cited at (1953) 6 S.Car. L.Q. 91. In Michigan, where the constitution incorporates the common law of crimes, the Supreme Court held that this does not extend to misprision of felony since it is \u2018wholly unsuited to American criminal law and procedure as used in this State\u2019; <em>State v. Lefkovitz </em>294 Mich. 263, 293 N.W. 642 (1940); <em>cf. U.S. v. Worcester </em>190 F.Supp. 565-566 (1960). And in interpreting the Federal statute (1 Stat. 113, s. 6) [18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (1976)] which provides that \u2018whoever having knowledge of the actual commission, of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the U.S. shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than three years or both,\u2019 it has been held that there must be some affirmative act of concealment, for instance the suppression of evidence, the harbouring of the criminal or the intimidation of witnesses, as well as the failure to disclose, for otherwise \u2018the words <em>conceals and </em>would be effectively excised from the statute.\u2019 This interpretation was necessary to rescue the statute from an \u2018intolerable oppressiveness,\u2019 for while federal statutes were few when it was enacted in 1790, the great increase in their number would make it un\u00e9nforceable today if any other were adopted: <em>Bratton v. U.S. </em>73 F. (2d) 795 [10th cir.] (1934); followed <em>Neal v. U.S. </em>102 F. (2d) 643 (1939). <em>[See also United States v. Farrer, </em>38 F. 2d 515 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d, 281 U. S. 624 (1930).] This policy appears to have been successful. In 1956 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals noticed that \u2018the annotations indicate no conviction for misprision [under the Federal statute] affirmed\u2019: <em>Miller v. U.S., </em>230 F. (2d) 486., <em>Cf. Bratton v. U.S.: </em>\u2018s. 146 was enacted April 30, 1790 ... and as far as the researches of court and counsel disclose, has been before the courts but twice in the 144 years of its life\u2019 (p. 797).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Perkins in the second edition (1969) of his Criminal Law states that \u201cthere seems to be no such offense as misprision of felony in most of the states.\u201d At 516. No such offense is included in the Model Penal Code (U.L.A.).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Four years ago, Florida followed Michigan\u2019s view announced in <em>Lefkovitz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>supra, </em>that misprision of felony was wholly unsuited to American criminal law. <em>Holland v. State, </em>302 So. 2d 806 (Fla. App. 1974). <em>Cf. Mangeris v. Gordon, </em>Nev., 580 P. 2d 481, 483-484 (1978). <em>Compare State v. Flynn, </em>100 R. I. 520, 217 A. 2d 432 (1966), stating that the common law crime of misprision of felony was an indictable offense under the constitution and laws of Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">A few states have enacted legislation creating a crim\u00a9 of misprision of felony substantially similar to the common law offense as defined in <em>Sykes. See </em>N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2A:97-2 (N.J. 1969); Ohio Rev. Code 8 2921.22 (Spec. Supp. 1973); Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9.69.100 (1976). Two states had such statutes, <em>see </em>Me. Rev. Stat. title 17, \u00a7 902 (1964) and La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 856 (1870), which were later repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Maryland has been in line with the practically universal view of the other states, We find no case prior to the case <em>sub judlce </em>in which a conviction of misprision of felony has reached an appellate court of this State and, insofar as can be ascertained from appellate dockets, there is only one other, <em>State v. Shaw, </em>282 Md. 231, 383 A. 2d 1104 (1978), <em>see </em>note 19, <em>supra, </em>in which the crime was charged. It is true, as observed by the trial court in the case at hand, that \u201c[a] dearth of appellate cases is not proof that the crime is not charged at trial level,\u201d but in view of the numerous appeals in criminal causes spawned by present day procedures and rights afforded an accused, it is remarkable indeed that, if convictions upon charge of the crime have occurred, the present case was the first in which an appeal was filed. We think that it is a fair inference that the crime has been seldom charged, and, if charged, has resulted in very few, if any convictions. Furthermore, we observe that misprision of felony was not proposed as an offense by Maryland\u2019s Commission on Criminal Law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">As it seems that misprision of felony has been virtually unused in Maryland since the Revolution gave birth to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>United States, our inquiry turns to the effect of non-use of a common law crime. Early on, in <em>State v. Buchanan, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 317, (1821), Buchanan, J. for the Court announced that no part of the common law of England to which the inhabitants of Maryland were constitutionally entitled should be excluded merely because it had not been introduced and used in the courts here. <em>Id. </em>at 358. <em>See McGraw v. State, </em>234 Md. 273, 275-276, 199 A. 2d 229, <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U. S. 862 (1964). Judge Buchanan explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201c[U]nlike a positive or statute law, the occasion or necessity for which may long since have passed away, if there has been no necessity before, for instituting a prosecution for \u25a0 conspiracy, no argument can be drawn from the <em>non-user </em>for resting on <em>principles </em>which cannot become obsolete, it has always potentially existed, to be applied' as occasion should arise. If there had never been in Maryland, since the original settlement of the colony by our ancestors, a prosecution for murder, arson, assault and battery, libel, with many other common law offenses, and consequently no judicial adoption of either of these branches of the common law, could it therefore be contended, that there was now no law in the State for the punishment of such offenses?\u201d 5 H. &amp; J. at 358.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">This principle was affirmed by us, implicitly at least, in <em>Harris v. Jones, </em>281 Md. 560, 380 A. 2d 611 (1977) when we \u201crecognized for the first time in Maryland the common law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a tort previously unacknowledged or arguably abandoned by non-use.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>38 Md. App. at 527. It does not follow, however, that because a common law crime does not become obsolete from mere non-use that it will always be viable. The opinion of the Court in <em>Buchanan </em>asserted that the provision in Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights regarding entitlement to the common law of England without any restrictive words being used, had reference \u201cto the common law in mass, as it existed here, <em>either potentially, or practically, </em>and as it prevailed in England at the time, <em>except such portions of it </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>as are inconsistent with the spirit of that instrument, and the nature of our new political institutions.\u201d </em>5 H. &amp; J. at 358 (emphasis added). We have repeated that statement on a number of occasions, <em>Dashiell v. Attorney General, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 392, 401 (1822); <em>State v. Bank of Maryland, 6 G. &amp; </em>J. 205, <em>226 </em>(1834); <em>Lickle v. Boone, </em>187 Md. 579, 582, 51 A. 2d 162 (1947); <em>McGraw v. State, supra, </em>234 Md. at 275-276; <em>Gladden v. State, </em>273 Md. 383, 389, 330 A. 2d 176 (1974). We put it this way in <em>Denison v. Denison, </em>35 Md. 361, 378 (1872):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201cIt is true the common law of England has been adopted by the people of this State, but only so far as it could be made to fit and adjust itself to our local circumstances and peculiar institutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">What this means is that the common law is subject to change. This is clearly apparent from its derivation and its very nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\u201cThe common law of <em>England </em>is derived from immemorial usage and custom, originating from Acts of Parliament not recorded, or which are lost, or have been destroyed. It is a system of jurisprudence founded on the immutable principles of justice, and denominated by the great luminary of the law of <em>England, </em>the perfection of reason. The evidence of it are treatises of the sages of the law, the judicial records and adjudications of the Courts of justice of <em>England,.\u201d Buchanan. </em>5 H. &amp; J. at 365 (opinion of Chase, C. J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">It may be changed by legislative act as Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights expressly provides. <em>See State v. Canova, </em>278 Md. 483, 486, 365 A. 2d 988 (1976); <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>State, </em>167 Md. 12, 15, 172 A. 354 (1934); <em>Harrison v. State, </em>22 Md. 468, 487-488 (1864); <em>Coomes v. Clements, </em>4 H. &amp; J. 480, 481. It may also be changed by judicial decision. Chase, C. J., in his opinion in <em>Buchanan, </em>observed: \u201cWhether particular parts of the common law are applicable to our local circumstances and situation, and our general code of laws and jurisprudence, is a question that comes within the province of the courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>justice, and is to be decided by them.\u201d 5 H. &amp; J. at 365-366. He gave this rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cThe common law, like our acts of assembly, are subject to the control and modification of the Legislature, and may be abrogated or changed as the general assembly may think most conducive to the general welfare; so that no great inconvenience, if any, can result from the power being deposited with the judiciary to decide what the common law is, and its applicability to the circumstances of the state,____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We said in <em>Gilbert v. Findlay College, </em>195 Md. 508, 513, 74 A. 2d 86 (1950) that \u201c[t]his interpretation has been continuously adopted in this State, and was reaffirmed in the case of <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 510, 165 A. 470 [1933].\u201d We asserted in <em>Ass'n of Taxi Oprs. v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>198 Md. 181, 204, 82 A. 2d 106 (1951): \u201cWe have frequently held that it is our duty to determine the common law as it exists in this state \u2014 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>does not preclude the exercise of this duty. We declared in <em>White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 354, 223 A. 2d 763 (1966): \u201cThe doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>important as it is, is not to be construed as preventing us from changing a rule of law if we are convinced that the rule has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life.\u201d <em>Accord, Hearst Corp. v. St. Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; T., </em>269 Md. 625, 643-644, 308 A. 2d 679 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Parts of the common law have been found by judicial mandate to be inapplicable or obsolete in other states. For example, <em>Flores v. Flores, </em>84 N. M. 601, 506 P. 2d 345, 347 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>(N.M. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>84 N. M. 592, 506 P. 2d 336 (1973) found that \u201cliability free intentional injury to one\u2019s spouse does not reflect the circumstances in New Mexico.\u201d <em>Swartz v. United States Steel, </em>293 Ala. 493, 304 So. 2d 881, 885 (1974) held that the common law rule that a wife has no cause of action for loss of her consortium is inconsistent with the institutions of Alabama. <em>Morganthaler v. First Atlantic National Bank, </em>80 So. 2d 446 (Fla. 1955) rejected the English rule that a legatee may elect to receive cash when a testator directs his executor to purchase an annuity because it \u201cdethrones a principle [that the intent of the testator controls] which is sacred to our way of life and fundamental in our concepts of right and justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In exercising our duty to determine whether a common law crime presently exists in this State, mere non-use is not sufficient, as we have indicated, to conclude that the offense has become obsolete. But non-use, we believe, is not without significance. When an offense has lain virtually dormant for over two hundred years, it is difficult to argue that the preservation of society and the maintenance of law and order demand recognition of it. <em>See </em>Glazebrook, <em>How Long, Then, Is The Arm Of The Law To Be?, </em>25 Mod. L. Rev. 301, 307-311 (1962). Perkins points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThe notion that misprision is needed, to prevent one who knows about another\u2019s felony from intentionally misleading investigating officers, is unfounded. If, when being questioned by officers who are investigating a felony, one who knows the facts intentionally misleads the officers by false statements and thereby 'covers up\u2019 for the felon, he thereby makes himself an accessory to that felony after the fact. If he impedes the investigation by falsely saying he does not know about it, or by refusing to talk, he should be held to be guilty of obstructing justice. There is a wide difference between a mere failure to hunt up an officer and tell about a felony, on the one hand, and a refusal to cooperate with an investigating officer, on the other.\u201d R. Perkins, Criminal Law 517 (2d ed. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Even more relevant, however, to a consideration of whether a common law crime is applicable as compatible with our local circumstances and situation and our general codes of law and jurisprudence is the nature of the crime. The reason for the failure of common law misprision of felony to survive in the United States was well expressed by Chief Justice Marshall over a hundred and fifty years ago in <em>Marbury v. Brooks, </em>20 U. S. (7 Wheat.) 556, 575-576 (1822) and thereafter noted by many commentators, text book authors and other authorities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cIt may be the duty of a citizen to accuse every offender, and to proclaim every offence which comes to his knowledge; but the law which would punish him in every case for not performing this duty is too harsh for man.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In England, according to Glazebrook in his critical consideration of <em>Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra, </em>in 25 Mod. L. Rev. 301, the Criminal Law Commissioners in their Fifth Report in 1840 repeated and elaborated this criticism and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\u201c \u2018The necessity of making such disclosures extends perhaps with greater force to the knowledge of a meditated crime, the perpetration of which may, by means of such disclosure, be prevented, than it does to the knowledge of one already committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, citing, n. 3, \u201cPari. Pap. (1840) xx, p. 32; quoted, Williams, <em>The Criminal Law: The General Part </em>(2nd ed., London 1961), p. 423.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Glazebrook opined that \u201c[f]or more than a century misprision of felony has been an embarrassment to common lawyers,\u201d and feared that the decisions and speeches in the House of Lords in <em>Sykes </em>\u201cafford only increased cause for this embarrassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. The Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Sykes </em>in holding that misprision of felony, as <em>Sykes </em>found it existed at common law, was currently an indictable crime in Maryland.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Glazebrook ably refuted <em>Sykes, </em>and we borrow extensively from him in the discussion which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Misprision of felony at common law is an unpractically wide crime, a long-standing criticism which remains unanswered in <em>Sykes. </em>It has an undesirable and ^discriminating width:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThe real harshness lies in the fact that the duty to disclose arises when a person acquires knowledge of an offence, and this he may do quite involuntarily. A says to B: \u2018Did you know that X stole a book from the library last week?\u2019 adding appropriate circumstantial details; or X says to B: T stole some money yesterday; will you help me to repay it?\u2019 B is a friend of X; he wished to know nothing of X\u2019s misdeeds; and yet he is to be a criminal if he does not betray him. It is, furthermore, particularly difficult to defend a law which indiscriminately adds to the injuries of the victim of a crime the penalties of the criminal law should he or she wish to forgive and forget.\u201d 25 Mod. L. Rev. at 311.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Misprision differs from almost all other common law offenses of omission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u201c[T]he duty to act arises not because of the willing assumption of responsibility, the occupation of an office, or the ownership of property, but because of the mere possession of certain knowledge \u2014 knowledge possessed accidentally and undesired \u2014 knowledge which may indeed have been acquired through some malevolent person.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Glazebrook observes that although \u201c[tjhere may be crimes where the protection of the public requires that each offender be brought to justice however reluctant his victims, his friends, or those who have him in their care, may be to do so, ... the line which separates them from all other offences is not the line which separates felonies from misdemeanors.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>at 312. This is particularly true with respect to Maryland where the distinction between felony and misdemeanor is a hodgepodge, following neither rhyme nor reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Under <em>Sykes, </em>no active step need be taken to conceal the felony (it is only thus that it remains quite distinct from the crime of accessory after the fact), and the concealment need bring no benefit to the accused.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But three fundamental questions remained: when does the duty to reveal a felony arise; how is that duty discharged; and does a relationship with the felon prevent the duty arising? <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">It seems that the duty arises when <em>\u201ca </em>man knows\u201d of the commission of a felony. When, then, can a man, be said to <em>know </em>and <em>what </em>is it that he must know? Lord Goddard held that there must be disclosure when the knowledge a man has \u201cis so definite that it ought to be disclosed. A man is neither bound nor would he be wise to disclose rumours or mere gossip, but, if facts are within his knowledge that would materially assist in the detection and arrest of a felon, he must disclose them as it is a duty he owes to the state.\u201d <em>Sykes </em>at 46. Lord Goddard left the matter to the jury as a question of fact. Glazebrook suggests that \u201cunless the jury is to be entirely uncontrolled, it has to be told how precise and certain the accused\u2019s knowledge must have been before he can be convicted.\u201d 25 Mod. L. Rev. at 313. Is the duty to be confined to felonies committed in the presence of the accused, and, if not, is hearsay sufficient? Should the felon\u2019s own admission, standing alone, be enough? Knowledge of the commission of a crime is an ingredient of the offenses of accessory after the fact and receiving stolen goods, but, unlike misprision, they require a positive act. It is reasonable, in such circumstance, to require a person who has reason to believe something is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>wrong to inquire further before embarking on some course of conduct, and to hold that he fails to do so at his peril. \u201cIf this rule is applied to misprision, two duties are imposed: a duty to disclose knowledge of a felony, and a duty also to make inquiries to resolve a suspicion concerning the commission of a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To paraphrase Glazebrook, must the inhabitants of Maryland become detectives as well as informers?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Sykes </em>fails to provide a working rule for <em>what </em>the accused must know. There was a direct conflict between Lord Denning and Lord Morton into which their brethren did not enter. Discussing knowledge, Lord Denning said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\u201cThe accused man must know' that a felony has been committed by someone else. His knowledge must be proved in the way in which the prosecution have been accustomed in other crimes when knowledge is an ingredient, such as receiving, accessory after the fact, compounding a felony, and so forth. That is to say, there must be evidence that a reasonable man in his place, with such facts and information before him as the accused had, would have known that a felony had been committed. From such evidence the jury may infer that the accused man himself had knowledge of it. He need not know the difference between felony and misdemeanour \u2014 many a lawyer has to look in the books for the purpose....\u201d <em>Sykes </em>at 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Glazebrook comments: \u201cThis leaves it largely a matter of chance whether misprision is committed or not.\u201d 25 Mod. L. Rev. at 314. That is, on the one hand, it must have been a felony of which the accused knew, but on the other hand, he need not know whether the crime was a felony or a misdemeanor. According to Lord Denning, it would be enough that the accused knew that a <em>serious </em>offense had been committed if it turns out to be a felony \u2014 \u201ca lawyer on turning up the books sees it is a felony____\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cThis requirement that it must be a serious offence disposes of many of the supposed absurdities, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>as boys stealing apples, which many laymen would . rank as a misdemeanour and no one would think he was bound to report to the police. It means that misprision comprehends an offence which is of so serious a character that an ordinary law-abiding citizen would realise he ought to report it to the police.\u201d <em>Sykes </em>at 42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">This rationale was based on the view that what distinguishes a felony from a misdemeanor is that a felony is a serious offense, \u201can offence of an \u2018aggravated complexion\u2019____ Felonies are the serious offences. Misdemeanours are the less serious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This introduced a limitation Lord Morton was not willing to accept. <em>Id. </em>at 46-47. In any event, the limitation added the further uncertainty of a trier of fact\u2019s view qf the gravity of the crime to be reported. 25 Mod. L. Rev. at 314. And, we observe, the foundation for the limitation is weak indeed when considered in light of the categories of felonies and misdemeanors adopted in this State. <em>Sykes </em>avoids what account is to be taken of excuses offered by an apparent felon. For example, \u201c[i]n cases of larceny, may the citizen be satisfied by any claim of right that is made, or must it be weighed, and where suspicion remains this communicated to the police? ... The <em>[Sykes} </em>recognition of misprision means, therefore, the imposition not of a duty to disclose <em>knowledge </em>of the commission of a felony, but of a duty to disclose <em>suspicions </em>of the commission of a felony....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-315. There are no criteria for determining which suspicions are to give rise to a duty, and so to criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">When the duty to disclose has arisen, it is not clear how it is discharged. It would be logical that once the authorities are in possession of all the information concerning a felony, a citizen\u2019s duty to disclose his own knowledge ceases. So there is an added element of chance \u2014 \u201cthe chance that the police already know.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. Lord Denning saw the duty as requiring a citizen \u201cto disclose to proper authority all material facts known to him relative to the offence. It is not sufficient to tell the police that a felony has been committed. He must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>tell the name of the man who did it, if he knows it; [<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>] the place, and so forth. All material facts known to him----If he fails or refuses to perform this duty when there is a reasonable opportunity available to him to do so, then he is guilty of misprision.\u201d <em>Sykes </em>at 42. This was not sufficient for Lord Goddard. He thought that \u201cfacts ... within his knowledge that would materially assist in the detection and arrest of a felon\u201d must be disclosed as a duty owed to the State. <em>Id. </em>at 46. \u201cThus if a man disclosed all he knew about the commission of a felony and yet did not disclose the whereabouts of the felon he would be acquitted by Lord Denning and convicted by Lord Goddard.\u201d 25 Mod. L. Rev. at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Their lordships agreed that the questions of when the knowledge must be revealed and how much trouble must be taken to reveal it were for the jury. Glazebrook is critical of this as assigning unsuitably vague questions to the trier of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201cIf a man is to be punished for not doing something, he ought to know precisely what is expected of him. The standard which he fails at his peril to attain ought not to be left to be fixed after the event by the whim of a particular jury. Formulae that pass muster in determining the liability of one who engages in a dangerous course of conduct are not always suited to crimes of pure omission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Only Lord Denning considered relationship with the felon with respect to the duty to disclose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201cNon-disclosure may be due to a claim of right made in good faith. For instance, if a lawyer is told by his client that he has committed a felony, it would be no misprision in the lawyer not to report it to the police, for he might in good faith claim that he was under a duty to keep it confidential. Likewise with doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and patient, and clergyman and parishioner. There are other relationships which may give rise to a claim in good faith that it is in the public interest not to disclose it.

I also agree with the majority that Pope was not guilty of child abuse as a principal in the second degree. However, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the child abuse statute, which interpretation furnishes the basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that Pope was not guilty of child abuse as a principal in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The child abuse statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 35A (a), reaches \u201c[a]ny parent, adoptive parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor child____\u201d The Court today takes the position that the statutory phrase \u201chas responsibility for the supervision of\u201d is ambiguous, thereby allowing the Court to \u201cgive effect to the real intention of the Legislature.\u201d The majority then states that, with regard to persons other than parents, legal custodians or individuals \u201cin loco parentis,\u201d only those persons who have assumed responsibility for a child with the consent of the parent or guardian are covered by the statute. The majority finds it \u201cself-evident\u201d that \u201ca third person may not assume such responsibility unless the parent grants it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Thus, we are told by the majority opinion that a \u201cperson taking a lost child into his home\u201d while an attempt is made to locate his or her parents is beyond the reach of the child abuse statute. In other words, in the Court\u2019s view, such a person may voluntarily assume full responsibility for the care of a small child, for a lengthy period of time while an effort is being made to find the parents, and during that time may batter the child unmercifully, but he would not be guilty of child abuse under Art. 27, \u00a7 35A. In my view this is a totally unwarranted narrowing of an important piece of legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">In addition to parents, the child abuse statute applies to \u201c[a]ny ... other person who has ... responsibility for the supervision of a minor child____\u201d The language is clear. Everyone who has responsibility is covered, regardless of how he obtained such responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>It is well-established in the law that one may, by his own actions, voluntarily assume a particular responsibility. That the Legislature intended to cover such a person is shown by the language <em>any other person who has responsibility. </em>There is no ambiguity here. Consequently, there is no need to go further in attempting to ascertain the legislative intent. The majority opinion today flatly violates settled principles of statutory construction, recently summarized by Judge Orth for the Court as follows <em>(Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 593, 596, 380 A. 2d 1052, 1054-1055 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U. S. 997, 98 S. Ct. 1650, 56 L.Ed.2d 86 (1978)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention. <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elect. Co. v. Board, </em>278 Md. 26, 31, 358 A. 2d 241 (1976). A statute should be construed according to the ordinary and natural import of the language used without resorting to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of limiting or extending its operation. <em>Burch v. State, </em>278 Md. 426, 429, 365 A. 2d 577 (1976); <em>Cearfoss v. State, </em>42 Md. 403, 407 (1875). That is, we must confine ourselves to the statute as written, and may not attempt, under the guise of construction, to supply omissions or remedy possible defects in the statute. <em>In Re Appeals Nos. 1022 &amp; 1081, </em>278 Md. 174, 178, 359 A. 2d 556 (1976). Thus, if there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the Legislature. <em>Maryland Auto Ins. Fund v. Stith, </em>277 Md. 595, 597, 356 A. 2d 272 (1976). As we said in <em>Purifoy v. Merc.-Safe Dep. &amp; Trust, </em>273 Md. 58, 66, 327 A. 2d 483 (1974), \u2018where statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Furthermore, even if there existed some ambiguity in the statute, I am at a loss to know why the majority finds it \u201cself-evident\u201d that only those persons who have been <em>granted </em>responsibility by a parent or guardian should be covered. Nothing in the statutory language indicates, such a legislative purpose. I kno\\v of no public policy justifying this differentiation between a person who assumes responsibility for a child with parental consent and one who assumes just as complete a responsibility without the parent\u2019s consent. If either abuses the child, he should be held accountable under \u00a7 35A.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The majority appears to be concerned about the \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d who watch a lost child, or allow neighbors\u2019 children to play in their yards and exercise supervision, or perform \u201cfunctions of a maternal nature from concern for the welfare, comfort or health of a child.\u201d However, such \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d have nothing to fear from the child abuse statute. But, if one of these same individuals assumes responsibility for the child and batters it, sexually molests it, locks it for a long period of time in a dark closet, etc., that person should be held just as accountable under the child abuse statute as someone else having responsibility for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">My concern in this case is not so much with the decision that the evidence was insufficient to convict Pope of child abuse. The evidence may not have been sufficient. Instead, what is troublesome in this case is the damage which the majority has done to the child abuse statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
