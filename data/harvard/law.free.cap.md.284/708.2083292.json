Franklin, <em>Poor Richard\u2019s Almanac </em>(1746), Howard R. and Sharon L. Fricke, respondents here, instituted this action in the District Court of Maryland to recover from petitioner Loch Hill Construction Company, Inc., the cost of another well to supply their new home with water. This second well was drilled following several instances in which the first well, bored at petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>direction to supply water to the house it constructed and sold to respondents, was not able to produce an amount adequate for the Fricke. family\u2019s daily use. The District Court, after hearing testimony concerning the drilling and testing of the two wells, determined that there had been no breach by petitioner of its implied warranty of habitability as created by Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-203 (a) (4) of the Real Property Article, which we will later set out, and denied to the Frickes recovery for the cost of drilling the additional well. In an on the record appeal to it, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County found the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the evidence to be clearly erroneous under Maryland Rule 1386 and entered judgment in respondents\u2019 favor in the amount of $3763 for the cost of the second well.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner then sought and was granted a writ of certiorari by this Court. Although we agree with the circuit court that the factual findings upon which the District Court based its determination will not support its judgment, we think the circuit court was in error in substituting its own factual findings for those of the District Court on the question of damages and will, therefore, direct a remand of this case to the District Court for further proceedings with respect to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The two wells that are the center of this controversy are both located on the same one and one-quarter acre lot in the Phoenix area of suburban Baltimore County. The initial well was drilled in November 1975 for Loch Hill Construction Company, then the lot\u2019s owner, by G. Edgar Harr Sons\u2019 Corporation, which was joined in this action in the District Court as a third-party defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the well was drilled to a depth of 223 feet, its production capacity was tested over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>a six-hour period. During that time, according to the drilling company, the well produced an average of five gallons per minute, which was more than sufficient to comply with the Baltimore County Health Department\u2019s standard of two gallons per minute. In April of the following year, subject to the condition it be completed, the respondents purchased from petitioner for $132,500 the dwelling being constructed on the lot containing the well. Settlement under the contract of sale took place in the summer of 1976 shortly after respondents and their three teenage children moved into their newly completed home.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">After the Fricke family used the well for approximately thirty days, it became dry. Though this water supply deficiency recurred on the average of once a month, Howard Fricke testified before the District Court that for the first several months he thought it simply might be the result of his family\u2019s water usage habits. In February 1977, however, he changed his mind for one Saturday afternoon, following the use of water merely for one load of laundry, a shower, and the hosing off of a small patio in the back yard, the supply was exhausted. As a result, respondents decided to test the amount of water the well was producing and, not realizing which company had originally drilled the well, contacted G. Edgar Harr Sons\u2019 Corporation to do the work. This test, conducted on February 25, 1977, revealed that the well\u2019s water recovery rate was then only four gallons in ten minutes, or four-tenths of a gallon per minute. As a result, G. Edgar Harr Sons\u2019 Corporation suggested respondents drill a new well. When the Frickes contacted Loch Hill Construction Company about remedying the situation. Loch Hill offered to deepen the existing well. Respondents refused this offer and instead employed G. Edgar Harr Sons\u2019 Corporation to drill a new well. In its first attempt, a 300-foot dry hole was bored but, after beginning anew at a different location on the lot, a 200-foot well was drilled that produced a flow of six gallons per minute. This well, the Frickes say, has ended their water supply problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">When the petitioner rebuffed their attempts to obtain payment for the cost of the new well, the Frickes filed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>suit in the District Court. That court determined that, under section 10-203 (a) (4) of the Real Property Article, as a condition of its sale there is an implied warranty that a new residence will have an adequate supply of potable water. It further ruled, however, that there was no breach of this warranty in this case because the original well, even though producing only four-tenths of a gallon per minute, would, when considered with the well\u2019s storage capacity, meet the Baltimore County requirements and because the testimony presented concerning the capacity of that well, when compared with the amount of water normally needed for a family of five, showed that the supply was sufficient to render the home \u201cfit for habitation.\u201d In reversing this ruling, the circuit court found the District Court\u2019s interpretation was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d because, according to that court, the well did not meet Baltimore County\u2019s minimum yield requirement. As a result, the circuit court entered a judgment against Loch Hill Construction Company for the cost of the new well, a determination the petitioner now seeks to have reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Although the existence of implied warranties arising from the construction and sale of new residential dwellings was first recognized by a court in this country only a little over two decades ago, <em>Vanderschrier v. Aaron, </em>103 Ohio App. 340, 140 N.E.2d 819, 821 (1957), since that time judicial acceptance of such warranties has spread rapidly until at present new home purchasers in over one-half of the states enjoy the protection of at least some type of implied warranty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Roeser, <em>The Implied Warranty of Habitability in the Sale of New Housing: The Trend in Illinois, </em>1978 So. Ill. U.L.J. 178, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>178 &amp; n. 1. Several times prior to 1970 this Court considered the status of implied warranties in the sale of new residences and determined that, absent legislative authorization, such a sale in Maryland did not incorporate any such guarantees. <em>E.g., Neary v. Posner, </em>253 Md. 401, 405, 252 A. 2d 843, 846 (1969); <em>Allen v. Wilkinson, </em>250 Md. 395, 398, 243 A. 2d 515, 517 (1968); <em>see Worthington Constr. v. Moore, </em>266 Md. 19, 21-22, 291 A. 2d 466, 467 (1972) (applying pre-1970 law). In that year, the General Assembly enacted a new statute providing that specified implied warranties arose with the purchase of a new house. 1970 Md. Laws, ch. 151, \u00a7 1 (initially codified at Md. Code (1957,1966 Repl. Vol., 1970 Cum. Supp.), Art. 21, \u00a7 95B). The current successor to that act\u2019s implied warranty provision is found in section 10-203 (a) of the Real Property Article and declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">(a) <em>Warranties which are implied. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) or unless excluded or modified pursuant to subsection (d), in every sale, warranties are implied that, at the time of the delivery of the deed to a completed improvement or at the time of completion of an improvement not completed when the deed is delivered, the improvement is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">(1) Free from faulty materials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">(2) Constructed according to sound engineering standards;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">(3) Constructed in a workmanlike manner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">(4) Fit for habitation. [Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-203 (a) of the Real Property Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In examining section 10-203 more closely, as we must do because it defines the scope of implied warranties in the sale of a new house, we first note that it pertains to \u201cimprovements,\u201d which are defined in section 10-201 of the Real Property Article to include \u201cevery newly constructed private dwelling unit, and fixture and structure which is made a part of a newly constructed private dwelling unit at the time of construction by any building contractor or subcontractor.\u201d Md. Code (1974), \u00a7 10-201 (b) of the Real Property Article. Petitioner has not contended, and correctly so in our estimation, that the dwelling involved here is not such an \u201cimprovement.\u201d Nor do we think the statute could in any way be construed as not applying to the petitioner and the respondents here, for, by its terms, Loch Hill Construction Company, as a \u201cperson engaged in the business of erecting or otherwise creating an improvement on realty,\u201d is a \u201cvendor\u201d within the meaning of section 10-201, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10-201 (e), while the Frickes, as \u201cthe original purchasers] of improved realty,\u201d are \u201cpurchaser[s]\u201d under that section, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10-201 (c). In continuing our examination of section 10-203, we find that the exceptions and exclusions provided for in subsections (b) and (d) have no relevance here. Whether a well will properly supply a new residence with water is not normally a \u201ccondition that an inspection of the premises would reveal to a reasonably diligent purchaser at the time the contract is signed\u201d and thus would not be excepted by subsection (b) from the implied warranties of section 10-203 (a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10-203 (b). Neither do we find in the contract of sale evidence of any attempt by the parties under subsection (d) to exclude or modify, wholly or partially, the warranties established by section 10-203 (a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10-203 (d). Thus, the statute\u2019s provisions contain no impediment to a finding that petitioner, in selling this new home with its well, by implica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tion warranted under section 10-203 (a) (4) that the premises were \u201cfit for habitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In determining whether an existing condition relating to a new dwelling renders it uninhabitable under section 10-203 (a) (4),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the test is one of reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., Coney v. Stewart, </em>263 Ark. 148, 562 S.W.2d 619, 621 (1978); <em>Smith v. Old Warson Development Company, </em>479 S.W.2d 795, 801 (Mo. 1972); <em>Jeanguneat v. Jackie Hames Const. Co., </em>576 P. 2d 761, 764 (Okla. 1978); <em>Yepsen v. Burgess, </em>269 Or. 635, 525 P. 2d 1019, 1022 (1974); <em>Padula v. J.J.Deb-Cin Homes, Inc., </em>111 R.I. 29, 298 A. 2d 529, 531 (1973); <em>Rutledge v. Dodenhoff, </em>254 S.C. 407, 175 S.E.2d 792, 795 (1970); <em>Waggoner v. Midwestern Development, Inc., </em>83 S.D. 57, 154 N.W.2d 803, 809 (1967). Accordingly, in any breach of contract action the answer to an inquiry concerning a violation of an implied warranty of habitability depends on the circumstances of the particular case. As a consequence, using the requirements of applicable governmental regulations, such as a building or housing code, together with any other evidence showing the customary or usual conditions that render habitable a new home of like kind and quality in the area where the dwelling has been constructed, if, as no doubt will frequently prove true, rational minds would disagree on the issue of fitness for habitation, the resolution of that issue rests with the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>fact; otherwise, the court makes the determination as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Considering the case before us in light of this standard, we have no hesitancy in determining that reasonable minds would not differ in reaching the conclusion that an adequate supply of water to and within the Fricke home was necessary to make it habitable. From time immemorial water has been a necessity for sustaining the physical well-being of humankind and a dwelling site to which it is not reasonably available is not habitable. While at one time a house that was close enough to allow its inhabitants to walk or ride to a water supply that could be taken and returned to the dwelling was one \u201cfit for habitation,\u201d this is no longer true in urban American society. Improved techniques of well drilling and the building of complex water supply and sewerage systems have created a reasonable expectation on the part of purchasers that every new urban dwelling will be supplied adequately with water, whether from a nearby well or from an area-wide supply system. We thus conclude that, unless exempted or excluded by the terms of the statute, a new dwelling that is without a proper supply of water breaches a vendor\u2019s implied warranty of habitability under section 10-203 (a) (4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Krol v. York Terrace Bldg., Inc., </em>35 Md. App. 321, 330, 370 A. 2d 589, 594-95 (1977); <em>Lyon v. Ward, </em>28 N.C. App. 446, 221 S.E.2d 727, 729-30 (1976); <em>see Forbes v. Mercado, </em>283 Or. 291, 583 P. 2d 552, 553 (1978) (quality of water); <em>Elderkin v. Gaster, </em>447 Pa. 118, 288 A. 2d 771, 777 (1972) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Recognizing then that a proper supply of water had to be readily obtainable if this dwelling was to be \u201cfit for habitation,\u201d we next confront the issue of how much water need be available to meet that requirement. In this instance, the District Court, in finding the Fricke\u2019s water supply to be adequate, concluded that the original well, from the date of the initial test in November 1975, continued to meet the applicable building code provision \u2014 the county health department\u2019s minimum yield requirement of two gallons per minute for six hours. In reviewing the record, however, we find, as did the circuit court, that this conclusion, not being supported by the evidence, is clearly erroneous. The parties agree that at least by February 1977 the well was yielding only four-tenths of a gallon per minute. At this rate, the well could produce only 144 gallons in six hours (.4 gal./min. x 60 mins, x 6 hrs.). This, according to the testimony of the chief of the Sanitary Engineering Division of the Baltimore County Health Department, could be added to the 282 gallon storage capacity of the well (188 ft. of storage space x 1.5 gals./ft.) to determine whether the building code\u2019s requirement was met.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet, this 426 gallons is far below the 720 gallons that would have to be available, as a minimum, in order to meet the test (2 gals./min. x 60 mins, x 6 hrs.). This means that if the well, filled to its storage capacity, was drained at a rate of two gallons per minute, it would be pumped dry in a little under three hours, far short of the six hours needed to meet the county\u2019s test. Thus, we again have no difficulty in determining that under these circumstances, reasonable minds would not differ in concluding that the supply provided by the vendor here was not adequate to make the Fricke home habitable and, therefore, as a matter of law, breaches its implied warrant to that effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>In so stating, we do not mean to imply that the mere showing by a homeowner that his well did not produce sufficient water precludes the vendor from demonstrating there was no warranty violation on its part. Yet, unless the vendor can satisfy the trier of fact by probative evidence that the absence of a proper water supply following the transfer of title resulted solely from acts of another for which the vendor was not responsible or was caused by a phenomena of such suddenness and magnitude that it can properly be classified as an \u201cact of God\" (i.e., earthquake), establishing such a water shortage entitles the purchaser to a verdict for the damages he suffered. <em>See Jeanguneat v. Jackie Hames Const. Co., supra, </em>576 P. 2d at 765. Though in the ease now before us there was speculation by several well drilling experts that the decrease in the flow of water from the first well could have been caused by something beyond the petitioner\u2019s control, nonetheless no one sought to give an explanation, supported by proper evidence, that tended to prove that the decline in the well\u2019s productivity resulted from any of the causes to which we have just alluded. Without any such evidence, petitioner must bear liability for the well\u2019s failure. In making this ruling we are cognizant of the fact that the vendor in situations such as exists here is required to assume an imposing burden. This, however, is the consequence of the legislature\u2019s decision to imply such a warranty. By doing so, the General Assembly, though not imposing liability without fault and providing for exemption through specific contractual agreement, nonetheless indicated its intent that because the vendor has a superior knowledge of the structure it had built or sold and profited by receiving a fair price, as between it and. the innocent purchaser, the purchaser should be protected from latent de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>fects that render his new dwelling not \u201cfit for habitation.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Coney v.

Because the issue was properly raised at trial, the petitioner is correct in asserting that it is entitled to a ruling on whether the Frickes, in drilling a new well, acted reasonably to minimize the damage caused by the breach of warranty. <em>See Slaska v. Idzi, </em>186 Md. 530, 534, 47 A. 2d 503, 504-05 (1946); <em>Petite v. Homes, Inc., </em>184 Md. 377, 386, 41 A. 2d 71, 76 (1945).

Although, under the view adopted by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Court, it was unnecessary for it to resolve the damage issue, we note that there was conflicting evidence introduced by the parties as to whether drilling the first well deeper would have been an effective, reasonable, and less expensive means of remedying the Frickes\u2019 water problem.

The initial break with the established rule of caveat emptor in the sale of real property came in the courts of Great Britain, as is illustrated by the case of Perry v. Sharon Development Co., Ltd., [1937] 4 All E.R. 390. In <em>Perry, </em>the court held that the sale of an uncompleted dwelling created an implied warranty that all building work would be properly done because the vendor was then contracting to do such work as well as to sell a structure and because the buyer could not inspect the entire residence as it was incomplete. <em>Id, </em>at 395.

Quinby, Inc., 248 Md. 428, 433-38, 237 A. 2d 4, 6-9 (1968), we do not think that such noncompliance in and of itself breaches the implied warranty of habitability imposed by section 10-203 (a) (4). <em>But see </em>Carpenter v. Donohoe, 154 Colo. 78, 388 P. 2d 399, 402 (1964); Goggin v. Fox Valley Const. Corp., 48 Ill. App. 3d 103, 365 N.E.2d 509, 511 (1977). Rather, we conclude that when the condition that it is urged renders the new dwelling not to be \u201cfit for habitation\u201d is regulated by a building code requirement, then such a provision not only acts as a guide in determining the issue of habitability but also aids in ascertaining what is necessary to make the new home \u201cfit for habitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">. Of course, the amount of water and the manner by which it is made available to a new dwelling in order to make the residence habitable will depend on a variety of factors, including the home\u2019s location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b797-5\">. Whether the storage capacity within the well can be considered in calculating its yield is not before us and thus we express no opinion as to the Sanitary Engineering Division chief\u2019s interpretation in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">. In asserting that there was no breach of the implied warranty of habitability here, petitioner, as did the District Court after finding the well complied with the county\u2019s requirement, relies on a comparison of the amount of water available to the Frickes from the well over a 24-hour period with the quantity required to satisfy the average daily needs of a family of five. Petitioner\u2019s conclusion that the dwelling was fit for habitation is based on the following reasoning: A family of five, according to the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>experts in the case, uses, on the average, between 350 and 500 gallons of water daily. The well, on the other hand, could make available to the Frickes over a 24-hour period a total of 868 gallons of water (282 gallons of storage capacity + .4 gal./min. x 60 mins, x 24 hrs.). Thus, petitioner asserts, the water supply is more than sufficient to fulfill reasonably the Frickes\u2019 daily needs. This rationale, however, is not persuasive for it does not take into account a vitally important factor recognized by the Baltimore County test, that is, that a family's water usage almost inevitably will be concentrated into the waking hours of the 24-hour day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. This same rationale goes far toward answering petitioner\u2019s suggestion that under section 10-203 (a) (4) a vendor is only responsible for those defects that are present \u201cat the time of the delivery of the deed,\u201d Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-203 (a) of the Real Property Article, so that, because this well originally met the Baltimore County standard and there was no showing by respondents pinpointing when the well failed to do so, petitioner should be relieved of liability. This interpretation, however, ignores that section 10-204 (b) (1) of the Real Property Article provides that any implied warranty, including habitability, continues for one year after delivery of the completed improvement to the purchaser or after he takes possession, whichever occurs first. <em>Id </em>(1974), \u00a7 10-204 (b) (1). To read section 10-203 (a) as narrowing the scope of the protection afforded the purchaser would totally frustrate the purpose of the legislature in protecting the buyer from any latent defect that, although apparently not in existence at the time of possession or delivery of the deed, nonetheless becomes patent during the first year of occupancy. <em>See </em>Krol v. York Terrace Bldg., Inc., 35 Md. App. 321, 328-29, 370 A. 2d 589, 594 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
