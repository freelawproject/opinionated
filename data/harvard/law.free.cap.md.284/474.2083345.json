It nevertheless holds itself out to the public as \u201cAccountants\u201d and advertises that it provides \u201caccounting\u201d services. Specifically, it characterizes its services as \u201cBookkeeping, Accounting and Tax Records Services\u201d and denominates itself on its business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>letterhead as \u201cAccountants.\u201d It claims a nationwide network of 150 authorized franchisees, staffed by qualified, graduate accountants who service 15,000 clients throughout the country. In its promotional literature, Comprehensive states that it was founded on the notion that \u201csmall and medium-sized business concerns cannot afford on their payroll the high-salaried accountants, systems specialists and consultants of huge corporations.\u201d Comprehensive advertises that it can provide \u201cthese same essential services to smaller businesses\u201d and that it will \u201cundertake <em>all </em>the bookkeeping, accounting, systems work, and permanent records for taxes for the business----\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The \u201cbasic services\u201d which Comprehensive offers to the public include the preparation of profit and loss statements, \u201cBank Reconciliation\u201d statements, complete records for tax purposes, the maintenance of detail general ledgers, and computerized accounts receivable systems, including all necessary journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Comprehensive claims that it has developed a specialized method of collecting, processing and disseminating financial information in order to furnish small business clients with monthly financial statements and a tax preparation service. Comprehensive\u2019s system is said to be based upon mass production \u201caccounting\u201d techniques, requiring mass media advertising to obtain large numbers of clients. Comprehensive does not represent that it conducts \u201caudits\u201d or \u201cexaminations,\u201d nor does it furnish written certificates or opinions concerning the correctness of financial statements, schedules, reports, or exhibits which it prepares.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The Board filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, to enjoin Comprehensive from violating the provisions of \u00a7 14 (e) by holding itself out to the public as \u201cAccountants\u201d and describing the services it offers as \u201cAccounting\u201d services. Comprehensive filed a combined demurrer and answer, in which it admitted offering \u201cAccounting\u201d services to the public and holding itself out as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cAccountants.\u201d Alleging that the services it performs for its clients are permissible under \u00a7 15 (e), Comprehensive claimed that \u00a7 14 (e) violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and the free speech provisions of the first amendment because the statute restricted the dissemination of accurate commercial information to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The trial court (Sullivan, J.) decided the case on the pleadings, without conducting an evidentiary hearing. It held that the challenged statute did not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cThe use of the word \u2018accountant\u2019 by an uncertified person may deceive the public into believing that the person is certified by the state. Section 14 (e)... does not violate due process because the means selected has a real and substantial relation to the [public welfare] object sought to be obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">While concluding that a rational basis existed for the enactment of \u00a7 14 (e) \u2014 protection of the public from misleading and deceptive information \u2014 the court stated that nothing in the statute prevented Comprehensive \u201cfrom offering the services it presently provides.\u201d The Board, it said, \u201chas not attempted to stop ... [Comprehensive] from practicing [its] livelihood, only from describing such as accounting services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Addressing Comprehensive\u2019s first amendment claim, the court recognized that \u201cprohibiting the use of the words \u2018accountant\u2019 and \u2018accounting\u2019 may infringe upon ... [Comprehensive\u2019s] free speech.\u201d It observed, however, that \u201cthe right of free speech is not an unlimited, unqualified right, but the societal value of speech must on occasion be subordinated to other values and considerations.\u201d The court concluded that Comprehensive\u2019s right of free speech \u201ccan be limited so as not to mislead or deceive the public that... [it] has the qualifications of a certified corporation.\u201d The court said that nothing in the \u201ccommercial speech doctrine\u201d inhibited the practice of a state\u2019s preventing false, misleading or deceptive information in the advertising of professional services. It, therefore, permanently enjoined Comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>from describing its services as \u201caccounting\u201d or holding itself out to the public as an \u201caccountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Comprehensive contends that the statutory prohibition upon use of the words \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting\u201d to describe its services is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied. It argues that \u00a7 15 (e) permits uncertified accountants to perform any and all accounting work, other than the attest function. Consequently, it argues that the statute creates an anomaly of expressly authorizing an uncertified accountant to perform accounting services for the public while at the same time prohibiting him from describing those services as accounting, or holding himself out to the public as an accountant. As a result, advertising restrictions are imposed on Comprehensive which it claims will diminish and may entirely eliminate a class of competition inherently best suited to satisfy the accounting needs of small business clients, <em>i.e., </em>accountants who do not hold enrollment certificates either as a certified public accountant or as a public accountant. It is the unlicensed accountant, according to Comprehensive, who is \u201cthe principal purveyor of accounting services for ... small business clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">With regard to its fourteenth amendment contention, Comprehensive claims that the prohibitions of \u00a7 14 (e) violate the due process clause because there is no rational basis from which it can be concluded that the use of the words \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting\u201d by uncertified practitioners would deceive the public into believing that they are certified or registered accountants.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Concerning its reliance on the first amendment, Comprehensive maintains that the prohibitions of \u00a7 14 (e) on its lawful accounting business unconstitutionally abridge its right of free speech because the statute prevents uncertified persons, who are permitted to perform ordinary accounting work, from advertising the true nature of their services; in other words, Comprehensive contends that the State cannot, consistent with the first amendment, completely suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>dissemination of truthful information about an entirely lawful business activity. Comprehensive argues that the burden is on the Board to demonstrate that \u00a7 14 (e) furthers a significant governmental interest and provides the least restrictive alternative of regulation; if it cannot do so, Comprehensive urges that the statute must be found to unconstitutionally infringe upon its first amendment right of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The Board takes a more simplistic view of the case. It argues that Comprehensive\u2019s admission that it performs accounting services and holds itself out to the public as an accountant, even though not holding an enrollment certificate, constitutes prima facie evidence under \u00a7 18 \u201cthat such person is holding himself out to be a certified public accountant or public accountant holding an enrollment certificate.\u201d The Board maintains that the rational basis underlying \u00a7 14 (e), consistent with due process requirements, is to prevent confusion and deception in the public mind between the practice of bookkeeping and the practice of accounting, even though it concedes there is some overlapping of the basic functions of each discipline. Through the operation of the statute the public is protected, according to the Board, from a non-certified practitioner\u2019s giving the appearance that he is certified or registered and thus subject to state and professional regulation and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">As to Comprehensive\u2019s first amendment claim, the Board concedes that uncertified accountants \u201care free to engage in simple accounting work but are not allowed under \u00a7 14 (e) to borrow the title \u2018accountant\u2019 in describing themselves, or the word \u2018accounting\u2019 in describing their services.\u201d It claims that nothing in the statute restricts uncertified accountants from advertising the availability and terms of services they are allowed to perform, so long as they do not use the prohibited terms. While recognizing that the commercial speech doctrine serves to inform the public of the availability, nature and prices of products and services, the Board nevertheless contends that \u00a7 14 (e) does not prohibit the free flow of truthful commercial information in violation of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>amendment, since it merely restricts the use of the words \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting\u201d by uncertified persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">That only certified public accountants or public accountants holding enrollment certificates can engage in the practice of \u201cpublic accounting\u201d would seem plain from the literal words of the statute. Since that term is nowhere defined in Art. 75A, we think it manifest that the legislature intended that it be construed in accordance with its common meaning in the accounting field, as limited by the exceptions contained in \u00a7 15 (e). While these exceptions purport to be confined to \u201cbookkeeping and tax services,\u201d the specifically delineated functions, as the Board admits, clearly encompass some accounting services, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cdevising and installing systems, recording and presentation of financial information or data, preparing financial statements, schedules, reports and exhibits, or similar services----\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 15 (e) expressly authorizes an uncertified accountant to perform accounting services for the public, while at the same time \u00a7 14 (e) prohibits him from describing those services to the public as accounting, or holding himself out to the public as an accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The right of the State to regulate the practice of public accounting is well established, as is the power of the State to restrict the use of the words \u201ccertified public accountant,\u201d \u201cpublic accountant,\u201d or the abbreviation \u201cC.P.A.\u201d to those certified or registered by it. <em>See </em>1 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Accountants </em>\u00a7 2 (1962). A statute prohibiting use of the term \u201caccountant\u201d by unregistered persons was held not violative of the due process clause in <em>Texas State Board of Public Accountancy v. Fulcher, </em>515 S.W.2d 950 (Tex. Civ. App. 1974), since a reasonable relationship was found to exist between the prohibition and the state\u2019s goal of protecting the public. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Similarly, in <em>People v. Hill, </em>66 Cal. App. 3d 320, 136 Cal. Rptr. 30 (Ct. App. 1977), it was held that the use of the terms \u201caccounting\u201d and \u201caccountant\u201d by a non-licensed accountant could be enjoined as misrepresentations, even though the statute did not expressly prohibit the use of those terms by an unlicensed person. On the other hand, it was held in <em>Florida Accountants Association v. Dandelake, </em>98 So. 2d 323 (Fla. 1957), that it was an unreasonable restriction upon rights of contract to prohibit uncertified accountants from holding themselves out to the public as \u201caccountants,\u201d so long as they did not use the statutory title of \u201ccertified public accountant\u201d or any other designation that might mislead the public into believing they held a state certificate. <em>See also State v. Riedell, </em>109 Okla. 35, 233 P. 684 (1924), holding that a statute which prohibits uncertified persons from practicing or holding themselves out as accountants constituted an unconstitutional abridgement of rights of contract and private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In <em>Pitts v. State Bd. of Examiners, </em>222 Md. 224, 160 A. 2d 200 (1960), our predecessors noted that prohibiting the business use of specified titles or descriptions in the public interest by uncertified or unlicensed persons was a commonplace legislative device. In <em>Pitts, </em>a statute prohibited psychologists not certified by the Board from using the words \u201cpsychological,\u201d \u201cpsychologist\u201d or \u201cpsychology\u201d to describe the services they offered to the public. Although uncertified psychologists were permitted to practice, without regard to their competency, the Court said that the adequacy of the legislative scheme to protect the public was for the legislature to determine; and that the method chosen had a substantial relation to the evil sought to be remedied. It found no merit in the contention that the statutory prohibition constituted a denial of substantive due process because it protected the public against representations of competence implicit in the use of the term \u201cpsychologist\u201d by uncertified psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Whether Comprehensive\u2019s right to substantive due process is offended by \u00a7 14 (e) depends, of course, upon the existence of a rational basis for the statute. One who attacks a statute on due process grounds bears the burden of proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>absence of such a basis, viz., that it does not bear a real and substantial relationship to the governmental object sought to be attained. <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, 282 </em>Md. 422, 384 A. 2d 748 (1978); <em>see Md. Bd. of Pharmacy v. Sav-A-Lot, </em>270 Md. 103, 311 A. 2d 242 (1973); <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. St. Bd., </em>268 Md. 32, 300 A. 2d 367 (1973). Because no evidentiary hearing was held, Comprehensive was not afforded an opportunity \u2014 as it should have been \u2014 to undertake to prove the absence of a rational basis for \u00a7 14 (e) by showing that the public would not be deceived if it and other uncertified practitioners were permitted to refer to themselves as \u201cAccountants.\u201d In view of our disposition of the case on first amendment grounds, however, such an evidentiary hearing will not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Comprehensive\u2019s first amendment challenge to the prohibitions of \u00a7 14 (e) is grounded upon the fact, conceded by the Board, that \u00a7 15 (e) permits the performance of ordinary accounting work, without an enrollment certificate, so long as the practitioner does not represent \u201cthat an \u2018audit\u2019 or \u2018examination\u2019 has been made ... [and does not] furnish written certificates or opinions concerning the correctness, fairness or fair presentation of financial statements, schedules, reports, or exhibits ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Until recently, \u201ccommercial speech\u201d claimed little of the protection traditionally afforded by the first amendment to other forms of speech. <em>See Valentine v. Chrestensen, </em>316 U. S. 52, 62 S. Ct. 920, 86 L. Ed. 1262 (1942). However, beginning with <em>Bigelow v. Virginia, </em>421 U. S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L.Ed.2d 600 (1975), the Supreme Court has used a balancing test to determine whether commercial communications warrant first amendment protection. Applying this test to a statute prohibiting the publication of abortion advertisements, the Court held that \u2022 the statute unconstitutionally infringed upon a newspaper publisher\u2019s first amendment rights. 421 U. S. at 829. While commenting that \u201c[advertising, like all public expression, may be subject to reasonable regulation that serves a legitimate public interest,\u201d 421 U. S. at 825-26, the Court concluded that the State\u2019s interest in shielding its citizens from abortion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>advertisements was outweighed by the publisher\u2019s interest in communicating \u201cfactual matter of clear \u2018public interest.\u2019 \u201d 421 U. S. at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Constitutional protection for commercial speech was further expanded in <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council, </em>425 U. S. 748, 96 S. Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976). In that case, the issue was \u201cwhether a State may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information\u2019s effect upon its disseminators and its recipients.\u201d 425 U. S. at 773. The Court decided that Virginia\u2019s ban on a pharmacist\u2019s commercial advertising of prescription drug prices interfered with the first amendment rights of consumers who wished to receive the information, as well as with the rights of those pharmacists who wished to speak. After examining and rejecting each of the State\u2019s proffered justifications for the law, the Court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cThe challenge now made, however, is based on the First Amendment. This casts the Board\u2019s justifications in a different light, for on close inspection it is seen that the State\u2019s protectiveness of its citizens rests in large measure on the advantages of their being kept in ignorance. The advertising ban does not directly affect professional standards one way or the other. It affects them only through the reactions it is assumed people will have to the free flow of drug price information....\u201d 425 U. S. at 769.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Characterizing the advertising ban as a \u201chighly paternalistic approach,\u201d the Court determined that Virginia\u2019s goal of protecting the public from unscrupulous pharmacists could not be constitutionally achieved by legislation that kept the public in total ignorance of the prices of drugs. In reaching this conclusion the Court emphasized the interest of consumers in the free flow of truthful information necessary for formation of intelligent opinions and proper resource allocation. 425 U. S. at 764-65. Viewed in this light, the first amendment protects consumers\u2019 opportunities to choose for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>themselves the price they are willing to pay for differing degrees of quality, service, or even safety. <em>See generally </em>Reich, <em>Consumer Protection and the First Amendment: A Dilemma for the FTC?, </em>61 Minn. L. Rev. 705 (1977). Rather than totally suppressing truthful commercial information, the State must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cassume that this information is not in itself harmful, that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them. If they are truly open, nothing prevents the \u2018professional\u2019 pharmacist from marketing his own assertedly superior product, and contrasting it with that of the low-cost, high-volume prescription drug retailer. But the choice among these alternative approaches is not ours to make or the Virginia General Assembly\u2019s. It is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the First Amendment makes for us____\u201d 425 U. S. at 770.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The Court was careful to distinguish truthful commercial speech from that which is false, misleading, or deceptive: \u201cUntruthful speech, commercial or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake.\u201d 425 U. S. at 771. Because commercial speech differs from other kinds of speech, in that it is more objectively verifiable and less likely to be chilled by regulations, commercial expression may enjoy a \u201cdifferent degree of protection\u201d than that normally accorded under the first amendment. 425 U. S. at 771-72, n. 24. While invalidating Virginia\u2019s total ban on drug price advertising, the Court recognized that in some cases it may be \u201cappropriate to require that a commercial message appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive.\u201d <em>Id. Cf. Fulcher v. Texas State Bd. of Public Acc., </em>571 S.W.2d 366, 370 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978) (dictum) (An uncertified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>accountant\u2019s holding himself out as possessing expert knowledge in accounting is misleading and may be enjoined under <em>Virginia Pharmacy.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Nowhere, however, are the concepts \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d defined in <em>Virginia Pharmacy. </em>Professor Pitofsky, in <em>Beyond Nader: Consumer Protection and the Regulation of Advertising, </em>90 Harv. L. Rev. 661 (1977), points out that the Federal Trade Commission, in measuring deception and unfairness, looks at the total impression of the advertisement and determines the extent, if any, to which a substantial part of the audience might be misled by it. The meaning of an advertisement is a matter committed to the discretion of the Commission, and the FTC is not required to sample public opinion to determine its meaning. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. F.T.C., </em>143 F. 2d 29 (7th Cir. 1944). However, the discretion exercised by an agency or a legislature is not unreviewable by the courts, especially when the agency or legislative action results in the complete suppression of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Although the Board recognizes that the Supreme Court has extended the guarantees of the first amendment to \u201ccommercial\u201d speech, it asserts that the rationale of <em>Virginia Pharmacy </em>is inapplicable because \u00a7 14 (e) does not restrict uncertified accountants from advertising the availability and terms of the services they are allowed to offer under \u00a7 15 (e). A similar claim was made by the Federal Trade Commission in <em>Beneficial Corp. v. F.T.C., </em>542 F. 2d 611 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U. S. 983 (1977), in attempting to justify an order which prohibited the use of the phrase \u201cinstant tax refund.\u201d Both the administrative law judge and the Commission concluded that only a total ban on the phrase could cure the false and misleading advertisements. On appeal, Beneficial contended that explanatory words could have cured any tendency to mislead, and that forcing it to abandon its copyrighted phrase was unwarranted. The court agreed. Relying on <em>Virginia Pharmacy, </em>it set aside the Commission\u2019s order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cThe Commission, like any governmental agency, must start from the premise that any prior restraint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>is suspect, and that a remedy, even for deceptive advertising, can go no further than is necessary for the elimination of the deception. The Commission\u2019s order proscribing use of the term instant tax refund or any other word or words of similar import or meaning, without consideration of the context in which the words appear, went further than was permitted for that purpose and was an abuse of the Commission\u2019s remedial discretion. It cannot in that form and without such consideration be affirmed or enforced.\u201d 542 F. 2d at 620.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The court concluded that the Commission, in failing to \u201cconsider fully the feasibility of requiring merely that advertising copy be rewritten in lieu of total excision of the offending language,\u201d had exceeded its remedial authority. 542 F. 2d at 619. <em>Cf., U. S. v. National Soc. of Professional Engineers, </em>555 F. 2d 978, 984 (D.C. Cir. 1977) <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>435 U. S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978) (striking down as overbroad an order requiring the Society to state that competitive bidding is not an unethical practice). Because the free flow of truthful information is protected by the first amendment, the courts require remedial relief for proved deceptions to be as narrow as possible. Similarly, the Supreme Court struck down a state ban on attorney advertising, and rejected the argument that all such advertising is inherently misleading. <em>See Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U. S. 350, 384, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977), where the Court acknowledged that supplementation, such as a warning or disclaimer, might be necessary in some circumstances to assure that consumers are not misled, but held that advertising by attorneys may not be subjected to blanket suppression. <em>See also Carey v. Population Services Intern., </em>431 U. S. 678, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977) (A total prohibition on advertisement or display of contraceptives is unconstitutional.); <em>Linmark Assoc., Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, </em>431 U. S. 85, 97 S. Ct. 1614, 52 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977) (Township\u2019s vital goal of promoting integrated housing does not justify banning \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs, because of an unsubstantiated belief that the impact of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>signs might be detrimental. The ordinance was not shown to be necessary to achieve the township\u2019s goal.).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The Board\u2019s contention that \u00a7 14 (e) does not prevent Comprehensive from advertising the services it may legally offer is contradicted by the fact that Comprehensive, although permitted to engage in simple accounting services under the statute, has been enjoined from describing these services to the public as \u201caccounting.\u201d To prevent the possibility of public confusion and deception, the legislature cannot consistent with the first amendment choose the most drastic remedy \u2014 the complete suppression of the use of certain words to describe the lawful activity of non-certified accountants. In these circumstances, \u00a7 14 (e)\u2019s prohibition on a non-certified accountant\u2019s use of the words \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting\u201d is inconsistent with the rationale of <em>Virginia Pharmacy. </em>As there has been no showing by the State that a compelling need underlies the enactment of \u00a7 14 (e), that provision violates Comprehensive\u2019s first amendment free speech rights. Accordingly, the injunction issued against Comprehensive\u2019s holding itself out to the public as \u201caccountant\u201d and describing the services it performs as \u201caccounting\u201d must be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aq4\">. Prior to its amendment by ch. 677 of the Acts of 1970, \u00a7 15 (e) listed \u201cother accounting services\u201d among those specified \u201cbookkeeping and tax services\u201d which uncertified persons were permitted to offer to the public. The term \u201cother accounting services\u201d was deleted by ch. 677 from \u00a7 15 (e); in its place the present words \u201csimilar services\u201d were substituted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
