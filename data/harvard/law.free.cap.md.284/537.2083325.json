J., joins at page 563 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We are here concerned with whether use of the racially derogatory term \u201cjungle bunnies\u201d by a teacher in referring to certain junior high school pupils amounts to misconduct in office within the meaning of then Maryland Code (1957,1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 77, \u00a7 114.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall here hold that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusions drawn by the administrative agency, that the agency made no error of law in determining that the statements made constituted misconduct in office, and that under the facts and circumstances of this case appellant, John Resetar, Jr. (Resetar), was properly discharged as a teacher by the Board of Education of Montgomery County (the County Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Resetar was advised by the Superintendent of Schools of Montgomery County (the County Superintendent) that a remark made by him to a group of junior high school students \u201cmight be interpreted as being intemperate under the circumstances and might be interpreted as having a racial connotation.\u201d The County Superintendent said he considered Resetar\u2019s conduct to be contrary to the County Board\u2019s \u201cPolicy Statement on Human Relations,\u201d as \u201ceducationally unsound and unprofessional, and [as such could] not be accepted by [the Montgomery County] school system as proper behavior by an employee.\u201d He told Resetar that, since he regarded the conduct in question to be contrary to Art. 77, \u00a7 114, he would recommend to the County Board that Resetar be dismissed. In his letter to Resetar the County Superintendent referred to the fact that Resetar had \u201cbeen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>warned both formally and informally, while a staff member at [three different junior high schools] about making remarks to students and/or fellow staff members which were not only intemperate and overreactive, but which also, in some instances, had derogatory, racial, or ethnic connotations.\u201d The County Superintendent said that in making his recommendation for dismissal he took into consideration \u201cthe cumulative effect of [Resetar\u2019s] behavior in [his] previous assignments despite earlier warnings that this type language and behavior was inappropriate and could not be condoned ....\u201d He told Resetar of his right to request a hearing before the County Board, which hearing was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Art. 77, \u00a7 114 then provided for suspension or dismissal of a teacher by a county board on the recommendation of its county superintendent of schools on the grounds of \u201cimmorality, misconduct in office, insubordination, incompetency, or wilful neglect of duty....\u201d Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Yol., 1974 Cum. Supp.) Art. 77, \u00a7 114A, as then in effect, authorized the County Board to have a hearing examiner for the taking of testimony under \u00a7 114. A hearing was duly held. The hearing examiner said in pertinent part in his findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">The event giving rise to the charges occurred on June 18,1974. During the school year 1973-1974 Mr. Resetar was a seventh grade science teacher____ June 18th was the last day of school. Mr. Resetar closed the windows in the classroom to which he was assigned to make the room secure for the summer, after all the students were out of the building. Another teacher ... used the same classroom and was present in it at the time. Also present was ... [the] secretary to the principal. A group of perhaps 15 to 25 students was standing on the school grounds outside. While some of the students were directing insulting and obscene remarks to Mr. Resetar, Randolph Tootle, an assistant principal of the school, came along. The testimony of Mr. Resetar, [the other teacher], [the secretary], and Mr. Tootle is essentially the/same, except for the opened or closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>state of the windows and the audibility of what Mr. Resetar said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">Mr. Resetar testified that he opened a window as Mr. Tootle came along and said, as closely as he can remember it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201cMr. Tootle this is what I have reference to. This is what I mean when I have been coming to you for some aid for both the students and myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar8\">This remark relates back to the fact that Mr. Resetar on a number of occasions during the year had referred disciplinary problems involving some of the same students to Mr. Tootle. Mr. Resetar then said to himself, as closely as he can remember it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaR\">\u201cLook at those jungle bunnies. Somebody ought to feed them bananas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">Mr. Resetar testified that he closed the window immediately after speaking to Mr. Tootle, so that all the windows were closed before he made the jungle bunny remark. He believed that it was \u201chumanly impossible\u201d for anyone outside the window to hear him. He was speaking only to himself, and did not intend for [the other teacher] and [the secretary] to hear him either. He characterized his remark as a \u201cmumble,\u201d reflecting his disgust and frustration with the attitude of these students throughout the year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">As it turned out, however, Mr. Tootle and some of the students did hear the jungle bunny remark. Mr. Tootle testified that he heard it, and that several girls asked him if he was going to do anything about it. Further, one of the students called back to Mr. Resetar something to the effect of, \u201cGo ahead on big head.\u201d It was also Mr. Tootle\u2019s recollection that two of the classroom windows were opened, while others were closed. With respect to Mr. Resetar\u2019s tone of voice, Mr. Tootle\u2019s recollection was:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cA little louder than a conversational tone because he had to get my attention from where I was over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>some of the noise that was being made by the students out there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">He was not shouting, and his tone of voice did not indicate that he was particularly angry or upset. On cross-examination, Mr. Tootle agreed that Mr. Resetar\u2019s tone of voice could be characterized as \u201cbantering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">[The other teacherl testified that there were students in the hallways as well as outdoors, fairly noisy as they called their good-byes. She thought all of the windows were opened. She was unable to characterize Mr. Resetar\u2019s tone of voice as conversational or louder, because \u201cMr. Resetar speaks louder than most of us and it would be difficult to say.\u201d She did not know whether anybody heard the jungle bunny comment or not, but thought that there were students who could have heard it if they were paying attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">[The secretary] testified that at least one window in the room was opened, and that Mr. Resetar was leaning toward it and speaking through the opened window. Following the jungle bunny remark, she testified that Mr. Tootle looked up and that at least two of the students called back some retaliatory remarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The evidence adduced before the County Board\u2019s examiner included the bases for the earlier warnings to Resetar. This hearing examiner discussed those situations in his conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">I conclude that the other episodes that are the subject of the charges also reflect varying degrees of intemperate conduct. I consider .the lunchroom conversation to be on the trivial side. Of course, casting aspersions on school staff members is not to be encouraged; but then, supposedly private lunch table conversation among men should not be too closely scrutinized. Mr. Resetar appears to have been careless on this occasion, and probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>habitually so, as to who might be listening to his disparaging comments. But the incident, standing by itself, would not, in my opinion, constitute misconduct. Calling the guidance counselor a \u201cGod damned liar\u201d must be classified as intemperate and over-reactive to the counselor\u2019s sarcastic remark. This unfortunately turned a minor annoyance into a serious conflict. But the fault was not entirely Mr. Resetar\u2019s. The superintendent determined that one or both of these incidents constituted misconduct, and issued a letter of reprimand in 1972.1 conclude the lunchroom comments should not be classed as misconduct, but I am inclined to agree with the superintendent to the extent that the liar accusation barely goes across the misconduct threshold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">In telling the student she was dirty, or words to that effect, Mr. Resetar was intemperate. There may be occasions when a teacher would consider it to be beneficial to suggest to a child improved habits of personal care, but this does not appear to have been such a case. Mr. Resetar initially spoke sarcastically to a noisy student, and then responded to the impertinence of the accompanying student with a personal affront. I conclude that this was misconduct, but not aggravated. Mr. Resetar\u2019s tirade against the disruptive boys in the presence of the office staff and the school visitor was intemperate, but, in my opinion, would not by itself amount to misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The hearing examiner discussed the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d incident in his conclusions, saying, \u201c[TJhere was misbehavior on the part of a group of students, directed toward Mr. Resetar. However, I conclude it was intemperance, rising to the level of misconduct, for Mr. Resetar to respond with a racial epithet.\u201d In his recommendation the examiner pointed to his conclusion \u201cthat three instances of intemperate conduct amounting to misconduct ha[d] been shown,\u201d said that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of the incidents also \u201cconstitute[d] misconduct in violation of the Human Relations Policy,\u201d and then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">I believe that no one of these cases, standing by itself, is sufficiently extreme to warrant dismissal of the teacher. It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether such a pattern of inappropriate behavior exists as to aggravate the particular offenses to the point where the sanction of dismissal is warranted. From the standpoint of racial bias, I have concluded that no such pattern has been shown. With respect to intemperate outbursts, however, such a pattern has been shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">The case is a close one, since only the jungle bunny episode is particularly serious. Yet the pattern of intemperate conduct has been persistent. There have been official warnings to this effect and a more gentle suggestion that \u201che maintain his professional composure.\u201d But the pattern has persisted during the 1973-1974 school year ..., culminating in the jungle bunny case. For this reason, I recommend that the superintendent\u2019s recommendation be adopted and that Mr. Resetar be dismissed for misconduct in office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The County Board held a hearing at which Resetar and his counsel were present. It ordered Resetar\u2019s dismissal for misconduct in office. The County Board noted, however, that its \u201cschedule did not permit it to hear ... argument [in the case] within 30 days as set forth in its rules.\u201d Therefore, it directed Resetar\u2019s reinstatement \u201cto pay for the period of March 27 to April 10, 1975,\u201d the date of its hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">As was his right under \u00a7 114, Resetar appealed to the State Board of Education (the State Board). At the time here relevant its powers were set forth in Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.) Art. 77, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They include \u201cexplaining] the true intent and meaning of the law, and ... deciding] all controversies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>and disputes that arise under it...The matter came on for hearing before the State Board\u2019s hearing examiner. The parties agreed that the transcript of testimony before the County Board\u2019s examiner should be introduced into evidence and considered by the State Board\u2019s examiner in addition to the testimony of the live witnesses. A number of persons testified, all of whom had testified below. The State Board\u2019s examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">After having carefully considered all of the evidence at the hearing <em>de novo, </em>including the transcript of the hearing below, I have reached the same findings, conclusions and recommendations as did [the County Board\u2019s] Hearing Examiner---Accordingly, I adopt them as my own and incorporate his entire report herein by reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">He considered Resetar\u2019s contention that the failure of the County Board to issue an opinion within 30 days of the receipt of its hearing examiner\u2019s memorandum and opinion as provided by its own rules vitiated its order. He said that \u201cthere was no showing that the [County] Board had purposely delayed its decision in order to injure [Resetar],\u201d and there was no \u201cshowing that [Resetar] had been materially disadvantaged in seeking employment in the teaching field or otherwise.\u201d He concluded on that issue, \u201c[I]f there was procedural error, it was not prejudicial....\u201d He said he gave careful consideration \u201cwhether to recommend suspension of Mr. Resetar, rather than the more drastic step of dismissal.\u201d The examiner then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">I would have been inclined to make such a recommendation had I been able to find, either (1) that Mr. Resetar had not previously been put on notice that his pattern of conduct was intemperate, or (2) that there was a reasonably good chance that, chastened by the experience of this case, he would control his intemperateness in the future. Unfortunately, neither finding was possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">As to (1), Mr. Resetar had received an official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>reprimand in a letter dated December 8, 1972 from [the County Superintendent] after he had been placed on leave with salary during investigation of allegations of inappropriate personal conduct at [another] [s]chool. (\u201cYour language use was inappropriate and cannot be condoned. Any future behavior on your part along these lines will not be tolerated.\u201d) Mr. Resetar had also been cautioned in writing on March 7, 1973, and on May 17, 1973, by the Assistant Principal of [a third] [s]chool about his unprofessional manner of disciplining school children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">As to (2), the entire record leaves an unmistakable impression that respondent simply does not have the temperament to cope with present-day conditions in the Montgomery County School system. In view of the likelihood of a recurrence of his intemperate conduct, any attempt to reinject him into that system would not be fair t\u00f3 the students, teachers and administrators, or even to himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The State Board adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">An appeal to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County followed. That court affirmed. Resetar then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted the writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In this Court Resetar contends: (1) the circuit court erred in refusing to permit him to present additional evidence; (2) it likewise erred in \u201cfinding and determining that there was sufficient evidence to warrant [his] dismissal... as a tenured teacher in the Montgomery County school system\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]he alleged statement attributed to [Resetar] involving a statement of racial connotation did not constitute an act of misconduct\u201d warranting his dismissal; and (4) the County Board \u201cwas precluded from dismissing [him] for misconduct in office after reinstating him as a tenured teacher in the school system for the period of March 27 to April 10, 1975.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">We first address the issue of whether the apparent violation by the County Board of its own rule has the effect of rendering void its action of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The County Board\u2019s rule relative to hearings before an examiner states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Hearing Examiner shall be distributed to or mailed to the parties and the Board of Education not more than fifteen (15) days after the completion of the hearing and receipt of the transcript or the filing of briefs if required or authorized. The Board shall review this material and render a decision in each case within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The question of whether a statutory provision using the word \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory or directory \u201cturns upon the intention of the Legislature as gathered from the nature of the subject matter and the purposes to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hitchins v. City of Cumberland, </em>215 Md. 315, 323, 138 A. 2d 359 (1958). As was said in <em>Blumenthal v. Clerk of Cir. Ct., </em>278 Md. 398, 408, 365 A. 2d 279 (1976), \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 is not treated as signifying a mandatory intent if the context in which it is used indicates otherwise [citing cases].\u201d Chief Judge McSherry observed for our predecessors in <em>Upshur v. Baltimore City, </em>94 Md. 743, 51 A. 953 (1902):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">The last sentence of <em>sec. 29, Art. 3 </em>of the Constitution, provides: \u201cAnd whenever the General Assembly shall enact any Public General Law, not amendatory of any section, or article of the said Code, <em>it shall be the duty </em>of the General Assembly to enact the same, in articles and sections, in the same manner, as the Code is arranged.\u201d This provision though containing the imperative word <em>shall </em>and though imposing an explicit <em>duty, </em>was held by this Court to be <em>directory, </em>and a law passed without the observance of that requirement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>upheld. <em>Co. Coms. v. Meekins, </em>50 Md. [28,] 45 [(1878)]. It is not disputed that cases may be found where, owing to peculiar conditions, the word \u201cdirect\u201d has been held to impose a mandatory duty. Such, for instance, is the case <em>Mayor, &amp;c., v. Reitz, </em>50 Md. 574 [(1879)]. But mere words do not control. The whole surroundings, the purposes of the enactment, the ends to be accomplished, the consequences that may result from one meaning rather than from another, and the cardinal rule that seemingly incongruous provisions shall be made to harmonize rather than conflict, <em>(New Lamp Ch. Co. v. Ansonia Co., </em>91 U.S. 656, [23 L. Ed. 336 (1876),]) must all be considered in determining whether particular words shall have a mandatory or a directory effect ascribed to them. <em>[Id. </em>at 757 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">More recently in <em>Director v. Cash, </em>269 Md. 331, 345, 305 A. 2d 833 (1973), <em>cert. denied sub. nom. Vucci v. Boslow, </em>414 U. S. 1136 (1974), and in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 533, 325 A. 2d 718 (1974), we have regarded as significant the fact that the language of the statute under consideration provided no penalty for failure to act within the time prescribed, although we observed in the latter instance that this was not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Maryland Constitution Art. IV, \u00a7 15 provides that opinions of this Court \u201cshall be filed within three months after the argument, or submission of the cause .. . .\u201d Art. IV, \u00a7 23 specifies that judges of the circuit courts \u201cshall render their decisions . . . within two months\u201d after cases have been argued or submitted to them. In <em>McCall\u2019s Ferry Co. v. Price, </em>108 Md. 96, 69 A. 832 (1908), our predecessors Were faced with a motion for reargument on the ground that the Court\u2019s opinion was not filed within three months. The Court said it \u201chestitate[d] to refer to the reasons for not filing [its] opinion sooner, and suppose[d] they were understood, but deem[ed] it proper in view of [the motion] to briefly state them.\u201d It observed that the judge to whom the case had been assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>had \u201cprepared the opinion as promptly as the character of the case permitted ... but before it was adopted by the Court, he was overtaken by a serious illness ....\u201d The opinion which he had prepared was circulated among the judges of the Court while he was still in the hospital. Some members of the Court, although concurring in the law as announced in the opinion, had \u201csome questions of fact which required further communication with him before filing the opinion, as written, or making any alterations in it, as courtesy and practice of this Court demanded.\u201d Therefore, a per curiam order was filed affirming the judgment but stating that the Court\u2019s opinion would be filed later \u201cas has been the practice of this Court, when the circumstances justified and required that course.\u201d In overruling the motion for reargument the observation was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">So far as we are aware, it has always been the opinion of the members of this Court that the clause is merely directory, and not mandatory, and hence the Court has not hesitated when circumstances required it to file opinions after the three months. It has for example sometimes at its final sittings at the April Term (usually in June) when for some satisfactory reason no opinion had been adopted, affirmed cases by <em>per curiam </em>orders, and filed opinions at the following October Term. The object of the constitutional provision is to have prompt decisions of causes, and no one can justly complain of unnecessary delay by this Court in filing opinions and deciding cases before it. It certainly would not be within either the letter or the spirit of this provision to grant a reargument, because an opinion had not been filed within three months \u2014 thereby causing further delay. <em>[Id. </em>at 113.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Judge Singley said for the Court in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Hirsch, </em>274 Md. 368, 374, 335 A. 2d 108, <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U. S. 1012 (1975), concerning the constitutional requirement pertaining to circuit courts and their opinions, \u201cWe have long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>held these provisions to be directory and-not mandatory,\u201d citing <em>Davidson v. Katz, </em>254 Md. 69, 78-79, 255 A. 2d 49 (1969), and <em>Pressley v. Warden, </em>242 Md. 405, 406-07, 219 A. 2d 25 (1966). To this list could be added <em>Myers v. State, </em>218 Md. 49, 51, 145 A. 2d 228 (1958); <em>Suttleman v. Bd. of Liq. Lic. Com\u2019rs., </em>209 Md. 134, 140, 120 A. 2d 388 (1956); and <em>Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>186 Md. 360, 370, 46 A. 2d 607 (1946). Judge Henderson observed for the Court in <em>Snyder </em>that the constitutional provision \u201cprovides no penalty for failure to act within the time prescribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The County Board\u2019s regulation provides no penalty and makes no provision in the event of a violation of the limit imposed. Resetar has suffered no prejudice. He received pay which he might not otherwise have received. The delay was brief. We are of the view that neither the delay nor the temporary reinstatement had the effect of stripping the County Board of authority to dismiss Resetar. The purpose of the provision no doubt was, as said by the Court in <em>McCall\u2019s Ferry, </em>\u201cto have prompt decisions of causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">At the time applicable to this proceeding authority for the presentation of additional evidence at a hearing of an administrative appeal was found in Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (e) and Maryland Rule B10. The latter provides merely that additional evidence may be allowed when permitted by law. The code provision permits the presentation of such evidence upon application to the court \u201cbefore the date set for hearing\u201d and a showing \u201cto the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the <em>agency.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The trial judge made repeated attempts to ascertain precisely what Resetar expected to prove by the additional testimony. Resetar\u2019s counsel appeared to indicate that through certain witnesses, many of whom testified at the County Board and State Board hearings, he would prove a conspiracy against Resetar and that school officials in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>counties had been given unfavorable comments relative to Resetar. It was pointed out by the County Board that different counsel for Resetar at the State Board hearing had raised the conspiracy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The matter was taken under advisement by the trial judge. In ultimately ruling on the motion he indicated he had examined the entire transcript from the two hearings and read all of the exhibits. He pointed out that of the witnesses Resetar desired to call \u201ctwelve ... testified in the County proceeding and eleven of the same twelve testified in the State proceeding. There was ample opportunity afforded [Resetar] in both of those hearings to present testimony; in one of them he did and the other he didn\u2019t.\u201d The court observed that Resetar had since changed lawyers but \u201cthat this mere fact that he has changed lawyers, and the new lawyer now sees some holes in the case presented by the first lawyer, doesn\u2019t support a motion for new evidence____\u201d Accordingly, he ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">There is no new evidence proffered which would relate to the jurisdiction or integrity of the proceedings below. The complaints that are made in these regards are based on matters that are already in the record and can be argued on the merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">The evidence proffered by the conspiracy issue is not relevant and the reason it is not relevant is because if the evidence is sufficient to support dismissal, the fact that it was produced by the combined efforts of two or more people working together is irrelevant on the issue of dismissal. There is nothing illegal or improper in persons working together to prepare testimony providing they don\u2019t suborn perjury.

In other words, the fact that people, assuming that proper testimony would support what it\u2019s offered for, the mere fact that somebody is coerced to testify \u2014 anytime you issue a subpoena a man is coerced to testify, if you wish to carry it that far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">The issue is whether the testimony is true or false, not that it was produced by a combination of things because somebody told him he had to testify or make a report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">Consequently, I don\u2019t regard any proffers in that respect to be relevant. This is quite aside from the fact that the so-called conspiracy issue was raised in the State hearing and while the appellant doesn\u2019t approve of the manner in which the questions were asked and answered, he was there; he had a right to produce his witnesses and had counsel; and didn't choose to do so, didn\u2019t choose to contest it, and it is not proper to try by the back door method to get in and simply retry all of the issues which have been tried already.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">The argument that the testimony received below was insufficient in that it was either hearsay or too far removed is not relevant again on the issue of offering new evidence.

We recently discussed the matter of abuse of discretion at some length in <em>Mathias v. State, </em>284 Md. 22, 394 A. 2d 292 (1978). In the words of Chief Judge Marbury for our predecessors in <em>Northwest\u2019n Nat. Ins. Co. v. Rosoff, </em>195 Md. 421, 436, 73 A. 2d 461 (1950), discretionary rulings \u201cshould only be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We shall discuss together the issues as framed by Resetar as to whether he was guilty of misconduct in office and whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">It must be borne in mind that under Code (1957,1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 255 the circuit court in reviewing the action of the State Board was limited to ascertaining whether it was in violation of constitutional provisions; in excess of its statutory authority or jurisdiction; made upon unlawful procedure; affected by other error of law; unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; against the weight of competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record; unsupported by the entire record; or arbitrary or capricious. It follows that our review is likewise so limited. As Judge Singley put it for the Court in <em>Oxon Hill Rec. Club v. Water Res. Adm., </em>281 Md. 110, 375 A. 2d 567 (1977), citing a number of cases and other authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">[O]ur review of actions taken or determinations made by an administrative agency ... is narrowly limited.

Even challenges directed at the substantiality of the evidence must be tested by standards of arbitrariness and <em>capriciousness____[Id. </em>at 113.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Chief Judge Murphy observed for the Court in <em>Zeitschel v. Board of Education, </em>274 Md. 69, 82, 332 A. 2d 906 (1975), \u201c[A] court should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the administrative agency from which an appeal is taken, <em>Grosman v.

Board of Education, </em>245 Md. 464, 226 A. 2d 243 (1967).\u201d Chief Judge Hammond pointed out for the Court in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 236 A. 2d 282 (1967), citing cases and authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">[J]udicial review [of the action of an administrative agency] essentially should be limited to whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. This need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment. <em>[Id. </em>at 309-10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Resetar says, \u201cThe State Board of Education of Maryland\u2019s Hearing Examiner, in an act of utter adjudicative indecency, abandoned his duty and responsibility to formulate, out of his own mind, his detailed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of decision; and, instead, merely adopted the findings, conclusions and decision detailed and given by the County ... Board\u2019s Hearing Examiner ... who had heard the case earlier.\u201d We find no impropriety on the part of the State Board\u2019s hearing examiner in this instance. The testimony before the State Board was virtually identical with that before the County Board. The careful consideration given by the State Board\u2019s examiner to the evidence adduced is indicated by the portion of his conclusions and recommendations to the State Board which we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">It is suggested by Resetar that some of the testimony of certain witnesses produced by the County Board at the hearing before its hearing examiner so conflicts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>testimony of those same witnesses before the State Board\u2019s hearing examiner as to cause it to lack probative force. Resetar failed in his brief in this Court to point out these conflicts. At oral argument we probed repeatedly for specification of the conflicts. No citation of conflicts has yet been given. Surely we are not obliged to search the testimony looking for conflicts. It is the duty of the challenger, Resetar in this instance, to point out any conflicts which would cause the testimony to lack probative force. However, we have meticulously examined the testimony of the witnesses mentioned at oral argument as having contradicted themselves. We found no such contradictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">From reading the testimony of some of the witnesses on behalf of the County Superintendent and noting some of their evasions in response to questions on behalf of Resetar one might draw an inference of bias on the part of many of them toward Resetar. The matter of credibility, however, in each instance was for the hearing examiner who not only had the opportunity to hear the witnesses but also had the opportunity to observe their demeanor on the witness stand. Each of the examiners has been meticulously fair in his findings of fact. The findings of each of them are amply supported by the record. Moreover, it is significant here that Resetar does not deny the occurrence of the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d incident. He merely takes issue with the interpretation which should be put on it. He says he is not racially biased. The principal of his school said in his contacts with Resetar he found no reason to believe him to be guilty of racial prejudice. Resetar\u2019s attorney succeeded in eliciting from the member of the school staff who was in the immediate presence of the students to whom the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d remark was addressed an admission that it might have been given in a bantering manner, as has been pointed out in the quotation from the hearing examiner\u2019s report. The manner in which it was given, however, does not erase the fact that the statement was made. In this instance we have no difficulty in concluding that a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The State Board under Art. 77, \u00a7 6 is vested with authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>to \u201cexplain the true intent and meaning of the [school] law, and [to] decide all controversies and disputes that arise under it,\u201d with \u201ctheir decision [being] final----\u201d Judge Henderson said for the Court in <em>Wilson v. Board of Education, </em>234 Md. 561, 565, 200 A. 2d 67 (1964), that the totality of the various statutory provisions concerning the State Board \u201cquite plainly ... invests the State Board with the last word on any matter concerning educational policy or the administration of the system of public education.\u201d Judge Alvey said for our predecessors in <em>Wiley v. School Comm\u2019rs, </em>51 Md. 401, 406 (1879), that the State Board\u2019s authority constitutes \u201ca visitatorial power of the most comprehensive character . . . .\u201d Cases in which this rule has been recognized and followed include <em>School Comm. of Car. Co. v. Breeding, </em>126 Md. 83, 89, 94 A. 328 (1915); <em>School Commissioners v. Morris, </em>123 Md. 398, 402-03, 91 A. 718 (1914); <em>Underwood v. School Board, </em>103 Md. 181, 188, 63 A. 221 (1906); and <em>Shober v. Cochrane, </em>53 Md. 544, 549 (1880). However, its powers are not without limit. In <em>Wiley </em>the Court pointed out that the power might not \u201cbe corruptly and fraudulently used,\u201d a statement quoted in <em>Coddington v. Helbig, </em>195 Md. 330, 337, 73 A. 2d 454 (1950). It follows, therefore, that its visitatorial power may not be exercised fraudulently, in bad faith, or in breach of trust. Also, the State Board does not have the. power to decide purely legal issues. <em>School Comm\u2019nrs. v. Henkel, </em>117 Md. 97, 105, 83 A. 89 (1912), and <em>Duer v. Dashiell, </em>91 Md. 660, 671, 47 A. 1040 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We have found no prior Maryland case which has addressed the question of whether certain conduct on the part of a teacher might or might not be misconduct in office. We find little help beyond the confines of the State. For instance, the annotations concerning teachers in 78 A.L.R.3d 19, 83, and 117 (1977), deal with sexual conduct, insubordination, and unauthorized absences, respectively. Causes for dismissal discussed in 68 Am. Jur.2d <em>Schools </em>\u00a7\u00a7 162-66, 170-71, and 174-82 (1973), are such issues as incompetency, unprofessional conduct, insubordination, disloyalty, political activity, union membership or activity, and publicly criticizing school officials. The immorality issues are concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>intemperance, gambling, financial unresponsibility, dishonesty, fraud, and use of profane language. 78 C.J.S. <em>Schools and School Districts </em>\u00a7 202 (1952), states, \u201cGood cause sufficient for removal of a teacher may consist of any cause that renders him unfit to be a teacher in the public school, so that the best interests of the school require that he should be removed or dismissed.\u201d The same section further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">Among the causes which, either under statute or contract or as a proper exercise of discretionary power by the school board, have been held sufficient to constitute grounds for dismissal of a teacher ... are included insubordination or violation of the rules and regulations of the school board; lack of cooperation; inability or incompetency; lack of efficiency in teaching or discipline; negligence in discharge of, or inattention to, duty; willful and persistent negligence; membership in a subversive organization or engaging in subversive activities; refusal to waive immunity in appearing or testifying before a court or legislative committee; or improper conduct, or, according to other decisions on the question, immoral, or unprofessional conduct. <em>\\Id. </em>at 1081-83 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As might be expected, courts have widely differed as to just what conduct on the part of a teacher will warrant dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Fisher v. Snyder, </em>476 F. 2d 375 (8th Cir. 1973) (A 55-year old divorced woman because of the lack of suitable motel accommodations permitted male friends of her son to stay overnight in her small apartment.

He observed a number of acts of sexual intercourse on the part of various members.

Superintending Sch. Com., City of Portland, supra, </em>has relevance here since the court in reaching its conclusion there insisted that to be grounds for dismissal the act must bear upon a teacher\u2019s fitness to teach, as did the California court in <em>Morrison v. State Board of Education, supra. </em>Bearing in mind the grant of power by the General Assembly to the State Board to \u201cexplain the true intent and meaning of the [school] law,\u201d we are of the view that the State Board could well have concluded that the remark of the teacher here might undermine his future classroom performance and overall impact on his students, to paraphrase the language used in <em>Wright. </em>Accordingly, we find no error of law on the part of the State Board in its conclusion that the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d episode constituted misconduct in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In meting out punishment in a criminal case judges constantly take into consideration the record of the accused. A first-time offender often will receive treatment different from that of a hardened criminal for the same act. Were we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>in this case to hold either that the acts of Resetar did not amount to misconduct in office or that the State Board was arbitrary and capricious in upholding Resetar\u2019s dismissal because it took into consideration the prior record of Resetar, we might well find ourselves accused, as was the majority in <em>Norton v. Macy, </em>417 F. 2d 1161, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1969), of \u201cviolatfing] the judicial cloister erected by the Administrative Procedure Act and rush[ing] out, robes flying, into the forbidden area of administrative discretion to give kind assistance to the subject of what [we might believe] to be [improper] tactics at the hands of the [administrative agency].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">We have found that there was a sufficient predicate for the State Board\u2019s findings of fact and that it properly found Resetar\u2019s conduct to amount to misconduct in office within the meaning of the statute. We have further found that the State Board was not guilty of arbitrary, capricious or illegal conduct when it took the prior reprimands to Resetar into consideration in meting out punishment \u2014 any more than it would have been arbitrary if because of a teacher\u2019s prior unblemished record it concluded that such conduct warranted a punishment less than the ultimate sanction of dismissal. That leaves us with the question, however, of whether dismissal in this instance was action so harsh as to amount to arbitrary and capricious action on the part of the State Board. It is impossible to catalogue just what would or would not constitute arbitrary action on the part of an administrative agency such as the State Board in imposing sanctions, since each situation must be judged on its own facts. Certainly the agency is obliged to take the factual setting and circumstances of the misconduct into consideration, as was done here. If, for example, the teacher here had merely uttered the racial epithet relative to the students under his breath so that it was heard only by a colleague of the teacher\u2019s race standing next to him, a reviewing court might determine dismissal to be so harsh a sanction as to be arbitrary conduct, while no question of arbitrariness would arise if dismissal were ordered because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>a teacher directed such an epithet at a student then in the process of reciting in the teacher\u2019s class.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">We can conceive of situations in which dismissal for a single act of misconduct by a teacher possessed of an otherwise clean record might be held upon judicial review to be arbitrary and capricious. Since there had been prior admonitions by the County Board to Resetar, we point out that in this case we are not obliged to decide what the result might have been had Resetar\u2019s prior record been without blemish.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In reviewing the action of an administrative agency, so long as we do not find it to have been arbitrary or capricious in the sanction imposed, we are not permitted to specify a sanction which we might have considered more appropriate. As held by this Court in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat'l Bureau, supra, </em>in reviewing the action of an administrative agency we must not engage in judicial fact-finding or substitute our judgment for that of the agency. In this instance we find no arbitrary conduct on the part of the administrative agency, the State Board. Accordingly, we find no grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">.

He was informed that a review of his employment was to be made upon completion of an administrative investigation \u201cconcerning the alleged charge that [he] made a remark to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>a group of students at Gaithersburg Junior High School which might be interpreted as being intemperate under the circumstances and might be interpreted as having a racial connotation.\u201d The investigation was conducted, and by letter dated 16 September 1974 Resetar was notified that the Superintendent would recommend his \u201cdismissal from service in the Montgomery County Public Schools to the Board of Education under the provisions of Article 77, Section 114, of the Public School Laws of Maryland upon the grounds of misconduct in office and insubordination.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The effective date of the dismissal was to be October 11, 1974, and he was to remain on leave with salary through that date. The letter stated that the County Board would act upon the recommendation at its meeting on 8 October unless Resetar requested a hearing before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Resetar requested a hearing, and the County Board referred the matter to a hearing examiner. Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.) art. 77, \u00a7 114A. The examiner conducted a plenary hearing and recommended that the Superintendent\u2019s recommendation be adopted. The County Board heard argument and issued a decision and order on 14 April 1975 dismissing Resetar as of 10 April 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Resetar appealed to the State Board of Education (the State Board). There was a <em>de novo </em>hearing before the hearing examiner for the State Board, who recommended that Resetar be dismissed. The State Board followed that recommendation. Resetar appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. It affirmed the judgment of the State Board. Resetar appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari before decision by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The County Board hearing examiner submitted a lengthy report which prevailed through all that followed. It served as the basis for Resetar\u2019s dismissal by the County Board and for the various determinations regarding the propriety of the dismissal in the subsequent appeal proceedings. The County Board adopted \u201cthe findings, conclusions and recommendations of [its] hearing examiner.\u201d The State Board hearing examiner, \u201cafter having carefully considered all of the evidence at the hearing <em>de novo, </em>including the transcript of the hearing below,... reached the same findings, conclusions and recommendations as did [the County Board examiner],\u201d and adopted them as his own.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He incorporated the County Board examiner\u2019s \u201centire report by reference\u201d in his report to the State Board. The State Board\u2019s opinion stated simply: \u201cWe hereby adopt the Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations of the Hearing Examiner in this case.\u201d The Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed \u201cthe decision of the State Board ... which adopted the County Board\u2019s decision to terminate [Resetar\u2019s] services in the Montgomery County School system for misconduct in office ...\u201d because \u201c[t]he record below fully supports the findings adopted by the State Board... as well as those of the County Board.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the circuit court accepted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the State Board, which adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its examiner, who adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the County Board, which adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its examiner. So, it is the findings and conclusions of the County Board hearing examiner, considered in light of the evidence adduced at both hearings, which must be evaluated in determining whether the Circuit Court for Montgomery County properly affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>judgment of the State Board dismissing Resetar from the Montgomery County school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The Superintendent\u2019s letter of 16 September 1974 to Resetar served as the required written statement of charges. The letter focused on a remark Resetar was alleged to have made to a group of students at Gaithersburg Junior High School. The Superintendent did not set out exactly what Resetar said, merely characterizing the remark, as he did in his letter of 9 August 1974 placing Resetar on leave, as one \u201cwhich might be interpreted as being intemperate under the circumstances and might be interpreted as having a racial connotation.\u201d He deemed the remark to be \u201ceducationally unsound and unprofessional,\u201d and not acceptable \u201cby this school system as proper behavior by an employee.\u201d He asserted that by making the remark, Resetar had violated the Policy Statement on Human Relations adopted by the Montgomery County Board of Education, which stated in part that \u201c. . . a fundamental goal of the Montgomery County Public Schools is to establish and maintain an atmosphere in which students and staff can develop attitudes for effective, cooperative living, including\u201d respect for the individual, cultural differences, economic, political and social rights of others, and the right of others to seek and maintain their own identities. The letter noted that Resetar had been \u201cwarned both formally and informally\u201d while a staff member at the school and several other junior high schools \u201cabout making remarks to students and/or fellow staff members which were not only intemperate and overreactive, but which also, in some instances, had derogatory, racial or ethnic connotations.\u201d The recommendation of dismissal, according to the Superintendent, was the result of an investigation conducted regarding the alleged remark, a conference with Resetar, and \u201cthe cumulative effect of your behavior in your previous assignments despite earlier warnings that this type of language and behavior was inappropriate and could not be condoned----\u201d The County Board examiner thought that \u201c[t]he letter charges Mr. Resetar with misconduct in office consisting of intemperate behavior and making remarks with derogatory racial connotations,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he letter also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>charges insubordination consisting of violation of the Board of Education Policy Statement on Human Relations and of failing to conform his behavior to warnings previously issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The County Board examiner found that the allegation of insubordination had not been sustained.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There remained the charge of misconduct in office which was bottomed upon \u201cintemperate behavior and making remarks with derogatory racial connotations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The remark made by Resetar which was the crux of the letter of 16 September 1974 and which, in fact, led to the charges set forth in the letter, occurred on 18 June 1974 while he was a seventh grade science teacher at Gaithersburg Junior High School. It was: \u201cLook at those jungle bunnies. Somebody ought to feed them bananas.\u201d The circumstances under which this remark was made were fully set out by the examiner as quoted in the majority opinion. The examiner noted that it was this remark that triggered the action against Resetar, but he concluded that the charge of misconduct in office was based not only on this remark but also on four more incidents on other occasions. He set them out in his findings 12, 13, 15 and 16 and designated them respectively as \u201clunchroom profanity,\u201d \u201cthe liar accusation,\u201d \u201cthe remark to the unwashed girl,\u201d and \u201cthe public reprimand.\u201d They are described in the report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">12. On November 13, 1972, while a teacher at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Broome Junior High School, Mr. Resetar had lunch with four male teaching colleagues in the faculty lunch room. While complaining about a matter of minor annoyance to him involving use of the copying machine, he expressed his irritation by making derogatory remarks about the librarian and the three Educational Materials Center aides accompanied by profanity and gratuitous sexual references. One of the EMC aides was in an adjoining room and overheard the statements, which she described as \u201cloud, vile, abusive.\u201d Mr. Resetar thought the setting was private, and did not intend to offend the ladies in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">13. On November 15, 1972, Mr. Resetar and the Broome guidance counselor, Mr. Neher, both came on the scene of an altercation among students. When Mr. Resetar said he had not seen the incident develop, the counselor made a sarcastic remark, and Mr. Resetar called the counselor a \u201cGod damned liar.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">15. In February, 1973, while a teacher at Newport Mill Junior High School, during a class period, Mr. Resetar was disturbed by a noise outside his classroom door. He opened his door and admonished a student, but cannot remember just what he said. The principal, Mr. Redmond, understood from his investigation that the admonition was in the form of a sarcastic remark. An accompanying black student, Valerie Smith, responded with a sarcastic remark. Mr. Resetar\u2019s reply evidently suggested improved cleanliness for Valerie. The testimony diverges on this, as the principal, the assistant principal, and the human relations specialist, from their investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>understood the remark to be in the nature of telling Valerie that she was dirty, stank, and needed a bath. However, Mr. Resetar denied making that statement. The matter ended with the student apologizing for interfering with a matter that was not her concern and with Mr. Resetar apologizing also. He explained his thinking, \u201cfor the good of all that an apology at this particular point would terminate this confrontation.\u201d The assistant principal sent Mr. Resetar a memorandum regarding this case, urging that a teacher should not be provoked by a student\u2019s comments, but should respond \u201cas a mature adult\u201d and in \u201ca more considerate way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">16. On May 17, 1973, while a teacher at Newport Mill Junior High School, Mr. Resetar brought two disruptive students, Greg Gassaway and Alfredo (Oscar) Gonzalez, to the school office for disciplinary consideration. Mr. Maley, the assistant principal, testified that Mr. Resetar spoke in a \u201cloud, domineering, demanding voice\u201d in requesting Mr. Maley to take some action in relation to the rude and disruptive behavior of the boys. Mr. Maley, the same day delivered a memorandum to Mr. Resetar expressing concern over this incident and over \u201cthe manner in which you frequently reprimand students in a loud and condemning voice in the presence of the main office staff.\u201d In addition to the office staff, a visitor to the school was present. The memorandum requested Mr. Resetar in the future, \u201cwhen you have serious concerns about one of your students,... bring him in a quiet manner directly to my office so that we can discuss the matter in private.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Thus, there were five incidents which might substantiate the charge of misconduct in office. The examiner concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>two of them did not support the charge. It was his opinion that the \u201clunchroom profanity\u201d (finding 12) and the \u201cpublic reprimand\u201d (finding 16) did not amount to misconduct. He found, however, that misconduct in office was established by the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d event, the \u201cliar accusation\u201d incident (finding 13) and the \u201cunwashed girl\u201d episode (finding 15). They mounted up to misconduct in office because they involved intemperate conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The examiner was satisfied, from general experience and from evidence adduced, that the term \u201cjungle bunny\u201d is \u201ca derogatory racial epithet,\u201d and that \u201c[cjoupled with the reference to eating bananas, the remark appears to be clearly insulting from a racial point of view.\u201d He asserted that \u201c[a]ny overt expression of racial or ethnic bias in the presence of students would be misconduct, in violation of the Board\u2019s Human Relations Policy.\u201d He found that, although in the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d event there was misbehavior on the part of a group of students directed toward Resetar, it was \u201cintemperance, rising to the level of misconduct, for Mr. Resetar to respond with a racial epithet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The examiner classified the \u201cliar accusation\u201d incident as \u201cintemperate and overreactive to the counselor\u2019s sarcastic remark,\u201d which \u201cunfortunately turned a minor annoyance into a serious conflict.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d the examiner pointed out, \u201cthe fault was not entirely Mr. Resetar\u2019s.\u201d The examiner decided that \u201cthe liar accusation barely goes across the misconduct threshold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The examiner believed that in the circumstances surrounding the \u201cunwashed girl\u201d episode Resetar was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>intemperate in telling the student, in effect, that she was dirty. The examiner noted: \u201cThere may be occasions when a teacher would consider it to be beneficial to suggest to a child improved habits of personal care, but this does not appear to have been such a case. Mr. Resetar initially spoke sarcastically to a noisy student, and then responded to the impertinence of the accompanying student with a personal affront.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthis was misconduct, but not aggravated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">So it was that the examiner \u201cconcluded that three instances of intemperate conduct amounting to misconduct [were] shown,\u201d one of which (the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d event) also constituted \u201cmisconduct in violation of the Human Relations Policy.\u201d But he expressly declared his belief that \u201cno one of these cases, standing by itself, is sufficiently extreme to warrant dismissal of the teacher.\u201d He, therefore, found it necessary \u201cto consider whether such a pattern of inappropriate behavior exists as to aggravate the particular offenses to the point where the sanction of dismissal is warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">As indicated, <em>supra, </em>the examiner determined that the charge of misconduct consisted of \u201cintemperate behavior and making remarks with derogatory racial connotations.\u201d He found, with respect to racial bias, that no pattern of inappropriate conduct existed as to aggravate the three offenses to the point where the sanction of dismissal was warranted. There was evidence presented at the hearing concerning Resetar\u2019s racial attitudes. This evidence, according to the examiner, showed him to be strict but not racially prejudiced. The examiner placed no credence in the complaints of some students that Resetar was prejudiced as they \u201ccould easily have been convenient excuses for students whose own behavior was subject to question.\u201d There was substantial evidence, including testimony from black teachers and supervisors, that they did not consider Resetar to be racially biased, that he treated all students fairly, that he was a strict disciplinarian toward both blacks and whites, that he was no more harsh in his discipline with blacks than with whites, and that although his grading was less generous than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that of his immediate predecessors, it was without bias between black and white students.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The examiner found, however, a pattern of persistent behavior with respect to intemperate outbursts, culminating in the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d case. \u201cFor this reason, [he] recommend[ed] that the superintendent\u2019s recommendation be adopted and that Mr. Resetar be dismissed for misconduct in office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">At the time the Circuit Court for Montgomery County rendered its decision in this case, a court, in reviewing administrative proceedings, as the majority point out, might have reversed the decision of the agency \u201cif the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions\u201d were, among other things, \u201c[unsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted,\u201d or \u201c[a]gainst the weight of competent, material, and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted,\u201d or \u201c[unsupported by the entire record, as submitted by the agency and including de novo evidence taken in open court.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol.) art. 41, \u00a7 255 (g) (5) (6) (7).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Of course, it is not permissible for the appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of an agency if its determination finds any support in the facts, <em>Oxon Hill Rec. Club v. Water Res. Adm., </em>281 Md. 110, 114, 375 A. 2d 567 (1977), and this is especially true in matters involving public education, <em>Zeitschel v. Board of Education, </em>274 Md. 69, 82, 332 A. 2d 906 (1975). On the other hand, if the court shall find that substantial rights of a petitioner for review have been prejudiced, by one or more of the statutory causes, because of an administrative finding, inference, conclusion or decision, then it is the function of the court to reverse or modify the order. <em>Bernstein v. Real Estate Comm., </em>221 Md. 221, 230, 156 A. 2d 657 (1959). <em>See </em>Maryland Rule B12.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>I think that the conclusion of the examiner that the acts of Resetar showed a persistent pattern of intemperate conduct was unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record when considered within the ambit of the three incidents which the examiner determined comprised the charge of misconduct. On the contrary, I believe that the conclusion was against the weight of the competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record. The examiner expressly declared his belief that \u201cno one of [the three] cases, standing by itself, is sufficiently extreme to warrant dismissal of the teacher.\u201d He frankly stated that \u201c[t]he case is a close one, since only the jungle bunny episode is particularly serious.\u201d The examiner recounted Resetar\u2019s testimony to the effect that when he made the remark he was speaking only to himself, that the remark was a \u201c \u2018mumble,\u2019 reflecting his disgust and frustration with the attitude of these students throughout the year,\u201d and that he believed that it was \u201chumanly impossible\u201d for the students outside the window to hear him. The assistant principal of Gaithersburg, who was present and heard the remark, said that Resetar was not shouting, and that his tone of voice did not indicate that he was particularly angry or upset, but rather could be characterized as \u201cbantering.\u201d And it should be emphasized that the examiner expressly found no racial bias or prejudice on the part of Resetar. Of the other two incidents included in the charge to show misconduct, the \u201cunwashed girl\u201d matter was deemed to be \u201cnot aggravated,\u201d and the \u201cliar accusation\u201d affair, he thought, \u201cbarely goes across the misconduct threshold.\u201d The examiner recommended dismissal, not because of the only \u201cparticularly serious\u201d incident, namely the \u201cjungle bunny\u201d remark, which he declared was not in itself sufficiently extreme to warrant dismissal, but because there existed a persistent pattern of intemperate conduct by reason of which the particular offenses were aggravated to the point where the sanction of dismissal was warranted. In my opinion, the three incidents found to be misconduct in office fall far short of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d sufficient to show a persistent pattern of intemperate conduct. That the \u201cliar accusation\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201cunwashed girl\u201d incidents are relatively innocuous is borne out by an evaluation report concerning Resetar made while he taught at Newport Junior High. It was signed by two evaluators on 18 June 1973 and thus was after these two incidents relied on to show a persistent pattern of intemperate conduct. The report called for an evaluation of Resetar as \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d with respect to scholarship, teaching power, executive ability, professional responsibility and personality. He was rated \u201csatisfactory\u201d as to each. He was recommended for continued employment. The report included comments under the various evaluation categories and in regard to \u201cpersonality,\u201d the comment on \u201cStrengths\u201d was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">He has a strong personality. He expects all students to achieve their maximum potential and to accept responsibility for their own personal behavior in class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The report indicated that the evaluators knew of the incidents. Under the heading \u201cPlans for Continued Improvement,\u201d they said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">He needs to show more patience for the reluctant learner. Students of all races and ethnic origins deserve equal respect and consideration from him. In dealing with disruptive students it\u2019s essential that he maintain his professional composure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">This did not deter the evaluators from recommending him for continued employment. And as we have indicated, the County Board examiner declared: \u201cNo one denies that he is a competent junior high teacher.\u201d I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and hold that the evidence in view of the entire record was not legally sufficient to warrant Resetar\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">I agree with the majority that the failure of the County Board to render a decision in thirty days of the receipt of its hearing examiner\u2019s findings was not reversible error in the circumstances. I concur with that part of the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>opinion which holds that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Resetar\u2019s motion to present additional evidence in the appeal proceeding before it.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-4\">Chief Judge Murphy authorized me to say that he joins in this opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AEE\">. Resetar had long since completed his probationary period and could be dismissed only for cause as provided by the statute referred to by the Superintendent. Maryland Code (1957,1969 Repl. Vol.) art. 77, \u00a7 114 provided that \u201c[a]ny county board of education may, on the recommendation of the county superintendent of schools ... dismiss any teacher ... for immorality, misconduct in office, insubordination, incompetency, or wilful neglect of duty, provided that the charge or charges be stated, in writing, to such person and that such person be given an opportunity to be heard by said board of education upon not less than 10 days notice....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. The County Board found that \u201cinsofar as the Board\u2019s schedule did not permit it to hear this argument within 30 days as set forth in its rules, the Board directs the superintendent to restore John Resetar, Jr. to pay for the period of March 27 to April 10, 1975.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-4\">. The record of the County Board hearing consisted of some 298 pages of testimony and 18 exhibits. The matter was heard <em>de novo </em>upon appeal to the State Board. The transcript of the proceedings before the County Board examiner and exhibits there admitted were received in evidence by agreement of the parties. In addition, witnesses appeared before the State Board examiner. The transcript of their testimony consisted of 219 pages. Five more exhibits were admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-5\">. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied a motion by Resetar to take additional testimony and heard the case on the record made below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">. The examiner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">Insubordination is basically a different kind of offense from misconduct. It involves a conscious, willful, and recalcitrant rejection of the authority of a supervisory official. Regulations and policies adopted by the Board of Education establish norms for the conduct of people subject to its jurisdiction. The flouting of such norms constitutes misconduct. I do not believe that violation of such norms also constitutes insubordination. If it did, the logical conclusion would be that virtually every case of misconduct would also be insubordination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">The documents relied upon by the superintendent as directives violated by Mr. Resetar ... are critical of Mr. Resetar\u2019s handling of particular situations, but are only general admonitions to moderate his conduct in the future. Stated in terms of the legal framework of this case, it is fair to characterize these documents as urging Mr. Resetar to refrain from misconduct in the future. They are not sufficiently pointed to constitute direct orders flouted by Mr. Resetar in the June 18th incident____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">. The \u201clunchroom profanity incident,\u201d finding 12, and the \u201cliar accusation,\u201d finding 13, were investigated by an associate superintendent and an area superintendent. \u201cUpon their recommendation ... the superintendent notified Mr. Resetar that his \u2018language use was inappropriate and cannot be condoned.\u2019 The superintendent also advised Mr. Resetar that a transfer to a different school would be arranged for him, in the hope that \u2018a fresh start in a different setting\u2019 would be helpful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">. The examiner also noted other episodes which were related at the hearing \u201cas background information purporting to indicate a pattern of attitudes and conduct on Mr. Resetar\u2019s part.\u201d He recounted the details of some of these and referred generally to others as to which he believed that findings were not warranted. In any event, none of these incidents, in his view, were included in the charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. The examiner observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">For analytical purposes, intemperate conduct can be viewed in three degrees. In the first place, everybody is intemperate and overreactive at times, so a minimal amount of this kind of behavior must be tolerated before the threshold of misconduct is reached. Second, intemperance which goes beyond what is ordinary and trivial constitutes misconduct, particularly if it involves students. A teacher occupies a special relationship with his students, assuming significant responsibility for their welfare and guidance while under his supervision. So self control is particularly important for a teacher. Third, if the intemperate behavior is flagrant or repeated, then the misconduct is serious enough to warrant dismissal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">. <em>See </em>Acts 1978, ch. 884, effective 1 July 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
