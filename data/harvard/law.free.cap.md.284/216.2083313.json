Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.) Art. 43, \u00a7 706 (the statute) does <em>not </em>require an electric company to obtain a permit from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the Department) as a condition to use of one of its \u201cgenerating stations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">\u201cThe Department may require by regulation that before any person either builds, erects, alters, replaces, operates, sells, rents, or uses any article, machine, equipment or other contrivance specified by such regulation the use of which may cause emissions into the air, such person shall obtain a permit to do so or be required to register with the Department. The aforesaid provisions of this section shall not apply... to generating stations constructed by electric companies. The Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene upon notification from the Public Service Commission of an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>prepare a recommendation in connection with the registration or permit required by this section. Such recommendation shall be presented at the hearing required under Article 78, \u00a7 54A, of the Annotated Code\u2019of Maryland. The decision of the Public Service Commission in connection with the registration or permit shall be binding on the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene, subject to judicial review as set forth in the provisions of Article 78, \u00a7 91, subsection (a)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">When this section was originally enacted by Chapter 244 of the Acts of 1970 it consisted only of the first sentence and exclusions (not here pertinent) in that portion of the second sentence prior to the statement relative to \u201cgenerating stations constructed by electric companies.\u201d Chapter 31 of the Acts of 1971 (the Act) added the word \u201caforesaid\u201d before \u201cprovisions\u201d in the second sentence and the remainder of the present section including the language relative to \u201cgenerating stations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Department initially read the Act as giving it no authority to require electric companies to obtain permits from it for their generating stations. After the General Assembly declined on several occasions to accede to the requests of the Department for the grant of such authority, the Department determined that a more careful study of the whole Act warranted a conclusion that electric companies could not operate their generating stations without permits from it,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, it dispatched a letter to appellant, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&amp;E), requesting that it submit applications for permits to operate \u201call [of its] fuel burning equipment----\u201d BG&amp;E replied with an assertion that after careful study of the matter it was of the view that \u201cthe clear and unambiguous exception granted for electric generating stations in the second sentence of Article 43, Section 706\u201d was \u201cat odds\u201d with the position taken by the Department. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Therefore, it immediately sought a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Baltimore City. That court held \u201cthat the exclusionary provision of Section 706 is ambiguous.\u201d It then determined that under the Act the Department continued to have \u201cpermit authority over the then existing electric plants,\u201d but not over new facilities. It was of the view, however, that \u201cany changes or modifications of facilities are subject to Department approval.\u201d BG&amp;E appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted the writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 379 A. 2d 1007 (1977), we said in pertinent part relative to statutory construction, citing a number of cases for each of the statements there made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent. In determining that intent the Court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification. ... A corollary to this rule is that if there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.... A court may not insert or omit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original foVm. ... The General Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law. ... Absent a clear indication to the contrary, a statute, if reasonably possible, is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In <em>Height v. State, 225 </em>Md. 251, 170 A. 2d 212 (1961), Judge Prescott said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201c[W]hen the words of a statute are of doubtful meaning, the Court, in determining legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u00a7 21:8-:10, at 762-71 (6th ed. S. Gard 1972); 8 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2292, at 554. The privilege is based upon the public policy that \u201c \u2018an individual in a free society should be encouraged to consult with his attorney whose function is to counsel and advise him and he should be free from apprehension of compelled disclosures by his legal advisor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrison v. State, supra, </em>276 Md. at 135, 345 A. 2d at 838 (quoting <em>Morris v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 252, 254, 242 A. 2d 559, 560 (1968)); <em>accord, </em>8 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2291, at 545. While never given an explicit constitutional underpinning, the privilege is, nevertheless, closely tied to the federal, as well as this State\u2019s, constitutional guarantees of effective assistance of counsel and could, if limited too severely, make these basic guarantees virtually meaningless. <em>Harrison v. State, supra, </em>276 Md. at 133-34, 345 A. 2d at 837; <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>519 F. 2d 1036, 1045-47 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. VI; Md. Deck of Rts., Art. 21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Initially we observe that, given the complexities of modern existence, few if any lawyers could, as a practical matter, represent the interest of their clients without a variety of nonlegal assistance. Recognizing this limitation, it is now almost universally accepted in this country that the scope of the attorney-client privilege, at least in criminal causes, embraces those agents whose services are required by the attorney in order that he may properly prepare his client\u2019s case. Consequently, in line with the views of the vast majority of the courts in our sister jurisdictions, we have no hesitancy in concluding that in criminal causes communications made by a defendant to an expert in order to equip that expert with the necessary information to provide the defendant\u2019s attorney with the tools to aid him in giving his client proper legal advice are within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. <em>E.g., United States v. Alvarez, supra, </em>519 F. 2d at 1046 (psychiatrist); <em>United States v. Kovel, </em>296 F. 2d 918, 922 (2d Cir. 1961) (accountant); <em>People v. Lines, </em>13 Cal. 3d 500, 531 P. 2d 793, 800-03, 119 Cal. Rptr. 225, 232-35 (1975) (psychiatrist); <em>accord, </em>3 B. Jones, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 21:15, at 786-87. <em>But cf. State v. Mingo, </em>143 N.J. Super. 411, 363 A. 2d 369, 370-71 (1976) (per curiam) (because defendant\u2019s handwriting exemplars not privileged communications, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>State\u2019s solicitation at trial of opinion of defense-hired graphologist as to identity of handwriting on note sent to assault victim not barred by attorney-client privilege). This is uniquely so in cases concerning the question of a criminal defendant\u2019s sanity, because the need of an attorney to consult with a qualified medical expert is paramount. Such a medical expert not only provides testimony that usually is necessary at trial to support an insanity defense, but also \u201cattunes the lay attorney to unfamiliar but central medical concepts and enables him, as an initial matter, to assess the soundness and advisability of offering the defense ... and perhaps most importantly, ... permits a lawyer inexpert in the science of psychiatry to probe intelligently the foundations of adverse testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>437 F. 2d 371, 377 n. 9 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The State here does not dispute the inclusion of psychiatric communications within the scope of the attorney-client privilege; instead, it contends that when Mrs. Pratt interposed a defense of insanity, she waived the privilege with respect to all statements she may have made to any medical expert, whether in her employ or in that of the State.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While there is little doubt that a client may waive this right to confidentiality, which may be done either expressly or impliedly, <em>see, e.g., Harrison v. State, supra, </em>276 Md. at 136-38, 345 A. 2d at 839; 8 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2327, at 634-39; <em>but see </em>2 H. Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 333, at 841 (5th ed. P. Herrick 1956) (doubtful if any waiver of the privilege should be implied in criminal cause), we have been made aware of only one decision in which a court, the New York Court of Appeals, has held that raising the defense of insanity, without more, is a relinquishment of the attorney-client privilege as to communications between the client and his alienist. In its opinion the court justified its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Art. 75, \u00a7 40 came into our statutory law through \u00a7 2 of the same Act. Judge Irving said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">\u201cThe two sections of this Act of 1785 having been both re-enacted in 1860, when the Code was adopted, neither can have superiority over the other, and they must be construed together and both made to stand, as they did in the Act of 1785, the second sec. as an exception to the first. For convenience sake they have been separated in the Code and no longer stand in juxtaposition as in the original, but having been re-enacted at one and the same time, they must be construed as if they had continued side by side.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We turn, therefore, to an examination of the Act. Its title states that it is an act to add new sections 763 through 768 to Art. 66C of the Code \u201cTitle \u2018Natural Resources,\u2019 subtitle \u2018In General,\u2019 subheading \u2018Department of Natural Resources,\u2019 to follow immediately after Section 762 thereof, and to be under the new subtitle \u2018Power Plant Siting\u2019 to add a new \u00a7 5A to Art. 66C under the subtitle previously mentioned and the subheading \u201cDepartment of Natural Resources\u201d; to repeal and reenact with amendments \u00a7 706 of Art. 43 of the Code entitled \u201cHealth,\u201d subtitle \u201cAir Quality Control\u201d; to repeal and reenact with amendments \u00a7 726 of Art. 66C under the subtitle \u201cWetlands,\u201d subheading \u201cPrivate Wetlands\u201d; to repeal and reenact with amendments \u00a7 11 of Art. 96A of the Code with the title \u201cWater Resources,\u201d subtitle \u201cAppropriation of Waters; Reservoirs and Dams\u201d; to repeal and reenact with amendments \u00a7 54A of Art. 78 of the Code with the title \u201cPublic Service Commission Law,\u201d subtitle \u201cPublic Service Companies,\u201d subheading \u201cGas and Electric Companies\u201d; to add a new \u00a7 54B to Art. 78; to repeal and reenact with amendments \u00a7 90 of Art. 78; to establish an environmental trust fund from a surcharge on generated kilowatt hours of electric energy to be used to underwrite a power plant environmental research and site evaluation program and to insure long-range and timely planning for power plant site selection and acquisition to strengthen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>State of Maryland\u2019s capability to define and manage a power plant environmental research program, to provide for the exercise of eminent domain and potential power plant site ownership by the Secretary of Natural Resources, to exempt from local zoning certain sites, to assign responsibility to the Secretary of Natural Resources on applications to the Public Service Commission for certificates of public convenience and necessity associated with power plant construction, to <em>provide for coordinated hearings and issuance of permits on applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity associated with power plant construction, </em>to provide for certain exceptions in the construction of certain overhead transmission lines, to define the term \u201cconstruction,\u201d \u201cto entitle the Secretary of Natural Resources to judicial review,\u201d and \u201cgenerally relating to power plant siting.\u201d We shall proceed to a consideration of those various sections seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The first group of sections (now found in Code (1974,1978 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 3-301 to -305, Natural Resources Article) provides for an environmental surcharge \u201cas an added cost of generation ... of electric energy ... in Maryland\u201d; the payment of the funds so obtained \u201cinto the special fund known as the Environmental Trust Fund\u201d; the administration and handling of the fund; a power plant environmental research program; long-range power plant site evaluation; acquisition by the State of sites for the construction of electric generating stations with payment to be made from the Environmental Trust Fund and ultimate acquisition of such sites by electric companies; and that the Board of Review of the Department of Natural Resources should not have jurisdiction over any proceedings arising under that subtitle but that review in the nature of judicial review should be available \u201cas set forth in [Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Yol., 1971 Cum. Supp.)] Article 78, Sections 89 through 98\u201d pertaining to the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The new \u00a7 5A of Art. 66C (now embodied in Code (1974) \u00a7 3-306, Natural Resources Article) specified that notwithstanding certain other provisions of law and in lieu of yet other sections, upon application to the Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>necessity associated with power plant construction where private wetlands or diversion of the waters of the State might be involved, the Public Service Commission was to notify the Department of such fact and supply it \u201cwith all pertinent available information regarding such application.\u201d The Department then was to treat the application as one similar to a request for appropriation or use of waters under Art. 96A and similar to an application for a license for dredging and filling under Art. 66C. The section set forth the procedures concerning such application including provision for the recommendation of the Department \u2019to the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Next came the section here in controversy which we have quoted. Then in the order of things came an amendment to Art. 66C, \u00a7 726. As it previously existed, that section had referred to the necessity for a permit for anyone desiring to do certain work upon any wetlands. The amendment provided that when an electric company applied to the Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience \u201cassociated with power plant construction which involves private wetlands, the hearing and permit procedures sh[ould] be in accordance with Section 5A of [Art. 66C].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">An amendment to what was then Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol., 1970 Cum. Supp.) Art. 96A, \u00a7 11 followed next (now codified as Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 8-802, Natural Resources Article). That statute as it had previously existed stated that after January 1, 1934, it should be unlawful \u201cto appropriate or use, or to begin construction of any plant, building or structure which m[ight] appropriate or use any waters of the State, surface or underground, without the consent or permit of the Department, in writing, previously obtained, upon written application therefor to the Department.\u201d The amendment said that notwithstanding other provisions of the subtitle of which \u00a7 11 was a part \u201can application to the Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity associated with power plant construction involving use or diversion of waters of the State, pursuant to Article 78, sh[ould] constitute an application for the permit required by [\u00a7 11] and sh[ould] be handled in accordance with Section 5A of Article 66C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The next succeeding section amended what was then Code (1957,1965 Repl. Yol., 1970 Cum. Supp.) Art. 78, \u00a7 54A. This law provided that no electric company might begin construction or exercise the right of eminent domain relative to generating stations or overhead transmission lines carrying a voltage in excess of 69,000 volts \u201cwithout having first obtained from the [Public Service] Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction of the station or line.\u201d It then went on concerning the obtention of such a certificate. The amendments were twofold. The section as it existed prior to the enactment of the Act provided that there could be no overhead transmission line \u201cin line with, and within one mile of, either end of any public airport runway.\u201d The amendment added, \u201cunless the Federal Aviation Administration has determined that the construction of such overhead transmission line will not constitute a hazard to air navigation and such determination has been concurred in by the State Aviation Commission.\u201d The second amendment concerned definition of the term \u201cconstruction\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 54A and 54B, the term being defined as including \u201cany clearing of land, excavation, or other action that would affect the natural environment of the site or route of bulk power supply facilities, but does not include changes needed for temporary use of sites or routes for non-utility purposes, or uses in securing geological data, including necessary borings to ascertain foundation conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Section 54A was followed by \u00a7 54B, which was entirely new. It is now codified as Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.) Art. 78, \u00a7 54B (although the 1978 Cum. Supp. comments that the 1976 amendments \u201cso changed subsection (a) that a detailed comparison is not... practical\u201d). It provided the procedure for obtention of a certificate under \u00a7 54A, specifying the filing of an application two years prior to commencement of construction or exercising the right of eminent domain; that \u201csuch application sh[ould] contain such information as the [Public Service] Commission [might] request\u201d; that upon receipt of such application and information the Commission was to \u201cnotify all interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>persons including, but not limited to ... the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Department of Transportation, Department of Economic and Community Development and Department of State Planning\u201d of Maryland; and that \u201cafter publication as the Commission [might deem] proper, [it] at the public hearing required by Section 54A\u201d was to \u201cinsure presentation of the information and recommendations from said agencies, [was to] permit the official representative of said agencies to sit during hearing of all parties,\u201d and then to allow the agencies \u201cbased on evidence relating to their areas of concern\u201d within 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing \u201cto modify, affirm, or amend their initial recommendations,\u201d after which, within 90 days after the hearing, the Public Service Commission was to grant or deny the permit, \u201cor grant it subject to such conditions as it m[ight] find appropriate....\u201d The section further specified, \u201cThe granting of such certificate shall also constitute authority to dredge and/or construct bulkheads in the waters or private wetlands of the State, as well as to appropriate or use such waters; in addition, <em>such certificate shall also constitute registration and a permit, as required under Article 43, Section 706, </em>of the Annotated Code of Maryland, for the air emissions, if any, resulting from the operation of the plant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection (b) of Art. 54B then went on to provide that in cooperation with the Secretary of Natural Resources \u201cas set forth in Section 765 of Article 66C, the Commission [was to] be responsible for assembling and evaluating annually the long-range plans of Maryland\u2019s public electric utilities regarding generating needs and means for meeting those needs,\u201d with the further proviso that the Chairman of the Public Service Commission on an annual basis was to forward to the Secretary of Natural Resources a ten-year plan \u201clisting possible and proposed sites, including associated transmission routes, for the construction of electric power plants within the State of Maryland.\u201d Specific provision was made that sites \u201cidentified as unsuitable by the Secretary of Natural Resources in accordance with the requirements of Section 765 of Article 66C [were to] be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>deleted from the plan, provided, however, nothing in [the] subsection [was to] prevent the inclusion of such site in subsequent ten-year ... plans,\u201d the first such plan to \u201cbe submitted on or about January 1, 1972.\u201d Subsection (c) went on to require the Public Service Commission to \u201ctake cognizance of the mandate by the General Assembly to impose the surcharge per kilowatt hour of electric energy generated within Maryland\u201d by authorizing electric companies \u201cto add the full amount of the surcharge to customers\u2019 bills,\u201d the revenues derived from such surcharges to \u201cbe placed into the special fund known as the Environmental Trust Fund.\u201d Further provision was made relative to preparation of a budget \u201cto carry out the provisions of th[at] Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The next succeeding section was an amendment to what was then Code (1957) Art. 78, \u00a7 90 relative to judicial review of any \u201cfinal decision or order of the [Public Service] Commission____\u201d The amendment provided that for purposes of the subtitle \u201cthe Secretary of Natural Resources [was to] have standing to seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s final decision or order made pursuant to Article 78, Section 54A and Section 54B relative to the environmental aspects of power plant siting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The final two sections of the Act concerned severability and its effective date of July 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">It will be seen that the Act contains a comprehensive plan for the erection of new power plants. In the long-term siting portion of it provision has been made for careful study which includes environmental impact at any proposed site. In instances where a new generating plant is to be erected prior law would require a permit from the Department under the section here under consideration as to air quality, from the Department of Natural Resources as to dredging or filling of private wetlands, and from the Department of Geology, Mines and Water Resources for the appropriation of ground water. This Act provided for consolidated hearings by the Public Service Commission relative to all three of these required permits, with that commission to make the ultimate determination whether such permit should be issued after all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>other agencies had had due opportunity to express their views. It is to be noted, however, that if at a power plant site existing at the time of passage of the Act or at one constructed under the provisions of the Act an electric company were to decide that it needed to drive a new well \u2014 to appropriate more'ground water in the terms of the statute on that subject \u2014 for sanitary purposes or any other reasons, the Act does not eliminate the pre-existing permit requirements. Likewise, if an electric company at a then existing power plant site or at one constructed under the provisions of the Act were to determine that it needed to take action involving \u201cdredging, filling, removing or otherwise altering or polluting private wetlands\u201d as, for instance, in the construction of a new landing area for coal or oil, the prior permit requirements continue in effect unaffected by the Act. Only in the section here under consideration has language been used which has caused a question to be raised relative to the continuation of the prior permit requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">With that background we proceed to further analysis of \u00a7 706. The first sentence after the disputed language specifies that the head of the Department (its Secretary) when notified by the Public Service Commission \u201cof an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity shall prepare a recommendation in connection with the registration or permit required by this section.\u201d What \u201cregistration or permit required by this section\u201d? If the section is in no way applicable to \u201cgenerating stations constructed by electric companies,\u201d then there is no \u201cregistration or permit required by this section.\u201d The \u201crecommendation [is to] be presented at the hearing required under Article 78, Section 54A____\u201d The hearing under that section is by the Public Service Commission relative to desired \u201cconstruction of a generating station or an overhead transmission line designed to carry a voltage in excess of 69,000 volts ....\u201d Then \u00a7 706 requires that the decision of the Public Service Commission \u201cin connection with the registration or permit [is to] be binding on the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene,\u201d subject to the provisions as to judicial review. The words \u201cregistration or permit\u201d must refer back to the earlier sentence calling for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the head of the Department upon notification of an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to \u201cprepare a recommendation in connection with the registration or permit required by [\u00a7 706].\u201d Why would the decision of the Public Service Commission \u201cin connection with the registration or permit... be binding on the [head of the Department]\u201d if there is no registration or permit to be issued by him to electric companies concerning their generating stations?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We find that the statute in question is ambiguous. Thus, we are obliged to construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">It was suggested by the Department at oral argument that if it were not permitted to supervise the use and any changes that might be made from time to time in generating stations such stations would be without supervision and the public unprotected. This argument fails for two reasons. First of all, electric companies are subject to the overall supervision of the Public Service Commission. See, <em>e.g., </em>Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.) Art. 78, \u00a7\u00a7 56, 59A, 61, 68, and 69. Secondly, there are yet other controls over such generating stations, some of which are vested in the Department. It concedes, as indeed it must, the existence of the statute relative to air quality control, Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.) Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 690-706 under which \u201cstandards for emissions into the air and the ambient air quality for each\u201d of various areas of the State may be set by the Department. In enforcing those regulations the Department is permitted to seek injunctive relief as well as \u201ccivil penalties.\u201d Moreover, since the enactment of Chapter 12 of the Acts of 1886, the Department has had the power under what is now Code (1957) Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 105-108 to proceed relative to any establishment certified to it \u201cby any two legally qualified medical practitioners, or any three or more persons affected thereby, to be in a state of nuisance injuriously affecting any adjacent property or district, dangerous to health ... if it shall be found that the nuisance complained of is such as to injuriously affect... or is calculated to endanger the health or life of any person ....\u201d For generations, without regard to statute, our equity courts have been open to actions to enjoin public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>nuisances. See, <em>e.g., Washington Cleaners v. Albrecht, </em>157 Md. 389, 146 A. 233 (1929), where, long before the current hue and cry relative to air pollution, neighbors of a cleaning and dyeing establishment complained \u201cof the effect of its operation upon their health and convenience\u201d by virtue of the fumes emanating from it. Our predecessors upheld an injunction restraining the owner from \u201cusing varnalene and/or gasoline ... in such quantity and manner as to be deleterious to the health' of the neighborhood.\u201d As a matter of fact, half a century before that opinion Judge Alvey said for the Court in <em>Dittman v. Repp, </em>50 Md. 516 (1879):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">\u201cIn <em>Adams v. Michael, </em>38 Md. 123 [(1873)], this court held that a court of equity will interfere and restrain by injunction an existing or threatened nuisance to a party\u2019s dwelling, if the injury be shown to be of such a character as to diminish materially the value of the property as a dwelling, and seriously interfere with the ordinary comfort and enjoyment of it, and that the injury be such as to entitle the party complaining to substantial damages in an action at law. That was the case of a manufacturing establishment about to be erected in immediate proximity to the dwellings of the parties complaining, and where, according to the allegations of the bill, large volumes of smoke, offensive odors and noxious vapors, would be emitted from the factory, during its operation, whereby the value of the dwellings would be materially lessened, and tbe comfort of their occupiers greatly interfered with, and their health impaired. The injunction was refused in that case, but solely because of the defective allegations of the bill. Here the allegations of the bill are sufficient, and the principles laid down in <em>Adams v. Michael </em>fully apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">See also the annotation on this subject appearing at page 123 of the Perkins edition published in 1899 of <em>Adams v. Michael, </em>38 Md. 123 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Although. there is no \u201clong standing\u201d administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>interpretation by the Department of the statute in question as the term \u201clong standing\u201d has heretofore been interpreted by this Court, we nevertheless regard it as significant that the Department\u2019s original interpretation of this statute immediately after its enactment was that the exclusionary language of the section stripped the Department of the power it previously held over generating stations constructed by electric companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">It is the first sentence of the statute which grants to the Department the power to regulate plants \u201cwhich may cause emissions into the air....\u201d That, however, is followed by the flat statement, \u201cThe aforesaid provisions of this section shall not apply ... to generating stations constructed by electric companies.\u201d The overall scheme of the Act is for the Public Service Commission to be vested with the sole power and authority to approve on behalf of the State of Maryland the erection of electric generating stations. This approval includes all matters involving or concerned with environmental impact. From the combination of the flat \u2014 unambiguous \u2014 sentence in the statute purporting to exempt generating stations of electric companies from its permit requirements, the legislative scheme, and the initial interpretation of the statute by the agency, we conclude that the better view is that \u00a7 706 vests the Department with no control at any time over \u201cgenerating stations constructed by electric companies.\u201d Chief Judge Prescott said for the Court in <em>Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 534, 212 A. 2d 311 (1965), \u201c[Construing a statute liberally and adding to it, by judicial fiat, a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to include are not one and the same thing.\u201d We decline to add words to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. This is the second time in recent weeks we have had before us a case in which one of the agencies of the State of Maryland initially thought it did not have authority which it later contended that it did have. <em>See </em>Holy Cross. Hospital v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, 283 Md. 677, 393 A. 2d 181 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. In effect, the State asks us, by judicial decision, to create a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as the General Assembly has done by providing that, in the case of the psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege, if the patient \u201cintroduces his mental condition as an element of his claim or defense . . . ,\u201d the privilege is waived. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.l, \u00a7 9-109 (d) (3) (i) of the Courts Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
