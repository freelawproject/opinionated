The motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. Evans seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of a motion seeking his immediate release. It is not necessary for Evans to obtain a COA in order to appeal. Evans\u2019 motion is based on his misinterpretation of an order issued in his federal habeas corpus proceeding, but the motion does not directly challenge the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Consequently, the motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, the motion for COA is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY, and the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b213-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
