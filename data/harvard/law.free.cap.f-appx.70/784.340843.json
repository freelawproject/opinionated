Karam appeals the district court\u2019s remand of this case to state court. Because we conclude that this court is statutorily precluded from reviewing the remand order, we dismiss Karam\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-26\">Plaintiff-Appellee Ronnie Meissner originally filed this civil action in Texas state district court, seeking an order requiring Karam to account and divide the assets and profits of their general partnership, Defendant Frog Leap. Karam removed the case to federal district court based solely on the existence of diversity of citizenship. Meissner then filed a motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-27\">The federal district court determined that the Frog Leap partnership consisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>of two partners, one of whom (Meissner) was a citizen of Texas, and the other (Karam) was a citizen of Oklahoma. Consequently, the court found that Frog Leap should be considered a citizen of both Texas and Oklahoma. Because both Frog Leap and Meissner had Texas citizenship, the court concluded that diversity jurisdiction did not exist. Given that diversity jurisdiction was Karam\u2019s only asserted basis for subject matter jurisdiction, the court granted Meissner\u2019s motion and remanded the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The threshold question in this case is whether we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s remand. Section 1447(c) of Title 28 of the United States Code authorizes remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, while \u00a7 1447(d) provides that \u201can order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d Save for a few exceptions, \u201ca remand to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(c) is ordinarily barred from appellate review by \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d <em>Arnold v. Garlock, </em>278 F.3d 426, 437 (5th Cir.2001). This rule applies even if the district court\u2019s determinations regarding subject matter jurisdiction are erroneous. <em>Heaton v. Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga., </em>231 F.3d 994, 997 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">One exception to this rule is derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermandorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976). The <em>Thermtron </em>Court carved out a \u201cnarrow exception to the strict bar to appellate review of remand orders. [The <em>Thermtron </em>exception provides that] a remand order may be reviewed where the district court has \u2018remanded [a case] on grounds not authorized by the removal statutes.\u2019\u201d <em>Angelides v. Baylor Coll, of Med., </em>117 F.3d 833, 836 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. at 353).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On appeal, Karam contends that the <em>Thermtron </em>exception applies because the district court ruled on an issue not specifically stated in the motion to remand when it determined that Frog Leap was a necessary party to the litigation. In so doing, he continues, the court exceeded its statutorily-defined powers under \u00a7 1447(c). As a result, Karam concludes, appellate jurisdiction is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">We agree with Meissner\u2019s contention that <em>Thermtron </em>is plainly distinguishable from this case. In <em>Thermtron, </em>the Court held that a district court exceeded its removal powers under \u00a7 1447(c) when \u201cneither the propriety of the removal nor the jurisdiction of the court was questioned,\u201d and the district court\u2019s determining factor for remand was its heavy docket. 423 U.S. at 343-44. These unique considerations are not present in this case. In his motion to remand, Meissner argued that the basis for remand was the absence of diversity between the named parties. The remand order, incorporating Meissner\u2019s argument, expressly concluded that diversity jurisdiction was lacking. In so doing, the district court directly implicated subject matter jurisdiction, which plainly indicates that the court remanded the case on grounds that are authorized by \u00a7 1447(c). Thus, regardless of the court\u2019s determination that Frog Leap was a necessary party to the litigation, the narrow <em>Thermtron </em>exception is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Because Karam fails to demonstrate that any of the available exceptions to \u00a7 1447(c) apply, we are required under \u00a7 1447(d) to DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b812-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
