We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that McJunkins has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, although we grant McJunkins\u2019s motion to amend his informal brief, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
