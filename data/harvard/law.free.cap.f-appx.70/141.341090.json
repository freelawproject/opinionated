Williams was convicted by a jury of twelve counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000), two counts of identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028(a)(7), 2 (2000), and one count of false use of a social security number in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B) (2000), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Williams\u2019 attorney has filed an <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), brief and a motion to withdraw, raising several issues at the request of Williams, but concluding there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Williams has filed a pro se supplemental brief, augmenting his attorney\u2019s claims and raising new claims. He also moves for appointment of new appellate counsel and general relief. After an independent review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">We find the indictment was not defective. The prosecutor was not obligated to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>504 U.S. 36, 45-46, 112 S.Ct. 1735, 118 L.Ed.2d 352 (1992). In addition, Williams cannot show he was prejudiced by any alleged false testimony presented to the grand jury. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 485-87 (4th Cir.1993). We further find no evidence of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. In addition, we find no evidence of judicial misconduct. Nor do we find that the district court judge should have recused himself. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(4) <em>(2000); United States v. Nobel, </em>696 F.2d 231, 233-34 (4th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Ravich, </em>421 F.2d 1196, 1205-06 (2d Cir.1970). Furthermore, the district court properly denied the motion to strike certain portions of the indictment for improper venue. This issue was decided in Williams\u2019 co-defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Janes, </em>2003 WL 21267842, 66 Fed.Appx. 483 (4th Cir. June 3, 2003) (No. 02-4866) (unpublished). In addition, there was no error in the determination of the offense level. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>316 F.3d 495, 502 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-24\">We have reviewed the issues raised in Williams\u2019 pro se supplemental brief and find them without merit. There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions. The sentencing enhancements for obstruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tion of justice and being an organizer or supervisor were proper. In addition, the criminal history category was properly determined. Williams\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable on direct review. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. Thus, we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and Williams\u2019 motion to appoint appellate counsel. If Williams requests that a petition for certiorari be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Williams. We also deny Williams\u2019 motion for general relief seeking review of this court\u2019s decision in his co-defendants\u2019 appeal. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
