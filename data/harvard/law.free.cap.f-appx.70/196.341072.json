He argues that the district court erred in refusing to adjust his offense level downward by two levels for acceptance of responsibility because he refused to submit to a presentence interview by a probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">If a defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\u201d the sentencing guidelines instruct the district court to decrease the defendant\u2019s offense level by two points. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Whether a defendant has sufficiently demonstrated acceptance of responsibility is a factual question, and the standard of review is even more deferential than \u201cclear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Spires, </em>79 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.1996). This court will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooten, </em>933 F.2d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">We have recognized the refusal to debrief a probation officer as a factor in deciding whether to apply the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and, most recently, we have stated that a defendant\u2019s refusal to make a statement of acceptance of responsibility to a probation officer called his sincerity into question. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>62 F.3d 118, 123 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003). Having reviewed the record in this case, we hold that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant the adjustment was not without any foundation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.3); <em>Hooten, </em>933 F.2d at 297-98. Flores also has not shown reversible error by arguing that he exercised his right to remain silent with the probation officer because mistakes or inadvertent omissions during a presentence interview can lead to additional jail time. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Kleinebreil, </em>966 F.2d 945, 953 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We note that the district court\u2019s refusal to apply the adjustment is also supported by the lack of timeliness in Flores manifesting his acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.l(h)); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>39 F.3d 568, 572 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Bickford v. Int\u2019l Speedway Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir.1981) (reversal is inappropriate if ruling of the district court can be affirmed on any grounds, regardless whether those grounds were used by the district court). Flores\u2019 sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\"> Pursuant to 5TH Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
