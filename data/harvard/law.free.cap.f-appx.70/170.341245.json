Later, Jupiter filed a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>judgment against Century on all claims asserted by Century against Jupiter and for summary judgment on Jupiter\u2019s counter-claim. The district court granted summary judgment in Jupiter\u2019s favor on both aspects.
