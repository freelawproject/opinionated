They appeal their sentences. Because we find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>district court did not clearly err in determining their sentences under the Sentencing Guidelines,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">On appeal, Feres contends that the district court erred in including cash seized incident to his arrest as relevant conduct. He argues that, because the money was the proceeds of Marker\u2019s marijuana distribution that occurred in 2001, and he had nothing to do with the distribution until after it was completed, he did not aid or abet the distribution, and could not be held responsible for any proceeds from the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">A district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs attributable as relevant conduct is reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 881 (4th Cir.1991). Where, as here, the crimes involve drug trafficking, the Guidelines define relevant conduct to include \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). The Guidelines also provide that \u201c[tjypes and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.12); <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>975 F.2d 1061, 1067 (4th Cir.1992). Our review of the record, including Feres\u2019s statements at his plea hearing, leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that the cash seized was properly attributable to Feres as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Marker contends that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level for an aggravating role in the offense. He argues that the evidence showed that he and Feres played equal roles in the offense, and the two level enhancement was not justified. A district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002). A two-level adjustment for role in the offense is appropriate when \u201cthe defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than\u201d more extensive activities meriting three or four level enhancements. USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). An enhancement for aggravating role requires, at a minimum, that \u201cthe defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). The record demonstrates that Marker exercised all decision making authority in the incidents that preceded the defendants\u2019 arrest, and directed Feres in several particulars of the trip from New York to West Virginia. We conclude that the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement for Marker\u2019s leadership role is supported by the evidence in the case and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences of Marker and Feres. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
