R. Crim.P. 35(b) motion. Harrell\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on the Government\u2019s withdrawal motion. The Government elected not to file a formal brief, and Harrell filed a supplemental brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the briefs and examined the entire record for meritorious issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-24\">On appeal, Harrell\u2019s counsel challenges the district court\u2019s failure to allow Harrell an opportunity to be heard in response to the Government\u2019s motion to withdraw its 35(b) motion. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-25\">It is well-settled that whether to file a 35(b) motion is a matter left to the government\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b); <em>see also United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993). However, the United States Supreme Court has held that a court may grant a downward departure in the absence of a government motion if: (1) the government has obligated itself in the plea agreement to move for a departure; or (2) the government\u2019s refusal to move for a departure was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). We find that Harrell can demonstrate neither, thus requiring a finding that the Government retained absolute discretion whether to pursue a Rule 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The plea agreement states in relevant part as follows: \u201c[the Government] will make known to the Court at sentencing the full extent of Defendant\u2019s cooperation, but the Government is not promising to move for departure pursuant to ... Fed. R.Crim.P. 35.\u201d A plain reading of the plea agreement thus reveals not only that the Government did not obligate itself to pursue a Rule 35(b) motion, it affirmatively retained absolute discretion over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Moreover, there is no evidence that the Government refused to pursue the Rule 35(b) motion based on an unconstitutional motive. The Rule 35(b) motion states that Harrell was expected to be a witness in subsequent months, and that because he was still cooperating and further assistance and testimony might be required, the Government requested that the motion be \u201cheld in abeyance until completion of that assistance.\u201d The motion is also explicit that it was \u201csubject to being withdrawn should the defendant not complete his cooperation.\u201d Consistent with the Rule 35(b) motion, the Government\u2019s withdrawal motion explained that it had been unable to secure prosecutions of individuals about whom Harrell had provided information.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Accordingly, pursuant to both the plea agreement and the Rule 35(b) motion, the Government\u2019s obligation to seek a reduction of Harrell\u2019s sentence was contingent upon what it deemed to be Harrell\u2019s substantial assistance, and the Government explicitly retained the right to withdraw the motion if Harrell failed to fulfill his continuing obligation to provide that substantial assistance. Thus, we find that the district court did not err by denying Harrell\u2019s motion to reconsider its order granting the Government\u2019s withdrawal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Moreover, whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a Rule 35(b) motion is a matter left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Pridgen, </em>64 F.3d 147,150 (4th Cir.1995). In its order denying Harrell\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the district court explicitly stated that it had enough information to make a decision without the need for a hearing. Thus, we find that the district court\u2019s failure to grant such a hearing did not amount to an abuse of discretion. In any event, Harrell has had the opportunity to be heard, once by the district court in his motion for reconsideration, and now by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Harrell\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
