The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Ango\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-23\">Ango first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2003). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>318 F.3d 1226, 1229-30 (10th Cir.2003); Moli<em>na-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Ango next challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that he failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying relief, we find that the immigration judge did not err in finding that Ango failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d or show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would face torture if returned to Gabon. <em>See 8 C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 <em>1208.16(c)(2) (2008) </em>(stating that to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d); <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Finally, Ango claims that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). To the extent that Ango argues that the summary affirmance procedure violates his rights under the Due Process Clause, we find this challenge to be without merit. <em>See Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003); <em>cf. Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2003) (rejecting a retroactivity challenge to the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure and concluding that \u201callowing summary opinions in clear cases is nothing more than a procedural change that does not affect substantive rights\u201d). We further reject Ango\u2019s argument that the Board violated his due process rights in deciding to streamline his particular case and find that summary affirmance was appropriate in his case under the factors set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Accordingly, we deny Ango\u2019s petition for review. We dispense -with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
