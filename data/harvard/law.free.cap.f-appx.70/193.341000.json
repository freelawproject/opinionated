Badio, federal prisoner number 28747-077, appeals from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he challenged his 1996 guilty-plea conviction for making a false claim against a United States federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. Because Badio challenged errors that allegedly occurred at his sentencing, the district court construed his petition as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Afforded liberal construction, Badio argues on appeal that he is entitled to application of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. However, Badio has failed to show that the remedies provided for under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
