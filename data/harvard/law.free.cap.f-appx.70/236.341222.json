Carter, Louisiana state prisoner #333544, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust his prison administrative remedies. Carter argues that he attempted to exhaust his prison remedies in the East Baton Rough Parish Prison system, but received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">The exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits regardless of the forms of relief sought or the remedies offered by the administrative procedures. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 739, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Carter was therefore required to' exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Clifford v. Gibbs, </em>298 F.3d 328, 332 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">Although defenses may be available to the exhaustion requirement, Carter has failed to assert any valid basis for the assertion of a defense. <em>See Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Carter\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
