He appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a $2,000 f\u00edne, arguing that the district court erred reversibly by imposing a f\u00edne based on his ability to earn money while in prison. Lopez argues that 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 345.35(a) prohibits deportable aliens from placement in Federal Prison Industries (\u201cFPI\u201d) jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Because Lopez does not argue and has not demonstrated that he is \u201ccurrently under an order of deportation, exclusion, or removal,\u201d he has not shown that he is ineligible for an FPI job assignment under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 345.35(a). The district court\u2019s determination that Lopez has the future ability to pay the fine through prison earnings is not clearly erroneous. Moreover, the fact of deportability alone does not prevent the imposition of a fine. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>227 F.3d 43 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Lopez also argues, for the first time on appeal, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. Lopez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule that decision. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing Lopez under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
