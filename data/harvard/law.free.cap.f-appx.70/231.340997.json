Bejarano argues that the IJ failed to address his claim of past persecution and erroneously found his testimony not credible. He asserts that he established a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence in the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-</em>Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
