Martinez\u2019s arrest and conviction followed an investigation that included the monitoring of his cellular telephone, as authorized by a wiretap order issued by a United States district judge pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(7). Martinez, arguing that the affidavits submitted to obtain that authorization neither supported a finding of probable cause nor established that a wiretap was necessary, contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the wiretap and the evidence obtained therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">Although in our review of the denial of a motion to suppress we generally resolve the question of probable cause <em>de novo </em>as a matter of law <em>where </em>all the relevant underlying facts are undisputed, <em>see United States v. Portillo-Aguirre, </em>311 F.3d 647, 651-652 (5th Cir.2002), we review the decision to authorize a wiretap for clear error. <em>United States v. Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d 1369, 1376 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, where the judge issuing a wiretap order \u201cuses common sense and bases her finding on the entire picture presented to her, our review is limited,\u201d and that judge\u2019s \u201cdetermination is conclusive in the absence of arbitrariness.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>866 F.2d 781, 786 (5th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>United States v. Weinrich, </em>586 F.2d 481, 487 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">The affidavits of FBI agents Michael LaPlante and Dennis Kintigh constitute a substantial basis for the district court\u2019s probable cause determination, and the court\u2019s decision was not arbitrary. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>866 F.2d 781, 786 (5th Cir.1989). The Government adequately showed that \u201cnormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(c); <em>see also United States v. Webster, </em>734 F.2d 1048, 1055 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
