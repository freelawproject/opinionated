The court ordered that Green\u2019s suit continue as to remaining claims. This Court may exercise jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tion only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Because it does not dispose of all of his \u00a7 1983 claims, the order Green seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
