Justice argues the district court mischaracterized the most serious violation of his supervised release as a Class B violation rather than a Class C violation. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">Justice was convicted in 1998 following his guilty plea to distributing cocaine, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (2000), for which he received a twenty-seven month prison term followed by a three-year term of supervised release, which commenced in July 2000. However, at a hearing in April 2003, Justice essentially admitted to violating his supervision in several respects,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including a positive test for methamphetamine. Rather than challenging the majority of the charged violations, Justice argued only that his positive drug test amounted to a Class C violation rather than a Class B violation for sentencing purposes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the base statutory maximum for the possession that could be inferred from his positive test is one year. <em>See United States v. Trotter, </em>270 F.3d 1150, 1153-54 (7th Cir.2001) (discussing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 (2000)); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3) (2002). Finding Justice\u2019s \u00a7 841 conviction qualified him for the higher, two-year maximum term of imprisonment under \u00a7 844, the district court concluded the violation constituted a Class B violation, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), and imposed a ten-month sentence followed by twenty-six months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of a ten-month custodial sentence, for two reasons. First, Justice\u2019s arguments are premised on the policy statements of Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, which are advisory and nonbinding. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). Second, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Justice\u2019s positive urine screen amounted to a Class B felony. <em>See Trotter, </em>270 F.3d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Accordingly, we affirm revocation of Justice\u2019s supervised release and his ten-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. Following Justice\u2019s objection to an allegation that he had violated the terms of his supervised release by committing larceny, the United States withdrew that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-23\">. Given Justice\u2019s criminal history, the sentencing range for a Class C violation was four to ten months, whereas a Class B violation entailed a six to twelve month sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
