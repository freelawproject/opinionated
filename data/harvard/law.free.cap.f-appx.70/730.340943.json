He raises three claims in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">First, Davis argues the district court erred in refusing his motion to continue at the outset of trial. A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983); <em>United States v. Speed, </em>53 F.3d 643, 644 (4th Cir.1995). An abuse of discretion in this context is \u201c \u2018an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for a delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. LaRouche, </em>896 F.2d 815, 823 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Davis\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Second, Davis contends that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress his statements that he owned firearms found in his store when he was arrested there. Davis claims these statements were given without proper warning in accordance with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its disposition of a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). We find that because Davis\u2019s questioning was justified by the public safety exception to <em>Miranda, see New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), the district court properly denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Lastly, Davis claims the Government did not establish that the seized firearms and ammunition were in and affected interstate commerce beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury\u2019s verdict is reviewed to determine whether there is substantial evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Government, to support the conviction. <em>Glasser v. United States, 315 </em>U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction \u201cmust overcome a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Hoyte, </em>51 F.3d 1239, 1243 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">At trial, James Berger, a special agent with the Bureau of Acohol, Tobacco and Firearms, testified that the shotguns were manufactured outside of North Carolina. The Government may establish the commerce nexus by showing the firearm was manufactured in another state. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Nathan, </em>202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>F.3d 230, 234 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, the evidence presented at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, was sufficient to establish that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Davis\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
