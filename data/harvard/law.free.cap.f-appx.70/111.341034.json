The district court sentenced Turner to a total of 228 months incarceration, four years of supervised release, and ordered Turner to pay a special assessment and a restitution fee. Turner timely appealed, asserting the district court erred in two sentencing determinations related to his involvement in a drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-26\">First, Turner asserts the district court erred in calculating the drug quantity for which he was liable. We review this claim for clear error. <em>United States v. D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 614 (4th Cir.1994). The district court based its determination on competent evidence. <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 211 (4th Cir.1999). Thus, Turner\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-27\">Second, Turner asserts the district court erred in enhancing his sentence un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>der <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(5)(C) (2001), based on its determination that Turner exposed his minor children to a substantial risk of harm by manufacturing drugs in their residence. In reviewing the district court\u2019s findings, we review factual determinations for clear error and legal questions de novo; mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under a standard that gives due deference to the district court. <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003 (4th Cir.1996). Because Turner stored and used dangerous manufacturing materials in his residence, the enhancement was properly applied. USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(5)(C), comment. (n.20).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Turner\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
