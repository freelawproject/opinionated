Rodriguez and David G. Rodriguez petition this court for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing their appeal from the denial of their applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-23\">The Rodriguezes argue that the Immigration Judge (IJ) and the BIA erroneously concluded that the Rodriguezes each failed to show that they qualified for asylum. They argue that the IJ failed to consider evidence of persecution, including David\u2019s dismissal fi-om his job, his subsequent unsuccessful attempts to obtain legal redress, and threats against the family. After reviewing the evidence, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s finding that the Rodriguezes were not refugees eligible for asylum was supported by reasonable and substantial evidence and that the Rodriguezes failed to show that the evidence they presented \u201cwas such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>See I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-24\">The Rodriguezes also argue that because they were proceeding <em>pro se, </em>the Id\u2019s failure to provide additional assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>in the factual development of their claims denied them a full and fair opportunity to present their claims. This court, however, has held that an IJ has no duty \u201cto develop the facts necessary to prove [the alien\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Lopez-Rodriguez v. I.N.S., </em>No. 93-05242 at *15, 20 F.3d 467 (5th Cir. Mar. 24, 1994) (unpublished).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b804-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
