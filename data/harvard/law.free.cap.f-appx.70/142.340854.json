Nichols\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Although notified of her right to do so, Nichols has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Counsel suggests that the court may have erred in denying Nichols an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility based on her unrelated criminal conduct. The district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility is factual, and we review it with great deference for clear error. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5) (2000); <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It is undisputed that Nichols was arrested for committing new criminal offenses after being released on bond for the instant offense. The district court may consider whether a defendant has voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct in deciding whether she has accepted responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(b)). In light of Nichols\u2019 intervening arrest, the district court did not clearly err in denying the reduction. <em>See United States v. Kidd, </em>12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993) (finding that defendant\u2019s continued criminal conduct is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We have reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
