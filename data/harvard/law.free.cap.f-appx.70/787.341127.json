Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The plaintiff, Citizen D. \u201cK\u201d Stewart, has filed a notice of appeal and motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) from the district court\u2019s February 4, 2003, order. In that order, the district court denied Stewart\u2019s motion for relief from judgment or order, which challenged the district court\u2019s January 22, 2003, order denying service by the United States Marshal without prepayment of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Federal appellate courts have jurisdiction over appeals only from (1) final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; (2) orders that are deemed final due to jurisprudential exception or which can be properly certified as final pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); and (3) interlocutory orders that fall into specific classes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), or which can be properly certified for appeal by the district court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). <em>Askanase v. Livingwell, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 807, 809-10 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir. 1988). The district court\u2019s February 4, 2003, order is not final or otherwise appealable. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Stewart\u2019s motion for IFP is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
