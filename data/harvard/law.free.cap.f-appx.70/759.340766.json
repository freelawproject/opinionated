After filing an answer in which they demanded London arbitration pursuant to the terms of a charter party and other contracts of carriage, Satin and SAMAMA moved to dismiss, or, in the alternative, to stay this action pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-25\">The district court ruled that Satin and SAMAMA\u2019s inaction in failing to respond to correspondence from Cargill (delivered five and a half months before defendants\u2019 answer), insist on arbitration, or nominate an arbitrator constituted a waiver of the right to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-26\">Pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), Satin and SAMAMA appeal. The refusal to stay an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>action pending arbitration is reviewed <em>de novo. See Steel Warehouse Co., Inc. v. Abalone Shipping Ltd. of Nicosai, </em>141 F.3d 234, 236-37 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Prejudice to the party opposing arbitration is determinative of waiver. <em>E.g., Price v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., </em>791 F.2d 1156, 1162 (5th Cir.1986). \u201cNormally, waiver occurs when a party initially pursues litigation and then reverses course and attempts to arbitrate, but waiver can also result from \u2018some overt act in Court that evinces a desire to resolve the arbitrable dispute through litigation rather than arbitration\u2019.\u201d <em>Texaco Exploration and Prod. Co. v. AmClyde Engineered Prods. Co., Inc., </em>243 F.3d 906, 911 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Subway Equipment Leasing Corp. v. Forte, </em>169 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.1999)). In this analysis, \u201c[tjhere is a strong presumption <em>against </em>waiver, and any doubts ... must be resolved in favor of arbitration\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Cargill contends delay and inaction by Satin and SAMAMA has hindered resolution of this matter. Delay, as well as the extent of the movant\u2019s participation in judicial proceedings, is a material factor in assessing prejudice <em>vel non. Price, </em>791 F.2d at 1161. \u201c[M]ere delay[, however,] falls far short of the waiver requirements----\u201d <em>Texaco, </em>243 F.3d at 912. Moreover, \u201cgeneralized protestations about the costs of delay are insufficient\u201d to establish waiver. <em>Walker v. J.C. Bradford &amp; Co., </em>938 F.2d 575, 578 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Cargill\u2019s contention is further undermined by <em>Tenneco Resins, Inc. v. Davy Int'l AG, </em>770 F.2d 416, 421 (5th Cir.1985): \u201c[W]hen only a minimal amount of discovery has been conducted ... the court should not ordinarily infer waiver based upon prejudice to the party opposing the motion to stay litigation ... particularly when ... the defendant clearly stated the desire to arbitrate the matter in its original answer....\" As noted, Satin and SA-MAMA raised the arbitrability of the dispute in their original answer. Moreover, Cargill does not contend they took advantage of, or even participated in, the discovery process. Cargill has failed to show it has been materially prejudiced by the delay; therefore, it has failed to overcome the strong federal presumption in favor of arbitration. <em>See e.g., Walker, </em>938 F.2d at 578. Restated, Satin and SAMAMA have not waived their right to arbitration. Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
