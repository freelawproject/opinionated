Having reviewed the record de novo, <em>see Moore v. Sims, </em>200 F.3d 1170, 1171 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Miles\u2019s claims because the South Dakota Department of Social Services and the United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services enjoy sovereign immunity, and Miles\u2019s claims against the third defendant (his ex-wife) are not properly brought in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal, but we modify it to reflect that the dismissal is without prejudice to any remedies Miles might have in state court or under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a). We also deny the pending motion for a hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-31\">. The Honorable Richard H.
