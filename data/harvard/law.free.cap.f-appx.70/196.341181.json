At the heart of that court\u2019s two-phase dismissal of the multiple claims asserted by Belk is his protracted failure to comply with the court\u2019s two orders that Belk amend his complaint to state grounds on which relief could be granted. Despite Belk\u2019s numerous accusations against defendants, defense counsel, and even the district court, the only issue cognizable on this appeal is the court\u2019s orders of dismissal, which we review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">We have painstakingly reviewed the record on appeal and the assertions of the parties in their appellate briefs. As a result, we are firmly convinced that the district court committed no legal error and did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Belk\u2019s claims. We therefore affirm the rulings appealed by Belk.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">Furthermore, we have observed with concern the essentially conclusional accusations leveled by Belk at, among others, the district court. Although that court was exceedingly tolerant of this <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s vituperative and - to our satisfaction - unfounded attacks on the court\u2019s motives and integrity, we are less tolerant. Belk\u2019s largely unsupported accusations and their vituperative tenor seriously approach - and likely cross - the line separating vigorous advocacy and sanctionable behavior. We caution Belk that any further displays of this nature will expose him to the full panoply of sanctions at the disposal of the courts, including contempt. AFFIRMED at Appellant\u2019s cost.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
