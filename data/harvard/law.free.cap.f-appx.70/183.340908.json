Williams appeals the district court\u2019s judgment that affirmed the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>sion of the Commissioner of Social Security denying disability benefits. Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards and whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 292 (5th Cir.1992). Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1021-22 (5th Cir.1990). We may not reweigh the evidence or try the issues <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1022. The record shows that the ALJ applied the proper legal standards and that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Anthony, </em>954 F.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Williams argues that the Commissioner failed to consider her obesity when she determined that Williams could perform her past relevant work. Because obesity was one of Williams\u2019s asserted claims for disability and because the Commissioner found that Williams had a combination of impairments considered \u201csevere\u201d, Williams\u2019s argument is unavailing. <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 393 (5th Cir.2000) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1523).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">She also argues that the Commissioner erred by failing to conduct a function-by-function analysis in light of all Williams\u2019s impairments. Although the Commissioner did not consider each function of Williams\u2019s past work, there was no conflicting evidence and substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s finding. <em>Myers v. Apfel, </em>238 F.3d 617, 620 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
