Chavez appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a $500 fine, arguing that the district court erred reversibly by imposing a fine based on his ability to earn money while in prison. Chavez argues that 28 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00a7 345.35(a) prohibits deportable aliens from placement in Federal Prison Industries (\u201cFPI\u201d) jobs. Chavez also contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Chavez did not raise below the issue of inability to work in prison, so we will review it for plain error only. Because Chavez does not argue and has not demonstrated that he is \u201ccurrently under an order of deportation, exclusion, or removal,\u201d he has not shown that he in ineligible for an FPI job assignment under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 345.35(a). The district court\u2019s determination that Chavez has the future ability to pay the f\u00edne through prison earnings is not clearly, much less plainly, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Chavez\u2019 contention that the enhancement provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional lacks merit because <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Chavez\u2019 sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
