The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. See <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if \u201c \u2018no amendment [in the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067 (quoting <em>Conisten Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>844 F.2d 461, 463 (7th Cir.1988)). In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, the court must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save [her] action by merely amending [her] complaint.\u201d <em>Domino Sugar, </em>10 F.3d at 1066-67. In this case, Greenway may move in the district court to reopen her case and to file an amended complaint specifically alleging facts sufficient to state a claim within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (2000). Therefore, the dismissal order is not appealable. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
