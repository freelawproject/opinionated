We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See King v. Town of Waynesville, </em>No. CA-02-55-1-T (W.D.N.C. filed Apr. 14, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>entered Apr. 15, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
