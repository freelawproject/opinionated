She argues that her petition was timely filed and served under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which she contends should be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-26\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201capply to civil actions removed to the United States district courts from the state courts and govern procedure <em>after removal.\u201d </em>Fed. R. Crv. P. 81(c) (emphasis added); <em>see also Matter of Meyerland, </em>960 F.2d 512, 520 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc) (\u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>case removed from state court simply comes into the federal system in the same condition in which it left the state system.\u201d). Accordingly, because O\u2019Carolan\u2019s case originated in state court, and the events relevant to its timeliness occurred prior to its removal, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not govern the issue whether O\u2019Carolan tolled the applicable statute of limitations while her case was pending in Texas state court. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c); <em>Meyerland, </em>960 F.2d at 520. Because O\u2019Carolan\u2019s claim is time barred in state court, <em>Hansler v. Mainka, </em>807 S.W.2d 3, 5 (Tex.App.Corpus Christi 1991), it is also time barred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
