Because the record contains substantial evidence that Crouse\u2019s conditions do not render him unable to engage in any regular employment within the meaning of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(v), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Section 2(a)(l)(v) of the Railroad Retirement Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) provides that an individual who has completed ten years of service shall be entitled to an annuity, upon application, if a permanent physical or mental condition renders him unable to engage in any regular employment. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(v) (2000). As set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.100, to be entitled to an annuity, Crouse had to demonstrate to the hearings officer that he was \u201cdisabled for any regular employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">After an independent and thorough review of the evidence before him, the hearings officer found that Crouse\u2019s claimed physical and mental impairments (including anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, stress-related disorders, heart problems, sleep apnea, degenerative disc disease, hepatitis C and heart and liver problems) did not render him unable to engage in any regular employment, that is, none of his impairments considered alone nor his impairments in combination significantly limit his physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(v); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 220.100. In a detailed order, the determination of the hearings officer was upheld by a majority of the railroad retirement board (a three-member panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s determination that Crouse\u2019s conditions do not render him unable to engage in any regular employment within the meaning of \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(v). <em>See Elzy v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>782 F.2d 1223, 1224 (5th Cir.1986) (holding that the board\u2019s findings are \u201cconclusive\u201d if they are supported by substantial evidence); <em>Davis v. Schweiker, </em>641 F.2d 283, 285 (5th Cir.1981) (describing the substantial evidence standard as requiring more than a mere scintilla of evidence but cautioning against substituting our judgment for that of the board); <em>see also Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (stating that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d is evidence consisting of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d). Crouse\u2019s contention that the board\u2019s determination requires reversal because the board did not consider the side-effects of his medication is belied by the opinion of the board, which clearly considers this argument on the second page of the opinion. Crouse\u2019s only other contention \u2014 that reversal is required because the board did not consider all of Crouse\u2019s ailments in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>aggregate \u2014 lacks merit. It is clear from the record (which includes the sixty-five page transcript of the hearing before the hearings officer for the railroad retirement board) that the board carefully analyzed the work of the hearings officer, who thoroughly reviewed the evidence regarding the combination of Crouse\u2019s numerous ailments. In addition to reviewing Crouse\u2019s numerous medical records and examination reports from Crouse\u2019s treating physicians (including the statement from Dr. Bonchak, one of Crouse\u2019s treating physicians, as well as statements and notations from other treating physicians, radiologists, chiropractors and a consulting physician), the hearings officer and the board reviewed Crouse\u2019s work history, Crouse\u2019s record of daily activities, and testimony from a vocational consultant and from Crouse himself. This record evidence abundantly supports the board\u2019s finding</p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
