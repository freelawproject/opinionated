Scott does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that, on at least three prior occasions while incarcerated, he has brought an action or appeal in a United States court that has been dismissed as frivolous and/or for failure to state a claim. Instead, he argues that he falls within the \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-21\">A review of the record and Scott\u2019s appellate brief reveals that he has failed to establish that he was \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d at the time that he filed his notice of appeal IFP. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, his IFP status is decertified, all outstanding motions are denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See id. </em>Should Scott wish to reinstate his appeal, he has 30 days from the date of this opinion to pay the full appellate filing fee to the clerk of the district court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-22\">IFP DECERTIFIED. ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED. APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
