He argues that the district court erred by not granting his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove venue in the Western District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-18\">Rodriguez failed to timely raise a venue objection. <em>See United States v. Carreon-Palacio, </em>267 F.3d 381, 392-93 (5th Cir. 2001). Thus, he did not preserve the issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-23\">This appeal lacks merit and borders on frivolity. Accordingly, Rodriguez\u2019s attorney is cautioned against bringing such appeals in the future. We remind him of his obligations to refrain from raising frivolous issues on appeal and to avail himself of the procedures outlined in <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) for disposing of cases that present no nonfrivolous issues. <em>See United States v. Humphrey, </em>7 F.3d 1186, 1191 (5th Cir.1993). We also admonish him that all counsel are subject to sanctions for bringing frivolous appeals. <em>See United States v. Burleson, </em>22 F.3d 93, 95 (5th Cir.1994). Because Rodriguez failed to preserve the sole issue raised on appeal, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
