See <em>United States v. Jett, </em>63 Fed. Appx. 155 (4th Cir.2003). In the petition for rehearing, Marshall asserts that we erred in applying a plain error standard of review to his claim that the district court erred by imposing a five-year term of supervised release when it resentenced him because no more than a three-year term was authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3). Upon a review of the record, we find that Marshall is correct as to his argument with respect to plain error, for he did raise this issue at resentencing and on appeal, and we should have applied a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. See <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 218 (4th Cir.1989). We therefore rehear the case and issue this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review on rehearing, we nevertheless affirm the holding of the district court based on our holding in <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 647 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that the statutory cap in \u00a7 3583 \u201cdoes not apply to statutes, such as \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), whose own mandatory <em>minimum </em>periods of supervised release are the same as, or exceed, the <em>maximum </em>periods provided by \u00a7 3583\u201d). Marshall suggests that we overrule <em>Pratt; </em>however, a panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel. <em>Mentavlos v. Anderson, </em>249 F.3d 301, 312 n. 4 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>With respect to the other issues raised in the petition for rehearing, we are of opinion these claims are meritless. We therefore affirm the sentences imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">There has been no request for a poll of the Court on the petition for rehearing en banc; therefore, the petition for rehearing en banc is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
