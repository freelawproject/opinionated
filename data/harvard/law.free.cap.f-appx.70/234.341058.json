He argues that the district court erroneously assigned him two criminal history points for a June 1993 juvenile adjudication because there was no evidence that he was released from confinement for that adjudication within five years of his commencement of the instant offenses as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A); that the district court erroneously enhanced his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing firearms in connection with the drug-related offenses; and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">We conclude that the arguments raised by Johnson under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A) and 2Dl.l(b)(l) were not sufficiently preserved for review, and, thus, the district court\u2019s application of these sentencing guidelines are reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 671 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1434 (5th Cir.1995). There is no plain error relative to the district court\u2019s alleged miscalculation of Johnson\u2019s criminal history score because the district court could, on remand, impose the same sentence. <em>See United States v. Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d 865, 871 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">As it was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the firearms found in Johnson\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house were connected to the charged offenses, there was no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3); <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>161 F.3d 909, 912 (5th Cir.1998)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-19\">As a general rule, Sixth Amendment claims of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be litigated on direct appeal unless they were adequately raised in the district court. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>55 F.3d 173, 179 (5th Cir.1995). Even though Johnson did not specifically raise this claim in the district court, the record provides sufficient detail to allow this court to make a determination of the merits of the claim. <em>See United States v. Saenz-Forero, </em>27 F.3d 1016, 1021 (5th Cir.1994) (failure of counsel to object to 16-level sentencing enhancement). As was discussed above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the district court correctly applied the enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b); therefore Johnson cannot show that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise it at sentencing. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-16\"> Pursuant to 5m Cir.
