The Board summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7). <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">The IJ found that Naadubon failed to file timely his application for asylum. This ruling, which Naadubon has not challenged, is not reviewable by a court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>318 F.3d 1226, 1229-30 (10th Cir.2003). Accordingly, as to the denial of the asylum application, the petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">Naadubon\u2019s petition for review of the denial of withholding of removal is denied because the Board\u2019s ruling is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-20\">Naadubon has waived any challenge to the Board\u2019s denial of his application for voluntary departure, by failing to brief it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-21\">The petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Naadubon\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel is DENIED, because such appointment would conflict with this country\u2019s immigration policy. <em>See Perez-Perez v. Hanberry, </em>781 F.2d 1477, 1480 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
