The indictment did not include an allegation of drug quantity, and the jury did not make a finding on that issue. For a variety of reasons, Garcia argues that the district court erred in attributing 4,354.56 kilograms of marijuana to him for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-26\">Because Garcia\u2019s sentence exceeded the default provision of 20 years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), this court assesses the evidence of drug quantity to determine if it is \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted\u201d that Garcia was responsible for at least 100 kilograms of marijuana to justify his enhanced sentence of nearly 27 years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(vii); <em>United States v. Bap</em>tiste,, 309 F.3d 274, 276 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1621, 155 L.Ed.2d 489 (2003); <em>United States v. Randle, </em>304 F.3d 373, 377 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1748, 155 L.Ed.2d 514 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The parties stipulated that law enforcement agents seized approximately 200 kilograms of marijuana from a storage facility that was leased by Garcia. The stipulation more than adequately supports Garcia\u2019s enhanced sentence. Furthermore, the testimony of Garcia\u2019s co-conspirators constitutes overwhelming evidence that he conspired to possess with intent to distribute at least 100 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See Baptiste, </em>309 F.3d at 278. Therefore, any error by the district court in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
