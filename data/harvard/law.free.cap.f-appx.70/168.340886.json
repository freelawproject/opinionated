Following an evidentiary hearing, the immigration judge (IJ) found FajardoEstrada removable on the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(E)\u00ae of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, for knowingly encouraging, inducing, assisting, abetting, or aiding another alien to enter or trying to enter the United States in violation of law, based on his conviction for aiding and abetting illegal entry, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(3). The IJ also denied his application for cancellation of removal and denied his request for voluntary departure. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Fajardo-Estrada argues that the BIA violated his right to due process by affirming his appeal without opinion. He argues that because the BIA did not give an explanation for its decision, he has no indication that his appeal received any consideration on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">This court rejected a due process challenge to the \u201cstreamlining\u201d regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7), which authorizes a single Board member to affirm, without opinion, the results of an immigration judge\u2019s decision, in <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). This court held that the summary affirmance procedures do not violate due process and do not deprive the court of a basis for judicial review. We agreed with the First Circuit\u2019s statements in <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365 (1st Cir.2003), that the use of the summary affirmance procedures do not lead to the inference that the BIA did not conduct the required review. <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">Fajardo-Estrada does not argue that his case did not meet the criteria for application of the streamlined review procedures contained in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(h). Nor does he argue that the decision in his case is not supported by substantial evidence, and thus, he has abandoned the merits of his immigration appeal. <em>Brinkmann v.

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
