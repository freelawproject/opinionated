Braxton, a state prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order substantially accepting the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge and denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). The order is appeal-able only if a circuit judge of justice issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). An inmate satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Braxton has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. Further, we deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Braxton\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
