R.Crim.P. 35(b). In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Breit, </em>754 F.2d 526, 528 (4th Cir.1985) (applying ten-day appeal period to Rule 35 motion). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-22\">The district court entered its order denying the motion for reduction of sentence on October 15, 2002; the ten-day appeal period expired on October 25, 2002. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Fed. R.App. P. 26.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Christian filed his notice of appeal after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remanded the case to the district court for a determination of whether Christian demonstrated excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The district court concluded that Christian failed to demonstrate excusable neglect or good cause and we find no abuse of discretion. <em>Breit, 754 </em>F.2d at 528 (providing standard of review). Because he failed to timely file an appeal or obtain an extension for filing an appeal, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Christian\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\"> Effective December 1, 2002, Rule 26 was revised to exclude \"intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays\u201d when the time period is less than eleven days.
