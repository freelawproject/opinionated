Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">On appeal, Cetera first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt, specifically that he knew that the vehicle contained a large quantity of ecstacy. A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and inquire whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Bur-gos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>See United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). Our review of the record convinces us that the evidence was sufficient to establish Cetera\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-20\">Cetera next argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to retake the stand after he completed his testimony and testify regarding alleged prior consistent statements. We review a district court\u2019s rulings admitting or excluding evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 423 (4th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1253, 154 L.Ed.2d 1018 (2003). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing its rule placing limits on direct and cross-examination of witnesses, or in concluding that the statements in question were not admissible as prior consistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We therefore affirm Cetera\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
