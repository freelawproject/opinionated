He argues that the district court erred (1) by enhancing his offense level by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), (2) by departing upward by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, and (3) by including special conditions of supervised release in its written judgment that were not orally pronounced at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-24\">Badillo argues that his felony convictions for possession of cocaine were not \u201caggravated felonies\u201d warranting an eight-level enhancement but were instead \u201cother felonies\u201d warranting only a four-level enhancement. A prior conviction is an aggravated felony \u201cif (1) the offense was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act and (2) it was a felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997). Badillo\u2019s arguments were rejected in <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We affirm an upward departure \u201cif (1) the [district] court gives acceptable reasons for departing and (2) the extent of the departure is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Route, </em>104 F.3d 59, 64 (5th Cir.1997). The district court provided acceptable reasons for departing upward pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 by citing Badillo\u2019s five previous felony convictions and his history of recidivism, and the four-level departure and additional 16 months\u2019 imprisonment were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Badillo argues that the district court erred by including in the written judgment special conditions of supervised release that were not stated at the sentencing hearing. We recently held that the inclusion in the written judgment of a condition requiring additional drug testing, even if that condition was not orally pronounced, does not create a conflict between the oral and \u2022written judgments. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Badillo\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly delegated to the Probation Department the authority to determine his ability to pay is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Warden, </em>291 F.3d 363, 364-65 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 935, 123 S.Ct. 35, 154 L.Ed.2d 236 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
