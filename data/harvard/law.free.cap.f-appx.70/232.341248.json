Celestine seeks a declaratory judgment that his 1964 Louisiana state court conviction for simple burglary was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-23\">A state may waive its defense of sovereign immunity, <em>Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Schacht, </em>524 U.S. 381, 389, 118 S.Ct. 2047, 141 L.Ed.2d 364 (1998), but the 27th Judicial District Court did not do so. Celestine\u2019s complaint against the 27th Judicial District Court does not fall within the exception created by <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 159-60, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>714 (1908). <em>See Aguilar v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>160 F.3d 1052, 1054 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Celestine may not obtain a declaratory judgment invalidating his burglary conviction. <em>Johnson v. Onion, </em>761 F.2d 224, 226 (5th Cir.1985). Furthermore, he has failed to state a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Celestine\u2019s complaint falls within the purview of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), even though his sentence has expired and he is not seeking damages. <em>See Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998). Celestine\u2019s proposed amendment to name the state judge who handled his conviction as a defendant is baseless because the judge is protected by absolute immunity. <em>See Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
