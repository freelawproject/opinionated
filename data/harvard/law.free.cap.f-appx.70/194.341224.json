Reviewing the dismissal <em>de novo, Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., 188 </em>F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Wafer sued the Postmaster General for discrimination and breach of a labor agreement. The district court dismissed that suit, based partly on the defendants\u2019 affidavits. Wafer then sued defendants, essentially for lying in their affidavits. She cryptically accused them of libel, obstruction of justice, perjury, misuse of process, and abuse of office. The district court dismissed, holding that the defendants had absolute immunity for statements made as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">Although Wafer does not specify whether her suit arises under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), or the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq., </em>the source of law makes no difference. Witnesses have absolute immunity from a <em>Bivens </em>action based on their testimony. <em>Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 334, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); <em>Charles v. Wade, </em>665 F.2d 661, 666 (Former 5th Cir.1982). Louisiana law also gives non-party witnesses absolute immunity from damages based on their former testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Marrogi v. Howard, </em>805 So.2d 1118, 1126 (La.2002). Defendants are therefore entitled to absolute immunity in any event.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-15\">. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, we apply the law of the state in which the events occurred. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b)(1), 2674; <em>Brown, </em>188 F.3d at 586. Louisiana law gives a non-party witness absolute immunity only for \"pertinent and material\u201d testimony, <em>Marrogi, </em>805 So.2d at 1126, but Wafer concedes that the defendants\u2019 affidavits were relevant to her earlier suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-21\">. To the extent that any defendants are not federal officers for purposes of <em>Bivens </em>or the Federal Tort Claims Act, the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over Wafer\u2019s claims against them, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, and they too have absolute immunity from her claims, <em>Marrogi, </em>805 So.2d at 1126.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
