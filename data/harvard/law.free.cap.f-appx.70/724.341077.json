The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Mengesha\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-20\">On appeal, Mengesha\u2019s sole claim is that the Board erred in designating her case as appropriate for affirmance without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). This section allows a single Board member to enter an order affirming the result of the immigration judge\u2019s decision if the result reached is correct; any errors are harmless or nonmaterial; and either the issue on appeal is squarely controlled by Board or federal circuit court precedent and does not involve application of precedent to a novel fact situation, or the factual and legal questions raised are so insubstantial that three-member review is not warranted. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a) (7)(ii). We reject Mengesha\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of the procedure in her case based on our finding that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">Accordingly, we deny Mengesha\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
