He contends that the district court erred in setting his base offense level at 20 pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) based on the court\u2019s determination that Danek\u2019s prior Maryland conviction for reckless endangerment was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He also contends that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by two pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) on account of his leadership role in recruiting his wife to participate in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">There is no support in the record for Danek\u2019s assertion, made for the first time on appeal, that he was convicted of reckless endangerment following plea bargaining on a different charge. Danek concedes that the Maryland reckless-endangerment statute describes a crime of violence under the guidelines. Thus, it was not plain error for the district court to determine that Danek had been convicted of a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Serna, </em>309 F.3d 859, 862 (5th Cir.2002); <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1327, 154 L.Ed.2d 1078 (2003); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). It is unnecessary to address Danek\u2019s argument that, absent this asserted error, he would have been eligible for an offense level of six.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">At sentencing, Danek waived the argument that his wife was not a \u201cparticipant\u201d in the offense for purposes of the two-level enhancement; the issue therefore is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931-32 (5th Cir.1995). Even if it were reviewable, there was no plain error because the record supports a determination that Danek\u2019s wife participated knowingly in the offense. <em>See United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 396 (5th Cir.2000). The district court did not err in determining that Danek was a leader in the offense. <em>See United States v. Giralda, </em>111 F.3d 21, 24-25 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
