California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Shutter has responded to counsel\u2019s motion and has moved to withdraw the <em>Anders </em>brief and for appointment of counsel. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s motion and <em>Anders </em>brief, Shutter\u2019s response, and the record and we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED; counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein; Shutter\u2019s motion to withdraw the <em>Anders </em>brief and for appointment of counsel is DENIED; and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b805-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
