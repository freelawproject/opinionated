Reyes appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Commissioner determined that Reyes was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act at the fifth step of the disability determination, after considering the testimony of a vocational expert. Reyes argues that the Commissioner erred in discounting the opinion of a treating physician, Dr. Perez-Rodriguez, and erred in relying on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony because the hypothetical question posed to the expert did not account for all of his impairments and there was no finding under <em>Watson v. Barnhart, </em>288 F.3d 212 (5th Cir.2002), that Reyes would be able to maintain employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The administrative record reflects that there was good cause for not according controlling weight to Dr. Perez-Rodriguez\u2019s opinion, which was brief, conclusional, and inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994). The hypothetical posed to the vocational expert incorporated all of the impairments and restrictions supported by the record, and the Commissioner therefore correctly relied upon the expert\u2019s opinion in determining that Reyes was not disabled. <em>See Bowling v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir.1994). Reyes identified no impairments that would prevent him from maintaining employment; he thus did not establish the factual predicate required by <em>Watson </em>to necessitate a separate finding on his ability to maintain employment. <em>See Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 619-20 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
