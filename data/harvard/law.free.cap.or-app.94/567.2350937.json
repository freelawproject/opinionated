The trial court denied the motion without making findings of fact or an explanation, and we cannot review the claim of error. <em>See State v. Wise, </em>305 Or 78, 81, 749 P2d 1179 (1988). Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for fact findings on the motion to suppress. <em>State v. Wise, supra; see also State v.
