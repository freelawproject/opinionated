They seek review of final orders terminating their benefits under that program. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In May, 1986, AFSD notified petitioners that, effective July 1, 1986, they would no longer be eligible for the GAMO program,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but could apply for medical benefits under the Medically Needy program. Under the GAMO program, petitioner Hartman paid $129.30 per month to receive medical coverage; petitioners Moon paid approximately $80 per month; and petitioner Rodriguez paid $5.40. Under the Medically Needy program, petitioners must spend a certain amount for medical assistance in each six-month period<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before receiving any benefits. The \u201cspend down\u201d requirement for Hartman at the time of the hearing was $763; for the Moons, $855; and for Rodriguez, $1,653.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In June, 1986, AFSD amended its rule governing eligibility for its Medically Needy program, OAR 461-05-903, to make persons in petitioners\u2019 category eligible for benefits, effective July 1, 1986. OAR 461-05-903(d). AFSD did not, however, at that time amend or repeal the provisions of OAR 461-05-910, which established petitioners\u2019 eligibility for the GAMO program. These provisions were eventually repealed, effective October 7,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Petitioners argue that AFSD\u2019s termination of their benefits under the GAMO program was unlawful, because the provisions of the rule which made them eligible for the program were still in effect when their benefits were terminated. However, although those provisions were in effect, the rule also then provided that \u201c[p]ersons who can qualify for Medicaid are not eligible for [GAMO].\u201d Medicaid eligibility is tied to eligibility for the Medically Needy program. OAR 461-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>05-909(1). Therefore, because petitioners could qualify for the Medically Needy program and, thereby, for Medicaid, they were ineligible for the GAMO program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Petitioners argue that the amendment to the Medically Needy rules did not make them immediately eligible for benefits under that program because it was necessary to meet the \u201cspend down\u201d requirements before receiving benefits and, therefore, they were not immediately disqualified for GAMO. However, the GAMO rule provides that they are disqualified if they <em>\u201ccan </em>qualify for Medicaid.\u201d Petitioners do not contend that they <em>cannot </em>qualify for Medically Needy benefits and, thereby, Medicaid. Their only argument is that it will take them some time to receive benefits. Because they could qualify for Medically Needy benefits at the time of the termination of their GAMO benefits, they were not eligible for GAMO.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Petitioners rely on <em>Burke v. Children\u2019s Services Division, </em>26 Or App 145, 552 P2d 592 (1976), in arguing that AFSD must have repealed or amended the GAMO rule before ending petitioners\u2019 benefits under that program. However, in <em>Burke, </em>CSD attempted to make a significant change in an agency program through the adoption of \u201cinternal management directives,\u201d rather than amendments to its administrative rules. Here, AFSD complied with the rule-making process. The agency gave notice of its proposed program change. The only defect in the process that petitioners alleged is the agency\u2019s failure to amend or repeal the GAMO rule. However, the repeal or amendment of that rule was unnecessary because, as discussed above, the amendment of the Medically Needy rule and the existing language of the GAMO rule made petitioners ineligible for the GAMO program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> Petitioners qualified for the GAMO program under the category of aged, blind and disabled persons who, except for their income level, would qualify for the Oregon Supplemental Income Program. OAR 461-05-910(2) (a) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\"> The six-month budget period for the Medically Needy program was reduced to a one-month period, effective February 1,1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\"> There are other requirements for qualification for Medicaid in addition to having Medically Needy status, but petitioners do not argue they cannot meet them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> Petitioners also argue that AFSD\u2019s later amendment of the rule to eliminate persons in petitioners\u2019 category from the GAMO program was improper, because it was made retroactive to July 1, 1986. However, because we conclude that AFSD\u2019s action in July, 1986, effectively disqualified petitioners from the GAMO program, the later repeal of the rule did not affect them and, therefore, their argument is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
