I told him he need not demur as my sister had authorized me to hand it to him as a loan to the firm ; his firm. I do not remember anything else at that time. The money was Mrs. Brock\u2019s.\u201d On cross-examination: \u201cI did not stipulate for any rate of interest on the money, nor was there any agreement to return it.

The objection was overruled and bill sealed for the defendants.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">. The plaintiff then testified: \u201cI was the wife of Martin Brock and was married to him March 19, 1883. I was divorced from him in January, 1886. The $2,000 was a wedding present from my father. The $500 was my own. I instructed my brother to loan it to the firm. After we were separated in the year 1885, I had an interview with Martin Brock in Philadelphia, and he then said he would return me every cent; he has not returned it or anjr part of it.\u201d On cross-examination : \u201c.....I merely told James to loan the firm the money.....I don\u2019t remember whether I mentioned the name of the firm or not at the time I gave the money to James.....\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-11\">\u2022 Mrs. Minnie H.

It was sometime between the 20th of March and the end of the month. I did not borrow any money from James or Moritz Ertheiler. At the time I was not aware of any loan having been made to the firm by any one. My brother put into the firm $2,500. He put it in on condition that he was to have the right to draw out a good deal of it within a few days. He took out during his connection with the partnership a good deal more than he put in.\u201d On cross-examination: \u201c The firm was composed of Martin Brock and Max Brock; it continued until May, 1884.....He deposited the checks and we had an agreement to form a partnership. I knew nothing of the checks before the 20th of March, 1883.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">Martin Brock testified: \u201c.....I was in New York city in my house the day of my wedding.

So that, if several persons agree to become partners, and contribute each a certain quantity of mon\u00e9y or goods for the joint benefit of all, each one is solely responsible to those who may have supplied him with the money or goods agreed to be contributed by him, and the fact that the money or goods so supplied have been brought in by him as agreed, will not render the firm liable: Col. Part., \u00a7 518, citing Greenslade v. Dower, 7 B. &amp; C. 635; Dickinson v. Valpy, 10 B. &amp; C. 141; and see upon the same point, Story Part., \u00a7 148; and it has been so decided in Pennsylvania: Brooke v. Evans, 5 <em>W. </em>196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-4\">So if a partner borrow money and give his individual note for it, it does not become a partnership debt by reason of the application of the money to partnership purposes: Graeff v. Hitchman, 5 W. 454. And where money is borrowed by one partner for his individual use, and he gives a note of the firm of which he is a member, and the proceeds of the transaction afterwards go into the business of such firm, the other members cannot be held liable, unless the money was put into the business with their knowledge and privity: Clay v. Cottrell, 18 Penn. St. 408. Donnally v. Ryan, 41 Idem 306, presented a much stronger case for the plaintiff than the present one, and yet it was held error to submit it to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-5\">No one appeared for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A4\">Mr. Justice Mercur :</author>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">This suit was against two persons as copartners, one of whom had been the husband of the plaintiff. On the day of their marriage, the money for the recovery of which the suit was brought, was handed to him by her brother. That brother testified in chief that the money was his sister\u2019s; that Martin objected to receiving $500 thereof, but on being informed that she authorized it to be handed to him as a loan to the firm, he accepted it. On cross-examination, however, he testified that he did not stipulate1 for any rate of interest on the money, nor was there any agreement to return it; that he did not know of the existence of the firm before he gave Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Brock tbe money. He further swore that he did not know whose money it was, that his father drew the check for $2,000 and handed it to him, and that he never saw Max Brock, the other partner, in regard to this money.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The unquestioned evidence is that the money was handed to Martin before the copartnership was formed; that Max had no knowledge of any money having been loaned to the firm by any person, and the money received by Martin was not used to pay the debts of the firm. There was no evidence to charge the firm with this money even if Martin did receive it as a loan. The whole evidence pretty clearly indicates that the money was handed to him as a wedding present to him and his bride. Their subsequent divorce produced disappointed expectations. The learned judge should not have permitted a verdict to be rendered against the copartners.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The plaintiff below was not competent to testify to a matter of a confidential nature Avhich occurred between her and her husband during the existence of their marriage relation, although she was divorced before she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
