W. Sheafer that the premises, etc., levied upon belonged to him, obtained a rule upon the execution plaintiffs to show cause why an issue should not be formed to try the title to said premises. To this rule the execution plaintiffs filed an answer objecting that the leases and improvements, etc., were estates in the land, not subject to seizure as personal goods susceptible of transportation, but by reason of their fixed and permanent character, could under an execution be seized and held only as real estate and sold in the same manner as real estate; and such property was not within the spirit and meaning of the Interpleader Act. On October 17, 1885, the rule was made absolute and an issue framed as stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\">On the trial there was evidence, <em>inter </em>alia, that before the issue was formed the plaintiff therein had transferred his interests in the properties in dispute t\u00f3 S.

The evidence being undisputed that the property levied upon under the writ of the defendants were leasehold estates of mining rights and the improvements thereon, and said leases having nearly fifteen years to run, such property partaking of the character and permanency of realty is incapable of seizure so as to.affect the liability of the sheriff and hence is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>within the act of assembly of 10th April, 1848, and its supplements, and this issue cannot be sustained and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">2. That Peter W. Sheafer, having parted with all his interest in the property levied upon on the 14th Sept. 1885, and this issue having been formed thereafter, the plaintiff has no status to maintain the issue and the verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">The court charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">We overrule and negative the points of the defendant and direct a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. As to the second point we say further that the issue in this case is really as to the ownership of the property at the time of the levy. The undisputed evidence in this case is that it was in Mr. Sheafer, and therefore the testimony which has been given in evidence and as to the effect of which we reserved, as to the subsequent assignments of this property by Mr. Sheafer to Mr. Barrett, that is really not relevant to the trial of the issue in this case; or if it were, then we think that the plaintiff would have a right to amend by making Barrett and Beddall the use \u25a0 plaintiffs in the case. And for these reasons we negative the points of the defendant and direct a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">Judgment was entered upon the verdict in favor of the plaintiff claimant, whereupon the defendants (the execution plaintiffs) took this writ, assigning for error the overruling of their' points and the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-9\"><em>Mr. James Ryon (Mr. W.

Justice Gobdon :</author>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">On a writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>issued at the suit of the plaintiffs in error, August 18, 1885, the sheriff levied on three certain leaseholds, alleged to belong to John A. Dutter, the defendant in the said writ of <em>fieri facias. </em>The leases under which Dutter held granted to him the right of digging, mining and carrying away anthracite coal from the Bush Mountain and underlying beds for and during the term of fifteen years. On the 7th of September the sheriff presented a petition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Court of Common Pleas setting forth that P. W. Sheafer claimed the premises as belonging to him, and praying for a rule on W. G. Maurer, S. H. Rothermel and C. D. Maurer to interplead. The defendants resisted this rule, but the court, on the 17th of October, 1885, made it absolute and ordered the issue. In due course the case came on for trial, and resulted in a verdict a,nd judgment for P. <em>W. </em>Sheafer, the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Now, the only material matter of controversy, in this case, arises on the defendants\u2019 first point, which is as follows: \u201c The evidence being undisputed that the property levied on under the writ of the defendants, were leasehold estates of mining rights and the improvements thereon, and said leases having nearly fifteen years to run, such property partaking of the character and permanency of realty, are incapable of seizure so as to affect the liability of the sheriff, and hence, are not within the act of assembly of 10th of April 1848, and its supplements, and this issue cannot be sustained, and the verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d The point thus stated was negatived by the court below, and this ruling is now assigned for error. In the case of Bain v. Funk, 61 Penn. St. 185, we held that the Sheriff\u2019s Interpleader Act was designed solely for the benefit and protection of that officer, and that an issue was not demandable by the claimant. The contention, therefore, may be regarded as turning upon the sheriff\u2019s right, in this case, to demand an issue; for if he had no such right the court ought to have affirmed the point recited, and directed a verdict for the defendants. But this right of the sheriff must depend upon his need of protection, for if he needs no protection neither can he exercise this right. He cannot have an issue merely for the benefit of a claimant, and in 'which he has no direct interest. The \u25a0 question, then, in this case is, what risk did the sheriff necessarily take upon himself in levying upon these leaseholds ? The answer must be, none whatever. And the same answer is required to the question, what interest can he possibly have in the determination of the title to them ? For it was not of the least consequence to him whether this property was owned by either of the claimants or none of them. His levy was on realty, or what, so far as he was concerned, was the same as realty; chattels real. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>could physically seize upon nothing; his levy need not be made either upon or in view of the premises, and it, the levy, was, at most, only a description of the realty out of which the leasehold estates issued. He had, in short, no more responsibility in or about the matter in hand than if his levy had been upon the land which was subjected to the leases: Titusville Novelty Iron Works\u2019 Appeal, 77 Penn. St. 103. The Inter-pleader Act answers an excellent purpose for the protection of the sheriff when on a levy and consequent seizure of personal chattels he discovers an adverse claimant of the goods, but when his levy is on realty of any kind it affords him no protection whatever, for he needs none; in such case he performs his official duty without risk of any sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the interpleader proceedings are vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
