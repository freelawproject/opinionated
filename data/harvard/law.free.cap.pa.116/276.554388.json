G. Bush, and others, already in evidence, the parties to said agreement were in negotiation about the sale and purchase of the timber specified in said agreement, and alleged by the vendors to be standing' and growing on the tracts named in said agreement; that the price to be paid for said timber had been agreed upon, to wit: twenty-five thousand dollars; that the location of the several tracts named in said agreement, being unsettled and unknown to the vendee, H. A. Merriman, acting for H. Merriman in the negotiations, required that a guaranty of the location of the lands should be expressed in the agreement; that when the parties had arrived at this point in the negotiations, they differed as to this requirement of guaranty, and the vendors declined to give a written covenant of guaranty of location. The parties separated, Mr. Merriman being advised by his counsel to decline the purchase without such guaranty, and he did so decline. After the negotiations were so broken off, they were on the same day renewed and resumed, and Mr. Merriman was advised by his counsel that if the vendors would agree to express in the contract a covenant that they were the legal and equitable owners of the lands described in the agreement upon which the timber was alleged to be standing and growing, and would point out, or cause to be pointed out and defined, upon the ground the boundaries of the said lands embracing the timber being sold and purchased, he could with safety enter into the agreement. This suggestion was communicated to the vendors and was accepted by them, and the proposed covenant of title was inserted in the agreement which was being prepared in the words following: \u201cSaid parties of the first part hereby covenant and agree that they are the legal and equitable owners of the twelve tracts of land above described.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\">In accordance with this proposition, the agreement was completed and signed by the parties. The promissory notes and a check of the purchaser covering the entire amount of the purchase money, to wit: $25,000, were at the same time executed by Mr. Merriman. All this was done under the express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>understanding of tbe parties that tbe agreement, tbe notes and the check, should not be delivered to the parties, but should be deposited in escrow with John P. Plarris, cashier of the First National Bank of Bellefonte, to be held by him in escrow until the boundaries of said land, embracing the timber sold by the agreement, should be pointed out by the vendors to the vendee, and the timber so pointed out should prove satisfactory to the purchaser, in which event the agreement was to be delivered to Mr. Merriman, and the notes and check were to be delivered to the vendors by the said John P. Harris; the agreement, notes and check were accordingly deposited with John P. Harris in escrow; that in pursuance of said agreement certain persons, namely, William P. Mitchell, H. P. Treziyulny, Samuel Marsh and H. A. Merriman, within a few days after said papers were so deposited, went from Bellefonte, and certain lines and boundaries were shown to said H. A. Merriman, by said William P. Mitchell, the said Mitchell acting on behalf of the said vendors, as the boundaries of the tracts named in said agreement, and the timber growing within said lines was pointed out as the timber intended to be sold in and by said agreement. That upon the return of the said persons to Bellefonte to wit: the parties who had been sent to examine and define the boundaries of said lands, they reported to the respective parties to the agreement what lines and timber had been pointed out' to the vendee, and the said Merriman, believing he had been shown tbe true boundaries of the tracts named in the contracts, and that the timber growing within said lines was the property of the vendors, and relying upon the designation of the same by' tbe authority of the vendors as aforesaid, as being correct and reliable, he, the said Merriman, consented that the written agreement and the notes and check aforesaid should be delivered to the parties, and they were accordingly so delivered; that the said check and several notes were promptly paid at maturity. This to be followed by proof that the vendors in said agreement were not, at the time the said agreement was made, the legal and equitable owners of the lands pointed out to the vendee as aforesaid, nor of the timber standing and growing thereon, which timber was specially exhibited to the vendee and was purchased by him from said vendors; that after the making and delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>of said agreement, the said vendee proceeded to cut and remove timber from the tracts of land so pointed out, to wit: that part thereof embraced within the lines of the John Rugg survey as pointed out as aforesaid, and during the winter of 1875-1876, did cut and remove a large number of pine logs therefrom; that to No. 81, January Term, 1876, an action of ejectment was brought in the Common Pleas of Centre county by a certain J. Z. Long against Hiram Merriman, D. H. Merriman and H. A. Merriman for the same land upon which they were cutting timber as aforesaid, and a writ of estrepement was issued in the same case against the defendants therein, restraining them from cutting timber; that said ejectment was proceeded with and a trial had thereon in said court, which resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for so much of the land pointed out to the said vendee as was embraced within the lines of a warrant and survey in the name of Jacob Z. Long; in consequence of which recovery the vendee was obliged to pay to said Long, by way of damages, a large sum of money for the timber cut and removed from the land so recovered, said timber being of great value; and in addition thereto the defendants in said suit were compelled to pay the costs thereof. The amount paid for damages and costs in said suit, plaintiffs. propose to show by competent proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">And at another time subsequent to the making of the said agreement said vendee and those authorized and employed by him on or about.....entered upon land shown and pointed out by the vendors as being embraced within the boundaries of the survey in the name of Robert Waters and proceeded to cut, and remove therefrom a large amount of timber then and there growing and being on the said land, being the timber which vendors showed to the vendee as standing within the lines of the Robert Waters tract, and which was purchased by Hiram Merriman on the faith of the said designation of boundary, and that he the said Merriman, by his agents and employees, cut and. removed a large quantity of logs from the said land; that whilst the said Merriman was proceeding to cut the said timber, a certain action of ejectment was brought in the Common Pleas of Centre county by P. B. Crider, Samuel Christ and F. W. Crider against Hiram Merriman and H. A. Merriman for tracts in the name of D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>EL H. Cunningham, Francis West and John West, of the bringing of which said action the said vendors were duly notified by the said Efiram Merriman and EL A. Merriman; that the said case was put at issue and tried at the April Term, 1881, and a verdict was therein recovered by the plaintiffs for the land described in the writ up to the line running north from white pine stump of the Patrick Moore as represented by a draft attached to the verdict of the jury, and returned therewith, which land so recovered, embraced part of the timber pointed out to, and purchased by Eliram Merriman as growing and standing on the Robert Waters tract. That by reason of the recovery in the last mentioned ejectment, the said Merriman was compelled to pay to the said P. B. Crider, Samuel Christ and F. W. Crider a large sum of money by way of damages together with the costs of said action, the amount whereof will be shown by the records of the court; that a large quantity of timber remained standing upon the territory recovered in the suits brought by J. Z. Long, and by Crider and others, which by the recovery had in said suits, has been lost to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">That a large quantity of timber remained still standing and growing upon the territory pointed out as embraced in the tracts in the names- of John Rugg and Robert Waters, <em>lying </em>outside of what was recovered in the ejectment brought by Jacob Z. Long and by P. B. Crider, Samuel Christ and F. W. Crider, which by reason of the determinations of the location of the tracts in the said suits' respectively has been lost to the said Merriman. This for the purpose of giving locality and identity to the tracts in the names of John Rugg and Robert Waters, named in said agreement, as pointed out by the defendants, and of applying the said written contract, and the covenants contained therein, thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">The offer was objected to, whereupon the court, Hon. J. W. Simonton, P. J., holding special term, ruled as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-7\">The objection to the offer of evidence must be sustained and the evidence excluded. The covenant contained in the writing is, \u201c That said parties of the first part hereby covenant and agree that they are the legal and equitable owners of the twelve tracts of land above described.\u201d The offer proposes to show that before this agreement was delivered, and after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>was executed tbe parties went upon the ground and certain lines were pointed out to locate one or two of these tracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">There is no offer to show any agreement that the lines as so located should be covenanted to be the proper lines of either of these tracts ; and if it were so offered to show, it would be adding a parol contract to the written contract. The action is upon the covenant, and is therefore in affirmance of the agreement, and for this reason the only breach that can be set up to warrant a recovery is a breach of some covenant contained in the writing. That the offer is based upon the theory that a recovery can be had for the breach of some covenant, not contained in the writing, is shown by the fact that the pleader in the declaration does not aver a breach of the covenant as contained in the writing simply, but a breach of this covenant as modified and enlarged by parol evidence. While we dislike very much to put parties out of court without trying the merits of their case, we are compelled to hold that this parol evidence cannot be received, because the effect of recovery under' it would be to modify and enlarge the covenant contained in the writing. To which plaintiffs\u2019 counsel except and ask a bill sealed, and a bill is accordingly sealed for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The jury then under the direction of the court returned a verdict for the defendants, whereupon, judgment having been entered, the plaintiffs took this writ, assigning for error (1) the overruling of the foregoing offer and (2) the direction to the jury to find for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-7\"><em>Mr. Samuel Linn </em>(with whom were <em>Mr. S. R. </em>Peale, <em>Mr. C. T. Alexander </em>and <em>Mr. J. L. </em>Spangler), for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-8\">1. The covenant bound the defendants to make good their allegation that they were the \u201c owners, legal and equitable,\u201d of the lands mentioned in the agreement; it covered the John Rugg tract, for instance, wherever it might be. Where is it ? The defendants allege that it is where the official location may fix it, and that their covenant binds them no further than the lines to be ascertained by official designation. But the offer proposes to prove that the location of these lands was unascertained and in confusion, that that subject was discussed during the negotiations between the parties, and that, whilst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the defendants were unwilling to give any written guaranty of location, they did agree that, before the papers should be delivered, the lines and boundaries should be pointed out by them upon the ground to H. A. Merriman, the son and agent of the purchaser, which was accordingly done and the papers delivered in pursuance of this agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-4\">Could this arrangement be proved by parol evidence ? The purpose of the offer was no more than to identify the land covered by the agreement, and that parol evidence may be offered for the purpose of identifying the subject matter of the contract has been several times decided : Barnhart v. Riddle, 29 Penn. St. 92; Bertsch v. Lehigh Nav. Co., 4 R. 129; Aldridge v. Eshleman, 46 Penn. St. 420; Clarke v. Adams, 83 Idem 309; Morris\u2019 App., 88 Idem 382; Martin v. Berens, 67 Idem 459; Walker v. France, 112 Idem 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">2. We contend, moreover, that the defendants were estopped from denying that the John Rugg tract, for instance, was located where they pointed it out to be, during the negotiations and before the contract was delivered. The territory pointed out in advance of the delivery of the paper, was, as between the parties to this case, the John Rugg tract; and it cannot be denied by the parties that that is the tract mentioned in the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">3. It is urged that under the ruling in Vicary v. Moore, 2 W. 451, which was, that where a specialty is altered or enlarged by parol, the whole contract becomes parol, the action should have been assumpsit and not covenant. But, in pointing out the lines of the tracts, the covenant is not changed in any way. This was done before the agreement was delivered and became effectual. We allege a breach of that written contract, and not a breach of a contract changed or enlarged by parol. The doctrine of Vicary v. Moore is thoroughly considered in McManus v. Cassidy, 66 Penn. St. 260, and see Lawall v. Rader, 24 Idem 285. Lehigh Coal Co. v. Harlan, 27 Penn. St. 429, is within the principle of Vicary v. Moore, where the agreement was changed <em>after </em>it had been executed and delivered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-7\"><em>Mr. It. M. Speer (Mr. Adam Hoy </em>and <em>Mr. John Cf. Love </em>with him), for the defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">1. In an action of covenant on a specialty the party is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>fined to the written covenants upon which he brings suit and is not permitted to prove by parol evidence an agreement different from that on which he declares: Barndollar v. Tate, 1 S. &amp; R. 160; Lyon v. Miller, 24 Penn. St. 392; Vicary v. Moore, 2 W. 451; Carrier v. Dilworth, 59 Penn. St. 406. There is an exception to this rule, where fraud or mistake is alleged and the agreement sought to be reformed, but the fraud or mistake must be specifically averred : Hunter v. McHose, 100 Penn. St. 38; Thorne v. Warfflein, Idem 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">2. And an action of covenant cannot be maintained upon a sealed agreement modified by parol: Vicary v. Moore, <em>supra; </em>Carrier v. Dilworth, <em>supra. </em>Here, the breach assigned is larger than the covenant and therefore bad: Clark v. McAnulty, 3 S. &amp; R. 364. Covenant does not lie against one who has not sealed the deed: Maule v. Weaver, 7 Penn. St. 329, and as it is strictly an action at law, if plaintiff in pleading bring down his pleadings to parol to suit his evidence, he defeats his action: Lehigh Coal &amp; Nav. Co. v. Harlan, 27 Idem 429.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">3. The doctrine of estoppel does not apply. The defendants are here simply to deny that they are bound in covenant to support any location of tracts the plaintiff may see proper to establish or seek to' establish by parol, independent and outside of the terms of the written agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">The cases, Barnhart v.

The action is covenant, and is therefore in affirmance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The plaintiff, having offered the contract in evidence, proposed to prove by parol that, although the defendants absolutely refused to guarantee the location of the land, and nego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tiations were broken off until this requirement was dispensed with, the lines of the respective tracts had been by the defendants pointed out to them on the ground, and the contract had been entered into, relying upon the designation of the lines so made ; that the agreement, and also the notes and checks for the purchase money, had been deposited in escrow, to be delivered when the lines were so pointed out, and that the contract was not to take effect and did not take effect until this was done. It is conceded that the Waters and the Rugg tracts, and the only contention arises out of these, have been regularly located by actual survey on the ground; but the offer rvas to prove that they are not located upon the ground designated, and that in consequence of the superior title of adverse claimants, the plaintiffs were prevented from taking the timber which was pointed out to them and which they supposed they Avere buying.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">This offer was objected to on the ground substantially, that the action being covenant and in affirmance of the contract, it was not proper to receive evidence in enlargement of the instrument upon which the suit was brought; that the action is necessarily founded upon the covenant as sealed by the parties; and, as there is nothing on the face of the agreement that is ambiguous or requiring explanation, and nothing was omitted, either through artifice or accident, the covenants contained in the contract cannot be affected by parol proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contention, however, is that there is nothing in the offer to contradict, vary or enlarge the terms of the agreement; that if the parties went upon the ground and pointed out the lines, saying : \u201c This is the John Rugg, and this the Robert Waters,\u201d the covenant will cover lands thus designated; that the eAddence offered was mere identification of the subject matter of the contract, that and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">It is plain that the only breach that can be set up as a basis of recovery, must be the breach of some covenant contained in\u201d the written contract. Referring to the writing, we find a covenant of title in the following form : \u201c Said parties of the first part hereby covenant and agree that they are the legal and equitable owners of the twelve tracts of land above described.\u201d It is upon an alleged breach of this covenant that the plaintiffs base their claim in this case ; but they contend that the cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>enant, as written, must be applied to the John Rugg and to the Robert Waters tracts, where they were shown to be, according to the understanding of the parties at the time, irrespective of their actual location on the ground; .and that the covenant is broken if it be made to appear that the territory pointed out on the ground as the Rugg and the Waters tracts, was not owned by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In the pleadings, therefore, the plaintiffs aver as a breach of the covenant, not that the defendants, at the time of the making of said agreement, were not the legal and equitable owners of the lands as described in the contract; but that they were not the legal and equitable owners of the lands, \u201c as the same were designated and pointed out upon the ground,\u201d etc.'; which lands are admittedly other and distinct from those described in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The argument of counsel in support of these propositions is certainly plausible and has been most ingeniously presented ; but we think it is more specious than sound. It seems very clear that by the exact terms of the agreement, the specific lands which were purchased by the plaintiffs, were the twelve tracts described in the written agreement by the warrantee names ; it is as clear that this description covered the territory embraced within the lines of the official surveys upon which the warrants were located, no more and no less. Now,\"if by the offer it is intended to show by parol, notwithstanding the exact and the plain provisions of the contract, that the lands described therein were not the specific lands purchased at all, but that the contract was intended to embrace other and wholly different lands which were pointed out at the time, the effect would certainly be, by parol evidence to change the terms of the writing upon which both parties are to be presumed to have relied. The contract, as it is written, however, is conceded to contain all that the parties or either of them contemplated it should contain; the offer discloses no matter which if established would justify a chancellor in entering a decree for reformation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">It is stated in the offer that the true location of these two tracts was not known, at all events was uncertain; that the defendants absolutely refused to guarantee any specific location for them; that they agreed, however, \u201c to express in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>contract a covenant that they were the legal and equitable owners of the lands described in the agreement, and would point out, or cause to be pointed out and defined, upon the ground, the boundaries,\u201d etc. But, assuming that the facts set forth in the offer were established by proof, it seems plain that in pointing out the boundaries, the defendants did not assume, expressly or by implication, to become liable for the correctness of the lines they should point out, as they absolutely \u2022 refused to become liable for any location ; the only liability for title which they agreed to assume they did assume, and it is written in the body of the contract, in the clause which we have quoted above, which clause it is conceded was inserted pursuant to the parol understanding alleged. No agreement is expressed, and certainly none can arise by implication under the facts alleged, that the defendants were the legal owners of the lands which were pointed out; they agreed that they were the owners of the lands \u201cabove described,\u201d that is, according to the description and designation of the written contract. If there was any parol cotemporaneous understanding to a different effect, the plaintiffs, in order to recover in covenant, must not only have averred in the declaration that the parol provision was omitted from the writing by fraud or mistake, but they must establish that averment by such measure of proof as would justify a chancellor in decreeing a reformation of the contract; then, as in equity, that may be considered don\u00e9 which ought to have been done, covenant may be sustained upon the instrument reformed : Hunter v. Meti\u00f3se, 100 Penn. St. 88. No such averments are made in the declaration and no such proofs were offered.</p>\n<p id=\"A3G\">It is true that parol evidence may in some cases be received, to give locality and identity to the subject matter, and to apply the contract to that subject matter: Bertsch v. Lehigh Coal Co., 4 Rawle 130; Morris\u2019 Appeal, 88 Penn. St. 368. But in this case, it is manifest from the offer that whilst the defendants were to point out the boundary, they were only to covenant for the title to the lands described in the contract; that was all the guarantee they would agree to give; all that was finally required, and all that was given. The subject matter of the contract was the land, which the defendants owned and were about to sell, described and designated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the names of the respective Warrantees, and the covenant of title was so expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Nor can we see how under such, circumstances any question of estoppel could be supposed to arise. Under our construction of the offer, the lines were pointed out, but with the understanding by parol that the defendants were to be bound for the location and title according to the clause which was inserted in their contract. The only object of pointing out the lines probably was, that the purchasers might know where the defendants believed the lines to be, and as there is no suggestion of fraud or artifice, or any offer to show that the defendants acted otherwise than in the utmost good faith, we cannot see why they should be estopped from saying that the Rugg and the Waters tracts, under the covenant, are just where they are actually found on the ground. The timber on the Rugg and the Waters tracts, wherever those tracts are located, undoubtedly belongs to the plaintiffs. The defendants can have no just or legal claim to it; even if they found it to their interest they could not compel the plaintiffs to yield it up and take the lands pointed out. \u2022 The plaintiffs, however, although invested with the title to the timber on these tracts, according to their true location, have not in any way relinquished their right, nor do they offer to do so ; on the contrary, whilst thejr hold the title to the timber on one location of the lands, they seek to recover the value of the timber on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The plaintiffs were not without remedy perhaps in other forms of action, but we cannot see how they can have redress for their alleged wrongs in an action of covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Upon a careful examination of the whole case, we find no error which would justify the reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-9\">Mr. Chief Justice Mercur dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
