From this assessment the corporation plaintiff appealed to the said defendants, Wm. Louglilin, George W. Fairman and Simon Gratz, composing the board of revision of taxes, claiming that the said property was exempt from payment of taxes, by reason of the provisions of the acts of incorporation above quoted; but the said board, on January 14, 1884, declined to grant the exemption asked for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-12\">After the said decision of the above-named defendants, composing the board of revision, the defendant, John Hunter, receiver of taxes of the city of Philadelphia, authorized and directed the defendants, John P. Sensenderfer and Charles A. Widmer, to collect from the plaintiff the taxes assessed against the properties named in the case stated, for the year 1884; and the defendants, John P.

R. B., No. 46, p. 550, was afterwards made part of the case stated as exhibit C. By this deed the grantors conveyed to the said institution \u201c all that certain lot or piece of ground, with the buildings and improvements thereon erected, situated at the southwest corner of .Montgomery street and Seventeenth street in %he twentieth ward of the city of Philadelphia, containing in front or breadth on the said Montgomery street one hundred and seventy-seven feet ten inches, and extending of that width in length or depth southward, two hundred and twenty-five'feet,\u201d in trust, etc., etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-12\">After argument the court entered judgment for the defendants, James T. Mitchell, J., delivering the opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-13\">The point in controversy is whether the property of the complainant, which is not part of the lecture building or scientific collections of the institute, but which is separate from them and disconnected from their occupancy and direct use, and from which the institute derives its revenue, is exempted from taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-14\">This property is not within the exemptions authorized by the language of the present constitution, or the act of 1874, passed in pursuance thereof, but the exemption is claimed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>virtue of the following language in section 11 of the charter: \u201cThe cabinet collections and \"lot of ground on which it is erected, belonging to the said institution, with any gifts, bequests or endowments, so long as the same shall be used for free lectures, shall be exempt from taxation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-5\">This provision beiug a grant in derogation of one of the highest prerogatives of the state, must be strictly construed. The language is not that the property of the said institute is exempted, but the collection and the lot of' ground on which it is erected, with any gifts, bequests or endowments. These last are the operative words to exempt the property now in question, if it is to be exempted, and it is by no means clear that they include any \u201c endowments\u201d except those which are like the cabinet collections and the building itself, <em>in </em>situ, and a necessary part of the machinery for the occupation and enjoyment of the franchise granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-6\">The case, however, has been argued upon broader and more general grounds, and we do not desire to decide it upon a strict and possibly narrow construction of the charter itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-7\">Conceding then for the present case that the property in question was exempted by its charter, two questions arise : first, could the state rescind the exemption; and secondly, has ib done so ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-8\">The court then proceeded to find, that under the constitutional amend.ment of 1857, and Article xvi., section 10, of the constitution of 1874, the legislature had the power to alter or revoke the charter, and that the act of May 14, 1874, P.'L. 158, under sections 1 and 2 of Article IX., of the constitution of 1874, the legislature had repealed the exemption, if any existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-9\">Judgment was entered for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-10\">The plaintiff then took this appeal, assigning for error the entry of judgment on the case stated for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-11\"><em>Mr. W. W. Montgomery </em>and <em>Mr. Geo. W. Biddle </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-12\">1. The supplementary charter of 1864 is a definite, specific grant of powers and privileges to a private corporation \u2014 a private statute. The act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 158, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>it is claimed repeals a portion of this private act, is a general statute purporting to regulate the whole question of exemption from taxation under the constitution of 1874. It is a principle in the construction of statutes that a general act is never to be construed as repealing a particular one by implication; <em>\u201cgeneralia speeialibus non </em>derogant: Max. Int. Stat., 157; Brown v. Commissioners, 21 Penn. St. 37; Harrisburgh v. Sheck, 104 Penn. St. 53. Nor can it be said that it is only by a construction necessarily creating a repeal of all prior exempting laws, that due effect can be given to the provisions of the act of 1874; for the constitution, leaving exempted cases as they were before the act of 1874, had in contemplation merely those cases where no exemption already existed. Its purpose was simply to exempt, and not in effect to impose taxation where none then existed: Coatesville Gas Co. v. Chester County, 97 Penn. St. 476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">2. Unless the power to do so was derived from the constitutional amendment of 1857, it was impossible for the legislature to revoke or repeal an existing exemption without violation of the inhibition as to the obligation of contracts. That amendment provided power in the legislature to alter, revoke and annul any charter of incorporation, whenever in their opinion \u201cit may be injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth; in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators.\u201d Now, the constitution of 1874 providing that \u201cinstitutions of purely public charity\u201d may have unlimited exemption, how can it be inferred from a general act like that of 1874, that the legislature considered the exemption of this particular and most excellent charity to be \u201c injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">3. The court below, holding that Article ix., \u00a7 1, of the present constitution operates as a repeal of the previously existing exemption, is not in accord with this court. The provisions of the constitution do not execute themselves, but were simply mandatory to the legislature to enact laws to carry them into effect: Hays v. Commonwealth, 82 Penn. St. 523 ; Erie County v. Erie City, 113 Idem 360. Moreover, the legislature is not the final and absolute judge of what \u201cis injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth: \u201d Hays v. Commonwealth, <em>supra; </em>Com. v. Railroad Co., 58 Penn. St. 26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>4. Any enlargement of the charter of a private corporation, so accepted as to become binding, is as inviolable as if it had formed part of the original grant: Gordon v. The Appeal Tax Court, 3 How. 133; Com. v. Pottsville Waterworks, 94 Penn. St. 516.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-5\"><em>Mr..Charles F. </em>Warwick, <em>City </em>Solicitor, and <em>Mr. Charles B. </em>McMichael, <em>Assistant City </em>Solicitor, for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">1. The appellants base their claim from exemption upon the provisions contained in \u00a7 11 of the act approved March 30, 1864.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">Shortly before, however, in the same section on the same page, the trustees had been authorized to accept conveyances and devises of' real estate. If the legislature had intended to exempt such devises and conveyances of real estate from taxation it would have used language broad enough to cover them, but the language is \u201cgifts, bequests and endowments.\u201d Evidently, therefore, the intention of the legislature was to exempt the lot of ground and building from taxation, and such gifts, bequests and endowments of personal property, as could be placed in the buildings or on the grounds. The word \u201cendowments \u201d seems to have here no precise or technical meaning. It was used to denote the method in which titles were conferred upon an ecclesiastical person, or in which dower was conferred upon a wife, but it can hardly be held to include conveyances of real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-8\">2. The opinion of the learned judge in the court below is so full and comprehensive that in is unnecessary to elaborate his argument upon the main question. The same view has been taken by two other judges in the Common Pleas: Pearson, P. J., in Londonderry Tp. v. Berger, 2 Pears. 230, and Ludlow, P. J., in German Society v. Philadelphia, 3 W. N. 483.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A8D\">Mr. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The property for which exemption from taxation is claimed by the appellant consists of two contiguous lots of ground on Eleventh street, Philadelphia, each sixteen feet front and one hundred feet deep, and each with two dwelling houses erected thereon ; and also a lot of one hundred and seventy-seven feet ten inches front and one hundred and eighty-six feet depth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>on Seventeenth street, Philadelphia. On the last mentioned lot are twenty-four dwelling houses. These properties are rented and yield an income which is applied to the support of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">As these properties are ordinary houses and lots, they are undoubtedly subject to taxation unless they are clearly exempted by some constitutional law plainly expressing such exemption. It is alleged there is such a law and we are referred to the eleventh section of an act approved March 80, 1864, entitled, a supplement to an act to incorporate the Wagner Free Institute of Science, approved the ninth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five. The portion of the section in question which it is claimed exempts this property from taxation, is in these words: \u201cThat the cabinet collections and lot of ground on which it is erected belonging to the said institution, with any gifts, bequests or endowments, so long as the same shall be used for free lectures, shall be exempt from taxation.\u201d The cabinet collection and lot of ground on which it is erected are no part of the premises as to which the present question arises. The fifth section of the original charter of 1855, exempted the cabinet collection and lot of ground on which it is erected, but nothing more, and it is now claimed that the exemption demanded is conferred by the words \u201c gifts, bequests or endowments,\u201d contained in the eleventh section of the supplemental act of 1864. All of the property in question in the present case was conveyed by several deeds by William Wagner and wife in 1864 and 1873 to the appellant, and hence was not owned by the appellant at the time of the passage of the original charter or the supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The first and -most obvious question which arises is, does this property come within the description \u201c gifts, bequests or endowments ; \u201d contained in the act of 1864? It certainlyls not a \u201c bequest,\u201d as the title was derived by deed and not by will Nor can we regard it as a \u201c gift,\u201d within the manifest meaning of the act. Gifts, in their ordinary legal sense, are donations of chattels, and the same meaning attaches to them in the common popular sense also. A gratuitous conveyance of the title to a piece of real estate is in a very large sense a gift, but it is not so designated in the popular, or in the legal thought or expression, and we would not feel at liberty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>depart from the ordinary meaning of the word in construing a statute exempting property from taxation. Nor is the word \u201cendowment,\u201d any more apt to describe such property as. this. Endowment is defined by Worcester as \u201c property or pecuniary means bestowed as a permanent fund; as the endowments of a college, a hospital or a library.\u201d It is certainly understood in common acceptation as a fund yielding income for the support of an institution. In its collocation in the act in question we think it very clear that the legislative intent was to indicate \u201c gifts, bequests or endowments \u201d belonging to the appellant, in connection with the cabinet collection and lot of ground on which it is erected, and for the maintenance of free lectures therein. In the sixth section of the same act the word \u201c endowments\u201d is certaintly used in such a connection. The corporation is there authorized to accept a deed \u201c and to hold the premises and property therein mentioned, including all endowments at any time to be made to the said corporation,\u201d etc. And in the fifth section all three of the words, \u201c endowment, gift or bequest,\u201d are manifestly used in this sense. The words \u25a0of this section are: \u201c Should these buildings described in this \u00a1section not be erected in the lifetime of the party of the first part by him and under his direction, the board of trustees, as in their opinion the funds which shall from time to time be at their disposal, will warrant such an expenditure, or by endowment, gift or bequest made for the above purpose, shall proceed to erect the laboratory,\u201d etc. Here \u201c funds \u201d which may be derived by endowment, gift or bequest, are authorized to be used for the construction of buildings. We cannot doubt that this was the sense in which the legislature used these words, and that being so we do not feel that we can enlarge this legislative meaning beyond its proper scope. We are, therefore, of opinion that the real estate in question is not exempt from taxation, and this view renders unnecessary the discussion of the other questions considered in the paper books and arguments of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
