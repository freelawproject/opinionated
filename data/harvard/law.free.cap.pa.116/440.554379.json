Ct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-18\">The case originated by the petition of Joseph M. Morrow, son and devisee under the alleged will of Thomas W. Morrow, deceased, to the register of wills of Perry county, and, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>appeal, to the Orphans\u2019 Court, of said county, to vacate letters of administration upon the estate of the deceased, granted to Thomas Morrow and Robert Morrow, and to admit to probate said alleged will as the will of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-4\">Thomas W. Morrow was a farmer residing at the time of his death, September 21, 1885, in Carrol township, Perry county, and was about seventy years of age. On Monday, September 14,1885, he was engaged in drilling wheat on his farm when his drill broke and he determined he would go to Landisburg to have it repaired. Before starting he went to his room, remained there awhile, and when he came out remarked that he was \u201c not feeling well, hardly fit to go,\u201d but would go any way. On the road to Landisburg he became sick, and when he reached the town he went to his son Joseph\u2019s house, went to bed, and on the following Thursday was taken to his own home in a buggy, put to bed, where he remained, growing worse, until he died the following Monday.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">On October 12, 1885, letters of administration were granted to Thomas and Robert Morrow and, some weeks after, the paper offered for probate as his will was found behind the clock, upon the shelf of which the decedent kept his writing materials. It also appeared in the testimony that for several months before his death, Mr. Morrow had determined upon the exact disposition of his estate found to have been made in his will; and that upon his death bed he had called Joseph to him and informed him how \u201c things yere to be.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">Upon the hearing before the register, the latter refused to admit the alleged will to probate and to vacate the letters of administration granted, whereupon the proponent appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">The appeal was dismissed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, Charles A. Barnett, P. J., in the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">Thomas W. Morrow died at home on or about the 21st of September, 1885. Letters of administration upon his estate were granted on the 12th October, 1885, to Thomas Morrow and Robert Morrow, two of his sons. On the 25th November, 1885, Joseph Morrow, another son, presented his petition to the register, setting forth that he had, since administration granted, come into possession of a testamentary writing which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>believed, to be the last will and testament of said Thomas W. Morrow, and praying for the appointment of a day when he might produce said will and proof of its execution, that the same might be admitted to probate; and that a rule might be granted upon said administrators to show cause why this should not be done, and their letters of administration vacated and surrendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">A day was appointed, and the testimony of witnesses taken to show the due execution of the instrument offered for probate, but the register refused the offer on the grounds that it was a conditional or contingent will, and the contingency not having happened,, the instrument became void as a will. From this decision of the register the said Joseph Morrow has appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">A true and correct copy of said instrument is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">I am.going to town with my drill and i aint feeling good and in case if i shouldend get back do as i say on this paper tomey and robert is to pay they last payment one this place Samuel nows his payments Joseph you are to have that land and town property and pay Magy $3.00 dollars $1.00 dollar a year without interest tomy Miten is to have his colt fore fredum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">tomy and robert is to settle up and make sail and devide the money equil amung my five boys this i write down .and sign to my will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqI\">Tho W.

It is there said, \u201c A will may be made so as to take effect only on a contingency, and if the contingency does not happen the will ought not to be admitted to probate.\u201d In note 2, there are cited several examples of contingent wills, among others the following : A pers'on intending to go to Ireland made'his will in these words: \u201cIf I die before my return from my journey to Ireland, I direct,\u201d etc. The testator went to Ireland, returned to England, and died some years afterwards. It was held by Lord Hardwicke that the will was contingent, depending upon the event of the testator returning to England or not. As he did return the will could have no effect, but was void: Parsons v. Lanoe, 1 Vesey Sr. 190. The will of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>mariner commencing, \u201c Instructions to be followed if I die at sea or abroad,\u201d is conditional: Lindsay v. Lindsay, L. R. 2 Prob. &amp; Div. 459. In Kentucky a will saying, \u201c If I never get back home I leave you everything I have in the world,\u201d was held to be contingent; Maxwell v. Maxwell, 3 Metc. 101. In Damon v. Damon, 8 Allen 192, the will began: \u201cIn the name of God, Amen! I, J. W. D., being about to go to Cuba, and knowing the dangers of voyages, do hereby make this my last will and testament,\u201d etc. \u201c First. If by casualty or otherwise I should lose my life during this voyage, I give and- bequeath to my wife A,\u201d etc. He then went on to. give other specific devises. He returned from Cuba and died two or three years afterwards. The will was admitted to probate, but it was held to be conditional as to the first clause. On the other hand, in Tarver v. Tarver, 9 Pet. 174, the will began: \u201cIn the name of God, Amen! Being about to travel a considerable distance, and knowing the uncertainty of life, think it advisable to make some disposition of my estate, do make this my last will and testament.\u201d Mr. Justice Thompson said: \u201c And it is contended that the condition upon which this instrument was to take effect as a will, was his dying on the journey and not returning home again. But such is a very strained construction of the will and by no means warranted. It is no condition, but only assigning the reason why he made his wiil at that time. But the instrument taking effect as a will is not made, at all, to depend upon the event of his return or not from his journey. There is no color, therefore, for annulling this will on the ground that it was conditional.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">Walbem on Wills, page 257: The author says: \u201cPapers propounded as .wills are frequently contingent or conditional in form, and difficulty is sometimes experienced in determining whether or not, in the events that have happened, the will is to take effect. The question turns upon the point whether the contingency is referred to as the occasion of making the will, or as the condition upon which the instrument is to become operative.\u201d \u201cWhere the will is made dependent on a condition precedent, it cannot be upheld as a will unless the condition is performed. Thus, where the deceased, a master mariner, whilst on a voyage, wrote with his own hand a will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>which commenced: \u2014 \u2018 This is the last will and testament of me, in case anything should happen to me during the remainder of the voyage from hence to Sicily and back to London, that I give and bequeath,\u2019 etc. The court held that the dispositions of the will were dependent on^the event referred to at the beginning of it, and that it had therefore only a contingent operation and probate was refused,\u201d and refers to In the Goods of Robinson, L. R. 2 Prob. 171, and other cases cited in the note. \u201c On the other hand a will in these words : I, W. M., being physically weak in health, have obtained permission to cease from all duty for a few days, and I wish during such time to be removed from the brig Appelina to the floating hospital ship Berwick Walls, in order to recruit my health, and in the event of my death occurring during such time, I do hereby will and bequeath,\u201d etc., was held not to be conditional. And a will commencing with the words: \u201cIn case of any fatal accident happening to me, being about to travel by railway, I hereby leave,\u201d etc., was held not to be contingent on the testator\u2019s death on that journey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">3 Phill. 397, Strauss v. Schmidt, is to the effect that a conditional will may be established by subsequent recognition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">4 Swab. &amp; Trist. 36 ; In the Goods of George Thorne, deceased. The deceased died in London in September, 1864, leaving a paper writing dated at the Gold Coast of Africa, on 2d November, 1863, containing <em>inter alia </em>as follows : \u201c Be this known to all concerned: I request that in the event of my death while serving in this horrid climate, or any accident happening to me, I leave and bequeath to my beloved wife,\u201d etc. \u201c I consider that every person should be prepared for the worst, and particularly in such a treacherous climate as this, which is considered one of the worst in the world, which has compelled me to write this letter.\u201d It was held not necessary to limit its operation to the event of death while on the Gold Coast.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">2 Bradf. 204: In <em>ex parte </em>Lindsay; the will contained:\u2014 \u201c According to my present intention, should anything happen me before I reach my friends in St. Louis, I wish to make a correct disposal,\u201d etc. The testatrix went to St. Louis, returned to New York, and died there more than a year after the date of the will. The will was admitted to probate, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>surrogate saying: \u201c There is another question necessary to be determined in tins class of cases, and that is, whether the words clearly express a contingency upon which the instrument is to take effect, or whether they may fairly be interpreted as indicating the cause or occasion of making the will; whether, in the language of Sir John Nicholl, \u201c it is an absolute condition, or dependent upon any particular motive operating at the time.\u201d The surrogate cites the following cases: In Burton v. Collingwood, 4 Hagg. 176, the will began: \u201cMarch 5, 1814. Morning, near one. All men are mortal, and no one knows how soon his life may be required of him. Lest I should die before the next sun, I make this my last will and testament,\u201d etc. Eighteen years afterwards the will was held not to be contingent, and was admitted to probate. In Forbes v. Gordon, 8 Phill. 625, the words : \u2014 \u201c In case of my inability to make a regular codicil to my will, I desire the following to be taken as a codicil,\u201d etc., were held not to be conditional. In Bateman v. Ponnington, 3 Moore P. G. C. 223, the instrument was written in ink, but dated and signed in pencil, with the addition: \u201cIn case of accident, I sign this will.\u201d The testator died more than three months afterwards, and the will was admitted to probate. In the Goods of Ward, 4 Hagg. 179, the paper propounded contained the expression: \u201cI mention these matters thus particularly, to serve as a memorandum for you, in case it should be the Lord\u2019s will to call me hence by any fatal event in the voyage or journey before us.\u201d The paper was rejected, but the testator had made a subsequent altered will. In Sinclair v. Hone, 6 Ves. 608, the contingency expressed in a codicil was: \u201c In case I die before I join my beloved wife; \u201d it was held to be contingent, and defeated by failure of the condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">3 Bradf. 366, in Thompson v. Conner, the testator, Charles Stephenson bequeathed to his cousin, Margaret Baxter, three hundred dollars; \u201c this gift and bequest being subject to the following condition, viz.: that the said Margaret Baxter shall produce from the officers of the ship in which I shall sail on my next cruise, satisfactory evidence of my decease during the same.\u201d His will was admitted to pAbate, the surrogate saying : \u201c Doubtless, the possibility of death during the contemplated cruise was considered, and led to the incorporation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the condition in the will; but then the,condition refers primarily to evidence, or in other words, he does not give only upon condition he should die during that voyage, but that certain specified proof of his death shall be produced.\u201d The foregoing eases illustrate very fully the difference between the contingency which furnishes the occasion or motive, and is given as the reason for making the will at that particular time, and the contingency upon which the instrument is to take effect; the contingency which must happen before the instrument becomes a will at all. It is the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time thereof that leads to the making of a will. The undertaking of a perilous journey, or the probable exposure to more than usual accidents, may furnish the occasion for making a will at a particular time; but although the time of making has been hastened by the apprehension of danger, the testator does not consider the instrument inoperative, or regard any further disposition necessary merely because the danger has been survived. When, however, the ordinary uncertainties of\" human life have not been carefully provided against, and circumstances may now postpone the opportunity for doing so, a crude instrument of testamentary character is sometimes made to bridge over the chasm, and become operative only upon some designated contingency, which shall prevent the execution of a maturely considered will. It is objected by his administrators against the writing left by Thomas W. Morrow, that it belongs to this latter class; that it is a contingent will, and the contingency not having happened, that the will is void. They rely upon the case of Todd\u2019s Will, 2 W. &amp; S. 145. And it was upon the authority of that case that the register refused admission to probate. The will of George Todd began as follows: \u201c My wish, desire and intention now is, that if I should not return (which I will, no preventing Providence) what I own shall be divided as follows,\u201d etc. C. J. Gibson refers to the cases of Parsons v. Lanoe, and Sinclair v. Hone, supra, in which the wills were held to be contingent. \u201c But,\u201d he says, \u201c an intention to make the operation of the paper eventual, is not near so apparent in either of these cases as it is in the one under '\u2018consideration; \u201d and the sentence of the court below refusing probate was affirmed. In the case at bar we think the will illustrates both sorts of contingency; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>that which urged to the present making of the instrument, and that upon which the instrument itself was to take effect. \u201c I am going to town with my drill and I aint feeling good,\u201d was the contingency suggesting the propriety of making the will. \u201c And in case <em>if </em>I shouldend get back, do as I say on this paper,\u201d contains the contingency upon which the will should become operative. It is very clear that the will is not <em>presently </em>operative. He does not say: \u201cI hereby give and bequeath; \u201d there is no immediate gift. He does not say absolutely, <em>\u201c </em>do as I say on this paper ; \u201d <em>some </em>time at least <em>must </em>elapse after his departure for town, before any such duty is imposed. The command is provisional: <em>\u201cif I shouldend get hack </em>do as I say on this paper.\u201d It is plain, that <em>his failure to </em>return, is the condition precedent required before the instrument can become effectual. If it was ineffectual until there was a failure to return, and if there was no such failure, it is also plain it never became effectual; that it was a contingent will, and became void by the non-happening of the contingency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">In Todd\u2019s Will, the expression is, \u201c if I should not return, what I own shall be divided as follows.\u201d In Morrow\u2019s Will the expression is, \u201c if I shouldend get back do as I say on this paper.\u201d If I should not return, and if I shouldend get back, are forms of expression so plainly equivalent, that we are unable to see any distinction or difference between them. Notwithstanding the able argument of proponent\u2019s counsel, we are of opinion that the register\u2019s decision was right in principle, and obedient to the authority of Todd\u2019s Will, and must therefore be affirmed. And now, 4th November, 1886, the decision of the register is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">Thereupon the proponent took the present appeal and assigned for error the affirmation of the register\u2019s decree refusing to vacate the letters granted and to admit the alleged will to probate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-7\"><em>Mr. W. H. Sponsler, </em>of <em>Sponsler Market, </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">1. It is submitted that in every adjudicated case the condition was such that the testator clearly desired the instrument to be his will <em>only </em>on the happening or not of the contingency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>We find him in each instance surrounded with uncertainties, with perils fancied or actual, extended over <em>an uncertain </em>period, the very existence of which leads him to make the will, and leaving the inference clear that, if he were differently situated, he either would make no will at all at that time or a different one. If this principle is stated correctly, the court will notice two elements: <em>a. </em>It is but temporary, pending the happening of the contingency, <em>b. </em>The time through which the contingency may happen is extended and indefinite : In the Goods of Ward, 4 Hagg. 179; Parsons v. Lanoe, 1 Ves. Sr. 190; Sinclair v. Hone, 6 Ves. 607; In Goods of Robinson, L. R. 2 Prob. 171; Todd\u2019s Will, 2 W. &amp; S. 145. In all these cases the courts held that the will was conditional and refused probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\">2. But the question turns upon the point whether the condition is referred to as the occasion of the making of the will, or as the condition upon which the instrument is to become operative: In Goods of Martin, 36 L. J. 116; In Goods of Dobson, 13 L. T., N. S., 758; <em>Ex parte </em>Lindsay, 2 Bradf. (N. Y.) 204; In Goods of Thorne, 4 Swab. &amp; Tr. 36. In all these cases the courts admitted the will to probate. It is claimed that the sudden illness of the decedent caused him to make the will. His trip was a mere incident.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>Mr. W. A. Sponsler, </em>for the appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-7\">1. The writing clearly comes under the rule established and denominated Conditional Wills, and this view is sustained by Parsons v. Lanoe, 1 Ves. Sr. 190; Lindsay v. Lindsay, L. R. 2 Prob. &amp; D. 459; Maxwell v. Maxwell, 3 Metc. 101; Damon v. Damon, 8 Allen 192; Todd\u2019s Will, 2 W. &amp; S. 145. A will or devise depending upon a condition or contingency is one thing, and the assignment of a cause for the making of a will or\" devise is another. Thus in Todd\u2019s Will, 2 W. &amp; S. 145, the language used is: \u201cIf I should not return, what I own shall be divided as follows.\u201d In Traver v. Traver, 9 Peters 174, the language is: \u201cBeing about to travel a considerable distance, and knowing the uncertainty of life, think it advisable to make some disposition of my estate, do make this my last will and testament.\u201d As was said by the court, there is no condition here, only a reason given for making the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">2. It is not a question of peril or uncertainty or length of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>journey, upon which a conditional will rests; a man can remain within his own domicile and write a conditional will. Thus, \u201c If I should die before the first of the coming month, then I dispose of my property as follows.\u201d But he does not die before the first of the coming month, but lives considerable time after the first of the coming month; the will is conditional. The decedent simply provides if he should not return from town (Landisburg), then do as I say, etc.; but he did return from town and lived for several days after his return, and died in his own house in Carroll township.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AKY\">Mr. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">It is scarcely possible to add anything to the very lucid and exhaustive opinion of the learned court below in this case. We agree entirely with the conclusion arrived at and the reasoning in support of it. The authorities cited are numerous and altogether convincing in their character. Our own case of Todd\u2019s Will, 2 W. &amp; S. 145, is exactly in point and controls the present contention. The essential words there were, \u201c if I should not return . . . what I own shall be divided as follows.\u201d The words here are, \u201cin case if I shouldend get back, do as I say on this paper.\u201d The meaning in both these cases is the same. A testament is to take place if there is no return. But there was a return in both instances, and the testament does not transpire. There is no will because the condition on which it was to come into existence has not occurred. In both cases the deceased did return.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">It is useless to speculate as to what the deceased would have done had he foreseen the precise facts which were to happen. He has made no provision for them. The condition which he has expressed is one which attaches to the operation of the instrument, and the effect of this is strongly expressed by Gibson, C. J., in Todd\u2019s Will case, thus: \u201c No text writer seems to have rdistinguished between a condition attached to a particular testamentary disposition, and a condition attached to the operation of the instrument. But in Parsons v. Lanoe, 1 Ves. Sr. 191, Lord Hardwicke said without hesitation that he would not require an authority for such a distinction, and that a paper subject to a condition ought not to be admitted to probate after failure of the contingency on the happening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>of which it was to have taken effect. \u201c Why should it be proved as a will when it could not have the effect of one ? \u201d And so here. The decedent did return from the journey he was about to take and the contingency upon which the paper was to take effect as a testament did not happen. Whether the journey was long or short is not material, it is the fact of the return which defeats the contingencjn It is true he was sick at his return, but as, he lived several days after, this fact also is immaterial. Further discussion seems unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
