That the plaintiff was duly incorporated under the act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 62, entitled An act to authorize the formation and regulation of railroad corporations, with power to locate, construct, maintain, and operate a railroad extending \u201cfrom a point near the intersection of Twentieth street and Pennsylvania avenue in the Fifteenth ward, of the city of' Philadelphia, to a point in the Twenty-seventh ward, of the city of Philadelphia, near the intersection of Fifty-third street and Bartram avenue,\u201d all in the city of Philadelphia, and to. construct branches from its main line as provided in said, statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">2. That on July 3, 1885, an ordinance of councils was. passed authorizing the construction of said line and a branch through that portion of the city known as \u201cThe Neck,\u201d and to enter upon and occupy certain streets in said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">3. 4. That said branch line was located in accordance-with the provisions of said ordinance, and the construction thereof commenced, said branch commencing at a point on plaintiff\u2019s main line near Schuylkill avenue and Dickinson street, in the Twenty-sixth ward of said city, a.nd extending-by way of Schuylkill avenue, Wolf street, Twenty-third street, Oregon avenue, and Meadow street to the Delaware river, in the First ward of said city; and that it has procured the right of way for almost the entire length of said branch railroad, and has purchased extensive terminal properties upon the Delaware river at Snyder street and Dickinson street, and that a. considerable portion of the said line has been graded and is. ready to receive the superstructure of said railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">9. That said branch railroad, as located, crosses the line of the railroad constructed, maintained and operated by the defendant in the Neck at grade at four points, to wit, at the intersection of Twenty-ninth and Wolf streets; at the intersection of Twenty-fifth and Wolf streets; at the intersection of Oregon avenue and Swanson street, and at the intersection of Commercial avenue' and Meadow street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>10. That it is not reasonably practicable for the plaintiff to build its said branch railroad so as to avoid crossing the said railroad of the defendant in the Neck at the four points specified at grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\">That the purposes sought to be accomplished by the plaintiff, in building said branch road, are to reach the terminal properties which it has acquired on the Delaware river, and to make railroad connections with the various business establishments located along its route in that portion of the city. That the property owners along its route, in consideration of the facilities for connection therewith, offered by a road constructed in conformity with plaintiff\u2019s plan at grade, have granted to the plaintiff the right of way \u201cwithout any or for a decreased charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">That \u201c it would be utterly impracticable to cross the tracks of the defendant at any one of the said points by passing underneath the same; and an elevation of plaintiff\u2019s railroad along its entire route or at any of said points so as to pass the railroad of the defendant overhead would be unreasonably expensive and make it of no practicable use or benefit whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">11. That at the time of the location of the road of the plaintiff upon the ground, the defendant had constructed and was operating its road; its two tracks at the point of crossing on Commercial avenue occupied only about twenty and a half feet; at the point of crossing on Swanson street it had one track only, which is at about seven and a quarter feet below the confirmed grade of said street; at the point of crossing upon Twenty-fifth street it had two tracks at about the confirmed grade of said street; and at the point of crossing on Twenty-ninth street it had only one track, also at about the confirmed city grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">12. That immediately upon the location of the plaintiff\u2019s branch road the defendant made a number of changes in the location and grade of its railroad, which the plaintiff avers was done simply to defeat and interfere with its right to cross the same. At the point of crossing on Commercial avenue it shifted one of its original tracks and laid three additional tracks, no two of the additional tracks being of the same grade, the five tracks occupying a total width of about sixty feet within the lines of Commercial avenue. At the point of crossing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Swanson street it deflected, its original track from its old position and lias laid two additional tracks each at different grades, varying as much as four feet between them. At the point of crossing at Twenty-fifth street it has laid one additional track between the two original tracks, without connecting the same at either end with the original tracks; and at the point of \u2022crossing at Twenty-ninth street it has laid two additional tracks, one above and the other below the confirmed grade of the street, said tracks varying in' grade as much as five feet between them, and neither connecting with the original tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">\u25a0 13. That plaintiff applied to the defendant to permit it to cross its railroad at the four several points in the manner aforesaid, but the defendant refused to consent thereto, and has heretofore prevented such crossings to be peaceably made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">14. That the plaintiff tendered a bond to the defendant in the matter of each of said crossings, conditioned for the payment of such damages as the defendant should sustain by reason of the respective grade crossings, but that the defendant refused to accept the same, and petitions were thereafter presented to the Court of Common Pleas of this countiy by the plaintiff, praying for the approval of said bonds. The defendant filed exceptions to said petition, and, <em>\u2018inter </em>alia, averred that it was reasonably practicable for the plaintiff to avoid said grade crossings by elevating the grade of its railroad so as to pass the defendant\u2019s road overhead at all of said points, and orders were made by the court withholding the approval of said bonds until the question whether the defendant should be permitted to cross at grade should be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\">5, 6, 7, 8. The plaintiff further avers that the defendant\u2019s said line of railroad in the Neck, which is known as its Delaware Extension, extending from a point near the western end of the bridge over the Schuylkill river, known as the Arsenal bridge, to the Delaware river at Greenwich Point, and three connections therewith, one running from a point thereon at Twenty-fifth and McKean streets to the Philadelphia Gas Works at Point Breeze, another from another point thereon, near Swanson street, running northward upon and' within the lines of said Swanson street to the intersection of Morris street and Commercial avenue, is not authorized bylaw, and is therefore unlawfully maintained and operated by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>And relief was prayed for as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">\u25a0 1. That an injunction be issued restraining the defendant from obstructing or interfering with the plaintiff in the construction of its said road crossing' the defendant\u2019s road at grade at the point specified; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">2. That a decree be made that it is not reasonably practicable for defendant to avoid said grade- crossings; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">8. Further, that the court prescribe such regulations as are usual and proper in such cases for the operation of the said crossings and the conduct of the business of the plaintiff and defendant respectively in the use of their railroads upon approaching and passing the said grade crossings; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">4. Such other and further relief as may be required. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">The answer of the defendant averred:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">\u25a0 1. That it was true the complainant company was incorporated under the act of April 4, 1-868, as stated in the bill; that the respondent was advised that under said act the authority to construct a main line and branches are two distinct subjects, and the latter cannot be constructed until after the completion of the main line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-11\">2. That it was true that an ordinance was' passed, approved July 8, 1885 (and this ordinance was copied in full).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-12\">That said ordinance was wholly invalid and by reason thereof vests no valid authority to construct said branch road in said complainant. 'In support thereof this respondent showeth, that by the act of May 23, 18T4, P. L. 231, dividing all the cities of this state into three classes and regulating the passage of ordinances thereby, the legislative power of every city is vested in the councils thereof ; and it is further by said statute enacted in \u00a7 3 thereof, that no ordinance shall be passed by or through the councils of any city except by bill, and that no bill shall'be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title. And this respondent is advised that'the aforesaid bill or ordinance, as passed, contains more than one subject, and that some subjects .contained therein are not clearly expressed, or indeed alluded to, in its title : in that\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-13\">A. The construction of a railroad as a main line and the construction of \u00e1 branch road from the main line of a railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>are two different subjects and cannot be contained in the same ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\">B. That said ordinance provides by sections 1, 6 and 7 thereof that the said Schuylkill River East Side Railroad Company may enter upon and occupy, either by crossing the same or otherwise, certain streets, lanes and alleys, the consent to which occupation constitutes one subject thereof, and the only one expressed in its title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">C. The same ordinance further provides: \u201c Whereas the said railroad company proposes upon the passage of this ordinance to locate its bridge over the river Schuylkill at a point at least fifteen hundred feet south of Gray\u2019s Ferry Bridge,\u201d that \u201c the bridge over the river Schuylkill shall be constructed at the place shown upon the said plan \u201d (which is a jolan required by section 16 of said bill to be filed by- the City Solicit- or), \u201cwith two draw openings, one upon each side of the center pier, of seventy-five feet clear waterway between the draw pier and each of the two adjoining piers.\u201d And the subject of said bridge or of its location or erection is not expressed, or indeed alluded to, in said title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">D. The said ordinance by section 5 thereof ordains \u201c that the Department of Surveys be and it is hereby authorized and directed to place upon the plans of the city Pennsylvania avenue, with an increased width upon its northeast line of forty-three feet between Twenty-fifth and Twenty-eighth streets, and of an increased width upon the said northeast line of thirty-three feet from Twenty-eighth street to Poplar street.\u201d And the widening of an existing street within the limits of the city constitutes another and separate subject from those hereinabove mentioned, and it is not expressed in its title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">E. The said ordinance by section 8 thereof ordains that \u201c the consent of the said city is hereby given to the occupation of such portion of the properties of the Philadelphia Gas Works, between Chestnut and Filbert streets, in the Ninth ward, and between Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth .streets, on Callowhill street, as is covered by the location of said railroad through the same, and which is shown upon the plan aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">F. That the main line of railroad described in said ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>differs in material respect from the line authorized to be constructed by the charter of the plaintiff company, the termini of which are given in the first paragraph of plaintiff\u2019s bill. The eastern terminus of the road described in said ordinance is a distance of about one mile from the eastern terminus fixed in said charter, the intervening distance being a thickly built up and populated portion of the city of Philadelphia. The entire route of said railroad as fixed in said charter is but about three miles in length; and its whole line is through said city. Inasmuch as the said charter without said ordinance, as well as said ordinance without said charter, is incompetent to authorize the construction of plaintiff\u2019s main line of railroad through the city, there could be no authorized branch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-4\">5, 6, 7, 8. In answer to the several matters averred in these several paragraphs touching the lawful construction and maintenance of lines of railroad actually in existence and operated by this respondent, it is advised that said subject is not within the power of the complainant corporation in this proceeding to have adjudicated, and without waiving the benefit of this suggestion, which is made as though relief had been prayed by said complainant by reason of said averment and this respondent had pleaded thereto, yet it saith that said lines of railroad which the complainant seeks to cross at grade at four several points have been constructed under the authority of divers statutes <em>(inter alia), </em>section 17 of \u201can Act to incorporate the Pennsylvania Railroad Company',\u201d approved April 13, 1846, P. L. 312, and supplements thereto, especially that of April 18, 1856, P. L. 447; and also of \u201c an Act for the sale of the main line of the public works,\u201d approved May 16, 1857, P. L. 519, this respondent having been the purchaser thereunder and receiving a deed therefor bearing date July 31, 1857 ; and also of \u201c an Act to authorize the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to occupy certain portions of -Delaware avenue, in the city of Philadelphia, for railroad purposes, and make connections therewith,\u201d etc., etc., approved March 12, 1873, P. L. 253.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">To the remaining paragraphs of said bill this respondent for answer saith: That it would be reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing by elevating the grade of the road of the complainant corporation so as to pass the road of this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>spondent overhead at each and all. of said points. The elevation of grade would not involve an additional expenditure of over $20,000 a mile for a single track, and this construction would insure an economy in use by a reduction of expenses in operation, as such elevation would also secure an overhead-crossing of all streets of the city at that point. Such construction would avoid the expense of appliances for a signal service at the railroad grade crossings, and of watchmen and gates at street grade crossings. Before the Master appointed by tins court plans of construction in detail can be shown in corroboration of the averments herein made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">Without this, this respondent is advised there is nothing else in said bill material to make answer unto, and prays to be hence dismissed with its costs.\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The cause was referred to <em>Mr. C. G. Morgan, Jr., </em>as Examiner and Master, who, after hearings had, reported:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">This suit is brought under the provisions of the Act of Assembly approved June 19, 1871, P. L. 1860, entitled \u201c An Act relating to legal proceedings by or against corporations.\u201d [sections 1 and 2 are quoted.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">It is averred by the pleadings, and testimony has been taken in support of the averments, that each of the parties to this suit is doing or is about to do that which would be an injury to the corporate rights and franchises of the other. By the plaintiff it is averred that the defendant is unlawfully obstructing, and interfering with the construction of the road which the plaintiff proposes to build in the Neck, at the places where the same is to be projected across that of the defendant. By the defendant, that the plaintiff\u2019s plan for the construction of its road, crossing defendant\u2019s tracks at grade, is unnecessary, and therefore, unlawful. And each of said parties moreover distinctly challenges the right of the other to construct and maintain its line of road in the Neck, and denies that it is vested with legal authority therefor, and each also denies the right of the other in this proceeding to question its authority to construct and maintain its road, although claiming for itself very strenuously this privilege.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">The Master is of the opinion that it is competent for each to compel the other to show at least a <em>prima facie </em>right and au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>thority to build and maintain its line at the points where they come in contact, and where it is sought by one to carry on the construction of its road and by the other to prevent such construction, subject to the well-settled rule that if the company whose title is thus challenged produces a warrant of power granted by its act of incorporation or by articles of association, under a general law, which originally conferred upon it the right to build and maintain its road, it is not competent for any party, other than the Commonwealth herself, to assert or set up a forfeiture of such franchise: [citing, Lejee v.

In accordance with these views, I proceed, first, to the consideration of the respective rights of the plaintiff and defendant to the roads or lines described in the bill and answer intersecting each other at the four points mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">(A.) The plaintiff\u2019s title is derived from articles of association duly filed with the secretary of the Commonwealth under' the general railroad law approved April 4, 1868, P. L. 62. Said articles empower plaintiff to build a railroad \u201c from a point near the intersection of. Twentieth street and Pennsylvania avenue, in the Fifteenth ward of the city of Philadelphia, to a point in the Twenty-seventh ward, near to the intersection of Fiftieth street and Bartram avenue.\u201d By section 9 of said act it is enacted that \u201c Any company incorporated under this act shall have authority .to construct such branches from its main line as it may deem necessary to increase its business and accommodate the trade and travel of the public.\u201d By section 12, that \u201c This act shall not be so construed as to authorize the formation of street passenger railway companies to construct passenger railways under or by virtue of its provisions in any city or borough of this commonwealth, nor to authorize any corporation formed under this act to enter upon and occupy any street, lane or alley in any incorporated city in the commonwealth without the consent of such city having been first obtained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>To this line the consent of the city was not obtained, and, in March, 1884, a resolution of councils was passed, which in effect declared its disapproval of said plan, and by it the city solicitor was instructed to commence legal proceedings to prevent the construction of the proposed road, and, shortly thereafter, a bill in equity was filed by the city of Philadelphia and an answer filed by the company and the suit was referred to a Master, who, on December 8, 1884, filed a report adverse to the defendant in said suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">Nothing further was done in the suit referred to, and shortly after the date mentioned the plaintiffs presented themselves before the councils of the city of Philadelphia, submitting for their selection various routes and plans for the said railroad. An ordinance was thereafter presented, entitled \u201c An ordinance relative to the construction of the railroad of the Schuylkill River East Side Railroad Compan3r, and of a branch thereof, within the city of Philadelphia,\u201d which was referred to the joint committee on railroads of councils, by whom the report in evidence was made, and on July 3, 1885, said ordinance was approved, as averred by plaintiffs in their bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">By the terms of the ordinance, the consent of the city to the construction of the road described in plaintiff\u2019s charter was made conditional upon the acceptance by it of the route described in the ordinance for both the main road and branch which it was proposed to build. The plaintiff thereupon formally accepted the terms imposed by the ordinance and proceeded to lay out and construct both the main road and branch therein described, the main line being precisely the same as to route as that originally adopted by plaintiff, as far north as Cherry street, but differing with it north of Cherry street, between Cherry street and Pennsylvania avenue. That is, by the original plan it was proposed to build the road from a point near to and north of Cherry street, north to Newkumet street; thence by a five degrees curve to Pennsylvania avenue between Twentieth and Twenty-first streets; and by the plan approved by councils, in the ordinance referred to, the road was extended-north from Cherry street along and near the east bank of the Schuylkill river to the Gas Works of the city of Philadelphia, at Twenty-fifth and Callowhill streets; and thence north along Twenty-fifth street to Pennsylvania avenue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>reaching the tracks of the Reading Railroad on Pennsylvania avenue at a point near to and west of Twenty-fifth street. The branch railroad authorized by ordinance to be laid out by the plaintiff, and at the date of the filing of the bill in this suit, in course of construction, commenced at a point on said main line north of Schuylkill avenue and Dickinson street, in the Twenty-sixth ward of the city of Philadelphia; thence south along Schuylkill avenue to Wolf street; thence east along Wolf street to Twenty-third street; thence south along Twenty-third street to Oregon street; thence east along Oregon street to Meadow street; thence north along Meadowstreet to the property owned by plaintiffs on the Delaware river front, at or near to and south of Reed street, with a connection also with other property of the plaintiff on the Delaware river at and fronting on Snyder street. These two properties, the one at Dickinson street and Reed street and that at Snyder avenue, are intended to be the terminals of the Schuylkill River East Side Branch Railroad on the Delaware river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">The entire length of the branch line is a little more than five miles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">The plaintiff proposes by this branch road to cross the road now maintained and operated by the defendant in the Neck, at grade, at four points, to wit, Twenty-ninth and Wolf streets, Twenty-fifth and Wolf streets, Oregon avenue and Swanson street, and Commercial avenue and Meadow street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">The defendant denies the right of the plaintiff to cross defendant\u2019s line at all, and contends :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">First. That the proposed branch cannot now lawfully be constructed because the main line has not yet been completed; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">Second. The plaintiff is without authority to build said main line, as approved by councils, because it varies from the route originally adopted by the company, and that, consequently, it has no right to build the proposed branch therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">1st. Is completion of a main line of road an essential prerequisite to the lawful construction of a branch thereof ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-11\">By the act of 1868, already referred to, it is provided in section 9, \u201cAny company incorporated under this act shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>have authority to construct such branches from its main line as it may deem necessary to increase its business and accommodate the trade and travel of the public.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">What is meant by the term \u201c main line \u201d as used in this connection ? Does it mean only a completed line ? The primary object of the act of 1868 was to provide a method of incorporation of railroad companies with the same general powers and privileges which had theretofore frequently been invested in corporations of this character by special legislation. The status of a company incorporated under it to operate in the city of Philadelphia, with the assent to its construction by the municipality, is, as to the general power to construct, maintain, and operate its road, and to build branches thereto, precisely the same as that of any company incorporated under a special charter, with the power to build branches from its main line expressly given. The rights and privileges intended to be conferred by the act of 1868 upon corporations formed under it, vested in the plaintiff at the moment its articles of association were filed for record with the secretary of the Commonwealth. Thereupon the company was at once vested with the right to immediately exercise the same, except only where by the terms of the act, or by necessary implication, there is a postponement. There is no express postponement of the exercise of branching power. As to the date of its exercise, there is nothing in the language of the act to distinguish it from the other powers conferred thereby, nor can it be reasonably contended that such a postponement is to be implied either from the language used in the statute, or the purpose for which it was enacted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">The only case cited by counsel for the defendant, in support of his argument, that \u00a7 9 of the act of 1868 is only applicable to a completed main line, is Wood v. Railroad Co., 8 Phila. 94. The question decided by Judge Sharswood, on a motion to dissolve a special injunction, was, that the acts of 1861, April 23, P. L. 410, and of 1870, February 17, P. L. 31, authorize the leasing of completed railroads only, and did not warrant the transfer by lease of a mere franchise or right to build.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">[The Master here quotes \u00a7 1 of the Act of April ' 23,1871, P. L. 410; \u00a7 1 of the Act of February 17, 1870, P. L. 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and refers to the language of Sharswood, J., in Wood v. Railroad Co., 8 Phila. 95.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">The phraseology of these statutes is too plain to admit of any doubt as to the meaning of the legislature. That which was to be thereafter the subject of a lease is described as a \u201c railroad \u201d or a \u201c road,\u201d showing clearly that the law-makers had in view completed railroads, not mere franchises to build roads. This legislation authorizing corporations to delegate; and transfer franchises and property granted by the Commonwealth, is to be strictly construed, and its scope confined to such subjects as are clearly and unequivocally indicated by the terms used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">In \u00a7 9 of the act of 1868, the legislature has avoided using the words \u201c railroad \u201d and \u201c road,\u201d and selected the word \u201c line,\u201d a word which is much more comprehensive and general in its meaning, and includes railroads laid out but not built, as well as constructed roads. Moreover, the rule of construction, to be applied to this section, differs from that applicable to the statutes referred to conferring upon railroad companies the power to lease other roads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">There is nothing in the nature of the power sought to be exercised, nor in the language of the statute, which would justify the construction contended for by the defendant. On the contrary, the language used, the manifest purpose of the statute, and the nature of the rights conferred, indicate that it was the intention of the legislature to permit companies formed under the act to build branches from main lines, as and when they might deem the same necessary for the purposes of their incorporation, whether before or after their main lines had become main roads entirely constructed and in full operation, provided the requirement of the twelfth section, as to the consent of the city, had been first complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">The term \u201cbranches,\u201d as used in the ninth section of .the act of 1868, has been defined by.the Supreme Court in McAboy\u2019s Appeal, 107 Penn. St. 548, to mean \u201c sections \u201d or \u201c subdivisions \u201d of main lines.....Plaintiff\u2019s Neck branch being but a \u201csection\u201d of its main line, the power to build it, as respects the time of its exercise, was precisely the same as its power to build the remainder of its road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Second. </em>It is further contended that the plaintiff is without lawful authority to construct a branch line in the Neck, because their <em>main </em>line, as now laid out and under course of construction, is unlawful, in that it varies from that originally adopted by the board of directors of the company, as to the part north of Cherry street. If the main line is unlawful, that is, if authority for its construction was not conferred upon the plaintiff by its articles of association, under the act of 1868, the line proposed to be built as a branch therefrom would also be unauthorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">Is the plaintiff\u2019s main line, from which it is proposed to extend said branch in the Neck!, unauthorized?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">A railroad corporation formed under the act of 1868 is vest- \u25a0 ed with authority to build and operate that road only which is \u25a0described in its articles of association, together with branches, 'etc., as provided therein. It must be conceded that a corporation formed either under a special statute or a general law is to be confined, as to termini, to the points so fixed in its charter, and, as to route, to that prescribed in the statute, if created by special legislation, or that formally and finally lawfully adopted by the board, if formed under the general law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">It will be noticed that the legislation making the city\u2019s assent necessary to the lawful construction of this road is contained in the act under which the plaintiff was incorporated; so that the right to form the corporation is coupled with the requirement of the consent of the city in the same statute, and the effect of this legislation upon the articles of association filed, is the same as if the legislature had incorporated this company by a special act, in which it was provided that no route should be selected, acquired, or used, providing for the use of the streets of Philadelphia, until the councils of the city had assented thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">In the city of Philadelphia v. Schuylkill River East Side R. Co., C. P. No. 2, March Term, 1884, No. 851, this section was construed by the Master to whom the suit was referred, to apply to the crossings of streets as well as to a longitudinal use of them, a view which I believe to be correct. If this be so, it follows that the assent of the city of Philadelphia was a prerequisite to the lawful adoption by the plaintiff of any route either along or across streets within its limits, and further that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the action of the board of directors of the company plaintiff in the selection of the first route, contemplating the occupation of streets not assented to by the city, was a mere nullity, and the first and only route ever lawfully adopted, was that described and consented to in the ordinance of 1885, and now in process of construction. In other words, no change has been made in the main line; the route authorized by said ordinance and now being followed is the original main line of the plaintiff. It will be noted that the termini, though not precisely the same as in the route first suggested and approved by the directors, are substantially so; the southwestern terminus is exactly the same, and the north-eastern end of the line consented to is but four city blocks or squares, or about two thousand feet, from that which was originally suggested, and to which the city refused its consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">In the articles of association the north terminus is fixed at a point near the intersection of Twentieth street with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad on Pennsylvania avenue; in the route first approved by the directors it is placed at a point on said Pennsylvania avenue between Twentieth and Twenty-first streets, and in that finally adopted and consented to by the city, at the point of intersection of said Pennsylvania avenue and Twenty-fifth street; the northern terminus in each being upon the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which was plainly the objective point, the plaintiff\u2019s main line being intended as a section of a through line from Baltimore to New York by way of Philadelphia, and, as to a portion of it, by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">Either of these two routes .would have been authorized under the articles of association, the requisite consent of the city having first been given thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">The argument of the learned counsel for the defendant that neither the corporation nor the city, separately or together, can change a route prescribed and termini fixed by the charter as a general proposition, is undoubtedly sound, and indeed could not be seriously questioned. As applied to this case, however, it begs the very question in dispute, which is: Which of the two routes referred to is the route prescribed by the charter? Clearly that approved and assented to by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the city. No other route could have been adopted under the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">To hold that the legislature, when the General Railroad Act of 1868 was passed, intended the mere preliminary approval of a route through a city, by the board of directors of a corporation formed under it, prior to the presentation of the same to the municipal authorities for their consent thereto, to be final and to operate as an exhaustion of the power of the corporation in this respect, so that, if the city disapprove thereof and refuse its consent, the road cannot be built at all, although it be manifest that' its construction and operation would be in fact a great public benefit, and the assent of the city be proffered, upon slight changes advantageous to the public being made, would be to impute to the legislature an intention to render the statute practically nugatory so far as it purports to authorize railroad companies to enter upon and occupy the streets of an incorporated city; for it would very seldom happen that any route approved by the board of directors, as presented to the municipal authorities for their consent, would, without any modification at all, receive that consent. Such a construction of th\u00e9 statute is contrary to its manifest purpose, which is to permit the public, in densely populated localities, where the moneyed interests are large and property valuable, to <em>take </em>part in the selection of the streets to be occupied by railroad companies formed thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">For the reasons stated, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff is vested with lawful authority to construct and maintain both the main line and the branch now being constructed, and to cross defendant\u2019s roads at the points specified: [Citing Frankford &amp;c.

In that case, councils first, by ordinance duly approved, refused their assent; then subsequently, by a second ordinance, revoked their veto and substituted an assent with conditions which did not merely prescribe a change of route, but substantially affected the charter of the company; and the court held, first, that the power of councils was exhausted by the first ordinance, the city having exercised its veto power given by the Commonwealth; and, second, that the conditions coupled with the assent contained in the second ordinance were at variance with the terms of the charter, and therefore void.

The court below erred in entering the final decree of December 81, 1886.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>Mr. David W. </em>Sellers, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">1. If it be conceded that a <em>branch </em>line of railroad may be constructed contemporaneously with the main line, yet there must be an authorized and valid main line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">Not only is the complainant\u2019s main line incomplete, but there is no valid authority for its construction. Under \u00a7 12 of the act of 1868, no main line of road can be constructed in this city without its authority. It is conceded that the city has never consented to the construction of such a main line of complainant\u2019s road as is written in its charter. In other words, this railway was incorporated with given termini which are from the river Schuylkill up along the east bank to Cherry street and thus passing in a northeasterly direction to Twentieth and Pennsylvania avenue. It has obtained the consent of the city to the construction of the line passing beyond Cherry street to Twenty-fifth, up Twenty-fifth to Pennsylvania avenue, and thence westwardly to a point about Thirtieth street, and it stands to-day admitted that not only has the city not consented to the construction of a main line between the termini indicated by the charter, but that this complainant corporation in point of fact has abandoned the construction of so much of its main line as is at a point near the Schuylkill river and Cherry street, running northeastwardly to Twentieth and Pennsylvania avenue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">No case can be found in Pennsylvania in which a special statute prescribed given termini, that any authority is found in the. corporation to depart from either of the termini, or to .substitute others, and the allegation to that extent is \"wholly unfounded. The cases in Pennsylvania are the reverse: Western Penn. R. Co.\u2019s App., 99 Penn. St. 155; Commonwealth v. Erie &amp; N. E. R. Co., 27 Idem, 399; Plank Road Co. v. Arndt, 31 Idem, 317. The act of June 1, 1883, P. L. 57, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>confirms the idea that the discretion in the corporation is never to be used to substitute or change termini.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">It was contended in the court below, that because the city is vested with the power to consent, it may couple its consent with such conditions as oblige a corporation to do what otherwise it has not the charter power to do, and certain <em>dicta </em>of courts in the West were cited. But in this state some consideration has been given to the powers of councils where their consent to construction has been a prerequisite : Faust v. Railway, 3 Phila. 164; Musser v. Railway, 5 Clark 466, 5 Am. L. R.,.O. S., 284;. Pittsburgh City\u2019s App., 18 W. N. 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">It is the duty of this court to examine, inquire and ascertain whether the appellee does in fact possess the right to build the branch road in question: \u00a7 1, act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360 ; which right is maintained in Lejee v. Railway, 10 Phila. 362; McCandless\u2019s App., 70 Penn. St. 210; and in Edgwood Railroad Co.\u2019s App., 79 Idem, 257.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">2. The finding of the Master that, as the plan of the construction of the road of the appellee has been accepted and consented to by the city, this authoritatively disposes of the question of its effect upon the public safety and convenience, involves the proposition that the power to consent given to the city in the act of 1868 can be used to repeal the act of 1871, which seems to be absurd: P. &amp; C. R. Co. v.. S. W. Penn. R. Co., 77 Penn. St. 184.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">3. The crossings at grade on the Schuylkill could be prevented without affecting those on the Delaware, and the converse is equally true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">In the answer it was suggested that an overhead crossing at all points would be reasonably practicable, involving an additional expenditure of not over \u00a720,000 a mile for a single track ; this construction insuring an economy in use by a reduction of expenses in operation and avoiding appliances for a signal service. But when appellant\u2019s plan produced in evidence was submitted to appellee\u2019s engineering department, it was discovered that the Schuylkill crossings could be more easily avoided by a simple prolongation of the grade adopted by the appellee than by the construction of an elevated road at these points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">In commenting on the whole evidence as to cost the Master by substituting a cheaper signal service in favor of the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>lee, finds the fact to be that n there is an excess of cost of $36,231.60 for construction and. maintenance to avoid these grade crossings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">When it is remembered that the so-called branch road of the appellee is as much the main line of the B. &amp; 0. Railroad into Philadelphia as is its technically-called main line along the east side of the river Schuylkill, it seems scarcely credible that with such a small expenditure as that the court below, in the language of this court in Railroad v. Railway, 77 Penn. St. 184, \u201crecognized that the appellant as the'first occupant had rights superior to these of the appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">As to the crossings at Swanson street and Commercial avenue on the Delaware; on these, a plan was suggested of an elevated road about 6600 feet in length, costing for construction, by appellee\u2019s testimony, $100,000, being a difference of first cost in favor of surface road of $56,990. There is testimony that the cost would exceed $100,000. To avoid dispute as to this an offer was made on behalf of appellant, before the case was considered by the Master, to construct the entire line of road according to this plan for $100,000 and deliver it to the appellee ready for the ties and rails.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">The testimony of the appellee is to the point that to avoid expense it is necessary to interfere with the previously granted franchise of the appellant. The best criticism of this doctrine of necessity may be found in the remarks of Mr. Justice Gordon in Pennsylvania R. Co.\u2019s App., 93 Penn. St. 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">4. The appellant contended below that if the appellee was allowed to cross as it desired, an interlocking system should be imposed on it. The Master looked at the past rather than to the future. Finding in existence signal appliances which were concededly below the standard of the art now, he applied those rather than decree the highest standard at this time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">Attention is called to the testimony of Mr. H. S. Cox, Mr. Getchell, Mr. Gucker, Mr. Wm. J. Latta and Mr. Richards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\">\u2022 5. This fifth assignment is wholly dependent on the view this court may take on the preceding assignments, and requires no special discussion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-11\"><em>Mr. Thomas Hart, Jr., </em>(with whom was <em>Mr. Lewis G. Gassidy'), </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>There are three main subjects in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\"><em>First. </em>That of the plaintiff\u2019s title or power to build the Delaware Branch Railroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\"><em>Second. </em>That of the defendant\u2019s title to maintain the lines of railroad which the said branch crosses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-7\"><em>Third. </em>That of the crossings themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-8\">The assignments of error have reference to the first and third subjects. The Master has decided in favor of the defendant upon the second head, but as he reported in favor of permitting the crossings as proposed by the plaintiff, the latter need not eoutest the right generally of the defendant with regard to its own lines.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-9\">1. 1. The power of the plaintiff to build the railroad in question was attacked upon several grounds, only one of which however, seems now to be urged in the appellant\u2019s paper-book, namely, that there has been a change in one of the termini of the main line of plaintiff\u2019s. road, which makes both the whole line of the main road and of the branch illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-10\">In Vollmer's Appeal, just decided, 19 W. N. 183, the right of the plaintiff to build the same branch railroad was upheld; but, in all the litigation which has harassed the plaintiff, no one has before said that the main line itself, now completed at a cost of millions of dollars, in the way that the citizens of Philadelphia demanded, is a wholly unlawful structure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-11\">The company was incorporated to build a railroad from a point near the intersection of Twentieth street and Pennsylvania avenue in the Fifteenth ward to a point in the Twenty-seventh ward near to the intersection of Fiftieth street and Bartram avenue; and there has been no change of terminus at all, under a fair and proper construction of the charter and the authority of the city arising out of \u00a7 12 of the Act. of April 4,1868, P. L. 62. The authorities sustain this position: Parke\u2019s Appeal, 64 Penn. St. 137; Fall River Iron Works Co. v. Railroad, 5 Allen 221.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-12\">2. But even supposing that the words \u201cnear Twentieth street \u201d did not comprehend a point near Twenty-fifth street, the case presented is not that of doing an illegal act, the building of any railroad which the company had not a right to build, but simply one of a failure to go to a point nearer Twentieth street. There has been a mere neglect to go to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>point at or near Twentieth street in consequence of the refusal of the city to consent to that part of the route; and, even if this might be made a basis of proceeding by the Commonwealth for a forfeiture, this defendant cannot therefore allege that the plaintiff has no power to build something else, the Delaware branch.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">In that aspect the case is simply that of a company building an entirely lawful railroad, but which is prevented by a power in accordance with an act of the legislature from building another part as originally intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">Mr. Sellers\u2019 argument upon this head has gone upon the assumption that, as there has been no valid consent \u2014 that is, as there has been no consent of the city to the whole of our original line \u2014 all that we are doing now is invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">But we deny that the effect of a failure to get the consent of the city at all, which is the strongest way it can be put for the other side, is to mate the road we are building unlawful: 5 Am. &amp; Eng. R. Cases, 253; C. &amp; W. J. R. Co. v. Dunbar, 100 Ill. 110; Lejee v. Railroad Co., 10 Phila. 362; West. Penn. R. Co.\u2019s App., 104 Penn. St. 399.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-8\">3. There is nothing in the change of the route to Twenty-fifth street; it was a change entirely within the powers of the company: 1 Rohrer Railroads, 274-7 and cases in notes; Gear v. Dubuque, 20 Iowa 529; <em>Ex. parte </em>S. C. R. Co. 2 Rich. (Law) 434; M. &amp; T. R. Co. v. Delaney, 42 Miss. 555; U. P. R. Co. v. A. T. &amp; S. R. Co., 5 Amer. &amp; Eng. R. Cases 389; Roberts v. Railroad Co., 1 Phila. 262; Caley v. Railroad Co., 80 Penn. St. 363; Beal v. Railroad Co., 86 Idem, 509; \u00a7 1 act of March 17, 1869, P. L. 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-10\">4. The next view is, that the assent of the city was a prerequisite to the adoption of any route, and that the first and only route lawfully adopted was that described and consented to in the ordinance of 1885, and upon which the railroad has now been constructed in accordance therewith. The views of the learned Master upon this point are strongly expressed and are sustained by the authorities : Pacific R. Co. v. Leavenworth, 1 Dill. 393; N. Y. &amp; H. R. R. v. Mayor of N. Y., 1 Hilt. 563; Northern Central R. Co. v. Baltimore, 21 Md. 93; B. Central R. Co. v. B. City R. Co., 32 Barb. 358; Slatter v. Railroad, 29 Iowa 148; Tate v. Railroad Co. 7 Ind. 480; P. &amp; B. Pass. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Co. v. Birmingham, 51 Penn. St. 41; West Penn. R. Co.\u2019s App., 99 Idem 155; McAboy\u2019s App., 107 Idem 548; Pittsburgh City\u2019s App., 18 W. N. 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">5. But there is a solution of this whole question in the Act of June 9, 1874, P. L. 282, authorizing municipal corporations to contract with companies for change of location or grade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">The Act is not confined to constructed railroads. The reason is greater as to one not built: Mercer v. Railroad Co., 36 Penn. St. 99; West. Penn. R. Co.\u2019s App., 99 Idem 155; Mc-Aboy\u2019s App., 107 Idem 548; Volmer\u2019s App., 19 W. N. 133. As to the question raised upon the title of the ordinance, see Dewhurst v. Allegheny, 95 Penn. St. 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">II. In the summary made by the Master, he found that the plan of construction of plaintiff\u2019s road proposed by it has been accepted and consented to by' the city of Philadelphia, which thus authoritatively disposed of the question of its effect upon the public safety and convenience; but in no part of his report has he considered this action by the city as conclusive of the rights of the parties upon the subject of the avoidance of the grade crossings. In no part of the master\u2019s report is any such proposition affirmed as that stated by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the above finding \u201c involves the proposition that the power to consent given to the city in the act of 1868 can be used to repeal the act of 1871.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">The case cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel, P. &amp; C. R. Co. v. S. W. Pa. R. Co., 77 Penn. St. 173, was merely to the effect that the right to cross other railroads at grade, given by the act of 1868, was subject to the act of 1871. There is no doubt about this. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not contend to the contrary, and certainly the Master did not otherwise report.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-9\">III. All the authorities upon the subject of the interpretation of the Act of 1871 are given in the Master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-10\">Upon an examination of the testimony it is submitted that the Master was clearly right in his finding upon the subject of these crossings. It is certain that the appellant has shown nothing to convict him of \u201c palpable error \u201d in this regard: Balt. &amp; C. V. Ex. Co.\u2019s App., 10 W. N. 530; Northern C. R. Co.\u2019s App., 103 Penn. St. 621.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-11\">IV. After a careful investigation the Master has expressly defined what is a \u201c suitable \u201d signal apparatus, and we submit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>there is nothing in any part of the testimony to convict him of \u25a0 clear error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\">More than this, the decree carefully provides for the precedence of the appellant\u2019s trains, and the trains of the appellee shall \u201c invariably come to a full stop before crossing defendant\u2019s tracks, and shall not proceed to cross until the proper signal shall have been given.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">Y. This assignment is not separately considered, and it is submitted that none of the preceding assignments of error should be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-6\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The policy of the law to discourage steam railroads from -crossing each other on the same grade, is distinctly ruled in Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad Co. v. Southwest Pennsylvania Railway Co., 77 Penn. St. 173, and in Northern Central Railway Co.\u2019s Appeal, 103 Idem 621. As, however, crossing at grade is not absolutely prohibited, each case must be determined on its own merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In the present case, the Master found <em>inter alia </em>that the proposed crossing is essentially necessary for the successful and profitable operation of the appellee\u2019s road and does not seriously injure the appellant although it does somewhat impede the movement of the latter\u2019s trains. He further found that it is not reasonably practicable to avoid crossing the road of the appellant at grade at the points specified, and that the municipal authorities of the City of Philadelphia have consented to the proposed plan of construction, thereby recognizing that it is not unduly dangerous to the public safety. This finding was confirmed by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">An examination of the evidence fails to convict the Master of error in his conclusions. In view of the fact that the crossings are in an outlying portion of the city and where through passenger trains are not likely to be moved, we discover no sufficient cause for prohibiting a crossing at grade. The decree imposes on the appellee the duty of erecting and maintaining suitable signal apparatus for each of the crossings, and otherwise appears to provide for due care in guarding and protecting against injury at the crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
