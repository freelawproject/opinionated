On the trial the court below, James Inghram, P. J., submitted to the jury to find from the evidence of facts, which are sufficiently stated in the opinion below, whether the defendants were guilty or not guilty. After verdict for the commonwealth, the defendants made a motion in arrest of judgment upon the ground <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cthe evidence did not support the charge\u201d; which motion being overruled the defendant, Samuel Thomp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>son, took this writ, assigning for error the order overruling said motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-5\"><em>Mr. Edward </em>Campbell, for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoi\">One who breaks open the door of his own house, which is forcibly detained from him by one who claims the bare custody, is not guilty of forcible entry: Commonwealth v.

He discovered no other marks of violence than what is here stated, except that a piece had been cut out of the door. His possession does not seem to have been disturbed, nor was there the slightest interference with him personally, and if his occupancy was at all interrupted he does not so state. Indeed, there could not have been an interruption thereof for a longer period than it took to remove the locks, since they alone interfered with his Immediate entrance upon the premises. There was neither violence nor threats of violence; nothing which was calculated to alarm the most timid. The explanation of the matter seems to be that sometime during the night Samuel Thompson and his son Robert had visited the premises and quietly, under a claim of right, had substituted their own locks, for that of Dutton. This evidence does ndt bring the case within the act of 31st of March, 1860, since no entry was made with violence and a strong hand, or other circumstances of terror, and the court below ought so to have instructed the jury. An insignificant trespass such as that above described, which had no public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>significance, cannot be made the subject of a criminal prosecution. As was said in Respublica v. Devore, 1Y. 501, indictments for forcible entry and detainer ought to be discouraged unless there is evident force against the person in actual possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The judgment is reversed, and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
