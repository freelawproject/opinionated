Subsequently she is condemned by a United States court to pay salvage of one-half the appraised value. The. question in the case is whether the seizures were illegal and France liable for salvage. The evidence does not indicate that the French vessels acted illegally so far as the mere seizures were concerned.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b206-17\">I. The court reiterates the decision made in the <em>Nancy'(37 </em>C. Cls. R., 410), that search and seizure are not necessarily illegal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b206-18\">II. In time of war the proper exercise of the right of search involves no responsibility on the 'part of the power exercising it in the absence of treaty regulations, and the burden of proof that the right is illegally exercised rests upon the owners.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>III. The distinction between this case and the <em>Sally </em>(37 C. Cls. R., 542) is that while the illegality of the seizure was not shown in that case, it was shown that the French authorities violated in a gross manner the rights of the owners after seizure. A legal seizure may be defeated by the illegality of the proceedings incident to the care, custody, and condemnation of the vessel.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b207-5\">IY. After the abrogation of the treaty of 1788 the French privateers had the right to seize vessels of neutrals, but France was responsible for the improper and illegal exercise of the right.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b207-6\">V. The liability of France depends upon what was done by the crew \u2022 of the privateer, and not upon the legal effect of the decree of the American court, except as an indication of the damages.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b207-7\">YI.

The brig Fair American, Robert Forrest, master, sailed on a commercial voyage on or about the 8th day of November, 1798, from Surinam, bound for Philadelphia. While peacefully pursuing her said voyage she was captured on the high seas on or about the 17th day of said month of November by the French privateer Le Jalouse. On the 20th of said month the said brig was recaptured by the United States sloops of war Montezuma, Captain Murray, and Norfolk, Captain Williams. On the next day (November- 21) she was again captured by two French frigates, the Volunteer and Insurgent, and a prize crew from the frigate Volunteer placed on board, and on the evening of the same day was retaken from the French by Edward D. Griswold, midshipman of the United States sloop of war Montezuma, and several of her crew who had been placed on board when the Fair American was recaptured from the French on the 20th day of said month of November, assisted by Captain Forrest and several of his crew, and conducted to the port of Antigua, where they found the sloops of war Montezuma and Norfolk; that said Edward D. Griswold was appointed prize master of the Fair American by Captain Murray, of the Montezuma, with orders to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>to Philadelphia, but not being able to make that port, went to Now York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Afterwards both vessel and cargo were libeled in the United States District Court for the district of New York,-and on the 11th day of February, 1799, condemned by said court to pay a salvage of one-half of the appraised value of said vessel and her cargo. The vessel was appraised at $6,250, and the cargo at $24,598.16, making together the sum of $30,843.16, of which the salvage paid was one-half, or $15,421.58. From this decree an appeal was entered by Isaac Harvey, jr., owner of the vessel and part owner of the cargo, but said appeal was abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">II. The Fair American was a duly registered vessel of the United States, of 145J| tons burden, built at Amesbury, Mass., in the year 1796, and was owned solely bjr Isaac Harvej7, jr., a citizen of the United States, residing in'Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\">III.

On the 20th of November she was recaptured by the United States sloops of war Montezuma and Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-19\">On the next day, to wit, November 21, she was again captured by the French frigates Volunteer and Insurgent and a prize crew placed on board. On the evening of the same day she was recaptured by the United States sloop of war Montezuma and taken to the port of Antigua and there ordered to the port of Philadelphia. Being unable to reach that port, the vessel was taken to the port of New York, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>vessel and cargo were libeled in the District Court of the United States for the district of New York; and on the 11th day of February, 1799, condemned to pay a salvage of one-half of the appraised value of vessel and cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The vessel was appraised at $6,250 and the cargo at $24,593.16, making the aggregate $30,843.16, one-half of which was paid by the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">From this decree an appeal was entered by Isaac Harvey, jr., owner of the vessel and part of the cargo, but the appeal was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The- Fair American was a duly registered vessel of the United States, of 145^f tons, built in the year 1796, and owned by said Harvey, a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The main question to be determined in the decision of the cause is, Were the seizures of the vessel by the French privateers illegal; and,, if not shown to be such by the evidence, are the claimants entitled to recover the amount of salvage paid, or any amount, because of the condemnation by the United States court in-the proceeding for salvage?</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Both seizures were made by French privateers when war was flagrant between France and England and after the abrogation of the treaty which had been entered into upon the part of .the United States with the Government of France, denominated Treaty of Amity and Commerce. (8 Stat. L., 12.) As has been said in the case of <em>The schooner </em>Nancy, Ward, <em>Master </em>(37 C. Cls. R., 410):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">\u201cAt the time of the capture, under and by virtue of international law, privateers of France had the undoubted and undisputed right to search, and, if necessary, to seize, American vessels. The right of search is preliminary to the right of seizure, and the right of seizure depends upon the result of the exercise of the right of search. Search and seizure are not necessarily illegal, because in time of war the belligerents, founded upon the condition of war, have the right to the exercise of both. Upon the seizure of a vessel, although neutral, all presumptions are in favor of the seizing vessel, and the onus is thrown upon the seized vessel, and therefore when a seizure is made the presumption of law is that it was properly made. If, upon the seizure, all presumptions are in favor of the seizing vessel, there is nothing in this case to indicate that the French vessel, in making a search and consequent seizure, acted illegally so far as the mere seizure is concerned. If the seizure was made in a lawful manner, and if no illegality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>is shown to have existed in what the French privateer did afterwards, then no grounds of recovery exist founded on seizure alone. The liability of France depends upon what it did, and not being a party to the proceedings in which the decree of salvage was made, France is not-bound bjr the legal effects of that decree, except as a mere measure of the damages suffered by the owners of the vessel. The liability of the United States in this proceeding is measured by the liability of France, and if no facts are shown which would make France liable (if this was a proceeding against France), then no liability attaches to the United States under the treaty of September 30, 1800.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">At the time of the seizure of the vessel, it being after the abrogation of the treaty of amity and commerce made in 1788, the French privateer had the right to seize for the purpose of search the vessels of neutrals in the prosecution of the Avar against its enemy, and France was responsible only for the improper and illegal exercise of that right. The right of search is one of the incidents of war to which neuti'als may be subjected, in order not to interfere Avith belligerents in the prosecution of hostilities against each other. It being a recognized right, the proper exercise of the right of search invotyes no responsibility of wrong against the power exercising it.</p>\n<p id=\"A0P\">Upon the seizure of a neutral vessel all presumptions are in favor of the legality of the seizure, it being in pursuance of a conceded right; and the burden of proving to the contrary is thrown upon the parties contesting the legality of the seizure. <em>(Schooner </em>Sally, 37 C. Cls. R., 542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As was said in the case of the Nancy, Ward, master (supra), \u201cthere is nothing in this case to indicate that the French vessel in making the search and consequent seizure acted illegally so far as the mere seizure is concerned.\u201d This case differs from the Sally in this, to wit, that case did not stop with the mere seizure; but it Avas shown that after the capture the French authorities despoiled the ship by breaking its hatches and plundering it of a great part of its cargo, besides destroying the papers of the ship, by the neglect of the French officers in charge. The court in that case, while holding that the illegality of the capture was not shown, it held that the French authorities violated in a gross manner the rights of the American oAvners after the capture; and because of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>illegality of conduct upon the part of the seizing parties the court held that there was a right of recovery. There may be a legal seizure, but the right of the capturing party may be defeated by the illegality of proceedings incident to the care, custody, and condemnation of the alleged prize. In this case the findings show that the Fair American was an American vessel; but beyond that the proof is silent in the requisites to show that the seizure was illegal. The seizure is the only thing complained of in the proceeding; the evidence being deficient in showing facts from which the court would be justified in holding that it was an illegal seizure on the part of the French vessel, and failing in that element of necessary proof, the court decides that the seizure was not illegal. It is only the illegal acts for which the law allows a finding in favor of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The findings, with a copy of this opinion, will be certified to Congress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
