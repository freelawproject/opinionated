Cruden, Pollard <em>&amp; </em>Stewart, of the latter place, and that he arrived at his destined port after a passage of thirty-three days, and that he sailed by the orders of the said house of Cruden, Pollard &amp; Stewart for Tobago, where he discharged. Soon after which he sailed from Tobago to Martinique and Grenada, but that on his return from the said Grenada to Martinique, on the 4th of January now last past, he was taken by the French privateer Two Friends, and carried into Guadeloupe, at which place, without his being-suffered to defend, the said schooner Maria was libelled, condemned, knocked down by inch of candle, and pocketed with a degree of dispatch and mockery of all justice astonishing to one whose habits of life have not led him to an acquaintance with the complaisant and fraternal \u25a0 squeeze of the midnight robber or a French administration, and that his papers, comprehending his log book, register, and those of private concern, were all taken from him by the orders of that standing burlesque of all that is manly and honorable, Victor Hugese; and that he, the appearer, himself, after experiencing the most studied and refined abuse, was thrust into a dungeon, that mild and placid preceptor of French citizenship, where he continued for thirty-three days, at great perils of life, at the end of which time he was exchanged as a prisoner of war and sent to Martinique, from which place he fortunately obtained a passage to Stonington by the way of New York.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">II.

Cru-den, Pollard &amp; Stewart, of the latter place. Upon the arrival of the vessel at Barbados, the master, in his protest, says <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>that he sailed by the orders of said house of Cruden, Pollard &amp; Stewart for Tobago, where he discharged;\u201d that the vessel sailed from thence to Martinique and Grenada, and that while pursuing her return voyage from Grenada to Martinique in January, 1797, she was seized on the high seas by the French privateer Two Friends and carried into Gaudeloupe, where both vessel and cargo were condemned by the French tribunal of prizes sitting at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">When so seized and condemned the vessel was laden with a cargo consisting of planks and copper nails. The grounds of condemnation were: \u201cConsidering that it follows from all the documents, particularly from the instructions given to Capt. Thomas Gardiner by the citizen Cruden, one of the victual-lers of the English army at Martinique, that the schooner Maria sails from island to island in the sendee of the enemy; that she has on board planks and copper nails for the sheathing of English vessels, and that consequently she renounced her neutrality,\u201d the vessel was declared to be good prize.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The question presented for our decision, therefore, is: Was the condemnation legal? The claimant\u2019s contention is that inasmuch as article 24 of the treaty of 1778 between the United States and France, then in force, provided that \u201cplanks, boards, and beams, and all other things proper, either for building or repairing ships, and such other goods as may not have been worked into the form of any instrument or thing prepared for war bjr land or by sea shall not be reputed contraband,\u201d that therefore the condemnation on the grounds stated was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">With what cargo the vessel sailed from Tobago to Martinique and from thence to Grenada does not appear, either from the master\u2019s protest or otherwise, but from the decree it appears that the cargo of the vessel, at the time of her cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ture, from Grenada to Martinique, consisted of \u201cplanks and copper nails for the sheathing of English vessels,\u201d but to whom consigned does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The master in his protest (after reciting that he had sailed for Barbados with a cargo of lumber and oxen consigned to Messrs. Cruden, Pollard &amp; Stewart at that place) says that upon his arrival at Barbados he sailed, by the order of the said house of Cruden, Pollard &amp; Stewart, to Tobago, where he discarged, soon after which he \u201csailed from Tobago to Martinique and Grenada, but that on his return from the said Grenada to Martinique, on 4th January now last past, he was taken by the French privateer Two Friends, and carried into Gaudeloupe,\u201d where the condemnation took place, he being denied the right to defend his vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Assuming that the seizure was lawful and that the vessel was for the reasons stated subject to condemnation and the master to imprisonment, was the condemnation legal when the\u2019master was denied the right to defend?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In the case of the brig Sally, Wells, master (37 C. Cls. R., 74, 77), the court held that even if the capture of the vessel was legal, \u201cit was the duty of the captain of the capturing vessel to afford the captain of the Sally every reasonable opportunity to assert and maintain his rights in the proceedings to condemn the vessel founded upon the capture.\u201d Furthermore, it was held that \u201c it is not the seizure which confers the right of property upon the seizing vessel, but it is the judicial determination of the question of the liability of the ship founded upon such seizure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">In the case of the snow Thetis, Cameron, master (37 C. Cls. R., 470), it was in substance held that where the proof shows that the master was deprived of the right to defend the condemnation was \"ex parte and the proceedings illegal; that to enable the captor to dispose of the ship and cargo there must be a regular judicial proceeding wherein both parties might be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Does the present case, therefore, come within the rule thus announced ?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">True, the right of a neutral to carry on trade with a belligerent is subject to the condition that such right shall not be exercised so as to aid the belligerent, either in the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of his own operations or in escaping- from the effects of those of his enemy. (Hall\u2019s Int. Law, 534.) But a violation of that right will not deprive the master of his right to appear and defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The vessel may have been engaged in carrying goods to aid in the sheathing of English vessels, but the vessel was an American vessel, owned by citizens of the United States, and it was the right of the master to be present to defend against the charge so made, and as he was deprived of that right the court cannot presume that the grounds of condemnation were well founded. Nor can it be held that the decree under the circumstances is conclusive on that point, as the condemnation was <em>ex parte </em>and the proceedings illegal. <em>(Snow </em>Thetis, supra.) Hence the sale and disposition of the ship and cargo were without that judicial sanction essential to pass title.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">It must therefore be held that the condemnation was illegal, and for that reason the claimants are entitled to indemnity' for the insurance paid on the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The owners of the vessel and. cargo are not in court, the only claims being those of the insurers of the vessel. The findings of fact, together with this opinion, will be certified to Congress accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
