For the following reasons we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">Respondent Archie Crawford (\u201cCrawford\u201d) was employed by Petitioner Island Operating Company, Incorporated (\u201cIsland\u201d) as a lead operator on an offshore oil production platform. On the morning of Wednesday, March 12, 2008, Crawford was taken by helicopter to an offshore platform at West Cameron 586 to begin a week-long shift. While disembarking from the helicopter, Crawford\u2019s knee buckled, and he fell down two stairs. Crawford filled out an accident report that day indicating that he bruised and scraped his right knee and sustained bruises on his right side. Crawford testified that he performed his job duties for the remainder of the day, but when he awoke the following morning, he experienced numbness in his left foot and three of the fingers on his left hand. Crawford testified that he asked his supervisor, Joe Pesche (\u201cPesche\u201d), to send a replacement to relieve him so that he could be examined by a physician. There were no physicians on the platform. Crawford testified that Pesche denied his request because a replacement was not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">Crawford\u2019s condition continued to worsen in the days that followed. Crawford testified that on Friday, March 14, 2008, he experienced numbness in his upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>body and that he continued his requests to be relieved from his post and taken to a physician. Crawford further testified that on Saturday, his chest felt numb, and the numbness was more pronounced than it had been on previous days. Crawford indicated that he continued requesting relief. According to Crawford, his condition stabilized on Sunday, but he could not walk. Crawford was replaced by a relief operator on Monday, March 17, 2008, and was taken by helicopter to Lafayette General Medical Center where physicians diagnosed him with a stroke. Crawford has not returned to any kind of work following this diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Crawford filed a claim for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, which Island and Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Corporation (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) contested. An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Crawford\u2019s stroke was a preexisting condition that was not caused by Crawford\u2019s work, but that the stroke was aggravated by his working conditions because of the time Crawford spent on the offshore platform before he was able to seek treatment. Crawford had also suffered a shoulder injury, which the ALJ found was caused by Crawford\u2019s fall. Ultimately, the ALJ awarded Crawford compensation for temporary total disability under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(b) for the time period from March 17 to April 2, 2008, and continuing compensation for permanent total disability under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(a). The ALJ also held Petitioners liable for the medical expenses related to Crawford\u2019s stroke and shoulder injury under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Petitioners appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision and order to the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d), contending that the ALJ erred in finding that Crawford\u2019s working conditions aggravated his stroke. The BRB affirmed the decision and order of the ALJ, and Petitioners now appeal the order of the BRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The BRB hears appeals \u201craising a substantial question of law or fact taken by any party in interest from decisions with respect to claims of employees under [the LHWCA].\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). \u201cThe findings of fact in the decision under review by the Board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that provides \u2018a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diamond M. Drilling Co. v. Marshall, </em>577 F.2d 1003, 1006 (5th Cir.1978) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 299, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. \u2018It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. at 300, 59 S.Ct. 501 (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Thus, the BRB lacks statutory authority to conduct a <em>\u201cde novo </em>review of the evidence or to substitute its views for those of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Mijangos v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>948 F.2d 941, 944 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">\u201cAny person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain a review of that order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). \u201c[Ojur review of BRB decisions is limited to considering errors of law and ensuring that the Board adhered to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>statutory standard of review, that is, whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and are consistent with the law.\u201d <em>Port Cooper/T. Smith Stevedoring Co. v. Hunter, </em>227 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Fulks v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>637 F.2d 1008, 1011 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cCourts of Appeals examine BRB decisions for errors of law and to make certain that the BRB has adhered to its scope of review. We likewise follow a substantial evidence standard.\u201d). \u201c[W]e \u2018may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the ALJ, nor may we reweigh or reappraise the evidence,\u2019 instead we inquire whether there was evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Boland Marine &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Rihner, </em>41 F.3d 997, 1002 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Empire United Stevedores v. Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d 819, 822 (5th Cir.1991)). \u201cMoreover, if supported by the evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the administrative law judge\u2019s inference is conclusive.\u201d <em>Fulks, </em>637 F.2d at 1011; <em>see also Avondale Indus., Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>977 F.2d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe substantial evidence standard is less demanding than that of preponderance of the evidence, and the ALJ\u2019s decision need not constitute the sole inference that can be drawn from the facts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\n<em>B. Compensation under the LHWCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABV\">Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a), the LHWCA provides for compensation for \u201cdisability or death of an employee ... if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States.\u201d The LHWCA defines an \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201caccidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment....\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2). \u201cThe words \u2018arising out of instruct that the employment must have caused the injury.\u201d <em>Bludworth Shipyard, Inc. v. Lira, </em>700 F.2d 1046, 1049 (5th Cir.1983). \u201cAggravation of a preexisting condition can be an injury under the [LHWCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1049; <em>see also Strachan Shipping Co. v. Nash, </em>782 F.2d 513, 517 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Cooper Stevedoring of La., Inc. v. Washington, </em>556 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir.1977) (discussing the \u201cwell-established principle that aggravation of a preexisting condition is compensable under the [LHWCA]\u201d). The aggravation rule requires an employer \u201cto compensate an employee for the full extent of the employee\u2019s disability, including any preexisting disability that the work-related injury worsens.\u201d <em>Strachan, </em>782 F.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Under \u00a7 920(a), a claim is presumed to come within the provisions of the LHWCA in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. \u201c[I]nherent in this provision is the presumption that an injury is causally related to a worker\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 287. Thus, to invoke the presumption under \u00a7 920(a), \u201cthe claimant must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This requires a claimant to prove \u201c(1) that he or she suffered harm, and (2) that conditions existed at work, or an accident occurred at work, that could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the condition.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Gooden v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>135 F.3d 1066, 1068 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Wheatley v. Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307, 313 (D.C.Cir.1968) (stating that evidence showing that there is \u201crealistic possibility\u201d that an injury was work related \u201csufficed ... to require substantial evidence in refutation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Once a claimant makes a prima facie case of causation, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut it with \u201csubstantial evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a); <em>Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 288 (\u201cA presumption can be rebutted by an employer through substantial evidence estab-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Iishing the absence of a connection between the injury and the employment.\u201d). As stated above, \u201cthis evidentiary standard is less demanding than the ordinary civil requirement that a party prove a fact by a preponderance of evidence.\u201d <em>Ortco Contractors, Inc. v. Charpentier, </em>332 F.3d 283, 287 (5th Cir.2003) (emphasis omitted). \u201cIf the employer rebuts the presumption, then the issue of causation must be decided <em>by-looking </em>at all the evidence of record.\u201d <em>Gooden, </em>135 F.3d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\n<em>C. Cranford\u2019s Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWC\">Petitioners in this case challenge the ALJ\u2019s finding that Crawford was entitled to the presumption under \u00a7 920(a) that working conditions had aggravated the disability resulting from Crawford\u2019s stroke.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners contend that Crawford failed to prove that working conditions or a work-related injury aggravated his stroke. Petitioners highlight that the ALJ concluded that Crawford\u2019s stroke was a preexisting condition that likely began before Crawford fell on the steps and was unrelated to work. They further assert that Crawford did not report that he was experiencing the symptoms of a stroke until at least twenty-four hours after his fall. However, Dr. Wael Karim, the neurologist who treated Crawford at Lafayette General Medical Center, testified that a stroke such as Crawford\u2019s would cause permanent and irreversible damage, except in some cases where blood thinner is administered within three hours of the stroke\u2019s onset. Consequently, Petitioners contend that Crawford\u2019s stroke had already caused permanent and irreversible damage by the time Crawford reported his symptoms. Thus, according to Petitioners, the aggravation of Crawford\u2019s condition was caused solely by Crawford\u2019s own inaction and could not have been caused by his working conditions, meaning that Crawford did not present sufficient evidence to entitle him to the presumption under \u00a7 920(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Petitioners liken this case to <em>Bludworth Shipyard, Inc. v. Lira, </em>700 F.2d 1046 (5th Cir.1983). In <em>Bludworth, </em>Alphonso Lira (\u201cLira\u201d) brought a claim under the LHWCA seeking compensation for, <em>inter alia, </em>the cost of a drug detoxification program. <em>Id. </em>at 1048-49. Prior to working for Bludworth Shipyard, Inc. (\u201cBlud-worth\u201d), Lira was addicted to heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 1048. While working at Bludworth, Lira injured his back and received painkilling narcotics as part of his treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 1048-49. Shortly thereafter, Lira began using heroin again, and he contended that his work-related injury had aggravated his preexisting condition (i.e., his propensity to use heroin). <em>Id. </em>at 1049. The BRB determined that Bludworth had failed to rebut the presumption that Lira\u2019s readdiction was caused by his work injury, but this court reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 1049, 1052-53. Stressing that Lira had failed to disclose his past drug use on his employment application because \u201che did not think he would get the job if he told the truth\u201d and that he again deliberately failed to disclose his past drug use to the physicians treating him for his back injury, this court ruled that Lira\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his past drug use \u201coverpowered and nullified the causal connection between his prior back injury and his subsequent read-diction to heroin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1048, 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The instant case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Bludworth. </em>In <em>Bludworth, </em>the court was clear that its \u201cholding stands for the limited proposition that an employee\u2019s <em>unjustified, intentional misconduct </em>may constitute an intervening cause in circumstances presented here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1052 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>(emphasis added). The court further stated that, \u201c[i]f the remote consequences are the direct result of the employee\u2019s <em>unexcused, intentional misconduct, </em>and are only the indirect, unforeseeable result of the work-related injury, the employee may not recover under the LHWCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051 (emphasis added). Petitioners have not set out any evidence suggesting that Crawford engaged in any sort of misconduct by failing to report his symptoms more quickly than he ultimately did. To the contrary, evidence suggests Crawford merely sought to continue performing his normal work duties until his symptoms prevented him from doing so. In the absence of any allegations of misconduct, <em>Bludworth </em>does not govern our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Petitioners further contend that the instant case resembles <em>Ortco Contractors, Inc. v. Charpentier, </em>332 F.3d 283 (5th Cir.2003). In <em>Charpentier, </em>Zeby Charpentier (\u201cCharpentier\u201d) came to work while he was having a heart attack, which escalated into a full-blown cardiac arrest within roughly fifteen minutes of his arrival at work. <em>Id. </em>at 286. In addressing whether Ortco Contractors, Inc. (\u201cOrtco\u201d) had rebutted the presumption of causation under \u00a7 920(a), the court highlighted that \u201caccording to un-rebutted medical testimony \u2014 [Charpen-tier\u2019s heart attack] would have escalated to a fatal cardiac arrest no matter where he was at that time, with the possible exception of the hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291. The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">To apply the aggravation rule in this context would empty it of any meaning under the LHWCA. If an employee\u2019s pre-existing injury would <em>necessarily </em>be exacerbated by <em>any </em>activity regardless of where or when this activity takes place, and an employee happens to go to work, it is an impermissible leap of logic to say that there must be a causal connection between the worsening of the employee\u2019s injury and his work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 292. The court subsequently concluded that \u201cPetitioners submitted substantial evidence sufficient to rebut Char-pentier\u2019s \u00a7 [9]20(a) presumption, and this evidence established that [Charpentier\u2019s] death at his place of employment was, in essence, a coincidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Unlike the instant case, however, <em>Char-pentier </em>addressed whether the presumption under \u00a7 920(a) had been rebutted. Here, the inquiry focuses instead on whether Crawford set out sufficient facts to entitle him to the \u00a7 920(a) presumption.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As discussed above, this is a relatively low threshold to meet and requires Crawford to set out that \u201cconditions existed at work ... <em>could have </em>caused, aggravated, or accelerated\u201d his stroke. <em>See Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 287 (emphasis added). The three-hour time frame Dr. Karim discussed as being particularly crit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ical in treating Crawford\u2019s stroke was not necessarily the only time period relevant to Crawford\u2019s treatment. Dr. Karim repeatedly stressed in his testimony that treatment should be administered as soon as possible. He further testified that post-stroke treatment includes controlling a patient\u2019s blood pressure, diabetes, and stopping the patient from smoking. Moreover, although there was some evidence to the contrary, Crawford testified that he repeatedly requested to be relieved from his post on the offshore platform so that he could receive treatment. As a consequence, we agree with the BRB that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s inference that the damage caused by Crawford\u2019s stroke was aggravated by the six days he spent on the offshore platform before he received treatment. <em>See Mendoza v. Marine Pers. Co., </em>46 F.3d 498, 500 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe ALJ\u2019s selection among inferences is conclusive if supported by the evidence and the law.\u201d). Thus, Crawford was entitled to the presumption under \u00a7 920(a). Because this is the only issue properly preserved on appeal, we AFFIRM the order of the BRB upholding the ALJ\u2019s decision and order awarding compensation to Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">For the reasons stated above, the order of the BRB is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-5\">. On this appeal, Petitioners focus solely on the issue of aggravation and do not challenge any rulings related to Crawford's shoulder injury or the cause of Crawford's stroke.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">. The ALJ in this case acknowledged that there was some evidence that Crawford did not take the earliest opportunity to return onshore but ultimately concluded that Petitioners did not present substantial evidence to rebut the presumption that working conditions aggravated Crawford's stroke-related disability. As the BRB noted in its decision and order, Petitioners did not challenge this finding on appeal to the BRB, and instead only contended that Crawford had not established entitlement to the presumption under \u00a7 920(a). On the appeal to this court, Petitioners contend that they produced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that working conditions aggravated Crawford\u2019s condition. However, Petitioners have waived this argument by failing to raise it before the BRB, and as a consequence, we decline to address the merits of this argument. <em>See Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>97 F.3d 815, 819 (5th Cir.1996) (finding waiver of an argument not raised before the BRB); <em>Superior Boat Works, Inc. v. Cremeen, </em>303 Fed.Appx. 183, 188 (5th Cir.2008) (\"Superior did not challenge the ALJ's decision before the [BRB] and, thus, has waived this issue on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
