After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">A. 1971 Application for CIB</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Appellant Bello is the child of Lucia Sanchez, born in Puerto Rico, and Carlos E. Bello, a citizen of the Dominican Republic. In 1967, the parents met in Puerto Rico. In 1969, the parents and their infant daughter moved to the Bronx, New York. In August 1970, two months before Appellant Bello was born, Bello\u2019s father died. Bello\u2019s mother moved to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On October 21, 1970, Appellant Bello was born in the Dominican Republic. On February 16, 1971, Bello\u2019s mother returned to the United States with Bello\u2019s sister, leaving Bello in the care of relatives in the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">In July 1971, Bello\u2019s mother applied for CIB on behalf of Appellant Bello and his sister. The Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) determined that Appellant Bello was eligible for CIB benefits, but that those benefits were subject to suspension, pursuant to the alien non-payment provision of the Social Security Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(t). Under the alien nonpayment provision, benefits cannot be paid to an individual who is not a U.S. citizen if that individual \u201cis outside the United States\u201d for six consecutive calendar months. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(t)(l). Bel-lo\u2019s mother did not appeal the denial of the CIB application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">On September 15, 1980, Bello moved to the United States to live with his mother and sister. From October 1980 until October 1988, when Bello turned 18, he received CIB benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">B. Bello\u2019s 2002 Letter to SSA Requesting Retroactive Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"Agc\">On December 6, 2002, Bello received a letter from the SSA stating that he was eligible for CIB beginning in October 1970 until he turned 18 in October 1988. In a December 11, 2002 letter, Bello advised the SSA that he had not received benefits between October 1970 and October 1980, and requested that those benefits be paid retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">In response, the SSA sent Bello a December 12, 2002 letter explaining that he did not receive benefits during that ten-year period because he was not a U.S. citizen and was not living in the United States at the time. Bello does not dispute that he was in the Dominican Republic during the ten-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">In a December 17, 2002 letter, Bello advised the SSA that he in fact was a U.S. citizen. Bello submitted documentation, including his October 1980 U.S. passport application and his mother\u2019s birth certificate, showing that, even though he was born in the Dominican Republic, his mother was actually born in Puerto Rico, and thus he was a U.S. citizen. On June 3, 2003, Bello provided the SSA with an affidavit from Bello\u2019s mother confirming her citizenship and other facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">In October 2005, an SSA district manager determined that the 1971 decision about Bello\u2019s CIB benefits could not be reopened.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SSA found that Bello\u2019s ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>efits were denied in 1971 because Bello \u201cwas born in the Dominican Republic and his mother presented no proof of U.S. citizenship\u201d at that time. With Bello being a non-U.S. citizen residing outside the United States in 1971, Bello\u2019s CIB benefits could not be paid under the alien nonpayment provision. In November 2005, the Appeals Council dismissed Bello\u2019s request for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">C. 2007 Request for Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In January 2006, Bello wrote a letter to the Appeals Council asking for further review of his 2002 letter request to reopen or for remand for reconsideration. In March 2006, the SSA dismissed Bello\u2019s reconsideration request. In April 2007, Bello sent a letter formally requesting a hearing on his request to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">On September 10, 2008, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) dismissed Bello\u2019s request without holding a hearing. The ALJ concluded that Bello did not have a right to a hearing because, pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.903(0, the SSA\u2019s denial of Bello\u2019s letter request for reopening was \u201cnot an initial determination giving the claimant appeal rights, so a reconsidered determination was never made.\u201d The ALJ concluded that \u201creopening at any time does not apply\u201d because: (1) the record failed to show that Bello\u2019s mother appealed or provided additional evidence to correct the 1971 determination; and (2) Bello did not present his evidence of U.S. citizenship until 1980. The ALJ opined \u2014 repeating an earlier admonition that the discussion of the issue was \u201conly for opinion purposes\u201d \u2014 that there was no error on the face of the evidence existing at the time of the initial 1971 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">On June 4, 2010, the Appeals Council denied review, agreeing with the ALJ that \u201cthe denial of a request for reopening does not constitute an initial determination and does not convey administrative and/or judicial appellate rights (20 CFR 404.903(i) and 20 CFR 404.930).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">D. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Bello\u2019s complaint seeks judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision and a retroactive award of benefits. The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss Bello\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). The Commissioner argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) because Bello had not obtained a final decision made after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">In a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), a magistrate judge recommended granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Overruling Bello\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed Bello\u2019s complaint. Bello filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">A district court\u2019s jurisdiction to review claims arising under the Social Security Act is limited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which permits review only \u201cafter any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1255 (11th Cir.2003). The Act does not define \u201cfinal decision,\u201d instead leaving it to the Commissioner to give meaning to that term through regulations. <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 106, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 2083, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a). Under the regulations, a final decision for \u00a7 405(g) purposes is an initial determination that a claimant has pursued through all steps of the administrative review process, including an initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>determination, a reconsideration determination, a hearing decision by an ALJ and discretionary review by the Appeals Council. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(a)(l)(5); <em>see also Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2466-67, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (explaining the regulations \u201cspecify that the finality required for judicial review is achieved only after the further steps of a hearing before an administrative law judge and, possibly, consideration by the Appeals Council\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The denial of a request to reopen a prior final and binding determination, however, is not an initial determination and is not subject to the administrative review process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.903((); <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 108, 97 S.Ct. 980, 986, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1256; <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, a denial of a request to reopen is not a \u201cfinal decision ... made after a hearing\u201d under \u00a7 405(g). <em>Califano, </em>430 U.S. at 108-09, 97 S.Ct. at 986; <em>Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1256. As such, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to review a denial of a request to reopen except where: (1) the claimant raises a colorable constitutional claim, or (2) the Commissioner <em>de facto </em>reopens and reconsiders the merits of the prior administrative determination or decision. <em>See Califano, </em>430 U.S. at 108-09, 97 S.Ct. at 986; <em>Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1256.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Here, Bello\u2019s complaint seeks judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his December 2002 request to reopen the 1971 decision about his CIB benefits. Ordinarily, the district court would lack subject matter jurisdiction to review such a denial. Bello contends the district court has subject matter jurisdiction here because the Commissioner <em>de facto </em>reopened his 1971 CIB determination by reviewing it on the merits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">We conclude that the Commissioner did not <em>de facto </em>reopen the 1971 decision about Bello\u2019s CIB benefits. Generally, a final decision by the Secretary will be deemed reopened if it is \u201creconsidered on the merits to any extent and at any administrative level.\u201d <em>Cherry v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1186, 1189 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988, a prior decision may be reopened at any time if it is \u201cfully or partially unfavorable to a party, but only to correct clerical error or an error that appears on the face of the evidence that was considered when the determination or decision was made.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988(c)(8). The ALJ must be allowed some leeway to evaluate how newly presented evidence relates back to the prior application in order to determine whether to reopen the ease under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988, without the evaluation amounting to a <em>de facto </em>reopen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ing of the merits. <em>Passopulos v. Sullivan, </em>976 F.2d 642, 646 (11th Cir.1992); <em>Brown v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1233, 1237 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Cherry, </em>760 F.2d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">As to the SSA\u2019s December 6, 2002 letter informing Bello that he was \u201celigible\u201d for benefits, Bello concedes that the initial letter only \u201cbeg[an] the process of reopening.\u201d However, the SSA explained in a follow-up letter sent to Bello a week later that, although Bello was \u201celigible\u201d for benefits, his benefits were denied due to the alien suspension rules, which indicates that the first letter was not a reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Under our precedent, a reopening requires an actual reconsideration of the merits, not just an intent to reconsider. <em>See Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1256-57 (noting that, \u201cin contrast, when our precedent has concluded that a reopening occurred, the case involved an actual reopening of a prior claim by either the ALJ or the Appeals Council\u201d); <em>see also Wolfe v. Chater, </em>86 F.3d 1072, 1078-79 (11th Cir.1996) (reopening occurred when ALJ, considering third application for benefits, reexamined merits of determination on first and second application concerning claimant\u2019s educational level); <em>Macon v. Sullivan, </em>929 F.2d 1524, 1529 (11th Cir.1991) (reopening occurred when Appeals Council reexamined merits of determination on claimants\u2019 first application concerning their status as surviving children after ALJ denied request for a hearing on basis of res judica-ta).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Additionally, a <em>de facto </em>reopening does not occur while the SSA is merely evaluating newly proffered evidence to determine whether to reopen the case. <em>See Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1256-57; <em>Brown, </em>921 F.2d at 1237. At most, the SSA\u2019s December 6, 2002 letter was a precursor to this evaluation process. It was not until Bello requested benefits and submitted documentation in support of his 2002 request, which the SSA apparently construed as a motion to reopen, that the SSA requested further information from Bello to evaluate his request to reopen. And, the letters Bello sent the SSA requested a decision as to whether it would reopen his case, reflecting that neither Bello nor the SSA viewed the case as reopened. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that the December 6, 2002 letter was not a <em>de facto </em>reopening of the 1971 denial of Bello\u2019s CIB benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Likewise, the ALJ\u2019s September 10, 2008 order dismissing Bello\u2019s request for a hearing was not a <em>de facto </em>reopening. The ALJ\u2019s dismissal order found only that Bel-lo did not have a right to request a hearing before an ALJ under the administrative regulations. That finding was based exclusively on the fact that the SSA had denied Bello\u2019s request to reopen and not on the merits of the 1971 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">After the ALJ found that Bello did not have a right to request a hearing, the ALJ did express his \u201copinion\u201d as to whether there was an error on the face of the 1971 evidence to warrant a reopening and did discuss Bello\u2019s new evidence. However, the ALJ explicitly noted both before and after the opinion that his discussion of this issue was \u201conly for opinion purposes.\u201d Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s discussion \u201cfor opinion purposes only\u201d evaluated only whether reopening might be warranted, which would not constitute a reopening in any event. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988; <em>Pas-sopulos, </em>976 F.2d at 646. Finally, the Appeals Council\u2019s subsequent denial of review agreed only with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Bello was not entitled to a hearing. Under these circumstances, the ALJ\u2019s dismissal did not constitute a <em>de facto </em>reopening of the initial 1971 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">In sum, Bello\u2019s complaint does not fall within an exception to the general rule precluding judicial review of the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>sioner\u2019s refusals to reopen. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the Commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">. Because the SSA destroyed Bello\u2019s 1971 file as part of its record management policy, his 1971 CIB application and the SSA\u2019s decision are not in the record. However, the parties do not dispute that the SSA denied Bello\u2019s 1971 application pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(t), and Bello does not contend his mother appealed that decision or requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-16\">. Although copies of the 2002 correspondence between the SSA and Bello are not in the record, the parties agree about the contents of the correspondence. It appears Bello did not file a formal request for reopening of the 1971 decision. However, later on the SSA appar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>endy construed Bello\u2019s earlier 2002 correspondence as a request to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-5\">.We find no merit to Bello's argument that the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of a request to reopen is subject to judicial review under <em>Bloodsworth. </em>As the district court correctly pointed out, <em>Bloodsworth </em>involved a denial of review rather than a denial of a request to reopen and thus is inapposite. <em>See Bloodsworth, </em>703 F.2d at 1238. Furthermore, in <em>Bloodsworth, </em>this Court explicitly distinguished the denial of a request for review, which may be subject to judicial review, and the denial of a request to reopen, which is precluded from judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1255 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b862-9\">. In the district court, Bello also argued that his complaint raised a colorable due process claim. However, Bello does not raise that argument on appeal and thus has abandoned it. <em>Cunningham v. Dist. Attorney's Office for Escambia Cnty., </em>592 F.3d 1237, 1254 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that an appellant waives any challenge to the dismissal of a claim by not raising it in his appeal brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b864-18\">. Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, Bello\u2019s claim that he was entitled to CIB between October 1970 and October 1980 is not properly before us, and we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
