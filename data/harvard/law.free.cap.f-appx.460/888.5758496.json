Guinn appeals his convictions for failing to file tax returns for the years 2003 through 2006, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. He presents one ground for the reversal of his convictions and a new trial: whether he was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecutor made improper and prejudicial comments during his opening statement and closing argument that appealed to the jurors\u2019 pecuniary interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">We review allegations of prosecutorial misconduct <em>de novo </em>because it is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). We view a prosecutor\u2019s comments in opening statement and closing argument in the context of the trial as a whole. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>123 F.3d 1381, 1400 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">A defendant demonstrates prosecutorial misconduct by showing that (1) the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, and (2) the comments prejudicially affected substantial rights. <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. A prosecutor may not, in his opening statement or closing argument, invoke the individual pecuniary interests of the jury as taxpayers. <em>United States v. Smyth, </em>556 F.2d 1179, 1185 (5th Cir.1977). In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights by changing the trial\u2019s outcome, we consider: (1) whether the challenged comments had a tendency to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant, (2) whether the comments were isolated or extensive, (3) whether the comments were deliberately or accidentally placed before the jury, and (4) the strength of the proof establishing the guilt of the defendant. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">Here, the prosecutor made improper comments before the jury in his opening statement and closing argument, comments that appealed to the jurors\u2019 pecuniary interests as taxpayers. However, Guinn has not shown that the result of his trial would have been different but for these improper\u2019 comments. The proof of Guinn\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and the improper comments were isolated to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>small portion of what the prosecutor had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
