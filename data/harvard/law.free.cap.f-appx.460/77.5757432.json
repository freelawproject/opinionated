During this time, Jackson contends, \u201che relentlessly sought revelation and resolution of the mass murderous lethal environmental crimes that he has titled \u2018The Phantom Evil.\u2019\u201d Compl. at 1 (emphasis omitted). Jackson allegedly had \u201cdiscovered that a deadly peril was being allowed to never cease inflicting fatalities and health hazards on mass millions of people in the public at large[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jackson\u2019s efforts to expose this \u201cPhantom Evil\u201d were not well received, <em>see id. </em>at 2-3, and he contends that \u201cconflict\u201d over his efforts led to termination of his employment. <em>Id </em>at 2. Jackson claims that \u201chis employment terminated for malicious and discriminatory reasons that [were] intended to deprive him of the cash flow needed to successfully litigate court ordered public disclose [sic] of the Phantom Evil.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Jackson seeks damages from the defendants (who are allegedly \u201cemployees of the aforementioned labor agencies or employees of clients,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4), claiming that he was the victim of discrimination, \u201cobstructed justice,\u201d and a \u201ccover up and censorship ... by clients of Labor Ready\u201d and others. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">The District Court deferred ruling on Jackson\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pau-peris </em>(IFP) and directed him to file an amended complaint, noting that its review indicated that Jackson\u2019s claims as pleaded were subject to dismissal as frivolous. The District Court entered a separate order directing Jackson to communicate with the court exclusively by written motion, citing Jackson\u2019s \u201cprior improper contacts with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Docket # 6 at 1. Jackson responded by filing a \u201cMotion for Court Communication Status and [IFP] Hearing,\u201d docket # 7, arguing that he is the victim of \u201cabuses by clerks of this court and other courts\u201d seeking to suppress information about the \u201cPhantom Evil.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. Jackson did not file an amended complaint as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">The District Court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>concluding that Jackson\u2019s allegations \u201cfall within the fanciful, delusional, and/or frivolous categories.\u201d Docket #8 at 3. The District Court denied Jackson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP as \u201cmoot.\u201d Jackson timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Jackson has been granted leave to proceed IFP on appeal, we must determine whether the appeal is subject to dismissal as frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). An appeal is frivolous if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). After a review of the record, we conclude that this appeal must be dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) \u201cauthorizes the dismissal of a[n IFP] complaint as factually frivolous if a court determines that the contentions are clearly baseless.\u201d <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1085 (3d Cir.1995). Here, the crux of Jackson\u2019s complaint is that he experienced various wrongs (e.g., termination of his employment, a \u201ccover up and censorship\u201d) due to his efforts to expose unspecified \u201cmass murderous lethal environmental crimes\u201d\u2014 the so-called \u201cPhantom Evil.\u201d Because Jackson\u2019s claims for relief, if any, against the named defendants are plainly entwined with the existence of this \u201cPhantom Evil,\u201d the District Court properly determined that the complaint is fanciful and baseless. \u201c[A] finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them.\u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Jackson did not amend his complaint to cure this deficiency in pleading despite being afforded an opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this record, his complaint was properly dismissed for frivolousness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">In sum, this appeal has no arguable basis in law or fact and will be dismissed for that reason under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. Jackson\u2019s complaint is also legally frivolous insofar he seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for \"negligence and malicious disregard of his constitutional rights.\u201d Compl. at 1. \"To prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant acted under color of state law, in other words, that there was state action.\u201d <em>Great Western Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159, 175-76 (3d Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1798, 179 L.Ed.2d 655 (2011). Jackson names private individuals and entities as defendants, and there is no alleged state action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">. We note the District Court\u2019s decision to deny as \"moot\u201d Jackson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP. It is settled that a district court must use \u201ca two-step analysis in evaluating motions to proceed under \u00a7 1915. First, the district court evaluates a litigant\u2019s financial status and determines whether [he] is eligible to proceed [IFP] under \u00a7 1915(a). Second, the court assesses the complaint under \u00a7 1915( [e]) to determine whether it is frivolous.\u201d <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 (3d Cir.1990). If the litigant is indigent, IFP status ordinarily should be granted. <em>Gibbs v. Ryan, </em>160 F.3d 160, 161 n. 1 (3d Cir.1998). As a procedural matter, therefore, the District Court should have addressed Jackson\u2019s IFP motion before dismissing the complaint as frivolous, rather than deny the IFP motion as moot after dismissal. This procedural misstep notwithstanding, the District Court was undoubtedly correct in its determination regarding the frivolity of Jackson\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
