Villanueva-Almendarez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Villaneuva-Almendarez, a native and citizen of Honduras, was deported from the United States in January 1997, September 1999, March 2000, and January 2006, and during that time he accumulated five convictions in the courts of Georgia and Florida for offenses, including criminal damage to property, burglary, and shoplifting. In October 2006, authorities arrested Villaneuva-Almendarez in Georgia, and he later pleaded guilty to reentering the United States illegally and received a sentence of 33 months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. In 2010, Villaneuva-Almendarez again reentered the United States illegally, and after he was sentenced to a term of 51 months of imprisonment, the government moved to revoke his supervised release. In response to Villanueva-Almendarez\u2019s request for leniency, the district court explained that it \u201cshared the frustrations [of others] ... that [Villanueva-Almendarez] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>continues to return\u201d to the United States despite warnings that another illegal reentry would be \u201ca serious offense for which he could serve significant time.\u201d The district court considered the sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and reasonably determined that a sentence of 12 months of imprisonment consecutive to Villaneuva-Almendarez\u2019s sentence of 51 months of imprisonment for his illegal reentry was \u201cneeded in order to enforce [the] Court\u2019s sentences and orders as well as to impress upon ... and hopefully deter\u201d him from future similar conduct. Villaneuva-Almen-darez\u2019s sentence to a term well below the advisory guideline range is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">We AFFIRM Villanueva-Almendarez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
