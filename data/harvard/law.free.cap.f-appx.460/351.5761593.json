The district court imposed the 24-month prison term \u201cto meet the objectives of punishment and deterrence.\u201d Wilson contends that the court erred in light of <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). We review for plain error because Wilson failed to preserve the purported <em>Miller </em>error in the district court. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>we held that it is improper for a district court to rely on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, which include punishment, for the modification or revocation of a term of supervised release because Congress deliberately omitted that subsection from the first clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). 634 F.3d at 844. Unlike the revocation under \u00a7 3583(e) at issue in <em>Miller, </em>the revocation of Wilson\u2019s term of supervised release was mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). Because \u00a7 3583(g) does not expressly invoke the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e), we find no clear or obvious error under <em>Miller. See United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095-97 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Ibanez, </em>No. 11-10504, 454 Fed.Appx. 328, 329-30, 2011 WL 6337771, at *1 (5th Cir. Dec. 19, 2011) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
