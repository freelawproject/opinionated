The district court imposed various sentences ranging from 135-months\u2019 to life imprisonment, with the four life sentences running concurrently. On direct appeal, our court vacated Macias\u2019 life sentences on two counts as exceeding the statutory maximum and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 561-62 (5th Cir.1996). With leave of court, the Government instead dismissed those two counts in April 1996. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(a). In February 2011, Macias moved to vacate the dismissal and reinstate his convictions on those counts, maintaining he had not been advised of the Government\u2019s motion when it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Macias contends the district court erred by exceeding the scope of its authority under the mandate in <em>Gaytan </em>by allowing the Government to dismiss the two counts. But, he cites no authority for showing he has a right to be sentenced on counts the Government chooses to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">Macias\u2019 contention-that an indictment cannot be dismissed after a conviction on it-is contrary to precedent. <em>See Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 98 S.Ct. 81, 81-82, 86, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977) (dismissing indictment after conviction on it). In any event, Macias remains imprisoned on the life sentences imposed for his convictions on two other counts. If a defendant must remain imprisoned under a valid sentence, our court may decline to consider any issues pertaining to other sentences concurrent with the valid sentence. <em>Williams v. Maggio, </em>714 F.2d 554, 555 (5th Cir.1983). This concurrent-sentence doctrine-a doctrine \u201cof judicial convenience\u201d \u2014 may be applied if no adverse collateral consequences attach as a result. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the concurrent \u2014 sentence doctrine is applicable, as there is no indication Macias will suffer such consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
