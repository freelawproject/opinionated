The district court dismissed the case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and (ii) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. The court denied \u201creconsideration\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). <em>See Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Jimenez\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely as to the judgment dismissing his case despite his reliance on the district court\u2019s unauthorized extension of time to file his post-judgment motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b); Fed. R.App. P. 26(b); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The notice was timely as to the order disposing of his Rule 60(b) motion, and we liberally construe the notice of appeal and his brief in this court as challenging that ruling. <em>See Trust Co. Bank v. U.S. Gypsum, Co., </em>950 F.2d 1144, 1148 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Because we must recast this appeal as one that solely challenges the denial of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion, our review is for whether the district court abused its discretion by denying the motion. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Jimenez complains that he had procedural rights that were not provided him. Before any process is due, the prisoner must have \u201ca liberty interest that the prison action implicated or infringed.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Joslin, </em>501 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Jimenez argues that the district court should not have dismissed his lawsuit. His complaint, though, failed to allege sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face that his placement in administrative segregation \u201cimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">We have previously rejected an argument that Texas created a liberty interest regarding placement in administrative segregation by promulgating its Administrative Segregation Plan. <em>Pichardo v. Kinker, </em>73 F.3d 612, 613 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Fultz v. Collins, </em>No. 92-5214, 1993 WL 347283, at *4 (5th Cir. Aug.20, 1993) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.3. Jimenez relies on <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), but the Supreme Court has abrogated Hewitt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>methodology. <em>Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 222-23, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005). Jimenez\u2019s argument that his placement in administrative segregation limits his opportunity to participate in certain time-earning programs fails. <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 958-59 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\">Jimenez has failed to show that the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the judgment dismissing his lawsuit was so unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </em>38 F.3d at 1408.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
