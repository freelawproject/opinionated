Cody, Esq., Shows, Cali, Berthelot &amp; Walsh, L.L.P., Bridget Benoit Denicola, Assistant Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General, David Glen Sanders, Assistant Attorney General, Louisiana Department of Justice, Baton Rouge, LA, for Defendants-Appellees.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b394-31\">Before GARZA, SOUTHWICK, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b394-32\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b394-33\">Kelvin Wells appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for \u201cvio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>lation of due process clause and equal protection\u201d which asked the district court to assume jurisdiction of the state court matters and award damages for civil rights violations. Wells claims that his state court complaints and filings have been ignored by Judge Kling and the clerk of court, Doug Welborn, acting with discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Wells fails to address the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cEast Baton Rouge Family Court\u201d is not a juridical entity, so he has abandoned any argument regarding that party. <em>Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1993)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">With respect to the district court\u2019s conclusion that Judge Kling is entitled to absolute immunity, Wells fails to point to any facts showing that Judge Kling acted outside his judicial authority. His citation to <em>Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991), dealing with individual capacity liability of a non-judicial government official for employment decisions, is inapposite to the facts (such as they can be discerned) of this case. Indeed, <em>Hafer </em>distinguished the case before it from the case of judges carrying out their judicial duties. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 112 S.Ct. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the allegations against the Clerk of Court, Doug Welborn. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 677-80, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Finally, Wells\u2019s request that the federal district court \u201ctake control\u201d of the state court proceedings runs afoul of the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-35\">. Wells included his notice of appeal with his motion for relief from judgment in the same document. Because the court denied the motion for relief, we conclude that the notice of appeal is effective as of the date of the court's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>denial to appeal the district court\u2019s June 7, 2011 judgment. <em>Burt v. Ware, </em>14 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
