California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Torres-Ojeda has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In his amended brief, counsel requested that Torres-Ojeda be given additional time to respond to the statements in that brief. Torres-Ojeda took no action and filed nothing after counsel filed his original <em>An-ders </em>brief. In the intervening time between the amended brief and this order, he has similarly failed to file anything. Accordingly, we conclude that Torres-Oje-da has had sufficient time to file something if we wished to do so; the motion for additional time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
