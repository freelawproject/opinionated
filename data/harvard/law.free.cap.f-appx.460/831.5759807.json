In the Florida courts, Rios collaterally attacked, Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850, his conviction for second degree murder on the ground that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to move for a judgment of acquittal. Because the Florida courts reasonably applied clearly established federal law when they concluded that Rios had failed to establish that his counsel had performed deficiently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Borden v. Allen, </em>646 F.3d 785, 808 (11th Cir.2011). To obtain a writ of habeas corpus, a defendant must prove that the decision of the state court was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court unreasonably applies clearly established federal law when the state court \u201c \u2018identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the] decisions [of the Supreme Court], but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2534-35, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). To constitute an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law, the decision of the state court must be \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). A habeas petitioner must \u201c[sjurmount ... [a] high bar\u201d to overcome the presumption of rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>sonableness accorded counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and he must overcome the \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard applied to the decisions of counsel under section 2254(d)(1). <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788. In other words, the petitioner must establish that no \u201creasonable argument [can be made] that counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The district court correctly denied Rios habeas relief. The Florida courts reasonably concluded that Rios\u2019s attorney had not been \u201cdeficient for failing to raise a meritless\u201d motion to acquit Rios of first degree murder. <em>Freeman v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008). The Florida courts reasonably determined that the state had presented sufficient evidence to prove that Rios had murdered Elvin Rodriguez with \u201cpremeditated design.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 782.04(l)(a)(l). One of Rios\u2019s cohorts, Edgardo Mercado, testified that Rios stabbed Rodriguez repeatedly because he was a snitch, and Mercado\u2019s account of the murder was consistent with the conditions at the murder scene and the findings of the medical examiner that Rodriguez had been stabbed at least 87 times with two knives and had been struck in his left lung, aorta, and jugular vein. <em>See Boyd v. State, </em>910 So.2d 167, 182 (Fla.2005) (\u201c[T]he deliberate use of a knife to stab a victim multiple times in vital organs is evidence that can support a finding of premeditation.\u201d). Rios argues that the decision of the Florida courts was unreasonable because a motion for a judgment of acquittal would have highlighted the discrepancies between Mercado\u2019s testimony and other evidence, but \u201c[t]he fact that the evidence is contradictory does not warrant a judgment of acquittal,\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. State, </em>900 So.2d 495, 508 (Fla.2005). The Florida courts reasonably concluded that Rios had failed to establish that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We AFFIRM the denial of Rios\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
