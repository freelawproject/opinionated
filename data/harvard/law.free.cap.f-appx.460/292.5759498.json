The district court determined that the suit was best classed as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it. In this appeal, Be-dolla argues that his claims are properly brought under \u00a7 2241 because they concern the infringement of his constitutional rights and because he has no other avenue in which to seek relief. He also argues that the district court erred by not considering <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">When considering the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Our analysis of Bedolla\u2019s arguments and pertinent authority show no error in connection with the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">Because Bedolla\u2019s arguments relate to events that occurred prior to sentencing, his suit arises under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426 (5th Cir.2005). He has already filed the one \u00a7 2255 motion to which he is entitled, and he has not received authorization to file another. Consequently, the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Insofar as Bedolla contends that he should be permitted to file a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 because <em>Bond, </em>131 S.Ct. 2355, meets the parameters of the savings clause, he is mistaken. <em>Bond, </em>a direct appeal, did not decriminalize his offense behavior, nor did it hold that claims such as the ones he raises may be presented in \u00a7 2241 petitions. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
