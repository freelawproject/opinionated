Johns appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion requesting a Rule 7(a) reply from Davalos. We conclude that we have no jurisdiction over this appeal, and we therefore DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">On February 7, 2011, Mary Davalos (\u201cDavalos\u201d) filed this lawsuit in federal district court against Jason Johns (\u201cJohns\u201d), a City of Dallas Police Officer, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for illegal arrest and excessive force in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. On April 15, 2011, Johns filed an answer to her complaint, wherein he asserted, inter alia, the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Johns then filed a motion seeking the court to order Davalos to file a reply pursuant to Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under <em>Schultea v. Wood, </em>47 F.3d 1427 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc), the district court \u201cmay, in its discretion, insist that a plaintiff file a reply tailored to an answer pleading the defense of qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1433-34. In his motion, Johns argued that, under <em>Schultea, </em>\u201c[vindicating the immunity doctrine will ordinarily require such a reply, and a district court\u2019s discretion not to do so is narrow indeed when greater detail might assist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1434; <em>see also Reyes v. Sazan, </em>168 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1999). Davalos opposed the motion. On July 13, 2011, the district court denied Johns\u2019s motion. The court explained that it \u201cha[d] reviewed Plaintiffs Complaint and [found] that the allegations are pled with sufficient particularity to respond to the defense of qualified immunity, making a Rule 7(a) Reply unnecessary.\u201d Johns appealed the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">We must first decide whether we have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal. Johns argues that we have jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Under <em>Cohen, </em>the collateral order doctrine allows appeals from a \u201csmall class [of orders] which final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ly determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be an immediately appealable order under the <em>Cohen </em>collateral order doctrine, an order must: \u201c[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Will v. Hallock, </em>546 U.S. 345, 349, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Johns argues that the district court\u2019s order deprived him of his qualified immunity from suit, because the order \u201cfinally resolved the issue of whether Johns was subject to at least limited discovery and other pretrial matters.\u201d Johns stresses that the Supreme Court has emphasized that qualified immunity is \u201can entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation,\u201d and that \u201ceven such pretrial matters as discovery are to be avoided if possible.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (citing <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 816-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). Johns asserts that we have jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court\u2019s order subjects him to discovery-a burden of litigation from which qualified immunity should protect him-and his immunity from this burden is too important and too independent from Davalos\u2019s claims to be denied immediate appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. We were presented with the same jurisdictional question in <em>Fulton v. Caraway, </em>400 Fed.Appx. 918 (5th Cir.2010), in which we held that a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a Rule 7(a) reply was not an immediately appealable collateral order. Although <em>Fulton </em>is a non-precedential opinion, see 5th Cir. Rule 47.5, we find that its reasoning is sound, persuasive, and applicable to the question before us. In <em>Fulton, </em>we explained that the Supreme Court has held that government officials can appeal district court decisions that deny them qualified immunity, to the extent that the district court decisions turn on questions of law. <em>Id. </em>at 919-20; see <em>also Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 526-28, 105 S.Ct. 2806. The Court\u2019s rationale is that qualified immunity is not \u201ca mere defense to liability,\u201d but \u201can <em>immunity from suit\u201d </em>and the burdens of litigation. <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806. Thus, the <em>Fulton </em>court held that \u201c[w]e unquestionably would have jurisdiction over an appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss a \u00a7 1983 claim on a defense of qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>400 Fed.Appx. at 920. However, we stated that a denial of a motion for a Rule 7(a) reply is a \u201cnon-dispositive\u201d order that does not fulfill the first requirement of the <em>Cohen </em>collateral order doctrine \u2014 \u201cthe order [does] not conclusively determine the disputed question\u201d of the defendant\u2019s entitlement to qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s order does not contain a ruling on whether the facts alleged would overcome qualified immunity, only that they were detailed enough to allow the court to rule on any subsequent dispositive motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Likewise, in the present case, the district court\u2019s denial of Johns\u2019s motion is a non-dispositive order that does not finally determine the issue of Johns\u2019s qualified immunity from suit. Johns argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s order effectively constitutes a denial of qualified immunity on the pleadings. However, we reject Johns\u2019s argument. The district court\u2019s order states only that \u201cthe allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tions [in Davalos\u2019s complaint] are pled with sufficient particularity to <em>respond </em>to the defense of qualified immunity, making a Rule 7(a) Reply unnecessary.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, the district court did not make a ruling that the facts alleged in Davalos\u2019s complaint would overcome Johns\u2019s defense of qualified immunity. Because the district court\u2019s denial of Johns\u2019s motion for a Rule 7(a) reply does not conclusively determine the disputed question of Johns\u2019s entitlement to qualified immunity, the court\u2019s order is not an immediately appealable collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
