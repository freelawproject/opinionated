Yasin contends that his failure to exhaust was due to interference by prison officials, that he should have been given notice and an opportunity to address the exhaustion issue prior to the dismissal of his complaint, and that there is now no administrative remedy available because the time for grieving has elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-24\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999). Yasin\u2019s complaint alleged that he requested a grievance form from the prison counselor but was never given one. The district court\u2019s determination that Yasin had not exhausted his administrative remedies was based on the infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ence that Yasin had made only a single request and a finding that Yasin had not alleged that prison officials had <em>refused </em>to give Yasin the appropriate form. Yasin was not required to plead any allegations with respect to exhaustion. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). As it was not crystalline from the face of Yasin\u2019s complaint that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, the district court\u2019s dismissal on that ground was premature. <em>See id.; Carbe v. Lappin, 492 </em>F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We therefore VACATE and REMAND for service of the defendants and subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
