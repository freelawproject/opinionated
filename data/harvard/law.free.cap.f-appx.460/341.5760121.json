Muhammed complains that Lone Star College improperly accused her of breach of computer security in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 33.02; she was found guilty of those charges because of false testimony by College employees; and that College employees made inflammatory, degrading, and racial statements concerning her nationality, and her religious beliefs. The district court dismissed Mu-hammed\u2019s claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Muhammed timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Although we \u201cliberally construe\u201d the filings of <em>pro se </em>litigants and \u201capply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel,\u201d <em>pro se </em>appellants must still comply with the principles of appellate procedure. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). The appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument, which in turn must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). General arguments without citations to any error are insufficient to preserve issues for appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Muhammed\u2019s brief purports to assert three issues for review by this Court: (1) \u201cviolations of civil rights and the 14th Amendment,\u201d (2) \u201cwrongful dismissal of case from U.S. District Court judge,\u201d and (3) \u201cperjury and forgery of employees.\u201d Her arguments on these issues are completely devoid of record citations or specific indications as to how the district court erred; it merely asserts that she was harmed by the College\u2019s actions and that the dismissal was incorrect. \u201cAside from the implication raised by its existence, [appellant\u2019s] brief does not argue that the district court erred in any way.\u201d <em>Grant, </em>59 F.3d at 525. Such a filing is \u201cin practical effect ... the same as if [s]he had not appealed\u201d at all. <em>Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Accordingly, we DISMISS Muhammed\u2019s appeal for want of prosecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. \"In all instances of failure to prosecute an appeal to hearing as required, the court may take such other action as it deems appropriate.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.3.3. \"[W]hen appellant fails ... to comply with the rules of the court, the clerk must dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution.\u201d 5th Cir.
