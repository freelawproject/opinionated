Plaintiff Rita Jones was injured on a Sunday afternoon, March 15, 2009, while in the produce department of a Publix supermarket. While she was reaching for an onion she encountered an unidentified odor which caused respiratory irritation; she fell to her knees coughing and vomited. After the parties joined issue and engaged in discovery, Publix moved the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>to exclude the opinion testimony of Jones\u2019s expert witness under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and for summary judgment. The court, in a comprehensive order dated July 21, 2011, granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Jones appeals the summary judgment and the court\u2019s order excluding her expert\u2019s opinion testimony. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s exclusion of the expert\u2019s testimony and therefore affirm its ruling. And we find no error in the the district court\u2019s ruling that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is inapplicable in this case and in its decision granting Publix summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
