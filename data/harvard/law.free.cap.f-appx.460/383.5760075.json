We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I.FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In November 2010, Bachman applied to be a Rural Route Carrier for the USPS. As part of the application process, he completed a standard Medical Assessment Form (the \u201cForm\u201d), on which he answered that he had never been injured on the job. On the same form, Bachman authorized USPS to obtain his health records to determine suitability for employment. In signing the Form, he acknowledged that his failure to answer the questions truthfully could result in his termination. Shortly after USPS hired Bachman, it discovered that he had previously filed two workman\u2019s compensation claims; USPS terminated Bachman for failure to disclose these claims on the Form. The district court, after referring the matter to a magistrate judge, dismissed Bachman\u2019s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Bachman timely appealed as to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, <em>et seq., </em>and the Fail' Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">District court dismissals pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) are reviewed de novo. <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cTo determine if a complaint fails to state a claim, we apply the same standard of review applicable to dismissals made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and will uphold a dismissal if, taking the plaintiffs allegations as true, it appears that no relief could be granted based on the plaintiffs alleged facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ahzu\">A. ADA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Bachman alleges that USPS violated the ADA, specifically 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d), by inquiring about his past job-related injuries. While we have reserved the question of whether a person who is not \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA has standing to bring a claim under \u00a7 12112(d), <em>Fuzy v. S &amp; B Eng\u2019rs &amp; Constructors, Ltd., </em>332 F.3d 301, 303 (5th Cir.2003), we need not reach that question to resolve Bachman\u2019s case. The provision that Bachman is suing under, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">A covered entity shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWN\">Bachman has failed to allege that USPS inquired about any disability of his. The ADA defines a disability as \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00a7 12101(1). Prior workman\u2019s compensation claims do not fit this statutory definition; therefore, Bachman\u2019s ADA claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">B. FCRA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Bachman further alleges that USPS violated the FCRA by failing to disclose to him its report obtained about his past workman\u2019s compensation claims before taking adverse employment action against him. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe FCRA was the product of Congressional concern over abuses in the credit reporting industry.\u201d The legislative history of the FCRA reveals that it was crafted to \u201cprotect an individual from inaccurate or arbitrary information in a consumer report.\u201d <em>St. Paul Guardian Ins. Co. v. Johnson, </em>884 F.2d 881, 883 (5th Cir.1989) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). The FCRA defines a \u201cconsumer report\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (A) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; (B) employment purposes; or (C) any other purpose authorized under section 1681b of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(l). A report about Bachman\u2019s previously-filed workman\u2019s compensation claims is not a \u201cconsumer report\u201d under the FCRA because it does not \u201cbear[] on [his] credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Bachman cannot state a claim under the FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bachman\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
