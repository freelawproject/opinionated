Because, after carefully reading Aysisayh\u2019s brief, we are unable to find that he has made any argument that one of the two independent bases for that dismissal was incorrect, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs and the arguments contained in them. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). But we nonetheless require <em>pro se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>litigants to comply with procedural rules. <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011). And, despite the leniency we afford them, we are not permitted to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled in part on other grounds as recognized in Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010). Thus, we will deem abandoned arguments that a <em>pro se </em>litigant does not address. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Finding that Aysisayh\u2019s initial complaint was so \u201cconfusing and unclear\u201d that it was \u201cimpossible to tell why each separate defendant [was] being sued,\u201d the magistrate judge to whom his case was referred ordered Aysisayh to file an amended complaint that complied with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a) and 10(b). Specifically, the magistrate judge\u2019s order told Aysi-sayh that his complaint must provide \u201ca short and plain statement of [his] elaim[s]\u201d and must divide each claim into separate paragraphs. After receiving Aysisayh\u2019s amended complaint, the magistrate judge recommended that his case be dismissed for two independent reasons. First, because the amended complaint \u201csuffer[ed] from the same deficiencies as the initial complaint,\u201d the magistrate judge recommended that it be dismissed because Aysi-sayh had not complied with the previous order. Second, the magistrate judge found that Aysisayh\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and so in the alternative was due to be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). As best we can tell, Aysisayh did not challenge the first independent reason for dismissing his complaint in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. After review, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed Aysisayh\u2019s complaint for the reasons that the magistrate judge had stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We have carefully and thoroughly examined Aysisayh\u2019s brief on appeal. Even reading it liberally, however, we are unable to find within Aysisayh\u2019s brief even a single mention of the first ground upon which the district court dismissed his amended complaint, namely that it still did not comply with Rules 8 and 10 despite the magistrate judge\u2019s order that it do so. Nowhere in his brief does Aysisayh refer to that alternative reason for dismissing his complaint, much less address why he believes it was incorrect. There is simply nothing in Aysisayh\u2019s brief on appeal that we could construe as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his complaint should be dismissed because it did not comply with the Federal Rules and the magistrate judge\u2019s order without effectively becoming Aysisayh\u2019s counsel. And that is a role we may not take. Therefore, on this independent ground for dismissal, which Aysisayh has abandoned, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
