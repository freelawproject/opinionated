Houston contends that his claim that he is actually innocent of a sentence enhancement is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition and, alternatively, falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. \u201cSection 2255 contains a \u2018savings clause,\u2019 which acts as a limited exception to this general rule.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">Houston\u2019s arguments that his claim is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition because the Bureau of Prisons classified him as posing a threat to public safety based on the enhancement and his \u00a7 2241 petition falls within the savings clause based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), will not be considered because these arguments are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 435 n. 1 (5th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Page v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>651 F.2d 1083, 1087 (5th Cir. Unit A July 27, 1981) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1062, 181 L.Ed.2d 779 (2012) (No. 11-7577)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">Houston\u2019s claim that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the sentence enhancement attacks the manner in which his sentence was initially determined. Therefore, he had to meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) to raise this claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Houston\u2019s claim of actual innocence of a sentencing enhancement does not satisfy the savings clause because the claim does not rely on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision showing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
