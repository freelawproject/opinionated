Mattox pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, conspiracy to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute, and the district court sentenced him to 190 months imprisonment. Mattox filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, which the court dismissed. He then filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition, contending that the court had improperly enhanced his guidelines range as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2002). The court also dismissed that petition, and this is Mattox\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-26\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Dohrmann </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTypically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cWhen a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion ..., he must apply for and receive permission from us before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945; <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). But \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). \u201c[Consequently, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), we held that \u00a7 2255(e) does not permit a \u201cfederal prisoner to challenge his sentence in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 [habeas corpus] petition when he cannot raise that challenge in a \u00a7 2255 motion because of the \u00a7 2255(h) bar against second and successive motions .... at least where the sentence the prisoner is attacking does not exceed the statutory maximum.\u201d We have not granted Mattox permission to file what would be his second \u00a7 2255 motion, and his 190-month prison sentence is below the statutory maximum of 40 years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), 846. The district court did not err in dismissing Mattox\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">.
