The presentence investigation report recounted Diggs\u2019 criminal history, which included one conviction for carrying a concealed firearm, one conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, and two convictions for resisting arrest with violence. Based on the convictions for carrying a concealed firearm and carrying a concealed weapon and one of the convictions for resisting arrest with violence, the PSR recommended classifying Diggs as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Because the statutory maximum prison sentence for his conviction was 40 years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), his status as a career offender increased his offense level to 34, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Subtracting 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was 31. Diggs\u2019 classification as a career offender automatically set his criminal history category at VI, <em>see id., </em>but that classification made no difference to Diggs\u2019 criminal history category because he also had 17 criminal history points. His total offense level of 31 and his criminal history category of VI yielded a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment. The court adopted the PSR\u2019s findings and sentenced Diggs to a 188-month prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Diggs did not file a direct appeal. Instead, he filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion seeking resentencing based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and our decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), arguing that his convictions for carrying a concealed firearm and carrying a concealed weapon were not convictions for a crime of violence for the purpose of the career offender enhancement. The district court denied Diggs\u2019 motion, finding that, even if carrying a concealed firearm and carrying a concealed weapon were not crimes of violence, Diggs still qualified as a career offender because he had two convictions for resisting arrest with violence, which were convictions for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Diggs moved for a certificate of appeala-bility, which the district court granted on the following question: \u201cDoes a Florida prior conviction for Resisting Arrest with Violence under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 qualify as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. Section 4B1.2(a), justifying a Career Offender sentencing enhancement?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion as a mixed question of law and fact. We review for clear error the court\u2019s findings of fact and review <em>de novo </em>its application of the law to those facts. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is \u201climited to the issue[] specified in the COA,\u201d <em>id., </em>but we read the COA to include whether Diggs procedurally defaulted his claim, which is an issue we must address before considering the claim\u2019s merits, <em>see Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2002); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1248 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">\u201cUnder the procedural default rule, a defendant generally must advance an available challenge to a criminal conviction or sentence on direct appeal or else the defendant is barred from presenting that claim in a \u00a7 2255 [motion].\u201d <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). There are two exceptions to the procedural default rule: \u201c(1) for cause and prejudice, or (2) for a miscarriage of justice, or actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder the actual innocence exception ... a movant\u2019s procedural default is excused if he can show that he is actually innocent either of the crime of conviction or, in the capital sentencing context, of the sentence itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>McKay, </em>we held that the actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule does not apply where a movant argues that the predicate offenses that warranted classifying him as a career offender were not crimes of violence under the guidelines yet does not argue that he did not commit those predicate offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Our holding in <em>McKay </em>controls the outcome of this case. Diggs \u201cprocedurally defaulted his claim that he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender because he did not raise that claim on direct appeal \u2014 indeed, a direct appeal was not even filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196. He has not argued that his procedural default should be excused for cause. Nor has he argued that he did not commit the underlying predicate offenses. His claim is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
