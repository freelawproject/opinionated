Kinsey and Janie L. Kinsey (\u201cthe Kinseys\u201d) sued (1) U.S. District Judge William Keith Watkins, (2) Debra B. Hackett, the Clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, and (3) the \u201cU.S. Marshals.\u201d The complaint alleged that Judge Watkins \u201cfail[ed] to carry out his duties\u201d and that, when the Kinseys visited the courthouse to confront Judge Watkins, the Clerk failed to meet with the Kinseys and the U.S. Marshals escorted the Kinseys out of the courthouse. The Kinseys apparently seek $83 million in damages for \u201ctr[e]spass, op[p]ression, malice, negligence, wanton negligence, wanton injuries, wanton act, discrimination, property loss, fraud ..., actual fraud, deceit, [and] omission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In a March 22, 2011 order, the magistrate judge determined that the complaint was deficient and directed the Kinseys to file either an amended complaint or a notice that they desired to withdraw their complaint. The Kinseys filed neither and instead submitted a \u201cJury Trial Demand\u201d stating that they \u201care willing to present the facts to the judge and the jury.\u201d Additionally, the Kinseys filed another complaint, docketed as a separate action, containing identical factual allegations as the first complaint. Each complaint contains only one paragraph of factual allegations, which are identical in both complaints. The second complaint, filed after the magistrate judge\u2019s March 22, 2011 order, also includes a \u201cmotion for a trial\u201d and a \u201cletter form\u201d demanding a jury trial and threatening an appeal if no jury trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">After consolidating the two complaints for all purposes pursuant to Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court dismissed the complaints under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). On appeal, the Kinseys argue that the district court erred by dismissing their claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), and that the district court\u2019s order was unreasoned and not based on the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">A federal judge enjoys absolute immunity from a suit seeking damages arising from the judge\u2019s actions in his judicial capacity. <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000). Because the complaint seeks damages arising from Judge Watkins\u2019s actions in his judicial capacity, the district court properly concluded that he enjoyed absolute immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">We also conclude that the Kinseys\u2019 complaints failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim against either the Clerk or the \u201cU.S. Marshals.\u201d Under the FTCA, the United States waives sovereign immunity and is therefore liable for state-law tort claims \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. Thus, to state an FTCA claim, the Kinseys must allege facts sufficient to state a claim under the tort law of the state where the conduct occurred, in this case Alabama. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number><em>See Howell v. United States, </em>932 F.2d 915, 917 (11th Cir.1991) (noting that the defendant\u2019s liability under the FTCA depended on whether a similarly situated private defendant would be liable for the conduct under the law of Georgia, the place where the allegedly negligent act or omission occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Although the complaint concludes that the defendants are liable for trespass, fraud, negligence, and other state-law tort claims, the only facts alleged in the complaint are that the Kinseys (1) visited the courthouse on September 13, 2010, (2) asked a Clerk\u2019s employee to speak with Judge Watkins, and (3) were escorted out of the courthouse by the \u201cU.S. Marshals.\u201d These bare allegations fail to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim.\u201d Indeed, these bare facts fail even to allege the principal elements of any of the ostensible state-law tort claims listed in the complaint. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (\u201c[A] plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d (quotation marks and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Despite the magistrate judge\u2019s March 22, 2011 order warning them that the complaint was deficient, the Kinseys refused to amend their factual allegations or otherwise seek clarification from the district court. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the complaints under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for failure to state a claim. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We may affirm \u201con any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., </em>433 F.3d 794, 797-98 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
