Petitioner raises two assignments of error. First, petitioner challenges DCBS\u2019s determination that drivers who sell its products are \u201csubject workers,\u201d ORS 656.017, for whom petitioner must pay workers\u2019 compensation premiums. Second, petitioner asserts that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to strike certain testimony, on which, it argues, the ALJ based her legal analysis. We conclude that the drivers are subject workers, and that, even assuming that the ALJ\u2019s failure to strike the disputed testimony was error, it was harmless. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We accept DCBS\u2019s factual findings regarding the drivers\u2019 relationship to petitioner, which petitioner does not challenge, and we review its legal conclusions for errors of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 183.482(8)(a); <em>Rubalcaba v. Nagaki Farms, Inc., </em>333 Or 614, 619, 43 P3d 1106 (2002); <em>Stamp v. DCBS, </em>169 Or App 354, 356, 9 P3d 729 (2000). Petitioner is a frozen meat and seafood distributor that uses drivers to market, sell, and deliver its inventory. In 2007 and 2008, petitioner\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, SAIF, conducted audits of petitioner\u2019s payroll. After each audit, SAIF assessed additional workers\u2019 compensation premiums based on its conclusion that petitioner\u2019s drivers were subject workers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner challenged the audits and the assessments, requesting hearings before an ALJ. <em>See </em>ORS 737.318(3)(d) (providing for administrative appeal process for premium audit billings). The challenges were consolidated, and an ALJ presided over an evidentiary hearing. In a proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>order, the ALJ set out her findings of fact and concluded that the drivers were workers for whom petitioner had to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Petitioner sought review by DCBS, which adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Because our analysis requires detailed consideration of the facts, we set out the ALJ\u2019s findings at some length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201cRJ is a frozen meat distribution company. RJ purchases frozen, pre-cut, pre-packed meat and seafood (products) from a wholesaler. The wholesaler ships the products to RJ\u2019s refrigerated warehouse for sale under RJ\u2019s assumed business name \u2018Home Meat Market\u2019 (HMM).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cRJ maintains a website, HomeMeatmarket.com, listing the products and retail prices for its customers. The website instructs customers that they may order through the website or by phone and products will be delivered to the customer. Mr. Kollar, RJ\u2019s warehouse manager, made deliveries for orders placed through the website. However, during the audit period, 95 percent of RJ\u2019s revenue was derived from the drivers\u2019 efforts because RJ\u2019s products were predominantly sold by drivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cRJ solicits drivers through various methods, including business opportunity advertisements. An example of the advertisement is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201c\u2018Here\u2019s how our package works:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201c\u2018We provide all the product training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\u201cWe lease our fully refrigerated trucks to our contractors at a low daily rate. We consign all products daily without prepayment necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">\u201cWe provide receipts, brochures and product information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\u201c\u2018Everything you would have to invest thousands of dollars to get your business started, we provide for you.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">\u201cIndividuals who responded to the business opportunity advertisements were met by Mr. Kollar. Mr. Kollar explained RJ\u2019s business model and presented the drivers with RJ\u2019s Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) solely scribed by RJ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u201cDuring the audit period, RJ had at least nine vehicles that were equipped with a freezer and/or generator.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] The vehicles had the HMM logo on them. RJ allowed the drivers the option of leasing one of these vehicles with a freezer and/or generator for a 12-hour shift. RJ required the drivers to pay for their own fuel. RJ paid the insurance and maintained and repaired the trucks and equipment. RJ set the lease fee at $25 per 12-hour shift and advised the drivers that the fee could be increased or decreased at RJ\u2019s discretion without any prior notice. RJ sometimes reduced the lease fee. RJ also waived the lease fees on those occasions when an existing driver took a new driver on a route. Pursuant to the ICA, RJ did not allow the drivers to have any riders in RJ\u2019s leased vehicle. However, to satisfy its insurance provider, RJ allowed riders on the vehicle as long as the riders signed a contract allowing RJ to check their motor vehicles report and determine if they had a valid driver license. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cA section [of the ICA] on \u2018Escrow Account\u2019 required drivers to accumulate an escrow account with a $250 minimum balance to insure against company losses, due to theft, etc. RJ did not enforce this section of the ICA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cRJ did not provide leads, routes or territories and did not require any drivers to appear on any particular day or time. The drivers set their own hours of work and chose their own sales areas. On a typical day, RJ opened at 8:30 a.m. Drivers started showing up to RJ\u2019s location and RJ gave products to the drivers to sell and leased trucks based upon availability, not on the time of the day. Some drivers had their own trucks. Those who did not have their own truck[s] leased from RJ. RJ leased the trucks on a first come first served basis. The drivers notified Mr. Kollar of the number of boxes of product they would take for the day. Mr. Kollar, in his sole discretion, determined whether to fill the order as requested by the driver or to withhold some product due to the driver not having enough credit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>If [RJ] did not have the requested product, [RJ] offered other product. The drivers were not allowed in RJ\u2019s walk-in freezer. Therefore, Mr. Kollar assembled the order and put it on a cart. The drivers did not pay any money up front. The drivers took the cart to their own or leased vehicle and loaded the products on to their vehicle. The drivers then left to make their sales to their customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cWhen the drivers returned to the warehouse at the end of their shift they checked in with Mr. Kollar or Mr. Russell[, one of RJ\u2019s owners]. RJ either restocked the unsold products or the driver purchased and retained the product. If RJ restocked the unsold product, RJ subtracted the unsold products from the products consigned to a driver on the consolidated daily sales record. RJ charged the drivers depending on the number of products the driver took on consignment. RJ settled the account with each driver at the time the driver paid for the consigned products by allowing the driver to keep the difference between the price paid by their customers minus the cost of the product price set by RJ, less the $25 truck lease fee and other fees, also set by RJ. In instances where the drivers received more in checks and credit card transactions than they owed RJ and used the checks or credit cards to settle their accounts with RJ, RJ paid them the difference in cash, as opposed to with a check. In those cases where credit card transactions and checks were not sufficient to settle a driver\u2019s account, RJ required the drivers to make up the difference in cash. RJ also extended credit to some drivers and kept a record of the credit on a ledger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cRJ provided brochures to the drivers when the driverspurchased products. The brochures listed HomeMeatmarket.com as the business with its telephone number and address and had a blank line under which it stated \u2018Authorized Dealer.\u2019 The brochures had an additional line designated for the area distibutor\u2019s cell phone number. Additionally, the brochures provided product descriptions and \u2018distributor\u2019s special prices.\u2019 RJ also provided receipts. The receipts also listed HomeMeatmarket.com as the business with its telephone number and address and had a designated line for a distributor\u2019s name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">(Citations and paragraph numbers omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The ICA characterizes the drivers as independent contractors, not employees, of petitioner. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\u201cIt is the expressed intent and purpose of the parties to enterintoarelationshipofCompany-IndependentContractor. COMPANY shall not have control over CONTRACTOR\u2019S place of performance except when COMPANY becomes aware of non-compliance with state and/or federal laws including consumer affairs regulations. CONTRACTOR shall sell COMPANY products whenever, however, and to whomever CONTRACTOR chooses at CONTRACTOR\u2019S sole and absolute discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cThe parties hereto recognize and agree that CONTRACTOR is an independent contractor and not an employee of COMPANY. Therefore, COMPANY [does] not provide Workers Compensation for CONTRACTOR, nor does it take any federal or state withholdings. CONTRACTOR agrees that it is Contractor\u2019s sole responsibility to obtain and maintain in full force and effect workers compensation and to pay any and all federal, state taxes, social security, and unemployment charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">(Capitalization in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Under the ICA, petitioner retains discretion to determine the amount of product credit extended to each driver, and the driver promises to pay in full at the end of each day for all products received on consignment that day. Petitioner guarantees \u201ctaste, tenderness and wholesomeness\u201d of the products, but does not guarantee any particular grade of meat, and petitioner may terminate the contract if the driver makes any promise of \u201cchoice\u201d grade meat to customers or if the driver makes any \u201cuntrue, misleading, or deceptive\u201d statement. The driver is to maintain product \u201cin good condition until it is sold\u201d and is prohibited from selling it to a consumer \u201cunless it has a good appearance.\u201d Petitioner retains exclusive control over complaints: \u201cComplaints are to be reported to the manager and are not to be handled by Contractor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The ICA also sets out the terms that govern the leasing of petitioner\u2019s trucks by drivers. It states that a driver may lease a truck, freezer, and generator from petitioner for $25 per 12-hour shift. Petitioner is responsible for insuring, maintaining, and repairing the trucks, and the driver is responsible for \u201cpay[ing] for all fuel used.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although petitioner is responsible for insuring the trucks, it reserves the right not to file an insurance claim and, instead, to charge the driver if the driver is at fault in an accident. In addition, the driver agrees that, in case of an accident, he or she \u201cwill be held fully responsible for any and all claims, lawsuits, and/or any traffic fines\u201d and will \u201chold [petitioner] harmless from all claims, losses, causes of action, and expenses, including legal expenses rising from the use, maintenance and operation of\u201d the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Leased trucks are \u201cto be used by [the driver] exclusively for the purveyance of products consigned on a daily credit basis.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The driver is responsible for keeping a leased truck \u201cclean so that it shall at all times present a neat appearance\u201d and promises to operate the truck \u201cin a careful manner and in conformity with all applicable federal and state laws and city ordinances.\u201d The driver also promises not to allow any riders in a leased truck and not to carry or use any \u201calcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, illegal substances, or drug paraphernalia\u201d in a leased truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Under the ICA, all drivers are required to inform petitioner if they are cited for a moving violation. The ICA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cI understand the great responsibility placed upon me as a contractor/driver for RJ Enterprises, LLC. That responsibility is to the company, its employees, fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>contractors, and the general public. Driving a vehicle for RJ Enterprises, LLC is a privilege associated with my contract. By my initials below, I acknowledge that I have read and understand these criteria. Furthermore, I understand that it is my responsibility to report my being cited for ANY moving violation to the manager as soon as possible after the citation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">(Capitalization in original.) As soon as a manager learns that a driver has been cited for a moving violation, the driver \u201cwill be counseled (by manager) regarding his/her responsibility to operate motor vehicles in a safe, mature, defensive manner.\u201d In addition, if a driver who is \u201cconvicted of two or more moving violations in any vehicle, not just an RJ Enterprises, LLC vehicle, will lose the option of leasing a vehicle from RJ Enterprises, LLC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">II. SUBJECT WORKERS</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On judicial review, petitioner contends that the ALJ and DCBS erred in concluding that the drivers are subject workers. That is a conclusion of law, which we review for errors of law. <em>Rubalcaba, </em>333 Or at 619. A petitioner bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that SAIF\u2019s billing was incorrect. <em>Salem Decorating v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>116 Or App 166, 170, 840 P2d 739 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>315 Or 643 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Under Oregon law, an \u201cemployer\u201d must provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for its \u201csubject workers.\u201d ORS 656.017(1). In making the determination whether drivers are subject \u201cworkers,\u201d the initial inquiry is whether they are \u201cworkers\u201d within the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>S-W Floor Cover Shop v. Natl. Council on Comp Ins., </em>318 Or 614, 630, 872 P2d 1 (1994). A \u201cworker\u201d is \u201cany person *** who engages to furnish services for a remuneration, subject to the direction and control of an employer[.]\u201d ORS 656.005(30). In turn, an \u201cemployer\u201d is \u201cany person *** who contracts to pay a remuneration for and secures the right to direct and control the services of any person.\u201d ORS 656.005(13)(a). All \u201cworkers\u201d are subject workers unless an exception applies. ORS 656.027.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Thus, whether a person is a subject worker depends on (1) whether the person agrees to provide services for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>remuneration and (2) whether the person\u2019s services are subject to the putative employer\u2019s direction and control. <em>DCBS v. Clements, </em>240 Or App 226, 232, 246 P3d 62 (2010). Here, we consider those issues in reverse order, beginning with whether the drivers were subject to petitioner\u2019s direction and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">A. <em>Direction and Control</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In determining whether the drivers were subject to petitioner\u2019s direction and control, we apply the \u201cright to control\u201d test. <em>See Rubalcaba, </em>333 Or at 627; <em>SAIF v. DCBS, </em>250 Or App 360, 370, 284 P3d 487 (2012). Because \u201cthere is some evidence suggesting that [petitioner] retained the right to control the methods and details of [the drivers\u2019] work\u201d we also apply the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. <em>Rubalcaba, </em>333 Or at 623-25; <em>see also SAIF v. DCBS, </em>250 Or App at 368-70 (discussing the relationship between the \u201cright to control\u201d test and the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test). Considering the evidence as it pertains to the factors of both of those tests, we conclude that the drivers were subject to petitioner\u2019s direction and control. <em>See Rubalcaba, </em>333 Or at 627 (\u201c[I]n situations in which there is some evidence suggesting that an employer retained the right to control the method and details of a claimant\u2019s work, a conclusion about the claimant\u2019s status depends on the analytical factors relevant to both tests.\u201d); <em>SAIF v. DCBS, </em>250 Or App at 370 (\u201cThe decision-maker must consider the factors relevant to both tests and decide [whether the individual is a worker] in light of all of the relevant factors [.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">1. <em>\u201cRight to Control\u201d Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u201cThe principal factors in the traditional test of the right to control are: [a] direct evidence of the right to, or the exercise of, control; [b] the method of payment; [c] the furnishing of equipment; and [d] the right to fire.\u201d <em>Castle Homes Inc. v. Whaite, </em>95 Or App 269, 272, 769 P2d 215 (1989); <em>see also Coghill v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>155 Or App 601, 606, 964 P2d 1085, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>157 Or App 125, 966 P2d 830 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 365 (1999) (listing the same factors).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u201c\u2018For the most part, any single factor is not merely indicative of, but, in practice, virtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in the opposite direction, contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best only mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no such force at all.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><em>Coghill, </em>155 Or App at 606 (quoting 3 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 44.31, at 8-90 (1998)); <em>Cy Investment, Inc. v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>128 Or App 579, 584, 876 P2d 805 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">a. Direct Evidence of Right to, or Exercise of, Control</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We agree with the ALJ that the record contains direct evidence of petitioner\u2019s right to control, and exercise of control over, the methods and details of the drivers\u2019 work. Although it carries some weight, the ICA\u2019s characterization of the drivers as independent contractors is not determinative. <em>See, e.g, Woody v. Waibel, </em>276 Or 189, 198-99, 554 P2d 492 (1976); <em>SAIF v. DCBS, </em>250 Or App at 371; <em>Coghill, </em>155 Or App at 606 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">First, petitioner controlled what the drivers could sell: It controlled the amount and type of product the drivers could sell, and it prohibited the drivers from selling anything other than its products from its trucks. Petitioner also exercised some control over how the drivers could sell its products: It limited the promises that the drivers could make while they sold its products, permitting them to promise \u201ctaste and wholesomeness\u201d but prohibiting them from making promises about the grade of the meat. Petitioner also mandated that \u201c[p]roduct is to remain in good condition until it is sold. It should not be sold to a consumer unless it has a good appearance.\u201d As a practical matter, petitioner also controlled the price and description of its products and the receipts that customers received by providing the drivers with brochures and receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Petitioner\u2019s control extended to the drivers\u2019 behavior on the road. It required all drivers to report \u201cANY moving violation to the manager as soon as possible after the citation.\u201d (Capitalization in original.) And, petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>reserved the right to counsel a cited driver \u201cregarding his/ her responsibility to operate motor vehicles in a safe, mature, defensive manner [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Petitioner strengthened its ability to enforce its standards by maintaining exclusive control over customer complaints. As noted, the ICA provides, \u201cComplaints are to be reported to the manager and are not to be handled by Contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Petitioner also controlled the operation of the leased trucks and who could drive and ride in them. It required the drivers to keep the trucks clean at all times and prohibited drivers from carrying or using alcohol or illegal drugs in the trucks. Because petitioner also prohibited any riders in the trucks, the drivers could not hire delivery assistants without petitioner\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We acknowledge that petitioner did not control all of the methods and details of the drivers\u2019 work. Petitioner did not provide the drivers with territories, routes, or customers. It did not provide extensive training, although it did facilitate training by waiving the truck-rental fee when experienced drivers took new drivers with them on their routes. Nevertheless, there is some direct evidence of petitioner\u2019s right to control, and exercise of control over, the methods and details of the drivers\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that its control over the occupants and operation of its trucks cannot demonstrate a right to control the drivers because it is merely an effort to limit potential liability arising from the truck rentals and \u201cappease its insurance provider\u201d is unavailing. At this stage, the relevant question is whether petitioner had the right to control, or did control, the drivers\u2019 work; it is not whether petitioner had a legitimate business reason to retain the right to control the drivers\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Petitioner argues that <em>Schaff v. Ray\u2019s Land &amp; Sea Food Co., Inc., </em>334 Or 94, 45 P3d 936 (2002), provides a relevant comparison to this case and demonstrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>petitioner did not retain the right to control the drivers. In <em>Schaff, </em>the plaintiff alleged that a negligent driver, Stockert, was an employee of the defendant, a meat and seafood distributor. <em>Id. </em>at 96! The plaintiff sought damages for personal injury on a theory of vicarious liability. Under the common law \u201cright to control\u201d test and the vicarious liability cases interpreting it, the Supreme Court concluded that Stockert was an independent contractor, not an employee. <em>Id. </em>at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">One of the issues that the parties disputed concerned the role of the jury in deciding whether Stockert was an employee or an independent contractor. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that that determination was not one that the jury could make. The defendant\u2019s argument relied on <em>Woody, </em>276 Or 189, a case involving a dispute about \u201csubject worker\u201d status under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. The court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cDefendant argues that this court announced a contrary rule in <em>[Woody]. </em>*** We find <em>Woody, </em>a case decided with respect to worker\u2019s compensation statutes, to be of limited relevance to our discussion of the role of the court and jury in the context of common-law vicarious liability. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 193 (\u2018The criteria in the workmen\u2019s compensation cases are keyed to the purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Schaff, </em>334 Or at 101 n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Similarly, here, the common law \u201cright to control\u201d test, as applied in cases involving vicarious liability, including <em>Schaff, </em>is of limited relevance to the question before us\u2014whether the drivers are \u201csubject workers\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation law. As the Supreme Court noted, the underlying concerns in workers\u2019 compensation cases\u2014 ultimately, that \u201cthe cost of industrial accidents should be borne by the consumer as a part of the cost of the product,\u201d <em>Woody, </em>276 Or at 195\u2014are different from those in vicarious liability cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>b. Method of Payment</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Petitioner compensated the drivers by allowing them to keep the difference between the price paid by customers and the product price set by petitioner, less the $25 truck lease fee and other fees. \u201c[W]hen payment is by quantity, the method of payment factor becomes neutral.\u201d <em>Kaiel v. Cultural Homestay Institute, </em>129 Or App 471, 879 P2d 1319, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 543 (1994); <em>see also Castle Homes, Inc., </em>95 Or App at 272 (explaining that the method of payment was \u201cnot particularly significant\u201d where the \u201c[claimant was paid strictly on commission\u201d). Thus, we conclude that, in this case, the payment factor is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">c. Furnishing of Tools and Equipment</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Next we consider the third factor, the furnishing of tools and equipment. Petitioner argues that, because its drivers paid for the use of the trucks, it cannot be considered to have furnished them. However, as petitioner\u2019s driver-recruitment advertisement explained, petitioner provided the trucks at \u201clow daily rates\u201d intended to enable drivers to lease them without any significant financial investment of the type that would ordinarily be required if the drivers were operating their own independent businesses. The trucks bore petitioner\u2019s logo. Petitioner insured and maintained the trucks and retained control over them by screening the driving records of drivers and passengers and setting standards for the trucks\u2019 appearance and cleanliness. Finally, as noted above, the drivers were prohibited from selling anything other than petitioner\u2019s products from the trucks. Those facts, considered together, demonstrate that petitioner was not merely a meat distributor that operated a truck-rental business on the side. Instead, those facts demonstrate that petitioner\u2019s purpose in providing the trucks was to equip the drivers to sell petitioner\u2019s products, for petitioner\u2019s benefit. Indeed, under the ICA, the trucks could not be used for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Petitioner argues that the drivers\u2019 independent nonemployment status is evidenced by the fact that the drivers were required to provide some of their own tools and equipment: check and credit card processing, bank accounts, clothing, and sunglasses. A number of facts refute that argument. First, as the ALJ found, petitioner\u2019s driver-recruitment advertisement belies the assertion that the drivers were required to provide any business-related tools or equipment. The advertisement explains that petitioner will provide \u201c[everything\u201d that a driver needs to sell petitioner\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Second, petitioner\u2019s practices bear out the promises of the advertisement: Although petitioner argues that the drivers were required to provide numerous items themselves, petitioner actually provided some of those items to the drivers, and others were unnecessary because of the way petitioner\u2019s operation was organized. In addition to trucks, petitioner provided check and credit card processing. And, because of the way petitioner designed its business, the drivers could sell its products and be compensated without bank accounts and without submitting invoices to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, the fact that the drivers had to provide their own clothing and sunglasses does not compel a different conclusion. If petitioner had provided its drivers with uniforms, that would certainly be a fact supportive of the \u201cright to control.\u201d However, a worker\u2019s responsibility for providing his or her own clothing and sunglasses does not indicate that the putative employer lacks direction and control over the methods and details of his or her work, especially when there is no indication that any special attire or gear is required for the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">d. Right to Fire</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The fourth factor, the right to fire, is inconclusive. Another case that evaluated that factor with respect to a single-shift contract like those at issue here is illustrative. In <em>Cy Investment, Inc., </em>128 Or App 579, Cy\u2019s, a nightclub, scheduled dancers on a shift-by-shift basis. The dancers \u201cselected the time, date, and frequency of their work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581. We described and analyzed the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201cThere is no evidence that Cy\u2019s ever terminated a dancer in mid-shift. Moreover, although Cy\u2019s retained, and exercised, the ability not to invite dancers back, there is no evidence that Cy\u2019s ever prevented a dancer from working a previously-scheduled shift. On the other hand, because the work \u2018contracted\u2019 for is of such limited duration, Cy\u2019s ability to prevent a dancer from signing up for additional shifts approaches a \u2018right to fire\u2019 even if Cy\u2019s never actually prevented a dancer from working a previously scheduled shift.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 584. Similarly, here, there is no evidence that petitioner ever terminated a driver\u2019s ICA mid-shift. However, petitioner retained discretion to determine how much product a driver could take on a shift and whether a driver could lease a truck for the day, effectively retaining the right to terminate the relationship on any given day. As in <em>Cy Investment, </em>Inc., here, where the agreement between the parties pertained to only a single shift at a time, petitioner\u2019s ability to prevent a driver from selling its products on future days \u201capproaches a \u2018right to fire.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>At best, this factor is inconclusive, as it was in <em>Cy Investment, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In sum, two \u201cright to control\u201d factors\u2014direct evidence of right to, or exercise of, control, and furnishing of tools and equipment\u2014indicate that the drivers are workers. The other two factors\u2014method of payment and right to fire\u2014are inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">2. <em>\u201cNature of the Work\u201d Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We next turn to the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. We recently explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018nature of the work\u2019 test effectuates the purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes,\u201d beginning \u201cwith the premise that the workers\u2019 compensation system is \u2018based upon the theory that the cost of industrial accidents should be borne by the consumer as a part of the cost of the product.\u2019\u201d <em>SAIF v. DCBS, </em>250 Or App at 364-65 (quoting <em>Woody, </em>276 Or at 194-95).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201c[T]he \u2018nature of the work\u2019 test consists of two elements. The first is the character of the person\u2019s work or business\u2014its skill, its status as a separate enterprise, and the extent to which it may be expected to carry the burden of its accidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>itself. The second is the relation of the person\u2019s work to the employer\u2019s business\u2014how much it is a regular part of the employer\u2019s regular work, whether it is continuous or intermittent, and whether it is of sufficient duration to be the hiring of continuing services rather than contracting for a particular job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201c[A] worker whose services are a regular and continuing part of the cost of a product, and whose method of operation is not so independent that it forms a separate route through which the costs of industrial accident can be channeled, is presumptively a subject worker.\u201d <em>Coghill, </em>155 Or App at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">a. Character of the Drivers\u2019 Work or Business</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The first of the two factors\u2014the character of the drivers\u2019 work or business\u2014weighs heavily in favor of the drivers being subject workers, because their \u201cmethod of operation is not so independent that it forms a separate route through which the costs of industrial accident can be channeled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner\u2019s driver-recruitment advertisement promised,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cWe provide all the product training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cWe lease our fully refrigerated trucks to our contractors at a low daily rate. We consign all products daily without prepayment necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cWe provide receipts, brochures and product information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">\u201cEverything you would have to invest thousands of dollars to get your business started, we provide for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The drivers provided their services; petitioner provided everything else. They needed no specialized skills, offices, bank accounts, records, brochures, or equipment. They provided no cash until they had sold\u2014and, accordingly, received payment for\u2014petitioner\u2019s products. They were not permitted to hire assistants without petitioner\u2019s permission. In short, despite petitioner\u2019s assertion that the drivers were independent contractors with their own businesses, the drivers\u2019 \u201cbusinesses\u201d were actually part of petitioner\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>b. Relation of the Drivers\u2019 Work to Petitioner\u2019s Business</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">As to the second factor, the ALJ stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cThe drivers\u2019 work formed an essential and regular part of RJ\u2019s work. RJ is engaged in business as a <em>retail </em>distributor of meat products. Under its current business model, RJ needs drivers to sell and distribute its products. The drivers provide this service\u2014sell and distribute products. Without the services of these drivers, RJ cannot operate under its current business model unless it hires drivers as employees to do the work[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Petitioner disagrees with that analysis. Its argument reduces to a contention that the ALJ was incorrect in describing petitioner as a retail distributor; instead, it asserts, it is a wholesale distributor. Said another way, the ALJ concluded that petitioner\u2019s business included the drivers\u2019 purported businesses; petitioner disputes that conclusion. Petitioner argues that the drivers\u2019 services were not a \u201cregular and continuing part of the cost of [the] product,\u201d <em>Coghill, </em>155 Or App at 608, because the drivers were its customers and its product was wholesale meat that the drivers purchased and resold to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">As noted above, however, we agree with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s business included the drivers\u2019 purported businesses. Petitioner was a retail distributor: It purchased the meat from wholesalers and provided drivers with the products, accounting, and equipment necessary for retail sales; it prohibited the drivers from selling other products and prevented them from hiring assistants; and it had exclusive control over customer complaints. In light of that conclusion, the drivers\u2019 services were \u201ca regular and continuing part of the cost of [the] product\u201d because the product was petitioner\u2019s meat and seafood, sold to consumers at retail. Together, the drivers\u2019 services were continuous, and they provided petitioner with 95 percent of its revenue. Thus, considered together, the \u201cright to control\u201d and \u201cnature of the work\u201d tests indicate that the drivers were subject to petitioner\u2019s direction and control. ORS 656.005(30).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>B. <em>Services and Remuneration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Next we turn to whether the drivers agreed to provide services in exchange for remuneration. ORS 656.005(30). The ALJ concluded that they did. In doing so, she rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that the relationship between petitioner and the drivers was one of vendor and vendee. Instead, as discussed above, the ALJ concluded that petitioner was a retailer, not a wholesaler. She explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cAny unsold product was restocked for sale and consigned the next day to the same or another driver. The record established that if there was a customer complaint, RJ handled the complaint, presumably by replacing the product without charge to the driver. The substance of the transaction was not that of a vendor-vendee relation and title to the product did not pass in any realistic sense given the ease of returning the product the same day if it did not sell. Thus, the drivers were in reality commissioned sales people and their remuneration was the difference between the wholesale price and the retail price to customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Petitioner argues that that conclusion is incorrect because the drivers do not pay their gross receipts to petitioner; instead, they settle their accounts at the end of the day by paying petitioner for any products that they have sold. Petitioner also contends that the drivers\u2019 use of its credit card and check services does not establish remuneration; instead, when it accepts the checks and credit cards and pays the drivers in cash, it merely \u201cmakes change.\u201d Furthermore, petitioner asserts, \u201cThe drivers are free to sell to the customers of their choosing, for the prices that they set solely within the exercise of their own business judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">As explained above, however, we agree with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner ran a retail business. It controlled the way the drivers did their work; controlled the condition and appearance of its products; provided its contact information to customers; handled complaints; and, in practice, set the prices for the products through the brochures. In light of that conclusion, the ALJ was correct that the drivers were commissioned salespeople; their commission was the difference between the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>petitioner charged them for the products, plus fees, and the retail price.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Thus, we conclude that the drivers were \u201csubject workers,\u201d ORS 656.017, because they agreed to provide services for renumeration and were subject to petitioner\u2019s direction and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">III. DENIAL OF MOTION TO STRIKE</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In its second assignment of error, petitioner argues that the ALJ erred in denying its motion to strike portions of the testimony of Grove, SAIF\u2019s auditor, who testified that, based on his audit of petitioner\u2019s records, he concluded that the drivers were subject workers. Petitioner argues that Grove presented expert testimony and that he \u201cadmitted that, in forming his opinion of whether the drivers were workers, he relied upon an audit file associated with a DCBS prior opinion,\u201d namely, <em>Cattlemen\u2019s Steak &amp; Seafood Co., </em>INS 95-06-009 (1997) (Cattlemen\u2019s). Petitioner sought, and was denied, discovery of the <em>Cattlemen\u2019s </em>audit file. As a result, according to petitioner, the ALJ was required to strike any portion of Grove\u2019s testimony that was based on the audit file. Because the ALJ did not strike that testimony, petitioner argues, petitioner \u201cwas denied the ability to adequately cross examine [Grove], thus denied its right to Due Process of Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We reject petitioner\u2019s argument, because petitioner has failed to show that its rights were substantially prejudiced by any error. <em>See </em>ORS 183.450(1) (\u201c[EJrroneous rulings on evidence shall not preclude agency action on the record unless shown to have substantially prejudiced the rights of a party.\u201d). The ALJ, DCBS, and this court are all charged with determining, independently and as a matter of law, whether the drivers are subject workers. <em>Rubalcaba, </em>333 Or at 619; <em>SAIF v. DCBS, </em>250 Or App at 363 (discussing legal conclusions of the ALJ and DCBS). In response to petitioner\u2019s objection to Grove\u2019s testimony, the ALJ explained that she had considered only the evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s relationship with its drivers, not the disputed evidence. The ALJ\u2019s analysis bears that out: In the proposed order, in accord with the requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>substantial reason, she applied the law to the facts regarding petitioner\u2019s relationship with its drivers and concluded that the drivers were workers. <em>See Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (explaining that an agency must set out the reasoning that leads it from the facts that it has found to the conclusions that it draws from those facts). DCBS agreed with the ALJ\u2019s legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On review, this court has also applied the law to the facts of this case and concluded that the drivers are workers. Neither the ALJ nor this court relied on Grove\u2019s opinion regarding whether the drivers were workers, and each explained the reasoning that led it to conclude that the drivers were workers. Therefore, even assuming, without deciding, that it was error for the ALJ to refuse to strike portions of Grove\u2019s testimony, that error has had no effect on the outcome of the case. Grove\u2019s opinion that the drivers are workers was not entitled to, and did not receive, any deference from the ALJ, DCBS, or this court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> As noted, petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error relates to the evidentiary record. As discussed below, 255 Or App at 459 the findings of fact that we accept do not rely on the disputed evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> SAIF\u2019s increased billings were based on its conclusion that petitioner\u2019s payroll included nine driver-workers, one for each truck that petitioner owned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> The ALJ found that some drivers owned their own trucks and that one of those drivers, Setera, also obtained a business license, made brochures, and set his own prices. However, as noted above, SAIF\u2019s billing was for the nine driver-workers who leased trucks from petitioner, not those, including Setera, who owned their own trucks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\"> Petitioner argues that it provides a product warranty and handles only complaints regarding product quality. It asserts that it does not handle complaints other than those concerning product warranties. The ALJ found petitioner\u2019s witnesses not to be credible to the extent that their testimony conflicted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the provisions of the ICA. The ICA does not limit petitioner\u2019s responsibility for complaints to complaints regarding product quality. Consequently, the record indicates\u2014and, indeed, the ALJ expressly found\u2014that petitioner has the \u201csole right\u201d to handle customer complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\"> It is not clear from the record whether the drivers actually filled the trucks with fuel, or whether petitioner provided fuel and charged the drivers for it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\"> Petitioner contends that \u201cthe evidence before the Court indicates that the drivers are free to sell other products from the trucks.\u201d However, as noted, the ALJ found petitioner\u2019s witnesses not to be credible to the extent that their testimony conflicted with the provisions of the ICA. The ICA indicates that the trucks are to be used exclusively for the purveyance of petitioner\u2019s products. Therefore, the record indicates that the drivers are <em>not </em>free to sell other products from the trucks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> As set out above, the ALJ found that, despite the ICA\u2019s prohibition on riders, petitioner \u201callowed riders in the vehicles as long as the riders signed a contract allowing [petitioner] to check their motor vehicles report and determine if they had a valid driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Even if the analysis in <em>Schaff </em>were relevant, petitioner\u2019s argument would remain unavailing because <em>Schaff </em>is distinguishable from this case on its facts. In three major respects, the relationship in <em>Schaff </em>involved less control than the relationship here: First, Stockert did not lease the truck from the putative employer, and, consequently, the putative employer did not insure the truck or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>exercise control over how Stockert drove or who rode in the vehicle. <em>Schaff, </em>334 Or at 97. Second, Stockert was permitted to, and did, sell items other than the putative employer\u2019s products from his truck. <em>Id. </em>at 104. And, third, Stockert purchased products from the defendant weekly; he did not take the products on consignment and return unsold products at the end of the day. <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> In its reply brief, petitioner responds to DCBS\u2019s assertion that Grove did not rely on the <em>Cattlemen\u2019s </em>audit file by asserting that Grove \u201clooked at how the auditor in <em>[Cattlemen\u2019s] </em>calculated the drivers\u2019 earnings.\u201d The second assignment of error does not relate to the drivers\u2019 earnings; instead, petitioner\u2019s argument is that Grove \u201creified] on unproduced documents in <em>forming his expert opinion that the drivers were \u2018workers.\u2019\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Because the earnings calculation is not relevant to the assignment of error, we do not consider whether petitioner was prejudiced regarding the earnings calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
