J.</author>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The Douglas County Sheriff appeals two orders directing him to return a portion of usable, packaged marijuana\u2014which had been seized from defendant\u2019s property pursuant to a search warrant\u2014to defendant, defendant\u2019s wife, and three individuals, all of whom hold registry identification cards pursuant to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act (OMMA). ORS 475.300 - 475.346. Defendant cross-appeals, assigning error to the court\u2019s denial of his motion for attorney fees predicated on ORS 20.105. For reasons amplified below, we conclude with respect to the appeal that (1) under the circumstances of this case, the OMMA does not provide for return of the seized marijuana; and (2) because defendant cannot \u201clawfully possess\u201d marijuana under federal <em>law\u2014viz., </em>the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 USC sections 801 to 971\u2014he does not have a \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d under the operative evidence return statute, ORS 133.643. Accordingly, we reverse the return orders. That disposition, in turn, forecloses the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The material facts in this case are undisputed. Defendant holds a registry identification card and grew marijuana for multiple other cardholders. ORS 475.309.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2006, pursuant to a search warrant, state law enforcement officers searched defendant\u2019s residence and seized live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>marijuana plants and packages of dried marijuana. The state charged defendant with unlawful manufacture of marijuana, ORS 475.856, unlawful delivery of marijuana, ORS 475.860, unlawful possession of marijuana, ORS 475.864, and asserted that the seized items were subject to criminal forfeiture, ORS 131.550 to 131.602.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">On September 20, 2006, defendant filed a pretrial motion for the return of marijuana to three cardholders for whom defendant had grown marijuana. The state opposed the motion, arguing at a hearing that the state needed the marijuana for evidentiary purposes. Notwithstanding the state\u2019s opposition, the trial court allowed the motion and issued a return order, requiring the sheriff to return a portion of the seized marijuana. The state filed a motion to reconsider, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that return and receipt of the marijuana would \u201carguably\u201d violate federal law. The sheriff filed a motion to intervene and a motion to reconsider the return order, arguing, in part, that the CSA preempted the OMMA return provisions. The court allowed the sheriff to intervene, but denied both the state\u2019s and the sheriff\u2019s motions to reconsider. Consequently, the return order remained effective. That order\u2014which is <em>not </em>the same order as the one at issue in this appeal\u2014was the subject of <em>State v. Ehrensing, </em>232 Or App 511, 223 P3d 1060 (2009) <em>(Ehrensing </em>7).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Defendant was not brought to trial during the pendency of <em>Ehrensing I. </em>On December 1, 2009, a week before our decision in <em>Ehrensing I </em>issued, defendant moved for dismissal of all charges on constitutional and statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>speedy trial grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 10; ORS 135.747. The trial court granted the motion under ORS 135.747 and, consequently, entered a judgment of dismissal on February 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Defendant subsequently filed a motion for return of the remainder of the usable seized marijuana to himself, his wife, and three cardholders for whom he had grown the marijuana. That motion invoked ORS 133.643(3) and (4), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201cA motion for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the movant has a valid claim to rightful possession thereof, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201c(3) The movant, by license or otherwise, is lawfully entitled to possess things otherwise subject to seizure under ORS 133.525 to 133.703;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201c(4) Although the things seized were subject to seizure under ORS 133.525 to 133.703, the movant is or will be entitled to their return or restoration upon the court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Defendant contended that the cardholders have a \u201cproperty interest in the marijuana seized\u201d based on their cardholder status and the OMMA provisions that recognize a property interest in medical marijuana. Specifically, ORS 475.304(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">\u201cAll usable marijuana, plants, seedlings and seeds associated with the production of marijuana for a registry identification cardholder by a person responsible for a marijuana grow site are the property of the registry identification cardholder and must be provided to the registry identification cardholder upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">In his motion, defendant also asserted that the OMMA return provision, ORS 475.323(2), \u201crecognizes broad property interests for both Defendant and the [other cardholders].\u201d ORS 475.323(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201cAny property interest possessed, owned or used in connection with the medical use of marijuana or acts incidental to the medical use of marijuana that has been seized by state or local law enforcement officers may not be harmed, neglected, injured or destroyed while in the possession of any law enforcement agency. A law enforcement agency has no responsibility to maintain live marijuana plants lawfully seized. No such property interest may be forfeited under any provision of law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed after conviction of a criminal offense. Usable marijuana and paraphernalia used to administer marijuana that was seized by any law enforcement office shall be returned immediately upon a determination by the district attorney in whose county the property was seized, or the district attorney\u2019s designee, that the person from whom the marijuana or paraphernalia used to administer marijuana was seized is entitled to the protections contained in ORS 475.300 to 475.346. The determination may be evidenced, for example, by a decision not to prosecute, the dismissal of charges or acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The sheriff opposed defendant\u2019s motion, contending that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cany order directing him to deliver marijuana to the defendant or to any [OMMA] cardholder would violate the [CSA] and would put him in a Hobson\u2019s Choice (or a \u2018damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u2019 bind), whereby he would be forced to choose to either honor the order and thereby violate the CSA, or honor the CSA and thereby violate the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The sheriff asserted that, \u201cas applied to marijuana, the delivery provisions of the OMMA and ORS 133.633 violate the CSA and are thus invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d As support for that proposition, the sheriff relied, significantly, on <em>Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. BOLI, </em>348 Or 159, 230 P3d 518 (2010), which the Supreme Court had decided while defendant\u2019s motion was pending. In <em>Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court held that certain provisions of the OMMA, ORS 475.306(1) and ORS 475.302(10),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in tandem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201caffirmatively authorize[] the use of marijuana for medical purposes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 171, and that, \u201c[t]o the extent that ORS 475.306(1) affirmatively authorizes the use of medical marijuana, federal law <em>[viz., </em>the CSA] preempts\u201d that provision, rendering it \u201cwithout effect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The trial court allowed defendant\u2019s motion and ordered the sheriff to return eight ounces of packaged marijuana to defendant, his wife, and three cardholders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cPursuant to ORS 475.304(5), ORS 475.323(2), ORS 133.623, et seq, and 133.643 Douglas County Sheriff shall return Eight (8) ounces of packaged marijuana seized from Mr. Ehrensing\u2019s property to each [named] individual [,]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The trial court, by way of a supplemental order, later increased to 24 ounces the amount of marijuana to be returned to each individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The sheriff appeals both orders and essentially reprises his arguments before the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>the sheriff asserts that the return order instructs him to violate the CSA, because returning the marijuana would constitute prohibited delivery of a controlled substance. 21 USC \u00a7 841(a)(1). In that regard, the sheriff contends that he is not entitled to federal immunity pursuant to 21 USC section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>885(d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because, according to the sheriff, \u201ca law enforcement officer is not \u2018lawfully engaged\u2019 in enforcement of controlled substances law if he delivers marijuana\u201d to a cardholder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><em>Second, </em>the sheriff argues that, to the extent that the possession provisions of the OMMA, specifically, ORS 475.304(5) and ORS 475.323(2), and the omnibus evidence return provisions, ORS 133.623 to 133.663, operate so as to authorize possession of marijuana, those provisions are \u201cwithout effect\u201d because they are preempted by the CSA, which prohibits the possession of marijuana. Undergirding the sheriff\u2019s position is his reiterated reliance on <em>Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Defendant similarly reprises his arguments before the trial court. In response to the sheriff\u2019s \u201ccompelled unlawful delivery\u201d argument, defendant remonstrates that the CSA, 21 USC section 885(d), provides immunity for law enforcement officers \u201cengaged in the enforcement of laws relating to controlled substances,\u201d and asserts that the return of marijuana pursuant to the OMMA or the omnibus evidence return provisions falls within the scope of that immunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, defendant contends that the return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>statutes do not impermissibly \u201caffirmatively authorize\u201d possession, triggering preemption <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>the CSA, because defendant may legally possess the seized marijuana under state law\u2014and, thus, the sheriff need not concern himself with giving effect to the federal prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\">With the dispute so joined, we turn to the merits. In doing so, however, we begin\u2014and end\u2014our analysis at a point that necessarily precedes any consideration of the parties\u2019 cross-cutting preemption contentions. Preemption principles are implicated only if defendant is, in fact, entitled under operative Oregon statutes to return of the marijuana. That is, if, as a matter of Oregon law, defendant has no such entitlement, the matter is concluded and preemption is inap-posite.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">As amplified below, we conclude that defendant has no entitlement under Oregon law to return of the marijuana. That is so because (1) express statutorily prescribed preconditions of the particularized OMMA \u201creturn\u201d provision, ORS 475.323(2), were not satisfied here; and (2) the omnibus \u201cevidence return\u201d provisions\u2014and, specifically, ORS 133.643\u2014do not authorize return of items whose possession would be unlawful under either state or federal law. Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering the return orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In ordering the return of the disputed marijuana, the trial court stated that it was doing so \u201c[p]ursuant to ORS 475.304(5), ORS 475.323(2), ORS 133.623, et seq, and 133.643.\u201d We address each of those provisions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">First, although the trial court referred to ORS 475.304(5), defendant does not claim that that provision confers an entitlement to return of the seized marijuana. Defendant\u2019s reticence in that regard is well-considered for the reasons expressed in the concurring opinion in <em>Ehrensing I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201cORS 475.304(5) is part of a statute that establishes the marijuana grow site registration system and rules. Properly framed in that context, ORS 475.304(5) establishes, <em>as between a cardholder and a person responsible for a grow </em>site, that the cardholder is the owner of the medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>marijuana. The statute plainly provides that the marijuana in production at a grow site \u2018must be provided to the registry identification cardholder\u2019 by the \u2018person responsible for a marijuana grow site.\u2019 By its terms, ORS 475.304(5) clarifies who owns the marijuana in order to grant the cardholder the right to obtain the marijuana <em>from the grower on request. </em>Because that statutory provision bears exclusively on <em>the relationship between cardholder and grower, </em>it has limited value in evaluating the obligation of a law enforcement officer to return seized marijuana under ORS 475.323(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">232 Or App at 521 (Sercombe, J., concurring) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The trial court\u2019s reliance on ORS 475.323(2) was also misplaced. Although ORS 475.323(2) does provide for the return of seized marijuana, it does so only in specifically prescribed circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201cUsable marijuana and paraphernalia used to administer marijuana that was seized by any law enforcement office shall be returned immediately <em>upon a determination by the district attorney in whose county the property was seized, </em>or the district attorney\u2019s designee, <em>that the person from whom the marijuana or paraphernalia used to administer marijuana was seized is entitled to the protections contained in ORS 475.300 to 475.346. </em>The determination may be evidenced, for example, by a decision not to prosecute, the dismissal of charges or acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">(Emphases added.) Here, there is no evidence that the district attorney or the district attorney\u2019s designee made the requisite determination with respect to defendant (or the other cardholders).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">To be sure, the <em>trial court </em>dismissed the charges against defendant on statutory speedy trial grounds; nonetheless, that judicial determination does not fulfill the express statutory requisite for the return of seized marijuana under ORS 475.323(2). Here, a judicial dismissal pursuant to ORS 135.747, for lack of speedy trial, is a dismissal without prejudice<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and does not address the merits and, thus, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>tantamount to an acquittal, <em>see generally </em>ORS 131.535(2)(b) (providing that a dismissal of the accusatory instrument \u201cupon any pretrial motion\u201d \u201cwill not constitute an acquittal of the same offense\u201d); nor did the district attorney in this case determine not to prosecute or to dismiss the charges\u2014 and defendant does not so argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">ORS 133.623, which the trial court also referenced, applies only to warrantless seizures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, it is also inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Thus, the inquiry with respect to purported authority for return of the seized marijuana narrows to the omnibus evidence return provision, ORS 133.643. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cA motion for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the movant has a <em>valid claim to rightful possession </em>thereof, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201c(1) The things had been stolen or otherwise converted, and the movant is the owner or rightful possessor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201c(2) The things seized were not in fact subject to seizure under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 or 133.525 to 133.703;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">\u201c(3) The movant, by license or otherwise, is <em>lawfully entitled to possess </em>things otherwise subject to seizure under ORS 133.525 to 133.703;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201c(4) Although the things seized were subject to seizure under ORS 133.525 to 133.703, the movant is or will be entitled to their return or restoration upon the court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">\u201c(5) The parties in the case have stipulated that the things seized may be returned to the movant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>(Emphases added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, ORS 133.643 includes five disjunctive triggers for return of items seized. Only two of those \u201ctriggers\u201d\u2014ORS 133.643(3) and (4)\u2014are even arguably applicable in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whether those provisions apply in this case, triggering an entitlement to return of the disputed marijuana, turns on the meaning of \u201cclaim to rightful possession\u201d and \u201clawfully entitled to possess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In construing those statutory terms, we employ the familiar <em>PGE/Gaines </em>methodology, examining the text, context, and pertinent legislative history so as to discern and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 <em>(2009); PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993); <em>see also Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997) (\u201cIn construing a statute, this court is responsible for identifying the correct interpretation, whether or not asserted by the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">As noted, a movant is entitled to return of seized property pursuant to ORS 133.643(3) only if he or she \u201cis lawfully entitled to possess\u201d that property. Although the text of ORS 133.643(4) does not also include the term \u201clawfully,\u201d in conjunction with its use of \u201centitled,\u201d we have held that, in the totality of the statutory context, \u201centitled\u201d in subsection (4) necessarily connotes and requires a showing of <em>lawful </em>entitlement to possession. <em>Filipetti v. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, </em>224 Or App 122, 132, 197 P3d 535 (2008) (concluding that the movants had failed to establish entitlement to return of \u201cSnowball,\u201d a black-tailed doe deer, pursuant to ORS 133.643(4), because \u201cat the time the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>granted [the] motion, [the movants] could not lawfully possess the doe\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In adopting that construction, and so holding, in <em>Filipetti, </em>we canvassed the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the statutory language, the statutory context, including the language of subsection (3), and, ultimately, the legislative history of ORS 133.643. We synthesized and summarized that legislative history\u2014which proved decisive\u2014as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cThe legislature enacted ORS 133.643 in 1973 as part of the Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s revision of the Criminal Procedure Code. <em>The commentary to that revision discloses that the legislature did not intend a motion for return or restoration of things seized to serve as a vehicle for the return of things seized to a movant who could not lawfully possess them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cFinally, and dispositively, the commission emphasized that it did not intend the state to return items that were unlawful for the movant to possess, no matter how the state came into possession of them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201cTn most if not all circumstances, the legality of the search or seizure is not relevant to disposition of a motion for return or restoration of the property. <em>If possession of the things seized is unlawful, the state retains the things no matter how it got them!</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201c[Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Preliminary Draft No 2, Part II, Art 5 \u00a7 23, 66 (Nov 1971)] (emphasis added). That legislative history demonstrates conclusively that the legislature intended for the state to retain items seized if the movant\u2019s possession of them would be unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">224 Or App at 130-31 (second emphasis in original; first emphasis added). We thus concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201ca party seeking to compel the return or restoration of seized property based on a \u2018valid claim to rightful possession\u2019 pursuant to ORS 133.643(4) must establish that (1) the item is \u2018no longer needed for evidentiary purposes\u2019 and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>person is \u2018entitled\u2019 to the return or restoration of\u2014that is, can lawfully possess\u2014the item sought to be recovered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 132.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Given the express \u201clawfully entitled\u201d language of ORS 133.643(3) and our construction in <em>Filipetti </em>of ORS 133.643(4), our interpretive inquiry reduces, finally, to whether <em>\u201clawful </em>possession\u201d refers to both state and federal law. That is, whether ORS 133.643(3) and (4) authorize return of seized property only if the movant\u2019s possession of that property would not violate either state or federal law (here, the CSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We conclude, consistently with the statutory text and the legislative history set out above, that \u201clawfully entitled\u201d encompasses both state and federal law. We note first that that term is textually unqualified. Further, the legislative history regarding the intent \u201cfor the state to retain items seized if the movant\u2019s possession of them would be unlawful,\u201d <em>Filipetti, </em>224 Or App at 131, is similarly unqualified. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that the legislature, in enacting the omnibus evidence return provisions in 1971, intended to compel the return of items to persons whose possession would violate federal law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, construing ORS 133.643 in such a fashion as to authorize\u2014indeed, compel\u2014the return of items whose possession would violate federal law could, as the parties\u2019 preemption-related contentions manifest, give rise to \u201cserious constitutional problems.\u201d <em>See Bernstein Bros. v.
