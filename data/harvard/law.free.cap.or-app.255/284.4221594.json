ORS 163.405. The indictment alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly have deviate sexual intercourse with [the victim], a person who was incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation, and/or physical helplessness.\u201d An indictment of one offense includes, by necessary implication, charges of lesser-included offenses. ORS 136.465; <em>State v. Gibbons, </em>228 Or 238, 242, 364 P2d 611 (1961). \u201cA lesser included offense is one that is included either in the statutory framework defining the greater and lesser offenses or in the accusatory instrument itself.\u201d <em>State v. Wille, </em>317 Or 487, 495 n 7, 858 P2d 128 (1993). A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser-included offense \u201cif there is a disputed issue of fact enabling the jury to find that all the elements of the greater offense have not been proven, but that all the elements of one or more of the lesser offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>have been proven.\u201d <em>State v. Naylor, </em>291 Or 191, 195, 629 P2d 1308 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 427, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005), we held that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cthe victim does not consent thereto\u201d in ORS 163.425 to apply to circumstances where a victim is incapable of giving consent to, among other conduct, deviate sexual intercourse. Similarly, to convict a defendant of first-degree sodomy under ORS 163.405(l)(d), the state must prove that the victim was incapable of consenting to deviate sexual intercourse. The latter offense, however, requires proof of an additional element not included in ORS 163.425, namely, that the victim was \u201cincapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness.\u201d Thus, where, as here, defendant was charged with first-degree sodomy on the theory that the victim was incapable of consent as provided in ORS 163.405(l)(d), second-degree sexual abuse is a lesser-included offense of first-degree sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We recite the evidence in the light most favorable to the giving of the requested instruction. <em>State v. Chapman, </em>209 Or App 771, 773, 149 P3d 284 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 473 (2007). When defendant engaged in the charged conduct, the victim was in her late sixties and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and dementia. Doctors who had examined and treated the victim testified that, because of her mental condition, she was incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct or of understanding the consequences of her actions. In the fall of 2009, the victim resided in an assisted-living facility where defendant was employed as a nursing assistant. As part of his duties, defendant occasionally was assigned to care for the victim, and he had access to her living quarters. On September 2, 2009, the victim reported to the nursing staff that she had had sex with a man who was a caregiver at the facility. When asked by the director of nursing staff what she meant, the victim said, \u201cWell, no, we didn\u2019t screw. We were supposed to. He asked if he could put his penis in my mouth and I let him.\u201d Subsequently, the victim was shown a photo array by a police detective, and she identified defendant as her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>At trial, defendant advanced three theories of defense. First, defendant asserted that the victim was mistaken and that the crimes had never occurred. Second, defendant argued that, if the crimes had taken place, someone else committed them. Finally, defendant argued that if he had engaged in sexual activity with the victim she had, in fact, consented to it. Among other requested instructions, defendant asked the court to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of second-degree sexual abuse. Defendant argued that that offense was a lesser-included offense of first-degree sodomy because \u201cit\u2019s just missing that element [of] consent based on defective, mental defect which is alleged in this case.\u201d The trial court declined to give the requested instruction, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\u201cAnd the issue I find more, more to the central core of this is what\u2019s the nature of the lack of consent. If the [victim] was incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, which is the element of rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree, I am not finding that just a general lack of consent is a lesser included concept. So if, she is either incapable of consent or she isn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t see any indication, quite candidly, that would raise the issue of lack of consent in the general sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Defendant remonstrated that, from the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony that the victim had been told to obey the staff of the facility, a reasonable jury could infer that the victim had not consented to the sexual contact. After defendant rested his case, he renewed his request for the lesser-included jury instruction, and the court once again declined, explaining that \u201cthe more I think about it, the more convinced I am that the consent referred to in sexual abuse two is not a lesser included of incapable of consent by reason of mental defect.\u201d Defendant was convicted by the jury and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">As noted, sexual abuse in the second degree is a lesser-included offense of first-degree sodomy; the state does not contend otherwise, nor does it assert that there was no evidence in the record to support the instruction. Instead, the state urges, first, that the requested instruction was inconsistent with defendant\u2019s theory of the case at trial and, therefore, the trial court did not err in declining to give it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Alternatively, the state argues that any error in failing to give the instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">For its first argument, the state relies on <em>State v. Washington, </em>273 Or 829, 836, 543 P2d 1058 (1975), where the court held that a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense is proper where \u201cthe jury could rationally find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and innocent of the greater.\u201d The state contends that \u201cthat rule suggests that the requested instruction must bear some rational relationship to a theory presented by one of the parties to the case.\u201d We disagree. The state\u2019s recapitulation of the holding in <em>Washington </em>is incomplete. In full, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cThe single limitation on the right of either the prosecution or the defendant to request lesser included offense instructions under these statutes is <em>that there must be evidence, or an inference which can be drawn from the evidence, </em>which supports the requested instruction so that the jury could rationally and consistently find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and innocent of the greater.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). As the emphasized text makes clear, whether a requested lesser-included offense instruction must be given depends on the <em>evidence </em>adduced at trial, not on the logical consistency between the instruction and the theory, or theories, advanced by its proponent. We therefore reject the state\u2019s contrary assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Alternatively, the state argues that any error in failing to give the requested instruction was harmless because, pursuant to ORS 136.460(2), the jury was required to consider the greater offense first, and either convict or acquit defendant of that offense, before considering any lesser-included offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the jury convicted defendant of the greater offense, the state reasons, the jury would have been precluded from considering the lesser-included offense by operation of ORS 136.460(2) and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>any error in declining to give such an instruction was harmless. We have rejected similar arguments on multiple occasions, most recently in <em>State v. Zolotoff, </em>253 Or App 593, 291 P3d 781 (2012), and we reject it again, here, for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"> ORS 163.405 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201c(1) A person who engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person or causes another to engage in deviate sexual intercourse commits the crime of sodomy in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">\u201c(d) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"> ORS 163.425 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the second degree when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">\u201c(a) The person subjects another person to sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse or, except as provided in ORS 163.412, penetration of the vagina, anus or penis with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor and the victim does not consent thereto!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> ORS 136.460(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\u201cThe jury shall first consider the charged offense.
