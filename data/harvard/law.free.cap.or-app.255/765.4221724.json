The trial court entered a judgment that, among other things, imposed an upward departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for the unlawful use of a weapon conviction. The court based the departure on defendant\u2019s stipulation to the fact that he was \u201con supervision\u201d when he committed the crime. After filing a notice of appeal, defendant moved to correct errors in the judgment pursuant to ORS ISS.OSSUXa).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argued, in part, that the judgment erroneously imposed the upward departure sentence in violation of ORS 136.773(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant argued that the court had erred in accepting defendant\u2019s stipulation to the enhancement fact without also first obtaining a written jury trial waiver. Defendant requested that the court delete the purportedly erroneous 60-month departure sentence and instead impose \u201ca sentence * * * that is not aggravated by an enhancement factor.\u201d The court entered an amended judgment that corrected other errors but left defendant\u2019s departure sentence intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Defendant appeals the amended judgment, raising seven assignments of error. We write only to address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred under ORS 136.773(1) when it imposed an upward departure sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>for the unlawful use of a weapon conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues that the departure sentence is unlawful because, although he stipulated to the enhancement fact, the court did not obtain his \u201cwritten waiver of the right to a jury trial on the enhancement fact,\u201d in violation of ORS 136.773(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the use of the enhancement fact at sentencing or otherwise notify the court that he had not signed a jury trial waiver; however, he contends that his argument is nevertheless preserved by virtue of the fact that the trial court entered an amended judgment after defendant moved to correct the original judgment under ORS 138.083(l)(a). The state responds that defendant\u2019s motion to correct the judgment under ORS 138.083(l)(a) preserved only the limited issue of whether the court abused its discretion in refusing to correct the judgment, not the issue of whether the sentence is erroneous. We agree with the state that defendant failed to preserve the argument that he makes on appeal. Filing a post-judgment motion does not retroactively preserve predicate sentencing error. <em>See State v. Layton, </em>163 Or App 37, 41, 986 P2d 1221 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 252 (2000) (\u201cWe do not understand how raising the issue after trial [pursuant to ORS 138.083(l)(a)] somehow \u2018cured\u2019 defendant\u2019s failure to raise it at the proper stage of the proceedings, that is, at the sentencing hearing.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Hammond, </em>218 Or App 574, 584, 180 P3d 137 (2008) (\u201cNo Oregon appellate decision has ever held that unpreserved prejudgment error can somehow be transmuted into preserved error by virtue of the filing and denial of a post-judgment motion.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Alternatively, defendant argues that the court\u2019s imposition of the departure sentence without a written jury trial waiver constitutes plain error and urges us to exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45 (\u201c[T]he appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (discussing the exercise of discretion to correct plain error). In response, the state concedes that the \u201ccourt did not submit the \u2018on supervision\u2019 departure ground to the jury and instead accepted defendant\u2019s admission to the ground (that is, his stipulation). But the court failed to obtain a written jury waiver. By neglecting to do so, the court violated ORS 136.773.\u201d The state, however, argues that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">We ultimately need not decide whether the trial court plainly erred under ORS 136.773(1). Assuming that the error were plain, we would not exercise our discretion to correct it. In deciding whether to exercise that discretion, we may take into consideration several factors, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and * * * whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9i\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Here, because he stipulated to the enhancement fact, defendant was not prejudiced by any error. On this record, no reasonable factfinder could conclude anything other than that defendant was \u201con supervision\u201d when he committed the relevant crime. <em>See State v. Porter, </em>202 Or App 622, 627, 123 P3d 325 (2005) (a stipulation \u201cis a statement by which one party waives the right to require the other party to prove a particular fact\u201d). Under those circumstances, any error is not grave, the state has a \u201csignificant interest in avoiding a second, unnecessary sentencing hearing,\u201d and remanding to the trial court would not advance the ends of justice. <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 513, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008) (court should not exercise discretion to correct harmless sentencing error).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> ORS 138.083(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">\u201cThe sentencing court shall retain authority irrespective of any notice of appeal after entry of judgment of conviction to modify its judgment and sentence to correct any arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment.

Rather, <em>Harding </em>stands only for the proposition that \u201carguments made in the trial court in support of, or against, corrections [to the judgment] pursuant to ORS 138.083[(l)(a)], are preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Put another way, arguments made to the trial court in support of corrections to the judgment under ORS 138.083(l)(a) preserve only the limited issue of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the court abused its discretion in not accordingly correcting the judgment under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Thus, as we understand our reasoning in <em>Harding, </em>in a motion to correct a judgment pursuant to ORS 138.083(l)(a), a party may raise issues concerning an erroneous term in the judgment, including issues that could have been raised about that error but were not raised before entry of the original judgment. The court, however, has discretion to determine whether to correct the judgment based on those arguments, and, on appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. Here, defendant preserved the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion in not correcting the judgment under ORS 138.083(l)(a). However, to whatever extent that defendant makes that argument on appeal, it is insufficiently developed, and we reject it without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\"> The state also argues, somewhat inconsistently, that the error is not \u201cplain\u201d because, as in <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 130 P3d 780 (2006), the record is subject to multiple, competing inferences as to whether the court erred. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (plain error must appear \u201con the face of the record\u201d so that the reviewing court \u201cneed not * * * choose between competing inferences to find [the asserted error]\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b792-5\"> Defendant contends that, under <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 173 P3d 827 (2007), we are required to correct the alleged error. We do not read <em>Barber </em>to require that result under ORS 136.773(1), and we reject defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
