Because defendant did not preserve that argument, we do not reach it, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Defendant was charged with several counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, and third-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.415, for crimes committed against two child victims, S and C. At trial, the prosecutor sought to have each of the victims read a letter that she had written to the district attorneys office shortly after defendant was charged. In the letter at issue on appeal, S explained her reasons for pursuing the prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, she explained that she had been encouraged by statements made by a school official and a police officer. The letter stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cThis has been a difficult challenge for me to overcome. I had learn a important lesson from this. I learn from one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>of my school official and detective of the Hillsboro Police Department. They both said, \u2018It not your fault and your some brave little girl.\u2019Another things that my school official said, \u2018Keep your head up and don\u2019t let people put your head down.\u2019 I so grateful that I have important people believe my story.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The prosecutor asserted that, although the letter was hearsay, it was admissible under \u201cthe exception for child hearsay statements,\u201d OEC 803(18a)(b). Defendant objected to the admission of the letter, advancing three arguments: (1) the letter was hearsay and the officials\u2019 statements quoted in the letter were double hearsay, OEC 801; OEC 802;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) the officials were not identified, so they could not be cross-examined, in violation of defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses, US Const, Amend VI; Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 11; <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004); and (3) the officials\u2019 statements amounted to vouching for S\u2019s credibility, so they were inadmissible under OEC 403, <em>see, e.g., State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009); <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988); <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 657 P2d 1215 (1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As to the first argument, defendant contended that the officials\u2019 statements were \u201cplain old hearsay contained within the hearsay that\u2019s the letter and so we\u2019d object to that part being offered.\u201d In response to that objection, the prosecutor asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201cThe whole letter is * * * an exception, so maybe there\u2019s double hearsay in there because she\u2019s saying what someone else told her. My response would be we\u2019re offering it for the effect on the listener.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cThis letter and these statements in that letter that are included from the officers or whoever else at her school go to show her motivations in coming forward and her motivations in continuing to come forward with the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cSo the statements in that letter about how basically she\u2019s being encouraged by people at her school to basically keep her head up and to be brave and to tell the truth, those are * * * not hearsay. They\u2019re statements that are offered to show (a) the effect on her, as the listener, which is her motivation to come forward; and (b) that she is coming forward because of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Thus, the prosecutor first asserted that the letter itself fell within OEC 803(18a)(b). Then he asserted that the officials\u2019 statements in the letter were not double hearsay because they were not offered to prove the truth of the matters <em>asserted\u2014viz., </em>that S was not at fault, that she was brave, and that she was telling the truth. <em>See </em>OEC 801(3) (hearsay is \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d). Rather, they were offered to prove why S had decided to come forward with her allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Defendant did not challenge either of the prosecutor\u2019s assertions: that the letter fell within OEC 803(18a)(b) or that the officials\u2019 statements were not being offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Instead, defendant moved to his second argument, contending that admission of the officials\u2019 statements violated his right to confront witnesses because the officials were unidentified and, consequently, could not be cross-examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Ultimately, the trial court concluded that, although the letter was hearsay, it was not barred by OEC 802 because it fell within OEC 803(18a)(b). As to the officials\u2019 statements, which defendant contended were double hearsay, the court agreed with the prosecutor that they were not double hearsay because they were introduced for their effect on S, not for the truth of the matters asserted. The court admitted the letter and, subsequently, defendant was convicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting the part of the letter that contains the officials\u2019 statements because the statements are not admissible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>OEC 803(18a)(b) as statements concerning acts of abuse. Defendant asserts that the legislature intended OEC 803(18a)(b) to provide an exception to the general hearsay prohibition for statements <em>by </em>victims of abuse, not for statements by others, like police officers, <em>to </em>victims of abuse. Thus, he contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the whole letter fell within the exception set out in OEC 803(18a)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">That argument is not preserved. As explained above, before the trial court, when defendant asserted that the letter was hearsay and the officials\u2019 statements were double hearsay, the prosecutor responded that, although the letter was hearsay, it was admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b) and the officials\u2019 statements were not double hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matters asserted. Defendant did not challenge the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that OEC 803(18a)(b) applied; instead, he moved on to his arguments that admission of the officials\u2019 statements violated his right to confront witnesses and that the statements amounted to vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">By contrast, on appeal, defendant challenges the admissibility of the letter under OEC 803(18a)(b), contending that OEC 803(18a)(b) does not cover statements made by anyone other than the victim of abuse. He did not make that argument below, and, under our case law, his failure to do so precludes us from reaching it. <em>See State v. Wilson, </em>323 Or 498, 512, 918 P2d 826 (1996), <em>cert den, </em>519 US 1065, 117 S Ct 704, 136 L Ed 625 (1997) (the defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of a hearsay statement under OEC 804(3)(c)\u2014 which establishes an exception to the hearsay rule for statements against the declarant\u2019s interest when the declarant is unavailable\u2014on the ground that the statement did not qualify as a statement against the declarant\u2019s interest did not preserve the defendant\u2019s appellate argument that the statement was inadmissible because the declarant was not \u201cunavailable as a witness,\u201d OEC 804(1), (2)); <em>State ex rel Juv.
