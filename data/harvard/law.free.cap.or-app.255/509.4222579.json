The amended judgment was entered the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in making a restitution determination more than 90 days after the original judgment without finding good cause to extend the 90-day statutory deadline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See ORS 137.106(l)(b) (court may extend the 90-day time within which the restitution determination and supplemental judgment may be completed \u201cfor good cause\u201d). We agree that the trial court was required to make a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination before extending the statutory deadline for making a restitution award. Accordingly, we remand for the trial court to address the predicate question of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> Defendant did not raise the issue of the statutory deadline in the trial court, but, as the state concedes, preservation principles are inapplicable because defendant had no opportunity to object to the error. <em>See State v. Selmer, </em>231 Or App 31, 34, 217 P3d 1092 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 608 (2010) (preservation principles do not apply when \u201cthe error arose when the court issued its order or judgment, and not earlier\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
