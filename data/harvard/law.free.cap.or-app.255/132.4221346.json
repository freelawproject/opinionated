The state asserts that defendant was not entitled to have the conviction set aside because, within the 10-year period preceding his initiation of expunction, defendant had been convicted of a municipal violation (urinating in public). We agree with the state and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The facts are straightforward and undisputed. On October 9, 2007, defendant pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, unlawful delivery of marijuana, an offense that had been charged as a Class B felony but was reduced by plea agreement to a misdemeanor. On January 21, 2010, defendant entered a plea <em>of \u201cno </em>contest\u201d to public urination, a violation of the Eugene municipal code, and paid a fine of $100. In a letter to the municipal court, he explained that he was working in Arizona and could not attend a trial in Eugene.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On October 14, 2010, defendant filed his motion to set aside the marijuana conviction. The state opposed the motion, because defendant had been convicted of the public urination violation within the 10-year period preceding the filing of his motion. Without explanation, the trial court rejected the state\u2019s argument that defendant was ineligible to have his conviction set aside as a result of the public urination violation and granted defendant\u2019s motion by order entered April 4, 2011, setting aside defendant\u2019s conviction and ordering that his records be sealed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Under ORS 137.225(l)(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u201c[a]t any time after the lapse of three years from the date of pronouncement of judgment, any defendant who has fully complied with and performed the sentence of the court and whose conviction is described in subsection (5) of this section by motion may apply to the court where the conviction was entered for entry of an order setting aside the conviction [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Defendant\u2019s misdemeanor conviction for unlawful delivery of marijuana is a conviction for which expunction is authorized under ORS 137.225(5)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Nonetheless, pursuant to ORS 137.225(6)(b), the provisions allowing a person to apply for expunction do not apply to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><em>\u201c[a]person convicted, </em>within the 10-year period immediately preceding the filing of the motion pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, <em>of any other offense, </em>excluding motor vehicle violations, whether or not the other conviction is for conduct associated with the same criminal episode that caused the arrest or conviction that is sought to be set aside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">(Emphasis added.) In the state\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s municipal code violation is \u201cany other offense\u201d that precludes expunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The state notes that an \u201coffense\u201d is defined in ORS 161.505 as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cconduct for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment or to a fine is provided by any law of this state or by any law or ordinance of a political subdivision of this state. An offense is either a crime, as described in ORS 161.515, or a violation, as described in ORS 153.008.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Thus, an \u201coffense\u201d includes violations. Under ORS 153.008(l)(c), an offense is a violation if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">\u201c[t]he offense is created by an ordinance of a county, city district or other political subdivision of this state with authority to create offenses, and the ordinance provides that violation of the ordinance is punishable by a fine but does not provide that the offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment. The ordinance may provide for punishment in addition to a fine as long as the punishment does not include a term of imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">It is not disputed that defendant\u2019s municipal offense was a violation as described in ORS 153.008(l)(c). We reject defendant\u2019s policy-based argument that we should not give effect to ORS 137.225(6)(b) as written because it \u201cmakes no sense\u201d to prohibit expunction when the defendant commits a relatively insignificant offense but to allow expunction when the defendant commits a serious traffic violation. That is an argument that must be taken up with the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The remaining question on appeal is whether defendant was \u201cconvicted\u201d as that term is used in ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>137.225(6)(b) by virtue of the judgment entered following his no contest plea to a municipal violation. Defendant contended at trial and contends on appeal that a no contest plea \u201cwould seem not to result in a \u2018conviction.\u2019\u201d In support of the trial court\u2019s ruling, defendant cites provisions of ORS chapter 153 that defendant contends, when read together, implicitly require the conclusion that a judgment entered after a no contest plea to a violation is something other than a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Defendant notes that, under ORS 153.061(3)(b), a defendant may enter a plea of no contest to a violation by \u201cdelivering to the court the summons, a check or money order in the amount of the base fine set forth in the summons, and a statement of matters in explanation or mitigation of the violation charged,\u201d and the delivery of the statement \u201cconstitutes a waiver of trial and consent to the entry of a judgment forfeiting the base fine ***.\u201d Defendant further points out that when there is a trial or a guilty plea, the court enters a judgment, ORS 153.099(1) and (3), but when a defendant enters a plea of no contest, then the court \u201cshall make a decision,\u201d ORS 153.099(2). Thus, defendant\u2019s view is that his no contest plea to the violation may have resulted in a \u201cjudgment forfeiting the base fine,\u201d or maybe a \u201cdecision,\u201d but not a \u201cconviction.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201cIn effect, the statutes are designed to create a speedy and fair resolution of the defendant\u2019s alleged offense. That resolution \u2014 a judgment forfeiting the base fine \u2014 potentially gives both sides a \u2018win\u2019: The state or municipality, which believes the defendant likely committed an offense, receives a payment from the defendant that should help deter him from repeating such behavior and warn other transgressors that the law cannot be ignored; the defendant is allowed to cap the money he will pay and to claim that he remains unconvicted; and both sides avoid the expense and trouble of going to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Defendant\u2019s statutory construction argument is undermined by ORS 135.345, which provides that \u201c[a] judgment following entry of a no contest plea is a conviction of the offense to which the plea is entered.\u201d Nevertheless, defendant argues, ORS 135.345 applies only to crimes, not violations. He notes that a defendant who pleads no contest to a crime is afforded various rights that a criminal defendant who pleads guilty is afforded, such as having the court inform the defendant of rights that he or she is waiving and determine that the plea is voluntary and intelligently made and has a factual basis. <em>See </em>ORS 135.335, 135.385, 135.390, 135.395. On the other hand, in defendant\u2019s view, a defendant who pleads no contest to a violation has in effect chosen \u201cto accept something akin to a diversion\u201d because the defendant avoids appearing by choosing to pay the base fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Although ORS chapter 153 does not contain a provision similar to ORS 135.345, ORS 153.030(1) provides that, \u201c[ejxcept as specifically provided in this chapter, the criminal procedure laws of this state applicable to crimes also apply to violations.\u201d And, as we have observed in the past, a person \u201cadjudicated guilty of a violation is \u2018convicted\u2019 of that violation in the same sense that a person charged and found guilty of criminal conduct is \u2018convicted\u2019 of a crime.\u201d <em>Washington Cty. Police Assn. v. Washington Cty., </em>181 Or App 448, 454 n 3, 45 P3d 515 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>335 Or 198, 63 P3d 1167 (2003). <em>See also City of Lowell v. Wilson, </em>197 Or App 291, 293, 302, 105 P3d 856, <em>rev den, </em>399 Or 406 (2005) (referring to \u201cconvictions\u201d entered after the defendant\u2019s no contest pleas to municipal code violations). We conclude that, pursuant to ORS 135.345 and ORS 153.030(1), defendant\u2019s no contest plea to the violation of public urination resulted in a \u201cconviction\u201d of an offense within the 10 years preceding defendant\u2019s motion to expunge his marijuana conviction. <em>See State v. Greenlick, </em>210 Or App 662, 667, 152 P3d 971 (2007) (stating that \u201ccriminal procedure\u201d in ORS 153.030(1) refers to \u201crules governing the mechanisms under which crimes are investigated, prosecuted, adjudicated, and punished\u201d and holding that the statutory speedy trial scheme in ORS chapter 135 is part of the code of criminal procedures and that ORS 135.747, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of the speedy trial provisions, is a \u201ccriminal procedure law\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court should have denied defendant\u2019s motion to set aside his marijuana conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> Defendant further points out that, in violation cases, when a defendant has entered a no contest plea, the court nonetheless has discretion under ORS 153.061(7) to require that a trial be held if the court determines that the base fine is not adequate. If the defendant appears and enters a plea of no contest, and no trial is otherwise required, then, according to defendant, that means that the judgment entered on a no contest plea to a violation is merely a \u201cdecision\u201d and not a judgment of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
