J.</author>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">This case comes to us on remand after the Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part our decision in <em>ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty Ins., </em>222 Or App 453, 194 P3d 167 (2008) <em>(ZRZ Realty I), modified on recons, </em>225 Or App 257, 201 P3d 912 (2009) <em>(ZRZ Realty II), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>349 Or 117, 241 P3d 710 (2010) <em>(ZRZ Realty III), modified on recons, </em>349 Or 657, 249 P3d 111 (2011) <em>(ZRZ Realty IV). </em>In our original decision, <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>we addressed, among other issues, whether plaintiffs (collectively Zidell) or defendants (collectively London) had the burden to prove whether environmental damage resulting from the operation of Zidell\u2019s business was expected or intended for purposes of various insurance policies issued by London. We held that the trial court had correctly allocated that burden to London as to certain policies, <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cimplied fortuity polices\u201d that, by their terms, provided coverage without regard to whether resulting property damage was expected or intended; but, we held that the trial court had erred in allocating that burden to London on \u201cexpress fortuity policies,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>policies that expressly limited coverage to property damage that was not expected or intended. We reversed the judgment (including an attorney fee award) in favor of Zidell and also vacated a supplemental judgment that awarded Zidell additional attorney fees. <em>ZRZ Realty </em>1, 222 Or App at 497. On reconsideration, we modified our opinion but adhered to our disposition, again remanding the case for retrial as to all policies. <em>ZRZ Realty II, </em>225 Or App at 262-65. In light of our disposition, we did not reach some of the parties\u2019 assignments of error on appeal and cross-appeal, including most of the parties\u2019 assignments concerning attorney fees. <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>222 Or App at 478, 480, 495-97; <em>ZRZ Realty II, </em>225 Or App at 264-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed our decision as it pertained to the allocation of the burden of proof, but concluded that our remand was too broad. The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he remand should have been limited, at least initially, to the question whether, for the purposes of the express fortuity policies, Zidell either expected or intended that a series of contaminants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>resulting from the operation of its business would damage the environment.\u201d <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>349 Or at 147. The court also held that we had erred in reversing the attorney fee award in the judgment and in vacating the attorney fee award in the supplemental judgment, because the issue to be retried\u2014whether Zidell expected or intended the damage resulting from its business activity for purposes of express fortuity policies\u2014\u201cwould have no effect on either the trial court\u2019s ruling that London had a duty to defend Zidell in DEQ\u2019s enforcement action or the trial court\u2019s conclusion that ORS 742.061 authorized Zidell to recover attorney fees it incurred in this action in establishing and enforcing London\u2019s duty to defend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">After reversing our decision in those respects, the court sent the case back to us for consideration of the assignments of error that we previously did not reach. The court described the remand this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cBecause we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing and vacating the fee awards, it follows that we must remand this case initially to the Court of Appeals to permit it to consider those assignments of error. On remand before the Court of Appeals, the parties are also free to ask the court to consider, if appropriate, those assignments of error that the court did not reach because it remanded the case for a new trial on both the express and implied fortuity policies. Because at least some of those issues must go back to the Court of Appeals for its resolution before the case returns to the trial court, we remand this case initially to the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"><em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>349 Or at 150-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The remand, however, did not reach this court immediately, because the Supreme Court issued two more opinions\u2014one on reconsideration that clarified that the trial court was not foreclosed from taking live testimony on remand, <em>ZRZ Realty IV, </em>349 Or 657, and another dealing with Zidell\u2019s petition for an award of attorney fees for prevailing on appeal, 351 Or 255, 266 P3d 61 (2011) <em>(ZRZ Realty </em>V).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In June 2012, we received the remand judgment from the Supreme Court and invited further briefing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the parties on what issues remain to be decided by this court. Having reviewed the original briefs, the various appellate decisions in this case, and the parties\u2019 most recent submissions, we conclude that the following assignments of error merit further discussion on remand: on appeal, London\u2019s second assignment (dismissal of claims as a matter of law), third assignment (inconsistencies in the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions), fourth assignment (expected losses under certain bumbershoot policies), and eighth, ninth, and tenth assignments (each pertaining to attorney fees); and, on cross-appeal, Zidell\u2019s first assignment (allocation of indemnity costs), second assignment (defense costs under ship dismantling policies), and fourth and fifth assignments (both concerning attorney fees). And, for the reasons that follow, we now affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings concerning the implied fortuity policies; vacate the initial attorney fee award because it includes fees for time spent on issues other than the duty to defend; reject London\u2019s argument concerning the supplemental fee award; and decline to reach the allocation question, which will benefit from a better- developed record below.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The facts underlying this appeal are set out in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, which we repeat here to provide context for the various assignments of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs (collectively Zidell) are a group of related companies that began acquiring and dismantling decommissioned navy and merchant marine ships after World War II. Zidell towed the decommissioned ships to a site along the Willamette River in Portland (the Moody Avenue site) where it dismantled the ships for scrap, generally while the ships were tied to a dock at the site. Dismantling the ships resulted in the release of pollutants found in, among other places, the ships\u2019 paint, batteries, motors, and fuel tanks. The pollutants included polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum products in the form of fuel, lubricating, and hydraulic oils, and a variety of metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and zinc. Some of the pollutants were released directly into the river; others contaminated the land on which Zidell operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>its business and, from there, leached into the groundwater and the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cOver the years, Zidell purchased different types of insurance from a variety of insurers. Only two insurers, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London and Certain London Market Insurance Companies, remain in this litigation; the others have settled. The interests of the two remaining insurers are, for the purposes of this appeal, identical, and we refer to them collectively as London. From 1956 to 1983, Zidell purchased three types of insurance policies from London that are at issue in this litigation: comprehensive general liability policies, a form of marine excess coverage known as bumbershoot policies, and another form of marine insurance known as protection and indemnity policies. In setting out the facts, we discuss the comprehensive general liability policies and refer to the other policies where appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cThe comprehensive general liability policies consisted of primary and excess policies that provided coverage for damage to property but contained an owned property exclusion. <em>See Schnitzer Investment Corp. v. Certain Underwriters, </em>341 Or 128, 138-39, 137 P3d 1282 (2006) (discussing effect of owned property exclusion on coverage for environmental contamination). From 1956 to 1965, London issued a series of comprehensive general liability policies that the parties refer to as the \u2018implied fortuity policies.\u2019[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] By their terms, those policies provided coverage without regard to whether the property damage that resulted from Zidell\u2019s business activities was either expected or intended. One policy, for example, provided coverage for \u2018any and all liability imposed by law against the Assured for loss of or damage to or destruction of the property of others * * * arising from any cause whatsoever out of the operation\u2019 of Zidell\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cDespite that broad grant of coverage, the trial court read a limitation into the implied fortuity policies. Specifically, the trial court ruled that \u2018the general principle that only \u201cfortuitous\u201d losses will be covered will be deemed a condition of each such policy, consistent with the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>in <em>A-1 Sandblasting &amp; Steamcleaning Co. v. Baiden, </em>293 Or 17, 643 P2d 1260 (1982).\u2019 As the trial court explained, that principle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\u201c\u2018limits coverage to those losses that were not expected or intended for policies between 1957 and January 1, 1968. From January 1, 1968 until July 1, 1983, the implied fortuity doctrine limits coverage to those losses that were not intended.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201cBoth parties accept the limitation that the trial court read into the agreements that they entered into before January 1, 1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cStarting in 1966, London began issuing comprehensive general liability policies to Zidell that the parties refer to as the \u2018express fortuity policies.\u2019 Those policies provided coverage only for damages that were both unexpected and \u25a0unintended. For example, in one of those policies, London agreed to pay Zidell \u2018all sums which the Assured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability [ijmposed upon the Assured by law * * * for damages * * * on account of *** [plroperty damage *** caused by or arising out of [an] occurrence.\u2019 The policy defined \u2018occurrence\u2019 as an \u2018accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally results in * * * property damage * * * during the policy period.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cIn 1994, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) issued a notice to Zidell stating that it was potentially responsible for cleaning up the environmental contamination resulting from its business at the Moody Avenue site. Zidell chose to participate in a voluntary clean-up program that DEQ offered and also requested that London, pursuant to the various policies that it had issued over the years, defend Zidell and indemnify it for the costs of remediating any environmental damage that had resulted from Zidell\u2019s business. When London denied that it had any obligation to defend or indemnify Zidell, Zidell brought this action, alleging breach of contract and also seeking a declaration of London\u2019s obligations under its policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cBefore trial, the court ruled on summary judgment that London had a duty to defend Zidell in response to DEQ\u2019s notice that Zidell was potentially responsible for cleaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>up the environmental damage resulting from its business. The court also ruled, on summary judgment, that London bore the burden of proving that Zidell either expected or intended the environmental damages that resulted from the operation of its business. The court explained that its ruling applied to both the express and the implied fortuity policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">\u201cWith those ground rules in place, the case proceeded to trial on the question of indemnity. Among other things, the parties and the trial court sought to identify the specific contaminants that, as a result of Zidell\u2019s business, had damaged the environment over the period of time in which London had insured Zidell. The trial court also sought to determine, regarding each pollutant, whether Zidell had either expected or intended the resulting damage. For example, the trial court found that Zidell had never intended any damage to the environment from removing anti-fouling paint (paint used to discourage the growth of organisms on the ships\u2019 hulls) but that \u2018Zidell management expected damage to sediments from [arsenic found in] anti-fouling paint beginning in 1972.\u2019 Because 90 percent of the arsenic found at the site came from removing the anti-fouling paint, the trial court sought to allocate London and Zidell\u2019s respective responsibility for the cost of remediating the damage accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the trial, the court issued lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law, which it incorporated in the judgment. In essence, the court found that, for a number of years, Zidell neither expected nor intended that its business operations would result in environmental damage; however, the court found that, beginning in the 1970s, Zidell expected that some of the substances released as a result of dismantling the ships would damage the soil and also the sediment in the river. As a result of those and other findings, the trial court held that London\u2019s policies required it to indemnify Zidell for part of the remediation costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>349 Or at 122-26 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The trial court\u2019s judgment, entered in April 2003, awarded attorney fees to Zidell in excess of $1.3 million. The court later entered a supplemental judgment that awarded Zidell an additional $268,988.15 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>London appealed the judgment and supplemental judgment, raising ten assignments of error, and Zidell cross-appealed, raising five of its own assignments of error. As previously described, in <em>ZRZ Realty I </em>we reversed and remanded the judgment and vacated the supplemental judgment for attorney fees; we then modified that decision on reconsideration in <em>ZRZ Realty II. </em>The Supreme Court, in <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>reversed in part our decision and remanded the case to us to consider issues that, because of our broad remand, we had not addressed. We now undertake that task and, in the course of our analysis, will describe in more detail the aspects of previous opinions that relate to issues now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">A. <em>Coverage-Related Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">1. <em>London\u2019s Assignments of Error</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">a. Second Assignment: Dismissal as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In its second assignment of error, London asserts that the trial court should have granted its motion to dismiss Zidell\u2019s claims pertaining to damage to river sediments, because \u201cthe nature of Zidell\u2019s knowing and intentional acts were so sure to cause harm that harm must be said to have been expected or intended.\u201d In <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>we rejected that argument on two independent grounds. We first explained that the trial court\u2019s error in allocating the burden of proof\u2014the subject of London\u2019s first assignment of error\u2014had infected the trial in a way that affected our review of the second assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cAs discussed above, the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling assigned the burden of proof to London on the question whether the damage was unexpected and unintended and effectively determined that Zidell was not required to prove that the damage was unexpected and unintended as part of its <em>prima facie </em>case. That pretrial ruling, which the court adhered to with respect to London\u2019s ORCP 54 B(2) motion, doomed that motion for judgment as a matter of law; if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>unexpected and unintended issue was not part of plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case, London would not have been entitled to prevail as a matter of law based on Zidell\u2019s evidence alone. Our reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the burden of proof complicates\u2014if not obviates\u2014our review of London\u2019s second assignment of error. As the parties discussed below, it is possible that Zidell would have tried the case differently had the burden been assigned to it rather than London. For that reason alone, it would be improper to conclude on appeal that the trial court should have granted a motion regarding Zidell\u2019s failure to make the wrong <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>222 Or App at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Nonetheless, we went on to address and reject on its merits London\u2019s argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cIn any event, we disagree with London\u2019s argument that the trial court was required, on the record before it, to conclude that the damage for which Zidell sought coverage was, as a matter of law, expected or intended. The gravamen of London\u2019s argument under its second assignment of error is that Zidell indisputably knew that <em>some </em>harm would result from its activities, such as dumping oil, discharging paint that was by its very design toxic to marine life, and violating state and federal clean water laws. Although we agree that there is evidence in the record from which a trier of fact could have determined that Zidell expected and intended the damage for which it sought coverage, that is not the question before us. Nor is the question before us whether Zidell <em>should </em>have expected or intended environmental damage from its activities. Rather, as the Supreme Court has explained in the context of expected and intended harm, the question is whether Zidell had the <em>subjective intent </em>to cause injury and harm to the property at the Moody Avenue site. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Stone, </em>319 Or 275, 279, 876 P2d 313 (1994) (explaining that the court has rejected the \u2018objective \u201cnatural and ordinary\u201d consequences approach to applying exclusions for intentionally-inflicted harms\u2019); <em>see also Nielsen </em>[v. <em>St. Paul Companies, </em>283 Or 277, 281, 583 P2d 549 (1978)]. (\u2018[T]he acts must have been committed <em>for the purpose of inflicting the injury and harm </em>before either a policy provision excluding intentional harm applies or the public policy against insurability attaches.\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201cAn insured\u2019s subjective intent to inflict harm can be established as a matter of law if the insured \u2018engaged in an act so certain to cause a particular kind of harm that the court will say that the insured intended the harm.\u2019 <em>Fox v. Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>327 Or 500, 514, 964 P2d 997 (1998) (citing <em>Snyder v. Nelson/Leatherby Ins., </em>278 Or 409, 413, 564 P2d 681 (1977)). \u2018In other words, the court should only infer that the insured had a subjective intent to cause harm or injury as a matter of law when such subjective intent is the <em>only </em>reasonable inference that may be drawn from the insured\u2019s conduct.\u2019 <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>319 Or at 279; see <em>also Nielsen, </em>283 Or at 281 (\u2018There are some intentional acts the nature of which is such that it must necessarily be concluded that there was an intention to injure.\u2019). London argues that Zidell\u2019s acts fall into that category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cWe are not persuaded that any of Zidell\u2019s acts were, by their very nature, sufficient to establish <em>as a matter of law </em>that Zidell acted with the purpose of causing harm. The Supreme Court and this court have found intent to injure, as a matter of law, only where such an intent was inherent in the insured\u2019s conduct. <em>See, e.g., Mutual of Enumclaw v. Merrill, </em>102 Or App 408, 411-12, 794 P2d 818, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 475 (1990) (intent to injure inferred as a matter of law where the insured sexually molested his minor granddaughter); <em>Falkenstein\u2019s Meat Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>91 Or App 276, 280, 754 P2d 621 (1988) (tort of deceit, by its nature, \u2018is an action from which the intention to do harm must necessarily be inferred\u2019). Otherwise, the matter of intent is a question for the trier of fact, even where the consequences of the insured\u2019s actions seem all but certain. <em>See, e.g., A-1 Sandblasting, </em>293 Or at 26 (\u2018The choice to paint the bridge by methods and under conditions expected to cause some compensable harm was intentional, as the insurer asserts, but it was not the kind of purposeful infliction of injury that excludes recovery of indemnity ***.\u2019); <em>Snyder, </em>278 Or at 415-16 (where the insured intentionally rammed the injured party\u2019s car, there was \u2018a permissible but not necessary inference to draw from [the insured\u2019s] actions and [therefore] a legitimate question of fact as to whether [the insured] intended the injuries and damage\u2019); <em>City of Burns v. Northwestern Mutual, </em>248 Or 364, 370-72, 434 P2d 465 (1967) (intent not inferred as a matter of law where the city moved the decedent\u2019s grave without securing his wife\u2019s consent as required by statute). Zidell\u2019s acts of disposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of toxic substances are more analogous to the latter cases than to those in which intent is inferred as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">\u201cWe are not persuaded that the <em>only </em>inference available to the trier of fact was that Zidell purposefully caused damage, or that Zidell engaged in acts so certain to cause harm that intent to injure must be inferred as a matter of law. We therefore reject London\u2019s second assignment of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>222 Or App at 478-80 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">London then petitioned for reconsideration of our opinion, including our treatment of the second assignment of error. We allowed the petition for reconsideration and, in a subsequent opinion, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cIn its petition for reconsideration, London submits that this court\u2019s analysis of whether the harm was expected <em>or </em>intended \u2018arguably conflates those two separate inquiries.\u2019 London acknowledges that, as a result of the court\u2019s independent basis for rejecting the assignment of error (different allocation of the burden of proof), the court may well adhere to its previous decision; \u2018[rjegardless, London is concerned that statements made by the Court after reaching the foregoing conclusion may lend themselves to further \u201cwrangling\u201d on remand.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cGiven our alternative and independent reason for rejecting London\u2019s assignment of error regarding its ORCP 54 B motion, and in the interest of avoiding any confusion on remand, we agree with London that our subsequent discussion of the evidence in the record was unnecessary and should be deleted. Accordingly, we modify our original opinion to delete the discussion of London\u2019s second assignment of error that begins with the sentence, \u2018In any event, we disagree with London\u2019s argument that the trial court was required, on the record before it, to conclude that the damage for which Zidell sought coverage was, as a matter of law, expected or intended.\u2019 <em>[ZRZ Realty </em>I,] 222 Or App at 478.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em>ZRZ Realty II, </em>225 Or App at 262-63 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Thus, after reconsideration, our resolution of London\u2019s second assignment of error rested on the fact that London erroneously had been assigned the burden of proof with regard to certain policies, and that the error infected Zidell\u2019s presentation of its <em>prima facie </em>case in a way that made it improper to conclude, as a matter of law, that Zidell had not carried its burden below. We did not distinguish, for purposes of addressing the second assignment of error, between the express fortuity policies (on which Zidell had the burden of proof) and implied fortuity policies (on which London had the burden); rather, we assumed that the trial court\u2019s error regarding the burden of proof required a retrial as to all policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed our allocation of the burden of proof on the express and implied fortuity policies, but concluded that our blanket remand was erroneous. The Supreme Court explained that, in the context of a bench trial, there was no reason why the court\u2019s retrial should not be limited, at least initially, to the express fortuity policies. <em>Id. </em>at 147. The court then remanded the case to this court and allowed the parties to ask us \u201cto consider, if appropriate, those assignments of error that the court did not reach because it remanded the case for a new trial on both the express and implied fortuity policies.\u201d Id. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On remand, London now asks us to address its second assignment of error. London concedes that the second assignment is not among those that this court \u201cdid not reach\u201d because of our broad remand; rather, London acknowledges that we rejected its second assignment but asks us to reconsider that holding in light of the more limited remand ordered by the Supreme Court. According to London, it was not unhappy with a retrial on all policies, as we held in <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>and therefore \u201cwas properly circumspect in its reconsideration request\u201d of the second assignment of error in <em>ZRZ Realty II. </em>But, London argues, \u201cthe Supreme Court has now decided that <em>there will be no retrial </em>on the implied fortuity policies. Accordingly, [the Court of Appeals] should decide whether, as a matter of law, Zidell expected the damage for which it seeks coverage under those [implied fortuity] policies.\u201d (Emphasis by London.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>We agree with London that, in light of <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>our treatment of its second assignment of error merits further consideration. The Supreme Court disagreed with one of the implicit premises of our holding as to the second assignment of error\u2014namely, that the erroneous allocation of the burden of proof on the express fortuity policies necessarily affected the trial of the \u201cunexpected and unintended\u201d damage issue under the implied fortuity policies. Our prior <em>reasoning\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cit would be improper to conclude on appeal that the trial court should have granted a motion regarding Zidell\u2019s failure to make the wrong <em>prima facie </em>case,\u201d 222 Or App at 478\u2014logically extends to those policies on which the court misallocated the burden of proof: the <em>express </em>fortuity policies. Accordingly, we elect to reconsider London\u2019s arguments that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the <em>implied </em>fortuity policies, on which the court correctly allocated the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">As for the merits of the second assignment, London argues that the evidence established, as a matter of law, that Zidell expected and intended the damage for which it sought coverage. We analyzed the question of \u201cintent\u201d at length in <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>but later withdrew that part of the opinion (ironically) to \u201cavoid [ ] confusion on remand.\u201d <em>ZRZ Realty II, </em>225 Or App at 262-63. Now that there will be no retrial as to the implied fortuity policies, we readopt our previous analysis concerning the evidence of \u201cintent,\u201d which is set out above, 255 Or App at 536-38 (quoting <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>222 Or App at 478-80), and again conclude that the record gives rise to competing inferences as to whether Zidell intended the damage for which it seeks coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Nor are we persuaded that the only inference available to the trier of fact was that Zidell \u201cexpected\u201d the damage for which it seeks coverage. The trial court ruled that a person \u201cexpects\u201d a result if the person \u201cact[s] with awareness that the result is substantially certain to follow.\u201d Suffice it to say that, viewing the record as a whole, a factfinder could draw competing inferences regarding Zidell\u2019s degree of awareness of damage to river sediment and groundwater that would result from its activities. The question was one for the trier of fact, and the court did not err in denying London\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>to dismiss the claims as a matter of law with regard to the implied fortuity policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">b. Third Assignment: Inconsistent Findings and Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In its third assignment of error, London argues that the trial court failed to enter a judgment consistent with its factual findings concerning post-1960 policies. Specifically, London argues that the trial court found as fact that Zidell (1) knew by 1956 that its operations were discharging paint chips into river sediments and (2) knew by 1961 that anti-fouling paint was \u201ctoxic to marine life.\u201d Yet, the court ultimately concluded that Zidell had coverage up until 1972 for damage to sediments and soil\u2014a legal conclusion that, according to London, is patently inconsistent with the court\u2019s other findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>we expressly declined to reach the third assignment of error. 222 Or App at 480. On remand, in light of <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>we now reach and reject London\u2019s third assignment of error on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Contrary to London\u2019s argument, the court\u2019s findings regarding the discharge of paint chips into sediment and the toxicity of anti-fouling paint to marine life are not irreconcilable with the court\u2019s ultimate finding that \u201cZidell management expected damage to sediments and soil from substances contained in anti-fouling paint beginning in 1972.\u201d The trial court distinguished toxicity to marine life\u2014 for instance, harm to barnacles that attach themselves to the hulls of ship\u2014from damage to the soil and river sediment from substances contained in that paint; it is the latter damage for which Zidell would be liable to DEQ for cleanup costs, and for which Zidell seeks coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Once again, the record created an issue for the trier of fact as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>what sediment and soil damage Zidell expected or intended, and the trial court\u2019s findings simply reflect the fact that it refused to draw certain inferences about Zidell\u2019s level of awareness of the damage for which it seeks coverage. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are not inconsistent with its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">c. Fourth Assignment: Expected Losses Under Bumbershoots</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In its fourth assignment of error, London argues that the trial court erred in ruling that bumbershoot policies for 1970 and 1971 covered <em>expected </em>losses, so long as those losses were <em>unintended.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That interpretation of the policies, London submits, was incorrect under federal maritime law and Oregon law, both of which limit coverage to losses that are unintended and unexpected.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>we addressed London\u2019s argument on its fourth assignment of error notwithstanding our remand for a new trial, because the interpretation of the policies \u201cpresent [ed] an issue likely to arise on remand.\u201d 222 Or App at 481. On the merits, we held that \u201cthe trial court did not err in declining to impose an implicit requirement that losses under the bumbershoot policies be unexpected as well as unintended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. However, in response to London\u2019s petition for reconsideration, we ultimately withdrew our conclusion regarding the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the bumbershoot policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cRather, we express no opinion on that issue, and, to the extent that the issue arises on remand, nothing in this opinion is intended to preclude London or Zidell from arguing about the legal effect of the trial court\u2019s earlier definition of\u2018expects\u2019 or \u2018intends,\u2019 or to preclude London from arguing that, in light of those definitions, the bumbershoots do not cover damages that Zidell knew were \u2018substantially certain\u2019 to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\"><em>ZRZ Realty II, </em>225 Or App at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Now, on remand from the Supreme Court, London asks us to address the issue that we reserved <em>inZRZRealty II: </em>whether the trial court ruled correctly that damage that was \u201cexpected but unintended\u201d was covered by the bumbershoot policies. We decline to revisit the fourth assignment of error, however, because our rejection of London\u2019s second and third assignments of error regarding the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions, coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that retrial should be limited to the express fortuity policies (which the bumbershoot policies are not), appear to obviate the need to resolve whether the bumbershoot policies cover \u201cexpected\u201d damage. The bumbershoot policies at issue cover 1970 and 1971.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that London had not proved that Zidell expected any of the damage for which it sought coverage until 1972\u2014after the coverage period for the bumbershoot policies. <em>See 255 </em>Or App at 541-42 (discussing London\u2019s third assignment of error). We therefore see no reason to further address whether the bumbershoot policies were impliedly limited to \u201cexpected\u201d damages, because Zidell would nevertheless have coverage under those policies in light of the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions, which this court and the Supreme Court have affirmed as they pertain to the implied fortuity policies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not revisit the merits of London\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">2. <em>Zidell\u2019s Assignments of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">a. First Assignment: Allocation</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In its first assignment of error on cross-appeal, Zidell argues that the trial court erred in adopting a \u201cstraight-time-on-the-risk\u201d approach to allocating indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>costs, rather than the \u201call sums\u201d approach that Zidell had urged. Zidell argues that, shortly after the notice of appeal was filed, the legislature in 2003 adopted the \u201call sums\u201d rule in amendments to the Cleanup Assistance Act, ORS 465.480(3)(a)\u2014a legislative change that applies to claims arising before or after the effective date of the amendments unless \u201ca final judgment, after exhaustion of all appeals, was entered before [July 1, 2004].\u201d Or Laws 2003, ch 799, \u00a7\u00a7 5(1), (2). Moreover, Zidell argues that the trial court\u2019s approach is inconsistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cascade Corp. v. American Home Assurance </em>Co., 206 Or App 1, 135 P3d 450 (2006), <em>rev dismissed, </em>342 Or 645 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>we declined to reach the assignment concerning allocation because the trial court on remand would have an opportunity to reconsider the allocation question in light of subsequent changes to the law and was in the best position to pass upon the question in the first instance. We adhere to that conclusion on remand. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>\u201cif the trial court reaches a different conclusion on remand as to when Zidell expected or intended property damage for the purposes of the express fortuity policies, then the court also will presumably have to adjust the findings allocating responsibility for remediating the damage between London and Zidell.\u201d 349 Or at 148. And, even assuming that the trial court were to make the same findings on remand as it did initially, we do not understand the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion or this court\u2019s opinion to preclude the trial court from reconsidering the allocation question in light of amendments to the Cleanup Assistance Act or <em>Cascade </em>Corp.\u2014an issue that neither this court nor the Supreme Court addressed on appeal. <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>349 Or at 148 (\u201cIf, on either the existing or a supplemented record, the trial court makes the same findings on remand that the trial court did initially, then it <em>presumably </em>can reenter the judgment, with any appropriate adjustment for attorney fees.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). Because we conclude that, in light of the statutory changes and developments in case law, any review of this issue would benefit from a better-developed record below, we decline to address Zidell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>first assignment of error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court can address Zidell\u2019s argument on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">b. Second Assignment: Ship Dismantling Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In its second assignment, Zidell argues that the trial court erred in ruling that certain ship dismantling policies do not require London to pay defense costs. The policy language at issue provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201c3. It is further agreed that if by reason of interest in the Vessel [Zidell] shall become liable to pay and shall pay any sum or sums in respect of any liability, claim, demand, damages, and/or expenses arising from or occasioned by * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cLoss of or damage to any harbour, dock (graving or otherwise), slipway, way, gridiron, pontoon, pier, quay, jetty, stage, buoy, telegraph cable or other fixed or moveable thing whatsoever, or to any goods or property in or on the same howsoever caused:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201c[London] will pay [Zidell] such proportion of such sum or sums paid, or which may be required to indemnify [Zidell] for such loss, as their respective subscriptions bear to the insured value of the Vessel hereby insured, provided always that the liability under this clause, together with any liability there may be under Clause 4, in respect of any one accident or series of accidents arising out of the same event, shall be limited to the sum hereby insured, but when the liability of [Zidell] has been contested with the consent in writing of [London], [London] will also pay a like proportion of the costs which [Zidell] shall thereby incur or be compelled to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201c4. This insurance also to pay the expenses, after deduction of the proceeds of the salvage, not recoverable under Clause 3, of the removal of the wreck of the insured Vessel from any place owned, leased or occupied by [Zidell]. [London\u2019s] liability under this clause is subject to the limitations in amount provided in Clause 3. The provisions of that clause regarding the payment of legal costs shall also apply hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In the trial court, Zidell argued that, although \u201c[t]he ship dismantling policies do not provide for a duty to defend separate from policy limits, as in traditional [comprehensive general liability] coverage,\u201d the policy language nevertheless requires London to pay Zidell\u2019s defense costs up to the policy limits. In response, London argued that, under the final sentence of Clause 3, defense costs are recoverable only when liability \u201chas been contested with the consent in writing of [London]\u201d\u2014a condition that Zidell failed to satisfy. In a reply memorandum, Zidell addressed London\u2019s objection \u201cto paying defense costs under the ship dismantling policies based on a condition that Zidell\u2019s liability must be \u2018contested with the consent in writing of [London],\u201d\u2019 but Zidell did not argue that the \u201ccontested with consent\u201d language was inapplicable to defense costs up to policy limits. Rather, Zidell argued that the condition should not preclude recovery because (1) despite entering into a consent decree with DEQ, Zidell was contesting liability; and (2) the failure to obtain London\u2019s consent was excused or waived by London\u2019s disclaimer of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The trial court agreed with London\u2019s interpretation of the policy language and rejected Zidell\u2019s reply. The trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cThe policies have valid and fair conditions that must be met prior to payment of any defense costs. There has to be contested liability, and it has to be with the written consent of the insurer. These are not regular duty to defend policies. This is a choice that can be decided by the insurer. The language is neither vague nor ambiguous. [London] may choose to defend or not to defend. Here the London Underwriters subscribing to the ship dismantling policies did not choose to defend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">On appeal, Zidell argues that the trial court erred in relying on the final sentence of Clause 3, suggesting, for the first time, that the \u201ccontest with consent\u201d language is \u201cdirected to a specific type of situation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\u201cIt can happen that a claim is brought against a policyholder and that for economic or other reasons London would prefer to simply pay the claim rather than incur the costs of defending against it. What the clause in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>provides is that, in such a circumstance, if the policyholder still wants to contest its liability, then London will pay the associated costs of defense only if London agrees to do so. In other words, the trial court is correct that London \u2018may choose to defend or not to defend,\u2019 but only (contrary to the trial court) in the special circumstance where London wants to pay the claim and the policyholder wants instead to defend against it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><em>In ZRZ Realty I, we </em>stated that \u201c[t] he argument that Zidell makes on appeal is different from the argument made to the trial court, and given that the case must be remanded for a new trial on both claims, we decline to address that argument for the first time on appeal.\u201d 222 Or App at 496. Now, in light of the more limited remand ordered in <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>Zidell asks us to decide its second assignment of error on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Although Zidell\u2019s specific argument has morphed on appeal\u2014a factor that, in light of our broad remand, counseled against offering any opinion on the issue in <em>ZRZ Realty </em>I\u2014we are nonetheless persuaded that the parties and the trial court were adequately alerted to the issue of contractual interpretation that Zidell now raises, namely, whether the language in Clause 3 establishes an obligation to pay defense costs up to policy limits. For that reason, we agree with Zidell that, notwithstanding the evolution of its reasoning, preservation principles are not an impediment to our review. <em>See State v. Haugen, </em>349 Or 174, 190, 243 P3d 31 (2010) (\u201cA party ordinarily may preserve an issue for review merely by raising an issue at trial; alternatively (and preferably), a party may preserve an issue by raising the issue, identifying a source for the party\u2019s position, and advancing a particular argument.\u201d (Citing <em>State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183, 188, 766 P2d 373 (1988))). We therefore turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Even in light of Zidell\u2019s newly proffered interpretation, we agree with the trial court that the language of Clause 3 \u201cis neither vague nor ambiguous.\u201d Under Clause 3, if Zidell \u201cshall become liable to pay and shall pay any sum or sums in respect of any liability, claim, demand, damages, and/or expenses arising from or occasioned by *** [l]oss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>or damage to any [itemized thing],\u201d then London \u201cwill pay * * * such proportion of sum or sums so paid, or which may be required to indemnify [Zidell] for such loss[.]\u201d Clause 3 continues by stating that any liability under Clauses 3 and 4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cin respect of any one accident or series of accidents arising out of the same event, shall be limited to the sum hereby insured, <em>but when the liability of the Assured has been contested with the consent in writing of the Underwriters, the Underwriters will also pay a like proportion of the costs which the Assured shall thereby incur or be compelled to pay\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Read in isolation, the \u201cwill also pa/\u2019 language could mean, as Zidell contends, that \u201ccosts\u201d are a subset of other covered liabilities in Clause 3, and that, when liability is contested with London\u2019s consent, London will pay those costs without regard to otherwise applicable policy limits. In context, however, it is evident that \u201ccosts\u201d incurred to contest liability are separate from \u201cexpenses.\u201d Clause 4, which is set out above, distinguishes between \u201cexpenses * * * not recoverable under Clause 3\u201d and \u201cpayment of legal costs\u201d under Clause 3. Clause 1 of the policy is similarly worded, distinguishing between liability as a consequence of collision, which London will pay based on a proportionate formula, and \u201ccases in which the liability of the Vessel has been contested, or proceedings have been taken to limit liability with the consent in writing of the Underwriters\u201d; in the latter case, London \u201cwill also pay a like proportion of the costs which the Assured shall thereby incur or be compelled to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Zidell\u2019s explanation\u2014that the \u201cwill also pa/\u2019 language applies only in circumstances in which London prefers to pay the claim but the policyholder wants to defend\u2014 would impose an implausible limitation on the language of the policy. As London points out, it is difficult to conceive of a reason why London would want to pay the claim <em>without </em>incurring defense costs but would nevertheless consent to pay them. Given the parties\u2019 respective commercial interests, the only plausible interpretation of the policy is the one that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the trial court applied: London will pay Zidell\u2019s defense costs \u201cwhen the liability of [Zidell] has been contested with the consent in writing of the Underwriters.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Alternatively, Zidell argues that \u201cLondon should be held to have waived its right to rely on the \u2018consent provision\u2019\u201d because \u201can insurer should not be able to rely on such a right while at the same time denying that it owes its policyholder any policy obligation whatsoever.\u201d We are not persuaded, however, that London\u2019s position on coverage somehow operates as a waiver of its contractual rights concerning defense costs, and we reject the alternative argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that Zidell failed to satisfy the unambiguous predicate for coverage of defense costs under the ship dismantling policies. Accordingly, we reject Zidell\u2019s second assignment of error on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">B. <em>Attorney Fee Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">All of the parties\u2019 remaining assignments of error concern the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding attorney fees. Because some of those assignments involve overlapping issues, we have grouped them by subject matter rather than by assignment of error. We review the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding Zidell\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees for errors of law, and its determinations regarding a reasonable amount of such an award for an abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Barber v. Green, </em>248 Or App 404, 273 P3d 294 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>1. <em>Recovery of Attorney Fees Related to Indemnity Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In its eighth assignment, London argues that Zidell\u2019s attorney fee recovery under ORS 742.061 should have been limited to those attorney fees that Zidell incurred in establishing London\u2019s duty to defend under the insurance policies. Instead, London argues, the trial court permitted Zidell to recover attorney fees for work that its attorneys performed to \u201cobtain a declaration of coverage for events that may or may not occur\u201d\u2014that is, on the prospective indemnity issue. <em>See McGraw v. Gwinner, </em>282 Or 393, 400, 578 P2d 1250 (1978) (an insured must obtain a money judgment against an insurer to recover attorney fees under statutory predecessor of ORS 742.061; obtaining a declaration of future coverage does not, by itself, trigger the right to attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Zidell\u2019s response is twofold. At one point Zidell contends, without much elaboration, that \u201cthe trial court did not award any attorney fees for work done specifically with regard to London\u2019s duty to indemnify.\u201d The trial court record suggests otherwise. At a hearing on entitlement to attorney fees, Zidell took the position that \u201cwe are entitled to all costs for this court proceeding to date and continuing,\u201d but conceded that it might not be able to recover for work performed on certain tort claims it brought against London. The court ruled that Zidell was entitled to attorney fees \u201cfor the defense cost portion of the case\u201d from the tender of the DEQ action in July 1994 until the date of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on the duty to defend (July 23, 1999). The court then took up \u201cthe question of what about the attorney fees <em>on the declaratory judgment action up until that same time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Citing <em>McGraw, </em>London argued that the declaratory judgment claim involved both indemnity and duty-to-defend issues, and that, as to the indemnity issues, Zidell had not obtained a money judgment that would entitle it to attorney fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After exploring that issue with the parties, the court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Here\u2019s [the] bottom line and here\u2019s the starting point: London will pay attorney fees up until my decision about defense costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">\u201c[ZIDELL]: For what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201c[LONDON]: About the duty to defend or beyond that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Attorney fees with the exception of [certain previously described exclusions regarding tort claims] ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Later, the court adhered to that ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t care if [Zidell] lost it or not. If they have an issue on the summary judgment dealing with the declaratory judgment action, they get it whether they won it or lost it because they are still the prevailing party, if we want to define it that way, at least on defense costs. And at least on the limited guidance of <em>[Cornell, Howland, Hayes &amp; M., Inc. v. Continental Cas. </em>Co., 465 F2d 22 (9th Cir 1972)], I\u2019m going to say they get their declaratory judgment costs up until that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">As a consequence, Zidell\u2019s statement of attorney fees and the court\u2019s ultimate award included time spent on the declaratory judgment action prior to July 23,1999, without regard to whether that time was spent on matters concerning the duty to defend or the duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we reject Zidell\u2019s suggestion that the attorney fee award does not include time spent specifically on indemnification issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Zidell\u2019s second response\u2014and the bulk of its argument\u2014is that ORS 742.061 \u201cshould be interpreted broadly\u201d to include attorney fees regarding the indemnification issues. In fact, Zidell argues that, under ORS 742.061, it is entitled to an award of attorney fees for time spent on those declaratory judgment issues <em>after </em>the court\u2019s summary judgment ruling\u2014fees that the trial court declined to award and that are the subject of Zidell\u2019s fourth assignment of error on cross-appeal. The crux of Zidell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>contention, both in response to London\u2019s assignment of error and in support of its own assignment on cross-appeal, is that, once an insured obtains recovery that exceeds the insurer\u2019s tender, ORS 742.061 entitles the insured to recover all of its attorney fees incurred in litigating the policy, including coverage issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The Supreme Court, it turns out, has already considered and rejected the same argument\u2014in the context of Zidell\u2019s petition for attorney fees in that court. In <em>ZRZ Realty V, </em>the court explained that Zidell was not entitled to appellate attorney fees for work related to the duty to indemnify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cZidell advances a second argument that it raised in the trial court (and the trial court rejected) and that it cross-assigned as error in the Court of Appeals (and the Court of Appeals did not reach). Zidell reasons that, if it recovers more than London tendered on one matter (the duty to defend), then ORS 742.061 permits it to recover the fees that it incurred both on that matter and also on other, separate matters. That is true, Zidell reasons, even though it has no independent right to recover fees under ORS 742.061 for those matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cZidell cites one case in support of its argument, <em>Hartford v. Aetna/Mt. Hood Radio, </em>270 Or 226, 527 P2d 406 (1974). In that case, the insurer brought a declaratory judgment action to determine its responsibility for a loss (damage to the insured\u2019s property), and the insured counterclaimed for monetary damages for failure to pay the full amount of the loss. <em>Id. </em>at 228, 235-37. This court held on the declaratory judgment claim that the insurer was responsible for the loss and on the counterclaim that the insurer owed more than it had tendered. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 237. This court also awarded the insured fees. <em>Id. </em>at 236. As the court later explained in <em>McGraw, </em>because the insured in <em>Hartford </em>had recovered more on its counterclaim than the insurer had tendered, the insured could recover the attorney fees it incurred both in responding to the insurer\u2019s declaratory judgment action and in pursuing the counterclaim. <em>See McGraw, </em>282 Or at 399-400 (explaining <em>Hartford).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cThe decision in <em>Hartford </em>does not advance Zidell\u2019s argument in this case. In <em>Hartford, </em>both the insurer\u2019s declaratory judgment claim and the insured\u2019s counterclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>involved the same issue\u2014the insured\u2019s obligation to pay the insured for damage to its property. Unlike this case, that decision did not involve a situation in which the insured had established a right to recover fees on one matter (the duty to defend) but had not established a right to recover fees on another, separate matter (the duty to indemnify). There may be cases in which the issues are sufficiently related that an entitlement to fees on one issue will warrant awarding fees for work on related issues. This is not one of those cases, however. As we explained in our previous decision, the matter on which Zidell seeks fees (the duty to indemnify) is independent of the matter on which it is entitled to recover fees (the duty to defend). In these circumstances, we agree with the trial court that, at this stage of the litigation, Zidell may recover only those fees that are related to the duty to defend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><em>ZRZ Realty V, </em>351 Or at 266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In light of the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>ZRZ Realty V, </em>we conclude that Zidell cannot recover attorney fees for work on the duty to indemnify, because it has not yet shown an independent entitlement to attorney fees on that matter. <em>Id. </em>at 267. Thus, the trial court correctly declined to award Zidell attorney fees for post-summary judgment work on the duty to indemnify, but the trial court erred in not imposing that same limitation on recovery for work performed before its summary judgment ruling. That is, Zidell has not established an independent right to recover attorney fees related to the duty to indemnify, which, at this stage of the litigation, precludes recovery under ORS 742.061 for work performed before or after July 23, 1999. We therefore remand with respect to the initial attorney fee award, which was included in the general judgment, for the trial court to reconsider the apportionment and award of attorney fees in light of that error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">2. <em>Attorney Fee Rates</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In its ninth assignment of error, London argues that Zidell received a windfall because the court awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>attorney fees in an amount that exceeds what Zidell is obligated to pay under its fee agreement. Specifically, London asserts that Zidell agreed to pay its attorneys based on a fixed hourly rate plus a percentage of any net recovery arising out of claims against third parties. Yet, when Zidell sought attorney fees, it urged the trial court to award fees in an amount equal to the market rates that its attorneys might have billed rather than the rates they had actually billed Zidell. That higher rate was justified, according to Zidell, because the contingent fees had not been calculated or paid to Zidell\u2019s attorneys. In London\u2019s view, the court\u2019s award at that higher rate gave \u201cZidell a recovery far greater than the amount Zidell agreed to compensate its attorneys. There is no evidence that Zidell will be required to pay its attorneys the difference.\u201d <em>See Associated Oregon Veterans v. DVA, </em>308 Or 476, 481, 782 P2d 418 (1989) (holding, under a provision of a contract awarding a \u201creasonable fee,\u201d that the prevailing party was \u201cnot entitled to more than it spent on attorney fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Suffice it to say that, under the circumstances of this case, we are not persuaded that the trial court awarded an amount that exceeds Zidell\u2019s obligation to its attorneys or that the court abused its discretion or somehow committed an error of law in determining a reasonable rate for the work performed by Zidell\u2019s attorneys. The lodestar method that the trial court used is a commonly applied and permissible approach for determining the reasonableness of a fee award, even when the insured has retained counsel on a contingency-fee basis. <em>See, e.g., Strawn v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439 (2013) (observing, in the context of a contingency-fee recovery by an insured, that \u201ctwo basic methods of calculation are generally available. One is the so-called \u2018lodestar\u2019 method, by which the attorney is awarded a fee based on a reasonable hourly rate, multiplied by a reasonable number of hours devoted to work on the case, with certain adjustments potentially made to that amount for factors such as the risk of loss and the quality of the attorney\u2019s work\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 221 n 7 (concluding that ORS 20.075, \u201calthough not mandating either a lodestar or percent-of-fund methodology, does not foreclose either\u201d); <em>see also Strawn v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>233 Or App 401, 416, 226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>P3d 86 (2010) (\u201c[A]n award of\u2018reasonable\u2019 attorney fees does not preclude the use of a multiplier or other fee enhancement * * *. Such an enhancement may be applied at the beginning of the calculation process by increasing counsel\u2019s standard or basic hourly rate to a \u2018reasonable hourly rate\u2019 for the work done given the nature of the case * * * or the enhancement may be applied later in the calculation process by increasing a lodestar amount of fees * * *.\u201d). We reject London\u2019s ninth assignment regarding attorney fee rates without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">3. <em>London\u2019s Credit for Amounts Paid by Settling Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">By the time that attorney fee issues were litigated, the London insurers were the last adverse parties still litigating against Zidell. In response to Zidell\u2019s statement of attorney fees, London argued that, because various insurers shared the obligation to defend Zidell and then settled with Zidell during the course of litigation, some of the money recovered from those settling insurers should be allocated to attorney fees, thereby reducing the amount of attorney fees that Zidell could recover from London. The trial court agreed with London, and the parties then stipulated to the amount of a credit, reserving the right to appeal the court\u2019s earlier ruling. The trial court\u2019s order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cWith respect to [London\u2019s] objection that [the London defendants] are entitled to a credit to be set off against their statutory liability for [Zidell\u2019s] attorney fees due to settlements reached by [Zidell] with other defendants prior to the filing of [Zidell\u2019s] Statement, this Court holds that the [London defendants] are entitled to some credit, but has not determined the amount in view of the stipulation [as to the amount to be awarded to Zidell as attorney fees, in light of the court\u2019s various rulings].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Zidell now argues on cross-appeal, as it did below, that London is \u201cfully responsible for Zidell\u2019s reasonable attorney fees\u201d and that a set off for fees incurred by settling defendants \u201cconflicts with both the language and the legislative purposes of the attorney fees statute, ORS 742.061.\u201d London responds that, unless there is some settlement credit, Zidell\u2019s approach would yield a windfall as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>opposed to a \u201creasonable amount\u201d of attorney fees under ORS 742.061. Both sides are correct, to a point.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">At the same time that this case was moving through the appellate courts, London was litigating an equitable contribution action against some of the settling insurers. <em>See Certain Underwriters v. Mass. Bonding and Ins. Co., </em>235 Or App 99, 104-06, 230 P3d 103 (2010), <em>modified on recons, </em>245 Or App 101, 260 P3d 830 (2011) (describing parallel courses of underlying coverage case and contribution case). One of the issues in the contribution action was whether London and the settling insurers owed a common obligation to Zidell under ORS 742.061, thereby making it inequitable for those settling insurers to escape liability for attorney fees. In the course of addressing that issue, we explained that liability for attorney fees under ORS 742.061 is different from the duty to defend: \u201cUnlike the duty to defend, which is a shared obligation that arises independent of completed litigation, liability for attorney fees under ORS 742.061 is a statutory obligation that arises only after the insured prevails at trial.\u201d 245 Or App at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">That observation concerning ORS 742.061 informs our analysis here as well. Under the statute, Zidell is entitled to attorney fees from London because its recovery exceeded London\u2019s highest tender\u2014a separate obligation from whatever duties might have been owed to Zidell by the settling insurers. For that reason, we agree with Zidell that, strictly speaking, London is not entitled to a particular credit for amounts that Zidell might have received as settlements from other insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">That said, we agree with London that ORS 742.061 requires that any attorney fee recovery be reasonable. <em>See Strawn, </em>353 Or at 217 (stating that, for purposes of ORS 742.061, \u201cthe touchstone for the amount of the award is * * * reasonableness\u201d). In determining the reasonableness of a fee, the trial court shall consider \u201c[s]uch other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case.\u201d ORS 20.075(l)(h), (2). In the particular circumstances of this case, the potential for a windfall\u2014that is, double payment of the same attorney fees\u2014is a factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>that the court can consider in setting a reasonable attorney fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">As previously noted, the parties stipulated, in light of the court\u2019s prior rulings, to an amount of attorney fees. Because we have remanded the attorney fee award for further consideration in light of the erroneous inclusion of fees related to the duty to indemnify (London\u2019s eighth assignment of error), the parties will have an opportunity to revisit their stipulated amount, which also included some credit for the settling insurers, and the trial court will have an opportunity to consider the reasonableness of the new attorney fee award in light of any potential windfall to Zidell.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">4. <em>Recovery for Time Spent Correcting Billing Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In its tenth assignment of error, London contends that the trial court erred in awarding Zidell attorney fees \u201cfor time its attorneys spent correcting their improper billing statements.\u201d Zidell\u2019s attorneys \u201cblock billed\u201d their time; they failed to allocate time between work devoted to particular defendant insurers or to particular tasks. Consequently, London argues, Zidell was required to review painstakingly those billing statements and recreate a division of labor before submitting its attorney fee petition. The problem, according to London, is that it bore the brunt of the block-billing mistake by Zidell\u2019s attorneys, because Zidell later sought and was awarded, by way of a supplemental judgment, attorney fees for the time spent preparing the initial petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Zidell, for its part, argues that we should not second guess the trial court\u2019s determination of what was reasonable regarding the preparation of the attorney fee petition, which took into account a number of factors. We agree with Zidell. The trial court, in its findings and conclusions regarding the supplemental fee request, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\u201c[London\u2019s objections] to plaintiff\u2019s Initial Statement were aggressively pursued and, in response, aggressively resisted. The contentiousness of the attorney fee issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>and their complexity required [Zidell\u2019s] use of a number of attorneys and paralegal staff</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cIn reaching its decision on the Supplemental Statement, the court considered the factors set forth in ORS 20.075, and, in particular, considered the extensive time and labor required in connection with the Initial Statement, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved in the attorney fee issue under these circumstances, the skill required of the attorneys preparing and presenting the Initial Statement, the amount involved and results obtained, the length of the attorneys\u2019 professional relationship with the client considering when the underlying claims were first initiated, the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys involved, and the nature of the fee relationship between [Zidell and its] attorneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In applying those factors and reaching the conclusion that it did, the trial court implicitly rejected London\u2019s argument that Zidell\u2019s block billings inflated the amount of fees reasonably and necessarily incurred in preparing the petition. There is evidence in the record to support that implicit determination, particularly concerning the complexity of this case, and, specifically, the attorney fee process. As Zidell points out, the trial court, in January 2002, conducted two days of hearings on issues related to entitlement to attorney fees, and made various rulings as to what was, and was not, recoverable. Zidell was required to conform its attorney fee request under ORCP 68 to those rulings, which, the trial court found, caused difficulty \u201csorting out what issues and related work were appropriate for an award of fees.\u201d In short, even if block billing complicated the efforts of Zidell\u2019s attorneys, we cannot say that the trial court, in light of all the factors it considered, abused its discretion in awarding Zidell $268,988.15 in supplemental attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">To summarize: We now reject London\u2019s second and third assignments of error as they pertain to the implied fortuity policies. We decline to revisit London\u2019s fourth assignment of error regarding the bumbershoot policies because, in the current posture, a decision as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>those policies cover \u201cexpected but unintended\u201d damage would have no effect on the rights of the parties. We also decline to reach Zidell\u2019s first assignment of error on cross-appeal, because the questions posed by that assignment would benefit from a better-developed record on remand. We reject on the merits Zidell\u2019s second assignment of error on cross-appeal, which concerns defense costs under ship dismantling policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">As for attorney fees, we conclude, based on London\u2019s eighth assignment of error, that the initial attorney fee award in the judgment must be remanded because it includes fees for work performed concerning the duty to indemnify, a matter on which Zidell was not entitled to fees. On remand, the trial court also can consider, in setting a reasonable attorney fee award, the amounts that Zidell received for attorney fees from settling insurers; but, as Zidell correctly argued in its fifth assignment of error on cross-appeal, London is not necessarily entitled to a set off for those amounts. We reject London\u2019s ninth assignment of error regarding the billing rates used to calculate a reasonable fee award. And, finally, we reject London\u2019s tenth assignment of error\u2014its challenge to the supplemental award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On appeal and on cross-appeal, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> \u201cThe trial court found that, in addition to the pre-1966 comprehensive general liability policies, London issued protection and indemnity policies from 1957 through 1983 and bumbershoot policies from 1970 through 1977, none of which required that property damage be unexpected and unintended. The court read a fortuity requirement into those policies, as well as into the pre-1966 comprehensive general liability policies.\u201d <em>ZRZ Realty III, </em>349 Or at 124 n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-9\"> London also raises assignments of error concerning attorney fees, which we discuss separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> To be clear, our deletion continued to the end of our discussion of the second assignment of error at <em>ZRZ Realty I, </em>222 Or App at 480.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> In stating its legal conclusions, the court explained that knowledge about harm to human or marine life was only part of the relevant inquiry for finding expected damage to river sediments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cThe following is the standard for finding expected damage to river sediments: First, that the substance gets on the water.

Courts, as far as we can tell, have treated similar \u201cwill also pay\u201d language in marine insurance policies as creating an entitlement to defense costs that is distinct from the indemnity obligation. <em>E.g., Gulf Mississippi Marine Corp. v.
