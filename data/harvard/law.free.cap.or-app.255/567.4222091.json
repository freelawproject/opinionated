J.</author>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In this juvenile dependency case, mother and father separately appeal from a judgment of the juvenile court changing the permanency plan for their child, C, from reunification to adoption. ORS 419B.476. The juvenile court determined that the Department of Human Services (DHS) had made reasonable efforts to reunify C with parents and that parents had not made sufficient progress to make it possible for C to safely return home and would not do so within a reasonable time. We conclude that there is adequate support in the record for the findings made by the juvenile court and that those findings provide a basis for its legal determinations. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We decline to conduct <em>de novo </em>review; indeed, the parties have not requested that we do so and this is not an exceptional case that warrants such review. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b) (providing for discretionary <em>de novo </em>review of certain equitable actions); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (the court will exercise discretion to try the cause anew on the record only in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d). Accordingly, our task is to review the facts found by the juvenile court to determine whether they are supported by any evidence and whether, as a matter of law, those facts provided a basis for the court\u2019s determinations. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. T. R., </em>251 Or App 6, 10, 282 P3d 969, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 564 (2012). We begin by addressing how DHS became involved in the case and then address the services that were provided to parents and their response to those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">DHS took C into protective custody in September 2010 when she was three months old, after parents brought her to an emergency room for colic, and a doctor discovered that she had sustained two posterior rib factures. Parents denied any knowledge of how the fractures occurred, although mother suggested that perhaps she had put C into a swing \u201ctoo hard.\u201d Following a contested jurisdictional hearing in January 2011, the court asserted jurisdiction on the following bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201ca) [C], age three months, has two posterior rib fractures in various stages of healing that are the result of non-accidental trauma. Parents are not able or willing to provide an explanation for these injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201cb) Parents exhibit cognitive deficiencies that inhibit their ability to understand the seriousness of the trauma their child has experienced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The following month, at the request of DHS, Dr. Ewell, a clinical psychologist, evaluated both parents. He diagnosed mother with an adjustment disorder and mixed anxiety and depressed mood, along with cognitive limitations and dependent personality features secondary to cognitive deficits. Ewell noted that mother \u201cdemonstrates specific deficits in areas pertaining to social judgment, interpersonal problem-solving and abstract reasoning.\u201d Mother reported experiencing significant depression and anxiety that had become \u201cnearly disabling.\u201d Ewell noted that mother was \u201chighly dependent upon relationships with other people\u201d and particularly dependent upon both father and her own father, who manages her finances and serves as her payee for Social Security benefits that she receives for a learning disorder. Overall, given mother\u2019s limited cognitive abilities, Ewell opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201c[mother] could benefit from parenting course work, but will require individualized instruction. It will be necessary for her to be coached and supported as she attempts to acquire skills and apply them to her own life. In-home parenting coaches would be very beneficial to her. She will also require help in organizing her daily schedule, completing basic chores and managing daily life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Ewell diagnosed father with cognitive limitations and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in partial remission. Ewell observed that father</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201cmost likely has difficulty understanding complicated scenarios, or abstract reasoning processes. There is also evidence that he experiences difficulty understanding concepts presented in parenting classes. It is likely he will also have difficulty applying what he has learned to his real life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Ewell opined that, as in mother\u2019s case, father would benefit from individualized forms of instruction. He further concluded that father</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201cwill best learn from course work that is skill-based and behaviorally oriented. He will need to observe role models <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>of appropriate parenting and then practice those skills while receiving feedback. Even then, he may have difficulty applying what he learns to his own life. [Father] could probably also benefit from some individual counseling to address his PTSD. * * * [Father\u2019s] ability to problem-solve and to follow through with a plan to keep his child safe is limited. At present, I would have concerns regarding his capacity to be a safe resource for his daughter. His future treatment/education providers will be in the best position to signal if he ever acquires the basic skills to demonstrate such an ability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Ewell noted that mother and father \u201cmight also benefit from couples counseling to address their communication patterns, joint problem-solving and co-parenting strategies.\u201d However, he concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201c[e]ven with course work, I believe the prognosis for [mother and father] becoming minimally adequate parents is guarded. I would not consider this to be a case where [DHS] can intervene, provide services and then successfully close the case. Instead, I believe [mother and father] will most likely require intervention throughout the foreseeable future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">About a week after the psychological evaluations, DHS began facilitating extended visits between C and mother and father. Home care nurse Fulmerton, who had been following C since shortly after C\u2019s birth, participated in those visits in order to \u201chelp[ ] the parents to engage more actively\u201d with C. Fulmerton made a home visit to assess the home environment in April and worked with both parents on their parenting skills until mid-June. Both parents were also provided with intensive parenting classes and a parenting coach for DHS office visits, and mother was provided with mental health services to address stress management techniques and strategies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record does not indicate that mother and father received the other services that Ewell had recommended\u2014that is, couples counseling and individualized treatment for father\u2019s PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>In addition to the instructional assistance provided by Fulmerton, in-home parenting mentor Wafer facilitated home visits from August to October and planned for <em>\u201ca </em>five to six hour time frame at various times during the day to assess parenting skills.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beginning in November and continuing until the March 2012 permanency hearing, DHS caseworker Price facilitated visits at the DHS office once per week for two hours at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">At the permanency hearing in March 2012, DHS argued that it had made reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the bases for the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and that, despite the services provided, mother and father had failed to make sufficient progress. Both parents countered that DHS\u2019s efforts were not reasonable and that they had nevertheless made sufficient progress. Mother characterized Wafer\u2019s services as too short in duration and as not being <em>\u201ca </em>real intensive type thing where they did in-home type of planning\u201d as suggested by Ewell.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The juvenile court determined that the efforts made by DHS were reasonable and that mother and father had not made sufficient progress for C to safely return home. The court noted that both parents\u2019 \u201ccognitive deficiencies * * * create all kinds of issues for [them] and their care of [C].\u201d The court explained that it had \u201creal concern * * * about [parents\u2019] ability to repair, or to deal with these cognitive issues\u201d and that \u201cit appears that [DHS] has given a great deal of time and consideration and programming to this case.\u201d Despite the services that were provided, the court noted a number of instances in which parents demonstrated that they did not have the cognitive ability to protect C. The court recounted, by way of example, an incident in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>mother had become so distracted by dealing with kitty litter arid caring for the cats that she failed to notice C beginning to eat dog food, and another instance in which parents had great difficulty extracting a crayon that C had put in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The court determined that there was \u201cno evidence of any progress regarding * * * the cognitive deficiency, nor any indication that there is likely to be any change in that in the future.\u201d It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cCognitive issues are * * * difficult * * * to deal with when it\u2019s unclear that * * * those can be remedied in any short term fashion. In this case I am finding that reasonable efforts have been made, finding that there hasn\u2019t been progress, nor in the foreseeable future that there would be progress made such that this child could be returned home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The court acknowledged that \u201cthese parents love this child, and that this child is delighted at their presence\u201d but, in accordance with its determinations, changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">On appeal, parents challenge the juvenile court\u2019s determinations that DHS made reasonable efforts to reunify the family and that parents did not make sufficient progress to allow for C to safely return home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They also argue that the court erred in determining that further services would not make possible C\u2019s safe return within a reasonable time. DHS responds that the record supports the court\u2019s determination as to reasonable efforts and the lack of sufficient progress, and argues that it was not required to prove that parents\u2019 progress demonstrated that further services would not enable C\u2019s safe return within a reasonable time. We conclude that the facts found by the juvenile court are supported by the record and provided an adequate legal basis for each of its determinations, including the determination that further services would not enable C\u2019s safe return within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ORS 419B.476(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-3\">\u201cIf the case plan at the time of the hearing is to reunify the family, [the juvenile court must] determine whether [DHS] has made reasonable efforts * * * to make it possible for the ward to safely return home and whether the parent has made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making its determination, the court shall consider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Accordingly, in order to change the permanency plan, the juvenile court must determine that (1) DHS has made reasonable efforts to make it possible for the child to safely return home and (2) despite those efforts, parents have not made sufficient progress to allow the child to safely return home. \u201cThe particular circumstances of each case dictate the type and sufficiency of efforts that the state is required to make and whether the types of actions it has required parents to take are reasonable.\u201d <em>T R., </em>251 Or App at 13. We address each of those required determinations in turn, beginning with the determination that DHS made reasonable efforts to make it possible for C to safely return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Parents\u2019 challenges to the adequacy of DHS\u2019s efforts reduce to two basic arguments: that the services DHS provided were not sufficiently related to the bases for the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that the services provided did not sufficiently follow Ewell\u2019s recommendations. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">To reiterate, the juvenile court asserted jurisdiction on the following bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201ca) [C], age three months, has two posterior rib fractures in various stages of healing that are the result of non-accidental trauma. Parents are not able or willing to provide an explanation for these injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201cb) Parents exhibit cognitive deficiencies that inhibit their ability to understand the seriousness of the trauma their child has experienced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The primary concern throughout this case has been that parents, because of their cognitive deficiencies, are unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to recognize or acknowledge threats to C\u2019s safety. In view of that concern, DHS provided parents with a number of services, including psychological evaluations, mental health services for mother, parenting classes, intensive monitoring, and extended supervised visits. We agree with the state that those services were sufficiently related to the bases for the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">As we explained in <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. M. S., </em>246 Or App 284, 300, 266 P3d 107 (2011),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cwhere the jurisdictional judgment is based on an unexplained, nonaccidental injuryt,] the basis for jurisdiction includes those \u2018conditions or characteristics\u2019 <em>potentially demonstrated by the specific facts alleged. </em>In other words, it properly encompasses those conditions or characteristics that could have caused the nonaccidental injury. <em>See [Dept. of Human Services v. G. E., </em>243 Or App 471, 479, 260 P3d 516, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>246 Or App 136, 265 P3d 53 (2011)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">(Emphasis added.) That universe may, for example, \u201cpoint to physical abuse, substance abuse, mental health issues, domestic violence, failure to protect, or other conditions. The universe, however, will narrow as DHS identifies possible explanations for the injury and develops a case plan based on that knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. K. D., </em>228 Or App 506, 516, 209 P3d 810 (2009) (a parent\u2019s progress is assessed with reference to the \u201cbarrier to reunification * * * identified in the dependency petition and the applicable case plan\u201d)). Here, mother and father were \u201cnot able or willing\u201d to explain C\u2019s nonaccidental injuries. As DHS asserts, the \u201cbarrier to reunification\u201d necessarily included the cognitive issues that potentially contributed to C\u2019s injuries and inhibited parents\u2019 ability to understand the seriousness of the trauma to C. Thus, DHS\u2019s concern is whether mother and father have the ability to understand what may have contributed to C\u2019s injuries and the steps they must take in order to create a safe environment for C. The services provided were directed toward addressing barriers to that understanding by teaching mother and father the steps required to safely care for C.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>We next address parents\u2019 contention that the services were not adequate because they fell short of Ewell\u2019s recommendations. Parents assert that DHS waited several months to provide an in-home mentor rather than immediately providing the intensive, hands-on parenting coaching that Ewell had recommended, and that they were never provided with couples\u2019 counseling, nor was father provided with mental health treatment for PTSD. Parents maintain that Wafer\u2019s guidance, which they contend was not provided until August 2011, was limited to observation rather than hands-on coaching and that, for all of those reasons, DHS\u2019s efforts were not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Parents\u2019 criticisms of the services provided are not well-taken. Contrary to parents\u2019 characterization of the record, DHS facilitated, and a home care nurse actively participated in, extended home visits beginning shortly after Ewell\u2019s psychological evaluations; Fulmerton worked with parents to develop parenting skills over several months. During that time, parents also attended intensive parenting classes and worked with a parenting coach during office visits, and mother was provided with mental health services to address stress management techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We also disagree with parents\u2019 characterization of Wafer\u2019s services as consisting primarily of observation rather than hands-on instruction as recommended by Ewell. Wafer spent a significant amount of time observing mother\u2019s and father\u2019s natural tendencies in caring for C\u2014but after identifying behaviors that needed correction, she redirected parents and provided specific feedback. On a typical visit, Wafer spent five or six hours with parents and worked with them on C\u2019s feeding and sleeping schedule and on creating shopping lists and engaged in other activities related to C\u2019s safety and health. After mother and father had engaged in services for several months, there were instances when Wafer refrained from providing feedback until the very end of the visit. At that point, however, it was appropriate for DHS to assess their progress in developing the ability to safely care for C without constant guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">At the permanency hearing, the court found that DHS \u201chad given a great deal of time and consideration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>programming to this case\u201d and ultimately determined that DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable. We are satisfied that the record supports that finding and that determination, despite the fact that DHS did not provide every service suggested by Ewell. Ewell\u2019s suggestions that father \u201ccould probably also benefit from some individual counseling to address his PTSD\u201d and that both parents \u201cmight also benefit from couples counseling\u201d did not create a requirement that DHS provide those services. Rather, the juvenile court evaluates DHS\u2019s efforts based on a standard of <em>reasonableness, </em>and the record supports the court\u2019s determination that those efforts were indeed reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">We next address the juvenile court\u2019s determination that parents had failed to make sufficient progress to allow for C to safely return home. They contend that they had made sufficient progress, based on the fact that there were no incidents during any of the visits in which either parent became angry or frustrated with C, nor did either ever handle her roughly, and nothing else happened that suggested a continuing risk of harm to C. Rather, in parents\u2019 view, the visits were consistently pleasant, and they demonstrated that they were able to protect C. Additionally, parents assert that the court, in determining that they had not made sufficient progress, erroneously relied on specific incidents that did not constitute a threat of serious loss or injury to C.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">As part of the support for the juvenile court\u2019s determination, DHS points to its report from August 2011, which states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\u201cNo notable progress has been made in the development of protective capacity necessary to safely parent [C], despite months of intensive services focused on parenting skill development. Parents continue to struggle with retaining information learned and processing information as it relates to their specific circumstances. Additional information indicative of little to no progress:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cBoth parents continue to blame their problems on others at times. [Parents] recently felt they are getting criticized by the visitation supervisor for being poor. We had to discuss this at length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cBoth parents at time[s] reject feedback regarding what must change. Both frequently struggle with being defensive at times. [Father] struggles with focusing on [C] as opposed to focusing on himself (he often spends a lot of time at visits talking with the visitation supervisor about himself). [Father] will often defend parent practices he believes in by talking about how common they are. He struggles with looking at his child\u2019s abuse history, age, vulnerability, and stage of development when considering appropriate parenting practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201c[Mother] is not emotionally able to intervene to protect her child, as evidenced by her frequent immobilization in response to uncomfortable things she experiences with treatment providers and others, her delayed response and action when she is experiencing problems she, herself, views as significant (such as feeling as though she and her mental health counselor are a horrible match, yet she is at a loss as to what to do to begin to resolve this issue) and her consistent presentation as someone who is consumed with her own fears and anxieties to the point where she can [sic] accept and internalize information necessary to safely parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c*** Neither parent at this time can articulate a plan for keeping [C] safe. Both parents continue to \u2018guess\u2019 as to how [C] sustained serious injuries. Neither parent has the ability to identify and predict what dangers may exist to [C] and how to safeguard her. Neither parent has demonstrated the ability to use sound judgment and reasoning as it pertains to parenting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">(Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The state also points to Wafer\u2019s extensive visitation notes, covering August to October 2011, to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination. Those notes demonstrate some of the same concerns included in the August 2011 report and also indicate that parents had difficulty discerning when C was hungry and when she needed to nap, knowing when and how to keep C from putting things in her mouth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>and following Wafer\u2019s suggestions regarding providing the proper structure to ensure C\u2019s health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The record, including the specific examples cited by the juvenile court, supports the determination that parents had failed to make sufficient progress to allow for C to safely return home. The incidents cited by the court\u2014e.g., mother becoming so distracted with dealing with her cats that she failed to notice when C began to eat dog food and both parents having great difficulty removing a crayon from C\u2019s mouth\u2014may not indicate a serious risk of harm when viewed in isolation, but in the context of the entire record, those incidents support the court\u2019s determination that parents were not progressing in their ability to protect C. We recognize, as did the juvenile court, that cognitive limitations present a unique challenge in this type of case. Indeed, parents\u2019 visits with C were generally pleasant and there was no indication that either parent would intentionally harm C; nevertheless, parents\u2019 cognitive limitations continually hindered their ability to ensure C\u2019s safety and health. Even after months of intensive services, mother and father still had difficulty understanding some of C\u2019s very basic needs. The record thus supports the juvenile court\u2019s determination that parents had not made sufficient progress to enable C to safely return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Finally, parents contend that, even if their progress was not sufficient to allow for C to return home at the time of the permanency hearing, their progress was nevertheless sufficient to allow for such a return within a reasonable time following the provision of additional services. The juvenile court was not required to make a finding on that point <em>before </em>changing the permanency plan from reunification to adoption. ORS 419B.476(2)(a); <em>Department of Human Services v. D. L. H., </em>251 Or App 787, 805, 284 P3d 1233, <em>modified on </em>recons, 253 Or App 600, 292 P3d 565 (2012). Nevertheless, a determination of whether the parents\u2019 progress is sufficient to allow for the child\u2019s return within a reasonable time following the provision of additional services is relevant to the question of whether there is a compelling reason to refrain from filing a petition for termination of parental rights immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Under ORS 419B.476(5)(d), if the court determines that the permanency plan should be adoption, the court\u2019s order \u201cshall include\u201d a \u201cdetermination of whether one of the circumstances in ORS 419B.498(2) is applicable.\u201d That statute, in turn, provides that DHS shall file a petition for termination unless, among other reasons, \u201c[t]here is a compelling reason *** for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child,\u201d including the fact that the parent \u201cis successfully participating in services that will make it possible for the child *** to safely return home within a reasonable time ***.\u201d Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s evaluation of whether reunification may be possible within a reasonable time is relevant to the <em>timing </em>for filing a petition for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The juvenile court here noted that it is unclear whether parents\u2019 cognitive limitations \u201ccan be remedied in any short-term fashion\u201d but determined that, in all events, parents had not made sufficient progress and would not do so \u201cin the foreseeable future.\u201d That determination finds adequate support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In short, the juvenile court did not err in determining that DHS made reasonable efforts, that mother and father did not make sufficient progress, and that, in view of their cognitive limitations, parents would not make sufficient progress \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d in order for C to safely return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Although mother made progress in mental health treatment, her caseworker reported that she made the impulsive decision to stop attending in August, in part, because of a conflict in her schedule that she did not attempt to communicate about or solve in any way. According to the caseworker, \u201c[t]his *** resulted in a setback directly impacting the ability to implement a sustainable in-home safety plan for [C].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> Wafer prepared extensive notes documenting her observations from visits occurring during that August-to-Oetober timeframe, and those notes apparently were the basis for the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Wafer began providing services in August. However, the record indicates that Wafer actually began working with parents in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Although we have discretion to review this case <em>de novo </em>in order to recognize that inconsistent evidence, a finding that Wafer provided an additional three months of services is not necessary to a conclusion that DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable. As we will explain, the services provided by DHS in addition to Wafer\u2019s extensive instructional guidance provide sufficient support for the juvenile court\u2019s determination that the efforts made by DHS were reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> Father also contends that there is insufficient evidence that the grounds for jurisdiction continued to exist. As the state points out, father did not ask the juvenile court to dismiss dependency jurisdiction and terminate wardship. Because father did not preserve a challenge to jurisdiction, we do not address that contention further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
