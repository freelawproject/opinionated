Petitioner unsuccessfully opposed the application and then appealed the county\u2019s adverse decision to the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA). Lane County submitted the record in the case to LUBA. Subsequently, after receiving petitioner\u2019s petition for LUBA review, the county filed a motion for a voluntary remand, relying on LUBA\u2019s longstanding practice of permitting a local government to voluntarily withdraw a land use decision if the local government agreed to consider each of the petitioner\u2019s assignments of error. Petitioner opposed the motion, arguing that, although LUBA must permit a local government to withdraw a decision <em>before </em>the local government submits the record, the relevant statute, ORS 197.830(13), does not permit a voluntary remand <em>after </em>that event. LUBA granted the county\u2019s motion and remanded the decision. <em>Dexter Lost Valley Community Assoc, v. Lane </em>County,_ Or LUBA. (LUBA No 2012-044, Oct 16, 2012). Petitioner seeks judicial review. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The relevant facts are all procedural. Three developers applied for a permit to build a bridge as part of a project in rural Lane County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over petitioner\u2019s opposition, a Lane County hearings official approved the permit. Petitioner appealed to the Lane County Board of Commissioners, which affirmed the hearings official without comment. Thereafter, the following events occurred: On June 12, 2012, petitioner filed a notice of intent to appeal to LUBA. On July 23, the county, in response, took the first step in defending its decision by submitting the record in the case to LUBA. On August 14, petitioner filed its petition for review setting forth its various assignments of error. On August 27, apparently in response to the petition for review, the county submitted a \u201cMotion for Voluntary Remand\u201d in which it agreed to \u201cconsider each of the Assignments of Error presented in the Petition for Review\u201d and \u201ctake final action * * * within 90 days.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>In doing so, the county relied on a series of LUBA decisions allowing for a voluntary remand after the record in a case is submitted if, but only if, the local government agrees to address in the remand all of the issues raised in the petition for review. <em>Mulholland v. City of Roseburg, </em>24 Or LUBA 240, 241 (1992); <em>Angel v. City of Portland, </em>20 Or LUBA 541, 543 (1991). Petitioner opposed the remand, arguing that LUBA\u2019s practice exceeded its statutory authority and violated the clear terms of ORS 197.830(13)(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-3\">\u201cAt any time subsequent to the filing of a notice of intent and <em>prior to the date set for filing the record, </em>* * * the local government or state agency may withdraw its decision for purposes of reconsideration. If a local government or state agency withdraws an order for purposes of reconsideration, it shall, within such time as the board may allow, affirm, modify or reverse its decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">LUBA granted the motion, relying on a variety of its own precedents and policy considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cPetitioner apparently views the unilateral right to withdraw a decision for reconsideration under ORS 197.830(13) (b) and the right to move for voluntary remand as the same thing. They are not. The right to withdraw a decision for reconsideration under ORS 197.830(13)(b) is unilateral, and must be granted by LUBA if timely filed. The right to move for voluntary remand is conditional. A local government that moves for voluntary remand must agree to consider all issues raised in the petition for review. <em>Mulholland v. City of Roseburg, </em>24 Or LUBA [at 241]; <em>Angel v. City of Portland, </em>20 LUBA [at 543]. * * * LUBA frequently grants motions for voluntary remand if it concludes that granting the motion is \u2018consistent D with sound principles governing judicial review.\u2019 ORS 197.805. In deciding whether to grant a motion for voluntary remand, LUBA is cognizant that the statutes under which LUBA operates express a \u2018preference that land use matters be resolved at the local level if possible, rather than on review by [LUBA] or the appellate courts ***.\u2019 <em>Mulholland, </em>24 Or LUBA at 243. LUBA also recognizes that by granting a motion for voluntary remand LUBA avoids \u2018forcing [a local government] and applicant to defend a decision they * * * do not believe will survive [LUBA] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>review.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>And in such cases granting a motion for voluntary remand can actually shorten the time required to present LUBA with focused arguments on the legal matters that are contested, by allowing the local government an opportunity to \u2018adopt a decision it is prepared to defend.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><em>Dexter Lost Valley Community </em>Assoc.,_Or LUBA at_ (LUBA No 2012-044 at 2-3 (footnote omitted; second omission in original; third through fifth brackets in original)). This judicial review ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Before this court, petitioner once again calls our attention to the well-settled precept that an administrative agency cannot act outside of its legislative grant of authority in order to \u201camend, alter, enlarge or limit the terms of a legislative enactment.\u201d <em>U. of O. Co-Oper. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>273 Or 539, 550, 542 P2d 900 (1975); <em>accord Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>330 Or 35, 41, 995 P2d 1163 (2000). Petitioner argues that, in ORS 197.830(13)(b), the legislature affirmatively limited LUBA\u2019s authority to allow voluntary remands after submission of the record. By allowing local governments to withdraw orders before submission of the record, the legislature implicitly prohibited withdrawal afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Respondents\u2019 brief on appeal focuses preliminarily on reviewability. Their first argument is that, by asking\u2014 in its original petition for review to LUBA\u2014that LUBA reverse <em>or remand, </em>petitioner forfeited the right to seek judicial review when LUBA, in fact, remanded. We disagree. After the county filed its motion for voluntary remand, petitioner submitted an express and vigorous \u201cOpposition to Motion for Voluntary Remand.\u201d Further, to the extent that petitioner sought remand in its original petition for review to LUBA, petitioner was seeking at least a partial adjudication on the merits of the county\u2019s decision; when petitioner now challenges the county\u2019s remand, petitioner is opposing LUBA\u2019s decision to refrain from an adjudication on the merits by allowing the county to reconsider its order. Those are different objectives, and asking for the first did not invite LUBA to perform the second. For similar reasons, we reject respondents\u2019 second reviewability contention\u2014 that petitioner has not demonstrated that its substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>rights were prejudiced. <em>See </em>ORS 197.850(9)(a) (the court may reverse or remand procedural error only if error is prejudicial). In granting the county\u2019s motion, LUBA delayed providing petitioner with a judicially reviewable decision on the merits of the county\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\">In addressing petitioner\u2019s argument, as opposed to the argument\u2019s reviewability, respondents maintain, \u201cWhat is missing * * * is any sound explanation as to why LUBA\u2019s practice of issuing voluntary remands after the filing of the record is contrary to any statute or rule.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) According to respondents, ORS 197.830(13)(b) does not limit LUBA\u2019s authority to grant voluntary remands; seen in the context of LUBA\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201clong-standing practice,\u201d the statute, \u201con its face, expands LUBA\u2019s authority to approve voluntary remands.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) Respondents\u2019 argument appears to be that, before the enactment of \u201cthe relatively recent\u201d ORS 197.830(13)(b), LUBA had adopted the practice of granting voluntary remands at any time in the review process before hearing, but only if the local government agreed to address all of the issues. In order to enlarge LUBA\u2019s authority, the legislature in enacting ORS 197.830(13)(b) <em>eliminated </em>the requirement that a local government agree to address the issues, thereby empowering LUBA to do what it had not been empowered to do previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Further, respondents echo LUBA\u2019s reasoning. ORS 197.830(13)(b), they argue, establishes that LUBA <em>must </em>permit a local government to withdraw a decision if the withdrawal occurs after the filing of the notice of intent and before the date set for filing the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LUBA\u2019s policy, on the other hand, <em>allows </em>LUBA to grant a local government\u2019s <em>request </em>for a remand without temporal limitation, provided the local government agrees to address all assignments of error. According to respondents, the statute and the policy do not conflict; rather, they complement each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We conclude that each side has plausible textual and contextual arguments. Respondents\u2019 argument, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>cannot be reconciled with unusually persuasive legislative history. What is now ORS 197.830(13)(b) was enacted by the 1991 Legislative Assembly. Or Laws 1991, ch 817, \u00a7 7. At one point in the process (in the \u201cA3\u201d amendments), the relevant portion of the provision read, \u201cAt any time subsequent to the filing of a notice of intent and prior to <em>the date set for oral argument, </em>the local government or state agency may withdraw its decision for purposes of reconsideration.\u201d HB 2261-A3 (June 3,1991) (emphasis added). Written testimony submitted by 1000 Friends of Oregon suggested a flaw in that language. In a letter to the chair and members of the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, 1000 Friends\u2019 staff attorney stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cThe A3 amendments would add a provision enabling local governments to withdraw a decision appealed to LUBA for purposes of reconsideration. 1000 Friends has no objection to that, but does object to allowing the withdrawal to be made at any time before the date set for oral argument. * * * Giving a local government that long means the appellant might have to pay a lawyer substantial sums to prepare a brief and an oral argument, only to learn at the last minute such expenditures were not necessary. Some local governments might even wait until the last minute to exhaust an appellant\u2019s resources and hence his ability to challenge the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201cAccordingly, 1000 Friends recommends substituting the words \u2018filing the record\u2019 for \u2018oral argument.\u2019 * * * Thus, an appellant would not have to incur attorney fees until the local government made clear whether it would withdraw its decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Testimony, Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, HB 2261, June 7,1991, Ex Q (statement of Neil Kagan). 1000 Friends\u2019 staff attorney further explained the proposed amendment in another memorandum addressed to the same committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cThis amendment <em>[i.e., </em>changing \u2018oral argument\u2019 to \u2018filing the record\u2019] would give a local government an opportunity to withdraw a decision appealed to LUBA for purposes of reconsideration. The local government would be able to withdraw the decision at any time prior to the date set for filing the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cUnlike an earlier proposed amendment, 1000 Friends\u2019 proposed amendment would not allow a decision to be withdrawn at any time before the date set for oral argument. Giving a local government that long might have forced the appellant to pay a lawyer substantial sums to prepare a brief and an oral argument, only to learn at the last minute such expenditures were not necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-3\">Testimony, Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, HB 2261, June 12, 1991, Ex G (statement of Neil Kagan). The bill that ultimately passed and is now ORS 197.830(13)(b) incorporated 1000 Friends\u2019 suggested language.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">From the foregoing legislative history, we conclude that ORS 197.830(13)(b), in allowing a state or local government to withdraw a decision \u201csubsequent to the filing of a notice of intent and prior to the date set for filing the record,\u201d necessarily prohibits a state or-local government from withdrawing a decision thereafter. LUBA\u2019s grant of Lane County\u2019s motion to withdraw its decision in this case was, therefore, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\"> The developers are ATR Land, LLC; Leelynn, Inc.; and Wiley Mt., Inc.
