Ferguson, </em>315 Or 135, 140-41 n 9, 843 P2d 442 (1992), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On December 8, 2007, the decedent passed away intestate, leaving four surviving heirs and an estate worth approximately $200,000 consisting of a single piece of real property located in Curry County and assorted items of personal property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each of the heirs resided in California, and nothing occurred until May 2008 when one of the heirs, Lee, contacted Oregon attorney Babin to represent her as the personal representative of the estate. However, soon after, Lee decided against serving as the personal representative and Babin located a creditor, Byrtus, who agreed to assume that responsibility. Babin filed a petition for administration of intestate estate and appointment of personal representative on July 3, 2008. Byrtus, however, quickly expressed interest in purchasing personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>belonging to the estate, an amended petition was filed, and ultimately petitioner was appointed personal representative of the estate on August 6, 2008. Babin facilitated that process and has served as petitioner\u2019s counsel throughout the entirety of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Petitioner, in conjunction with Babin and his staff, proceeded to administer the estate\u2014resolving creditors\u2019 claims, taking an inventory of the personal property of the estate, communicating with the heirs regarding that property, selling some items, and unsuccessfully attempting to sell the piece of real property, which had fallen into disrepair during the months between decedent\u2019s death and the appointment of petitioner. On October 30, 2009, petitioner filed a first annual accounting and petition for interim payment of Babin\u2019s attorney fees, requesting $16,051 as a partial payment of attorney fees (represented to be \u201cless than 80% of the anticipated attorney fees and costs\u201d). An affidavit of attorney fees and accompanying documentation was filed concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The trial court denied the request for interim fees in a December 7 letter opinion addressing petitioner\u2019s counsel, stating, \u201cIn my review of the accounting, a number of concerns arose, all of which should be addressed in the final accounting.\u201d The court' detailed those concerns, which, in relevant part, consisted of (1) an inquiry regarding four specific payments to petitioner\u2019s counsel totaling over $1,200 \u201cwhich [the trial court did] not see reflected as paid in your billing statements and for which it appears there was no prior court approval\u201d; (2) a concern \u201cregarding some of the funds paid directly to your staff * * * for things that either the personal representative could have done personally, or could have hired less expensive workers to handle [,]\u201d including $2,306.22 charged to \u201c[o]rganize for estate [s]ale\u201d; and (3) a general concern \u201cregarding the amount of attorney fees, which seems high for an estate of this size and complexity.\u201d Regarding the overall fee calculation, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cThere are many instances in your billing where it appears the amount of time spent is excessive. For example, 2 hours of attorney time and over 5 hours of staff time are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>attributed to the preparation of the petition and the amended petition with charges of over $600. 1.3 hours of staff time was apparently spent on preparing three simple waivers and \u2018postage time\u2019 and \u2018copy time\u2019 presumably for those same waivers. There are other instances where it appears what is essentially one task is broken down into multiple entries which, when added together, show what appears to be excessive amounts of time charged for the task. Please review and revise your billing as you feel is appropriate prior to resubmitting it to the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Approximately eight months later, on August 13, 2010, petitioner filed a final accounting and petition for judgment of final distribution and payment of attorney fees along with a 14-page statement of attorney fees and 41 pages of supporting documentation, requesting a final award of $22,729.40 in attorney fees and costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notice of time to file objections to the final accounting was sent to each of the heirs as required by ORS 116.093, and no objection was filed. However, in a September 3 letter opinion addressed again to petitioner\u2019s counsel, the trial court reprised and expanded upon its concerns regarding petitioner\u2019s request for attorney fees\u2014stating that its earlier concerns had \u201cnot been adequately addressed\u201d by petitioner\u2019s final accounting, statement of attorney fees, and supporting documentation. The trial court explained, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cAt the time you made a request for interim fees in this matter I had a discussion with you about concerns I had regarding your billing and I denied the request for interim fees. Those concerns have not been adequately addressed in your most recently filed statement of attorney fees in which you request $22,729.40 in attorney fees and costs. Generally, the average fee for completing a probate in Coos and Curry Counties is around $4,000 to $6,000, assuming it is not complicated and does not involve any contested issues. It is quite rare for attorney fees and costs in this area to exceed $10,000 when there are no contested issues or litigation. The estate assets in this case consisted of a single piece of real property, some vehicles, guns, coins, and miscellaneous personal property which, according to the inventory, [were valued at] $199,835.37. This case was slightly more complex than is average, but, after reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the factors set forth in ORS 116.183,1 find that a reasonable amount for fees and costs to complete this probate matter should have been no more than $9,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">\u201cExamples of complications in this case which do justify some additional expense include finding a new fiduciary and filing the appropriate documents in relation to the new fiduciary, and perhaps slightly more work than is typical related to claims against the estate. *** There is certainly ample evidence of time spent by you and your staff, but there is little correlation between the time spent and benefit to the estate or the amount of responsibility assumed and the total value of the estate. A good example of this is the time spent attempting to sell the real estate without the help of an agent or broker. Also, it appears that your staff was hired by the personal representative and paid separately by the estate for work related to the sale of personal property. That is not improper and in fact I have no reason to doubt they did an excellent job in that capacity but there is a relationship between that and the overall reasonable cost of handling this estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Following receipt of the trial court\u2019s above-quoted letter opinion, petitioner filed a generalized objection to the trial court\u2019s finding \u201cthat reasonable attorney fees for the personal representative are limited to $9,500.00\u201d and requested a hearing on the matter. He attached a proposed judgment of final distribution, which, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s findings, included an award of $22,729.40 in attorney fees. On September 22, the trial court denied petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing. It then modified and signed the proposed judgment of final distribution on October 12\u2014redacting petitioner\u2019s proposed $22,729.40 attorney fee award, replacing the amount of \u201creasonable attorney fees\u201d awarded with $9,500, and apportioning the difference among the four heirs. Petitioner then filed a motion for reconsideration and offer of proof on which no action was taken. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As noted, petitioner first argues that the trial court abused its discretion in substantially reducing the requested attorney fee award. It is well settled that \u201c[t]he determination of attorney fees to be allowed out of the funds of [an] estate is a matter which rests within the sound discretion of the probate court [and] will not be disturbed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>appeal unless there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Smith v. U. S. National Bank, </em>47 Or App 967, 977, 615 P2d 1119 (1980) (citing Ira <em>re Lachmund\u2019s Estate, </em>179 Or 420, 170 P2d 748 (1946)); <em>see Parrott v. Carr Chevrolet, Inc., </em>156 Or App 257, 282, 965 P2d 440 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>331 Or 537, 17 P3d 473 (2001) (\u201cThe amount of attorney fees is a question of fact as to which the trial court has wide discretion.\u201d); <em>Damerow Ford Co. v. Bradshaw, </em>128 Or App 606, 623, 876 P2d 788 (1994) (\u201cThe trial court was in the best position to evaluate the attorneys\u2019 services and we cannot say that it failed to exercise its discretion properly in fixing the amount.\u201d). In determining the amount of attorney fees to be awarded in an estate proceeding, a court must consider the factors set forth by ORS 116.183, which provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\u201c[a]n award of reasonable attorney fees under this section shall be made after consideration of <em>the customary fees in the community for similar services, </em>the time spent by counsel, counsel\u2019s experience in such matters, the skill displayed by counsel, the excellence of the result obtained, any agreement as to fees which may exist between the personal representative and the counsel of the personal representative, <em>the amount of responsibility assumed by counsel considering the total value of the estate, </em>and such other factors as may be relevant. No single factor shall be controlling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Here, after petitioner submitted his request for interim fees, the trial court\u2014in addition to denying the request\u2014provided a narrative description of its concerns regarding petitioner\u2019s accrual and computation of attorney fees, including concern \u201cregarding some of the funds paid directly to your staff * * * for things that either the personal representative could have done personally, or could have hired less expensive workers to handle.\u201d That concern goes directly to \u201cthe amount of responsibility assumed by counsel considering the total value of the estate\u201d under ORS 116.183; however, petitioner did not avail himself of the opportunity to address that concern. Most strikingly, in the statement of attorney fees, rather than directly address the issue of whether the personal representative or much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>less costly workers hired at his request could have handled myriad nonlegal tasks, great detail was provided regarding the excellent work performed by counsel\u2019s paralegal ($90 per hour) and legal assistants ($45 per hour). One example is particularly illustrative and underscores the trial court\u2019s concerns and overall reasonableness determination: The statement of attorney fees explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">\u201c [sjeveral matters <em>handled by the attorney and paralegal </em>during this probate make this a complex probate instead of just a simple probate. There were 5 vehicles/recreational vehicles on the estate property that were in poor condition and only one of the vehicles had keys to it. The home itself as well as the garage did not have keys and all of the aforementioned assets had to be re-keyed in order to have access to them and their contents. Numerous attempts were made to sell the various vehicles [without success] ***. Therefore, when an offer was made to purchase the whole lot of vehicles for one sum, \u2018as is [,]\u2019 the administrator agreed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">That statement goes directly to the trial court\u2019s concern as to the responsibility assumed by counsel considering the total value of the estate under ORS 116.183. It was well within the trial court\u2019s discretion to find that predominately nonlegal services such as the preparation and sale of vehicles and other personal property should not reasonably have been handled by persons charging $200 (counsel\u2019s rate), $90, or even $45 per hour, but rather by petitioner or \u201cless expensive workers\u201d hired at his request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Estate of Leda Mae Grove v. Selken, </em>109 Or App 668, 677, 820 P2d 895 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 676 (1992) (\u201cThe court also disallowed payment of legal fees to * * * [the] attorney for the estate, because it found that much of the work claimed as attorney work was more properly classified as administrative work of the personal representative. We agree with the probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>court\u2019s findings ***.\u201d). As noted, the trial court reiterated that point\u2014relating it explicitly to the considerations mandated by ORS 116.183\u2014in response to petitioner\u2019s final accounting and statement of attorney fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">\u201cThere is certainly ample evidence of time spent by you and your staff, but there is <em>little correlation between the time spent and benefit to the estate or the amount of responsibility assumed and the total value of the estate. </em>A good example of this is the time spent attempting to sell the real estate without the help of an agent or broker. Also, it appears that your staff was hired by the personal representative and paid separately by the estate for work related to the sale of personal property. That is not improper and in fact I have no reason to doubt they did an excellent job in that capacity <em>but there is a relationship between that and the overall reasonable cost of handling this estate.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Accordingly, based on this record, the trial court\u2019s central concern and resultant reduction in attorney fees was supported by ample evidence, was called to petitioner\u2019s attention prior to submission of the final accounting and statement of attorney fees, comports explicitly with ORS 116.183, and was explained in \u201cterms that are sufficiently clear to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., </em>327 Or 185, 190-91, 957 P2d 1200 (1998) (\u201c[a]dequate findings\u201d in support of a court\u2019s award of attorney fees \u201cneed not be complex or lengthy\u201d but rather must simply be set forth in \u201cany terms that are sufficiently clear to permit meaningful appellate review\u201d); <em>see also Ashley v. Garrison, </em>162 Or App 585, 592-93, 986 P2d 654 (1999) (trial court must describe relevant facts and legal criteria relied upon in determining amount of attorney fee award). Moreover, in taking into account \u201cthe customary fees in the community for similar services\u201d under ORS 116.183 and then reducing petitioner\u2019s requested fee award accordingly based on evidence in the record as illustrated above, the trial court did not, as petitioner contends, \u201cexercise [] its \u2018discretion\u2019 without evidence [,]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Grisby v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Progressive Preferred Ins. Co., </em>233 Or App 210, 222, 225 P3d 101 (2010) (in reducing requested attorney fees, \u201cthere must be a rational nexus between the factor invoked, and its underlying circumstances, and the amount of the reduction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Finally, in assigning error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to award the requested amount of attorney fees, petitioner argues that the court improperly relied upon \u201cmatters outside of the record\u201d such as purportedly \u201cunsubstantiated conclusions about the typical cost of a probate\u201d in the community based on the \u201cjudge\u2019s experience.\u201d Again, the trial court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cGenerally, the average fee for completing a probate in Coos and Curry Counties is around $4,000 to $6,000, assuming it is not complicated and does not involve any contested issues. It is quite rare for attorney fees and costs in this area to exceed $10,000 when there are no contested issues or litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Although we express misgivings as to whether the trial court was entitled to rely on specific information apparently derived from personal experience or knowledge, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s argument as to its asserted impropriety was not preserved below as required by ORAP 5.45(1). <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (court generally will not consider an unpreserved issue on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">After the trial court made the above-quoted statement regarding average attorney fees for similar matters in the community, petitioner\u2014in requesting a hearing\u2014merely noted a general objection to \u201cthe finding of the Court that reasonable attorney fees for the personal representative are limited to $9,500.00.\u201d The same generalized objection, albeit accompanied by supporting declarations and other evidence, was repeated in petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration and offer of proof. Petitioner raises on appeal, for the first time, an argument that \u201c[t]he trial court could only come up with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>such a conclusion [regarding the average range of attorney fees for probate cases in Coos and Curry Counties] based upon its own investigation [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Above all, had petitioner raised that argument below in response to the trial court\u2019s September 3, 2010, letter opinion\u2014whether in objecting and requesting a hearing, in his motion for reconsideration, or in any other form\u2014the trial court would have been alerted to the potential error such that it could have considered and addressed it\u2014e.g., by taking judicial notice of the figures relied upon. <em>See Shields v. Campbell, </em>277 Or 71, 77, 559 P2d 1275 (1977) (\u201cA party owes the trial court the obligation of a sound, clear and articulate motion, objection or exception, <em>so as to permit the trial judge a chance to consider the legal contention or to correct an error already </em>made.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); <em>Charles v. Palomo, </em>347 Or 695, 700, 227 P3d 737 (2010) (we will generally consider an issue advanced on review only if the party \u201craised the issue below with enough particularity to assure that the trial court was able to \u2018identify its alleged error\u2019 so as to \u2018consider and correct [it]\u201d\u2019 (quoting <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343)). Such a process would have additionally fostered more extensive development of the record. <em>See Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219-20, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (preservation requirement is principally designed to apprise the trial court of a party\u2019s position so that the court can consider it and act accordingly, to avoid surprise and unfairness to any opposing party, and to foster full development of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">As to whether petitioner was entitled to a hearing on the matter of attorney fees, we note, first, that no objection was filed in response to the final accounting, and thus the statutory scheme governing attorney fee awards in estate proceedings did not mandate a hearing. <em>See </em>ORS 116.103 (\u201cAny person entitled to notice under ORS 116.093 may, within the time fixed for the filing, file in the estate proceeding objections to the final account and petition for distribution, specifying the particulars of the objections. Upon the filing of objections the court shall fix the time for hearing thereon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Petitioner grounds his argument as to the need for a hearing principally in generalized considerations of due process, as well as the apparent notion that the trial court\u2019s finding that the requested amount was unreasonable functioned as a <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cobjection\u201d for purposes of ORS 116.103. We reject the latter contention, noting that ORS 116.103 provides for a hearing upon \u201cthe <em>filing </em>of objections\u201d by <em>\u201c[a]ny person entitled to notice </em>under ORS 116.093.\u201d (Emphases added.) ORS 116.093 provides that notice of the time for filing objections to a final accounting and judgment of final distribution\u2014where the decedent died intestate and neither the Department of Human Services nor the Oregon Health Authority has presented a claim\u2014be provided to each of the decedent\u2019s heirs, each creditor \u201cwho has not received payment in full and whose claim has not otherwise been barred [,]\u201d and \u201c[a]ny other person known to the personal representative to have or to claim an interest in the estate being distributed.\u201d Accordingly, as petitioner implicitly concedes in stating that, \u201c[h]ad anyone objected to the requested attorney fees and costs, the trial court <em>would have been </em>required to have a hearing\u201d (underscoring in original; emphasis added), a trial court\u2019s reduction of a requested attorney fee award and attendant findings does not constitute an \u201cobjection\u201d in an estate proceeding for purposes of ORS 116.103. The court was therefore not required to \u201cfix the time for hearing thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">As noted, petitioner also argues more generally that \u201cbasic principles of due process and fundamental fairness require that interested parties have an opportunity to be heard if the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>makes objections.\u201d On that point, we note that, in this case, petitioner was provided with ample opportunity to present evidence and argument. Notwithstanding its denial of a traditional, live \u201chearing,\u201d the trial court reviewed nearly 100 pages of explanation and documentation submitted by petitioner in support of his fee request and then provided two narrative responses thereto. Indeed, summarizing his argument regarding the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for a hearing, petitioner states that the trial court \u201cabused [its] discretion in refusing to allow a hearing <em>or other opportunity for presentation of evidence and argument\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Cf. Koskela v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>331 Or 362, 378, 15 P3d 548 (2000) (\u201cAn appropriate hearing is one that is provided \u2018at a meaningful time and <em>in a meaningful manner 1\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) (Quoting <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 US 545, 552, 85 S Ct 1187, 14 L Ed 2d 62 (1965).)); <em>Taffe v. Smyth, </em>62 Or 227, 241, 125 P 308 (1912) (referring to the concept of a \u201cpaper hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In fact, petitioner concedes that, in the final accounting and accompanying statement of attorney fees, \u201cdetailed explanations for the questions previously raised by the trial court\u201d were set forth in response to the court\u2019s December 7, 2009, letter opinion. The final accounting provided, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201clengthy narrative of every task undertaken,\u201d a \u201cdetail [ed]\u201d explanation as to \u201cwhy this particular probate case was more complex than the amount of value at issue would otherwise suggest!,]\u201d and billing records along with explanation \u201cin great detail\u201d of \u201cthe reasons for the time expended.\u201d The trial court then responded to that documentation in kind, providing specific reasons for its rejection of petitioner\u2019s requested award of attorney fees as detailed above. Unlike the situation in, for instance, <em>Nelson v. Emerald People\u2019s Utility Dist., </em>116 Or App 366, 377, 840 P2d 1384 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>318 Or 99, 862 P2d 1293 (1993), upon which petitioner relies, this is not a case where \u201c[t]he court could not have properly apportioned fees solely by examining the fee statement\u201d and thus erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In <em>Nelson, </em>the court was faced with apportioning attorney fees between the plaintiff\u2019s separate civil rights and contract claims. <em>Id. </em>at 376-77. We held that the documentation pertaining to attorney fees had \u201cnumerous entries for \u2018research\u2019 and other services described in such general terms that the court could not have ascertained which claim they related to without conducting an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Conversely, here the trial court was presented with extremely detailed documentation pertaining to one matter alone, applied the factors set forth in ORS 116.183, and utilized its discretion to determine a reasonable amount of attorney fees without facing the complexities inherent in apportioning fees between two separate claims. <em>Nelson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>like the balance of cases upon which petitioner relies, is thus inapposite as applied to the facts before us. <em>See, e.g., Morgan v. Goodsell, </em>220 Or App 329, 185 P3d 1117 (2008) (trial court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing \u201cupon which to base an apportionment\u201d of attorney fees between homeowner\u2019s association and specific members of that association where \u201cthe association offered no evidence to support its proposed apportionment\u201d). We conclude that, although petitioner was not afforded a traditional, live \u201chearing,\u201d he was afforded sufficient opportunity (of which he availed himself) to present evidence and argument supporting his request for attorney fees. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court neither abused its discretion in awarding petitioner $9,500 in attorney fees nor in denying his request for a hearing on the matter. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\"> Respondents have not appeared on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\"> In addition, petitioner argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to enable meaningful appellate review[,]\u201drelying in part on McCarthy <em>v.
