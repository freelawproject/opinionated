The court also determined that mother\u2019s \u201cnegative comments\u201d to one of the twins, MA, created a risk of injury to her emotional and physical well-being. On appeal, mother contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the children were presently endangered, a necessary predicate for jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(l)(c), \u201cbased upon one incident of inappropriate touching four years before the trial,\u201d given that stepfather was assessed not to be a risk to children. She also contends that the court erred in concluding that mother\u2019s comments to MA \u201camount [ed] to such harm that the child was endangered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In dependency cases such as this one, we have discretion to \u201ctry the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d ORS 19.415(3)(b). We exercise that discretion sparingly, <em>see </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (appellate court exercises its discretion under ORS 19.415(3)(b) only in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d), and, typically, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the absence of a request from a party concisely stating why <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate, we would not choose to do so. ORAP 5.40(8)(a), (b). However, in this case, although mother does not ask us to apply the <em>de novo </em>standard, she does challenge one of the crucial findings underlying the juvenile court\u2019s judgment\u2014namely, that a psychosexual evaluation of stepfather indicated that he did not present a risk of harm to only his <em>biological </em>children. As explained below, 255 Or App at 308, we agree with mother that the court\u2019s finding does not comport with the uncontroverted evidence in the record, and, because that finding is essential to the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that MA and MI are presently endangered, we exercise our discretion to review the facts <em>de novo. </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(d)(ii); <em>Dept. of Human Services v.

Considering the totality of the circumstances\u2014including, particularly, our finding on <em>de novo </em>review that stepfather was assessed not to present a risk of harm to <em>any </em>child, as well as the express and implied findings of the juvenile court that are supported by the record\u2014we conclude that the twins\u2019 \u201ccondition or circumstances\u201d are not \u201csuch as to endanger [their] welfare.\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">MA and MI were born in 1998. Mother and father divorced in 2000. In 2004, mother married stepfather; they have four children together. Father also remarried; he has no children with his current wife. At the time of the events that gave rise to the jurisdictional judgment, father and mother shared custody of MA and MI; father had them 60 percent of the time and mother had them the remaining 40 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In February 2011, when MA and MI were in the seventh grade, the school scheduled a meeting with mother and father to discuss concerns about MA\u2014in particular, MA had fabricated a detailed story to her teacher that she had bone cancer. The meeting included MA\u2019s teacher, her school counselor, and the vice principal; MA was brought in at the end of the meeting. When the counselor told MA about the upcoming meeting, MA admitted that she had lied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>about having cancer; she also told the counselor that she was \u201cscratching\u201d her arm and leg and was not eating lunch. According to the counselor, MA felt that mother did not like her and treated her differently from MI. MA then told the counselor about a disclosure that MI had made about stepfather\u2014specifically, MI had told MA that stepfather had touched her inappropriately when MI and MA were in the fourth or fifth grade. At the meeting, mother and father were told about that disclosure. Father \u201ckind of fell apart\u201d and was supportive of MA; mother said that it was a lie and told MA that she would be in trouble if she was telling lies. The meeting was on a Friday; MA and MI spent the following weekend with father, as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Father separately talked to both girls about the abuse allegation and, on Monday morning, reported it to the Department of Human Services (DHS), who began an investigation. A DHS caseworker and an officer from the Hillsboro Police Department went to talk to mother. Mother told them that she thought the allegation about stepfather was false. But, she agreed that MA and MI would stay with father and that stepfather would move out of the home and have no contact with any of the children until the investigation was completed. The caseworker described mother as \u201ccautiously cooperative.\u201d Mother then remained in the home with the other four children and had only supervised visits with MA and MI. Mother requested counseling for MA and MI as soon as she learned of the disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Later that week, MA and MI were evaluated at CARES Northwest (CARES), which provides medical assessments for concerns related to child abuse and neglect. MA told the CARES examiner and interviewer what she had disclosed to her teacher\u2014that MI had told her about an incident that occurred when they were in approximately the fourth or fifth grade when stepfather was rubbing MFs back as they were watching television together and then he touched her on her front private area. MA also acknowledged that she had recently been cutting her arm and leg with an \u201cX-Acto\u201d knife and that she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d about mother. She told the interviewer that she felt mother favored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>MI over her and that mother sometimes told her that she was stupid. She denied that stepfather had ever touched her inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">MI also told the CARES interviewer about the incident with stepfather. She said that one day, around the time that she was in the fourth grade, she was lying on the couch watching television with stepfather, who was sitting on the couch at her feet. She thought mother and the other children were at the grocery store. MI related that stepfather had been rubbing her back with his hand when he moved his hand under her shirt and began rubbing her stomach. She said (and demonstrated using dolls) that his hand then slid down inside the front of her pants, under her underwear, touching the top of her vaginal area. He then pulled his hand out of her underwear and put it over her underwear between her legs, rubbing her front private area. MI was confused and scared, and she got up and went to her room. She looked in her \u201cfeelings book\u201d to identify how she was feeling and then began writing in her journal her thoughts about what had happened. The journal later disappeared. Stepfather came into her room while she was writing in her journal and asked if she was okay. She said that she was, and he left. She told MA the next day about what stepfather had done, but MA did not react. MI did not tell anyone else, and she indicated that stepfather had never touched her inappropriately again. MI said that she had recently told MA again about the incident<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but had told her not to tell anyone because it had been over three years since it had occurred. A physical examination performed at CARES revealed no physical evidence of sexual abuse of either girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">DHS filed dependency petitions for all six of mother\u2019s children on March 8, 2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The operative petitions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>that MA and MI are within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419B.100(l)(c) based on the following conditions and circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>[Stepfather] sexually abused [MI] several years ago. The mother does not believe that the sexual abuse occurred and does not believe that [stepfather] poses a threat of harm to her children. This circumstance places all the children under a current threat of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cB. The mother has made negative comments directly and indirectly to [MA] that created a risk of serious loss or injury to [MA\u2019s] emotional and physical well being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">\u201cC. [Father] is the legal father of [MI and MA]. He was married to the mother at the time of [MI and MA\u2019s] birth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cD. The father is unable to legally protect [MI and MA] due to the custody order allowing unsupervised visitation with the mother and requires the assistance of DHS to monitor the mother\u2019s contact with [MI and MA], This circumstance poses a current threat of harm to [MI and MA\u2019s] emotional and physical well being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Before the jurisdictional hearing, Dr. Colistro, a forensic/investigative psychologist and certified clinical sex-offender therapist, performed a psychological evaluation and psychosexual risk assessment of stepfather. The results of his psychological testing supported the presence of a social anxiety disorder, which was consistent with what stepfather reported. Stepfather\u2019s \u201cpsychosexual profile as it pertains to sexual violence risk *** indicate[d] an absence of criminogenic factors.\u201d Colistro stated, \u201c[I]t is safe to conclude that [stepfather] is in no way criminally oriented.\u201d Colistro\u2019s report summarized the results of his evaluation, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201cIn summary, results of this psychologic evaluation and psychosexual risk assessment, which has taken into account documentation from law enforcement, DHS, CARES NW and others, and which has subjected these data to quantitative and qualitative psychosexual risk assessment protocols, fail to support the hypothesis that [stepfather] poses any significant threat for committing a person-to-person crime in general or a sex crime in particular. A sexual person-to-person crime is particularly unlikely given [stepfather\u2019s] intensely felt moral values and the fact that his social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>anxiety is at its highest in the context of close interpersonal relations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">After DHS received Colistro\u2019s report, stepfather was allowed to return to the home with mother and their other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">However, the twins continued to stay with father and have only supervised visits with mother. After the twins\u2019 first visit with mother, both girls came home crying. They told their caseworker that they felt that mother was targeting MA by saying things to make her feel bad. In mid-March, MA was taken from school to the emergency room because of concerns about \u201csuicidal ideation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The jurisdictional hearing was held over 10 days between June 13 and November 15, 2011. The court heard testimony from MA and MI, mother, father, DHS workers, the CARES examiner, school personnel, a police officer, psychologists, and various family members and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Mi\u2019s testimony at the hearing was consistent with what she had told the CARES interviewer about the incident with stepfather, except that, at the hearing, MI testified that stepfather had touched her vaginal area on top of her underwear, rather than under it. A video recording of the CARES interview of MI was also admitted into evidence and played for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">MA also testified consistently with her previous disclosures. She explained that mother \u201csometimes blames me for things or gets upset with me because I\u2019m like my dad or something like that\u201d and that mother has called her a \u201cbrat or stupid or something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Mother testified that she did not believe that the abuse had occurred. She said that, when she first heard the allegations about stepfather from the school staff, she found it \u201cless than ten percent\u201d believable and, as the investigation proceeded, she had \u201czero percent\u201d belief that the incident ever occurred. She testified that she did not believe it had happened because MA \u201chad just been lying about other things for no reason,\u201d some of the details of Mi\u2019s story did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>not reflect reality,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and she never left MI or MA alone with stepfather in a one-on-one situation. Regarding the latter point, she explained that she had instituted a \u201crule of three\u201d policy\u2014meaning that she \u201cdid not leave [MA or MI] in a one-on-one situation with any adult male\u201d\u2014even before she was married to stepfather, because, after her contentious divorce from father, she did not \u201cwant him to be able to accuse anybody of doing anything to my twins.\u201d With respect to MI, mother testified that she did not believe her because \u201c[MI] is a people pleaser and I believe that she is doing what she has always done, which is trying to please her father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Both mother and father testified that they were unaware that MA had been cutting herself until the week of the school meeting in February 2011, when MA admitted to that behavior. Mother testified that it was not until then that she had any indication that MA was suffering any emotional distress. Up until that time, mother \u201cfelt like [MA] was handling her life pretty well and that, you know, she was pretty\u2014a pretty well-accomplished child and she seemed very confident.\u201d Father also testified that \u201c[i]t was a shock\u201d to learn about MA cutting herself. Neither parent had noticed any physical signs of that behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Colistro testified as to his evaluation of stepfather, explaining that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201c[i]t was a general psychological psychosexual risk assessment, so the question in general is: Are there any aspects [of] this individual psychologically that are significant visa-vis him posing any sort of threat relative to a person [-] to [-] person crime to his family or to anyone and, specifically, a person [-] to [-] person crime of a sexual nature?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Colistro noted that he was unable to administer certain test instruments because those instruments are standardized based on convicted offenders or people who have been formally charged with sexual offenses, neither of which describe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>stepfather. He also acknowledged that, had stepfather admitted to touching MI in the way that she alleged, his testing results and conclusions would have changed \u201cdrastically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">On direct examination, Colistro was asked whether, in his opinion, stepfather posed a risk of threat or harm to his own biological children; he responded, \u201cHe poses no risk.\u201d However, on cross-examination by counsel for father, the following additional colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cQ. Dr. Colistro, have you made a specific recommendation as to whether [stepfather] is a potential threat to his nonbiological children, [MA and MI]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cA. No, I\u2019ve made a general conclusion about him posing a threat to anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cQ. To anybody. But you didn\u2019t make it specific as to [MA and MI] where the allegation actually\u2014there\u2019s an allegation of sexual touching of [MA and MI] and I\u2019m asking you, have you reached a\u2014a conclusion or do you have an opinion on whether he poses a threat of harm to [MA and MI]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cA. I see no basis on my findings, based on my findings to restrict his contact with them relative to concerns about sexual deviance. I would have concerns about his contact with them relative to relationship issues that were addressed in the DHS documentation and which he talked about as well.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Dr. Zorich, a psychologist who had conducted a psychological evaluation of mother, also testified at the hearing. She noted that mother was \u201cvery bright\u201d and had no Axis I or II diagnoses; in her report, she concluded that, \u201cCurrently, there is no psychiatric condition or symptoms that would impair [mother\u2019s] functioning as a parent.\u201d She also explained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cDetermining if [stepfather] sexually abused [MI] is beyond the scope of this evaluation. The allegations are certainly plausible and [mother] presents a plausible alternative explanation based on the familial history. [Mother] is a critical thinker and her intelligence has led her to believe that she is usually right in her assessment of situations. On interview, she presented clear reasons why she questioned the allegations and provided specific reasoning why she could be \u2018certain\u2019 that the abuse didn\u2019t occur. That being said, a safety plan is rarely failsafe, particularly if one has little cause to actually perceive danger. [Mother] was clear that[,] if it was determined that [stepfather] had sexually abused [MI], she would divorce him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Zorich testified that \u201c[fit\u2019s very clear\u201d that mother is \u201cwilling to protect her children and her husband,\u201d and to \u201cput into place whatever safety measures she needs to.\u201d Zorich related that mother volunteered to put cameras in her home and was \u201cwilling to go the extra mile to make sure that there is no possibility of something like this happening again.\u201d Zorich also opined that mother was capable of being protective even if she did not believe that the touching had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">According to Zorich, mother expressed love for both twins but acknowledged that she had a more difficult relationship with MA than with MI. Zorich observed that mother\u2019s relationship with MA \u201chas been ruptured and it will be challenging to restore it from both sides.\u201d Zorich recommended that mother receive individual counseling to \u201caddress issues of distrust with the kids.\u201d She thought it important that there be a \u201csupervision component\u201d during visits with the twins as therapy was getting underway but, otherwise, expressed no concerns about them being in mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, mother moved to dismiss the petition, asserting that the state had failed to prove that that there is a current risk of harm to MA and MI. The juvenile court denied the motion and found that the state had proved the allegations in the petitions. It made the following oral findings in support of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>First, the court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that MI had been sexually abused by stepfather. It also found that it was a one-time incident. In doing so, the court relied heavily on its assessment of Mi\u2019s credibility. The court found that Mi\u2019s testimony was \u201cextremely credible,\u201d emphasizing her consistency over time in relating what had occurred. The court observed, \u201cThere were no embellishments as time went on. There was no recanting and that\u2019s unusual in these cases for a basically consistent story to be told.\u201d The court also noted that MI had \u201ckept quiet to keep people happy as opposed to telling people to make people happy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Next, the court also found that mother \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not believe that the abuse happened; rather, \u201cmom\u2019s whole approach * * * is that [MA] was a liar,\u201d and that \u201cmom felt from the beginning of these allegations that her children need[ed] to prove these happened.\u201d The court also found that MA is aware that mother does not believe her and that that has affected their relationship, which was already strained. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201c[MA] said the stress of her mother\u2019s attitude was affecting her. MA testified that the cutting was about mom. That when the cutting issues and cancer allegations came out, that her impression was mom didn\u2019t think she [referring, presumably, to mother] had anything to do with it. That it wasn\u2019t something stemming from her or her actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The court found that mother was not \u201cdishonest in any of her testimony\u201d but that she \u201ctestified from a particular focus\u201d; the court observed, consistent with Zorich\u2019s testimony, that mother is \u201cextremely bright, but yet the focus becomes on one focus to the exclusion of other possibilities.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe girls are hurt by this. It is clear that mom truly\u2014it comes off that mom has put [stepfather ahead] of the girls [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The above-stated findings of the juvenile court are supported by evidence in the record, and we accept them. However, in explaining its ruling, the court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201cThe fact that [stepfather] was found not a risk of harm under the risk assessment to his own children does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>make him not a risk to other children. That question was kind of very narrowly answered by Dr. Colistro.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">That finding cannot be reconciled with the evidence, and we decline to adopt it. As detailed above, when asked whether, in his professional opinion, stepfather poses a threat of harm to MA and MI, Colistro testified: \u201cI see no basis * * * based on my findings to restrict his contact with them relative to concerns about sexual deviance.\u201d Similarly, Colistro concluded in his written report that the results of his psychological evaluation and psychosexual risk assessment of stepfather \u201cfail to support the hypothesis that [stepfather] poses any significant threat for committing a person-to-person crime in general or a sex crime in particular\u201d and that \u201c[a] sexual person-to-person crime is particularly unlikely [.]\u201d In short, there is no evidence in the record indicating that, as the trial court found, Colistro had distinguished between the risk that stepfather poses to his biological children and the risk that he presents to his stepchildren. Rather, Colistro concluded that stepfather did not present a risk of sexual deviance to any person, <em>including </em>his stepchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Given the trial court\u2019s error in that regard, and for the reasons expressed previously, 255 Or App at 298-99, we engage in <em>de novo </em>review and, pursuant to that review, determine that the evidence is insufficient to support jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">ORS 419B.100(l)(c) grants the court \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d in a case involving a child \u201c[w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others.\u201d Under the relevant case law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201ca child\u2019s \u2018condition or circumstances\u2019 warrant the protection of juvenile court jurisdiction when, \u2018under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u2019 <em>State ex rel Juv.

Necessarily implicit in that conclusion is the court\u2019s finding that stepfather continues to pose a threat of sexual abuse to MI and MA and that mother will not take steps to prevent that harm because she does not believe that it exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">There can be no question that the threat of sexual abuse to a child is a \u201cthreat of serious loss or injury\u201d; the issue is whether the state proved that the circumstances here present a current threat of that harm\u2014and one that is reasonably likely to be realized. A. <em>F, </em>243 Or App at 386. Mother argues that it did not, given that the prior abuse occurred four years earlier; it was a one-time incident; stepfather has been determined not to present a current risk for sexual abuse of the children; and mother has agreed to protective measures. The state remonstrates that there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the twins\u2019 welfare because, \u201c[a]t the time of the jurisdictional trial, mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>did not believe that [stepfather had] sexually abused [MI], [stepfather] was residing in the family home, mother and father had joint custody of the twins, and mother had a strained relationship with the twins, especially [MA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Even assuming that stepfather\u2014who has never been charged with or convicted of a sexual offense\u2014can be considered a \u201csex offender,\u201d we have held that, generally, \u201ca person\u2019s status as a sex offender does not <em>per se </em>create a risk of harm to a child.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. G. J. R., </em>254 Or App 436, 445, 295 P3d 672 (2013) (citing <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. N. S., </em>229 Or App 151, 157-58, 211 P3d 293 (2009)). Nor is there a \u201cpresumption that a party\u2019s status as an \u2018untreated\u2019 sex offender presents a safety risk to a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>B. </em>B., 248 Or App at 727).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In <em>G.J.R., </em>we considered whether the circumstances of the father\u2019s convictions for sexual offenses\u2014specifically, three convictions for public indecency involving masturbating in public, one of which took place at a school-owned field\u2014and his failure to complete sex-offender treatment, provided a legally sufficient basis for concluding that there was a current risk of harm to his child, Z. We held that they did not, noting that there was \u201cno evidence that father had reoffended in the 10 years since his last conviction and no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could find that Z fits within the class of father\u2019s victims.\u201d 254 Or App at 445. There was also a lack of evidence that the father\u2019s failure to complete treatment would give rise to a current risk of reoffending. Id. Thus, we concluded, there was an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the circumstances and a risk of harm to Z. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>B. B. </em>is also instructive. In that case, DHS alleged that the children were endangered based on the father\u2019s history of sexual conduct with minors,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which was \u201cunre-mediated,\u201d the father\u2019s failure to complete sex-offender treatment, and the mother\u2019s failure to protect the children from the father. 248 Or App at 722, 729. We held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>those circumstances were insufficient to establish that the children were presently endangered, when there was no evidence that the father had ever sexually abused his children (or even been suspected of having done so) or that he had had inappropriate sexual contact with any other children in the 16 years before the jurisdictional hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 723. Moreover, testimony from the father\u2019s previous sex-offender treatment specialist indicated that \u201cfather could have made changes in his life during the 11 years following father\u2019s last treatment * * * so as not to \u2018recommit these types of offenses,\u201d\u2019 and the testimony of the father\u2019s former probation officer also did not provide a basis for finding that the father\u2019s behavior or condition was \u201cunremediated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">Here, the \u201cnexus\u201d between stepfather\u2019s prior conduct and a potential risk to MI and MA is clearly more pronounced than in either <em>G. J. R. </em>or <em>B. B. </em>Not only are the twins in the same <em>class </em>of victims as stepfather\u2019s prior conduct, one of them <em>is </em>the same victim, a fact that we do not, by any means, intend to minimize. And, the time that has elapsed between stepfather\u2019s sexual conduct and the jurisdictional decision is not nearly as lengthy as in <em>G. J. R. </em>or <em>B. B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Nonetheless, it has been approximately four years since the abuse occurred, and the court expressly found that it was a one-time incident. That finding is amply supported by the record. There is no hint in the record that there has been any sexual behavior by stepfather toward MI since the one incident, even though the incident of abuse was not disclosed and, consequently, there was no intervention. MI consistently denied that stepfather had acted inappropriately with her at any time after the single incident. She told the CAKES interviewer that it was \u201cawkward\u201d between them at first, but \u201ceverything is fine now.\u201d There also is no evidence that stepfather has ever touched MA inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Moreover, Colistro was quite definite in his opinion that stepfather presented no risk of sexual harm to MA and MI, particularly given his social-anxiety disorder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>He wrote, \u201cA sexual person-to-person crime is particularly unlikely given [stepfather\u2019s] intensely felt moral values and the fact that his social anxiety is at its highest in the context of close interpersonal relations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In addition, Zorich, whom the trial court also found credible, opined that mother was capable of being protective even if she did not believe that the abuse had occurred. Indeed, although mother did not believe MA\u2019s disclosure about stepfather, she immediately agreed to a voluntary protection plan so that the twins would not be in his presence. In particular, she agreed that stepfather would leave the home, that MA and MI would stay with father, and that she would have only supervised visits with them. Mother also requested counseling for the twins as soon as she learned about MA\u2019s disclosure. Zorich testified that mother was willing to put into place whatever safety measures were needed to protect her children, including putting cameras in her home. In addition, mother had a policy\u2014the \u201crule of three\u201d\u2014to never let one of the twins be alone in a room with an adult male. Although there was conflicting testimony regarding whether mother consistently applied that policy with regard to stepfather, there is no reason to doubt that she will do so in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Given the totality of those circumstances, we are not persuaded that the evidence is sufficient to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that stepfather\u2019s four-year-old abuse of MI and mother\u2019s denial of that abuse present a current risk of harm to MI and MA. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. M. Q., </em>253 Or App 776, 787, 292 P3d 616 (2012) (\u201cJurisdiction cannot be based on speculation that a parent\u2019s past problems persist at the time of the jurisdictional hearing in the absence of any evidence that the risk, in fact, remains.\u201d); <em>cf. State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. T. S., </em>214 Or App 184, 193, 164 P3d 308, <em>rev </em>den, 343 Or 363 (2007) (reasonable likelihood of harm to the child\u2019s welfare established where the totality of the circumstances included numerous incidents of sexual abuse of the child by the father over a period of several years, past claims that the father had sexually abused two of his other children, father\u2019s writing of a fictional account that described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>graphic detail a father raping his young daughter, which was similar to the sexual abuse claims of the child, and the mother\u2019s hostility toward, and \u201cunwillingness to be vigilant in her protection\u201d of, the child).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">That is the end of the matter as it concerns MI. However, because we must evaluate \u201cwhether the allegations in the petition are <em>collectively </em>sufficient, if proven, to establish jurisdiction,\u201d <em>State v. R. H., </em>237 Or App 245, 251, 239 P3d 505, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 480 (2010) (emphasis in original), we must also evaluate whether the court\u2019s additional finding with respect to MA is sufficient\u2014either alone or when considered in conjunction with the allegations discussed above\u2014to warrant jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(l)(c). We turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The court found that the state proved the allegations in paragraph B of the petition, that is, that mother\u2019s direct and indirect \u201cnegative comments\u201d to MA have \u201ccreated a risk of serious loss or injury to [MA\u2019s] emotional and physical well being.\u201d The court did not separately explain that finding (nor did either party separately address it); however, the court, in explaining its ruling generally, stated that \u201cmom\u2019s whole approach is that [MA] was a liar\u201d and that MA \u201c[is] aware that mom doesn\u2019t believe her.\u201d The court also noted that MA had testified that \u201cthe stress of her mother\u2019s attitude was affecting her\u201d and that \u201cthe cutting was about mom.\u201d Thus, by \u201cnegative comments,\u201d we understand the court to be referring both to comments made by mother to the effect that she did not believe that the abuse occurred and was upset with MA for disclosing it and\u2014because the \u201ccutting\u201d behavior preceded the abuse disclosure\u2014comments that MA understood as meaning that mother favored MI and did not like her and that mother had occasionally called her a \u201cbrat\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">That said, the facts do not support that MA was at risk of \u201cserious loss or injury\u201d as a result of those comments. First, the state failed to present any evidence as to the nature of the physical or emotional injury that MA was reasonably likely to suffer because of mother\u2019s negative comments. Although it is true that the harm may be self-evident in some circumstances, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Although there was some evidence that MA had begun cutting herself because of \u201cstress\u201d due to her relationship with mother, the extent of that behavior is undisclosed in the record. It also appears that no one\u2014 least of all mother\u2014was aware of it until the week of the meeting at the school. In fact, there is no evidence in the record that mother knew that MA was having any emotional difficulties until she learned from the school about the fabricated cancer story. And, most importantly, once mother learned about MA\u2019s actions, she responded appropriately\u2014immediately requesting that MA receive counseling and agreeing to have only supervised visits with MA until the situation could be assessed. Although Zorich concluded that mother\u2019s relationship with MA \u201chas been ruptured and it will be challenging to restore it from both sides\u201d\u2014a fact that mother recognized\u2014and suggested counseling and supervised visits as that process initially got underway, she expressed no concerns about MA being in mother\u2019s care. In short, although the record supports a finding that mother\u2019s parenting of MA has not been ideal, it does not support a conclusion that, under the totality of the circumstances, MA\u2019s welfare is presently endangered. <em>See A. F, </em>243 Or App at 387 (\u201cThe fact that a parent engages in behavior that could negatively affect his or her parenting does not necessarily mean that the behavior can serve as a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction over a child.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 386 (state failed to present any evidence that exposure to child pornography would harm the affected children \u201cin a way and to a degree\u201d that would justify jurisdiction); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v.
