J.</author>\n<p id=\"b414-3\">This case involves an insurance-related dispute arising out of construction defect litigation. Plaintiff Brownstone Homes Condominium Association, an assignee of the insured defendant, A&amp;T Siding, Inc. (A&amp;T), appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiff was not entitled to garnish the proceeds of an insurance policy issued by A&amp;T\u2019s insurer, Capitol Specialty Insurance Co. (Capitol). The trial court\u2019s ruling was based on an application of the holding in <em>Stubblefield v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>267 Or 397, 400-01, 517 P2d 262 (1973) (\u201cthe <em>Stubblefield </em>rule\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff appeals, contending, variously, that (1) the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule is inapposite in a garnishment proceeding pursuant to ORS 18.352 and ORS 742.031; (2) in the circumstances presented here, ORS 31.825 abrogates the operation of the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule; and (3) the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule is inap-posite because the settlement agreement did not \u201cunambiguously and unconditionally\u201d relieve A&amp;T from its obligation to pay the judgment. For the reasons amplified below, we reject each of plaintiff\u2019s arguments. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Where, as here, the material facts are undisputed, we review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for legal error. <em>Povey v. City of Mosier, </em>220 Or App 552, 554, 188 P3d 321, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 460 (2008). We also review the trial court\u2019s construction of ORS 31.825 for legal error. <em>Horton v. Western Protector Ins. </em>Co., 217 Or App 443, 448, 176 P3d 419 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">This case derives from construction defect litigation, in which the plaintiff association filed claims against defendant A&amp;T, a siding subcontractor, for breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and negligence. A&amp;T was insured by two companies, Zurich and Capitol. A&amp;T\u2019s policy with Capitol provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">\u201c[Capitol] will pay those sums that the insured becomes <em>legally obligated to pay as damages </em>because of\u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">On March 14, 2008, plaintiff, A&amp;T, and Zurich entered into a settlement agreement. A&amp;T agreed to stipulate to a judgment against it in favor of plaintiff for $2 million. Zurich agreed to pay plaintiff $900,000 on behalf of A&amp;T. Plaintiff agreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cin no event will it execute upon or permit the execution of the stipulated judgment against A&amp;T or its assets or [Zurich]. [Plaintiff] shall be entitled to seek recovery of the unexecuted portion of [the stipulated judgment] against [Capitol] ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">A&amp;T assigned to plaintiff any claims that A&amp;T had against Capitol under the above-quoted policy. In addition, A&amp;T agreed to \u201creasonably and in good faith cooperate with [plaintiff] in pursuing the rights and claims assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">A stipulated general judgment and money award was entered on November 13, 2008. Plaintiff subsequently served a writ of garnishment on Capitol pursuant to ORS 18.352,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that Capitol was liable for the unpaid portion of the stipulated judgment\u2014approximately $1.1 million. Capitol disputed liability and eventually moved for summary judgment, arguing, as pertinent here, that, under the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule, the settlement agreement extinguished Capitol\u2019s potential liability because Zurich had already satisfied what A&amp;T was \u201clegally obligated to pay.\u201d Capitol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>argued that ORS 31.825<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not abrogate the application of the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule because that statute requires that the assignment occur after entry of judgment and A&amp;T had assigned its rights to plaintiff before a judgment \u201chad been entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\">The trial court agreed with Capitol and granted the motion for summary judgment in a post-judgment order and letter opinion. The court reasoned that the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule was \u201cfatal to plaintiff\u2019s claims,\u201d and that ORS 31.825 was inapplicable because the assignment here \u201coccurred long before the judgment was entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Plaintiff appeals,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contending, variously, that (1) the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule is inapposite in a garnishment proceeding pursuant to ORS 18.352 and ORS 742.031;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) in the circumstances presented here, ORS 31.825 abrogates the operation of the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule; and (3) the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule is inapposite because the settlement agreement did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cunambiguously and unconditionally\u201d relieve A&amp;T from its obligation to pay the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Capitol remonstrates that the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule applies to garnishment actions because plaintiff, as a judgment creditor, \u201csteps into the shoes\u201d of the judgment debtor, A&amp;T, for purposes of prosecuting claims against Capitol and, thus, remains subject to Stubblefield\u2019s constraints.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Capitol further reiterates its assertion that ORS 31.825 is inapposite here because plaintiff\u2019s covenant not to execute the stipulated judgment against A&amp;T antedated the entry of the stipulated judgment. Finally, Capitol asserts that, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s characterization, the nonexecution covenant was unambiguously unconditional.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We address each of plaintiff\u2019s alternative arguments in turn, and ultimately conclude that plaintiff does not have any enforceable claims against Capitol. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We begin with <em>Stubblefield. </em>There, the plaintiff and the insured defendant entered into a settlement agreement in a tort action, which included a stipulated judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50,000. 267 Or at 398. As part of the settlement, the plaintiff also agreed to a covenant not to execute the judgment against the insured for any amount over $5,000, which the insured agreed to pay. In return, the insured assigned to the plaintiff all claims against his insurance company in excess of $5,000 arising out of his policy\u2014a policy that provided that \u201cthe Company will indemnify the Insured for all sums <em>which the Insured shall be legally obligated to pay as damages and expenses </em>* * * \u201d a\u00a3 4oo (emphasis added). The plaintiff then filed an action against the insurer. The insurer prevailed in the trial court, and the plaintiff appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 398-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the result of the nonexecution covenant was that the only sum that the insured was \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d was $5,000. <em>Id. </em>at 400. That amount was expressly excluded from the assignment. Consequently, the court determined that, under the terms of the assignment, \u201cplaintiff acquired no rights which [were] enforceable\u201d against the insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01. <em>See also Lancaster v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>302 Or 62, 726 P2d 371 (1986) (reversing the allowance of summary judgment for the insurer, which had been based on <em>Stubblefield, </em>because ambiguity in the predicate non-execution covenant gave rise to material issues of fact as to whether the insured remained liable under the agreement); <em>Oregon Mutual Ins. Co. v. Gibson, </em>88 Or App 574, 746 P2d 245 (1987) (applying <em>Stubblefield, </em>in a declaratory relief action, concluding that the nonexecution covenant unconditionally insulated the assignor insured from liability and, as a result, the insurer was not liable to the assignee).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">While forthrightly acknowledging <em>Stubblefield\u2019s </em>reasoning and result, plaintiff first asserts that <em>Stubblefield </em>is not controlling here because its rationale is categorically inapposite to garnishment proceedings. Specifically, plaintiff posits that, because plaintiff may proceed directly against Capitol under ORS 18.352 and ORS 742.031, plaintiff\u2019s claim against Capitol is dependent neither on A&amp;T\u2019s rights against Capitol nor on the viability of the assignment of those rights to plaintiff. In response, Capitol invokes <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. v. Reuter, </em>299 Or 155, 700 P2d 236 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In <em>Reuter, </em>after concluding that the defendant insured had no enforceable claims under the terms of his insurance policy, the court considered whether the plaintiff in a tort action against the insured would similarly be barred from asserting coverage. 299 Or at 164. The court reasoned that, if the plaintiff eventually prevailed in her tort action, \u201ctwo avenues against [the insurer] would be open to her. She could garnish [the insurer], <em>[former] </em>ORS 23.230 <em>[renumbered as </em>ORS 18.352 (2003)], or she could sue [the insurer] under <em>[former] </em>ORS 736.320 <em>[renumbered as </em>ORS 742.031 (1989)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that \u201c[a] garnishment gives the judgment creditor plaintiff no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>greater rights against the garnishee than the judgment debtor defendant has.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">\u201cWhether [the plaintiff] would proceed against [the insurer] under ORS [742.031] or under ORS [18.352], either as garnishor or subrogee, [the plaintiffs] rights against [the insurer] are no greater than those of [the defendant insured]. As garnishor [the plaintiff] stands in the shoes of the subrogor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We agree with Capitol that <em>Reuter </em>preempts and precludes plaintiff\u2019s garnishment-based distinction of <em>Stubblefield. </em>Consistently with <em>Reuter, </em>plaintiff\u2019s rights as a garnishor against Capitol are, at most, no greater than those of its judgment debtor, A&amp;T, under the terms of the insurance policy. As noted, under the policy, Capitol is liable to A&amp;T only for \u201cthose sums that [A&amp;T] becomes legally obligated to pay\u201d\u2014and, under <em>Stubblefield, </em>Capitol has no enforceable payment obligations to A&amp;T (and, derivatively, plaintiff). Thus, in this circumstance, there is no material functional difference in the relationship between an assignee and an assignor, as in <em>Stubblefield, </em>and between a garnishor and a judgment debtor, as in <em>Reuter. </em>In sum, under <em>Stubblefield </em>and <em>Reuter, </em>plaintiff\u2014\u201cstanding] in [A&amp;T\u2019s] shoes\u201d\u2014has \u201cno rights which are enforceable by it\u201d against Capitol.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Stubblefield, </em>267 Or at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Plaintiff next contends that ORS 31.825 abrogates the operation of the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule. ORS 31.825 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u201cA defendant in a tort action against whom a judgment has been rendered may assign any cause of action that defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer as a result of the judgment to the plaintiff in whose favor the judgment has been entered. That assignment and any release or covenant given for the assignment shall not extinguish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>cause of action against the insurer unless the assignment specifically so provides.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">The parties\u2019 dispute with respect to the applicability of that statute centers on whether the statute requires a particular sequence of events. Specifically, plaintiff argues that \u201c[n]othing in the text of the statute says that any \u2018assignment and any covenant or release\u2019 must be executed <em>after </em>the \u2018judgment rendered\u2019 for the statute to apply.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Capitol counters that, by its plain language, ORS 31.825 applies only \u201cif the judgment has been entered <em>prior to </em>execution of the Settlement Agreement and its unconditional covenant not to execute.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We agree with Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">ORS 31.825 refers to the judgment using the present perfect verb tense: \u201c[a] defendant in a tort action against whom a judgment <em>has been rendered </em>may assign\u201d; \u201cto the plaintiff in whose favor the judgment <em>has been entered\u201d </em>That tense necessarily connotes that the judgment must be entered before the assignment of rights. We conclude that, by its terms, ORS 31.825 preserves assigned rights against an insurer that \u201cresult from a judgment\u201d that \u201chas been entered\u201d prior to the assignment. <em>Accord Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 498 n 5, 112 P3d 320 (2005) <em>(\u201c\u2018Has been </em>convicted\u2019 is present perfect tense, indicating that the earlier conviction may have taken place at any time before the present\u2014the present being the time of sentencing for the later conviction[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)); <em>State v. Root, </em>202 Or App 491, 494-96, 123 P3d 281 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 308 (2006) (concluding that <em>\u201chas </em>* * * <em>been advised </em>by his or her attending physician the medical use of marijuana may mitigate the symptoms or effects of that debilitating medical condition,\u201d for purposes of an affirmative defense under ORS 475.319(1), \u201ccan only mean at the latest some time prior to arrest\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">That construction of ORS 31.825 comports with the statute\u2019s legislative history. For example, and with particular respect to the timing feature, a proponent of the legislation, Steve Piucci of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association, responded in the affirmative to committee counsel\u2019s question regarding whether a judgment must precede an assignment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201c[Committee Counsel]: But a judgment under the underlying coverage is a precursor to getting the assignment!?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">\u201c[Piucci]: That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 519, Mar 27,1989, Tape 82, Side A.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We note finally that our construction here of the timing feature of ORS 31.825 comports with our prior understanding of the statute\u2019s operation, as expressed in <em>Portland School Dist. v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>241 Or App 161, 249 P3d 148, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 573 (2011). There, the insurer had argued that ORS 31.825 was inapposite \u201cbecause the assignment and release were agreed to * * * before any suit was filed against the contractor.\u201dId at 174-75. We concluded that the timing of the assignment in relation to the entry of judgment did not bar the application of ORS 31.825, because the settlement agreement required a specific sequence of performance that was consistent with ORS <em>31.825\u2014viz., </em>the assignment \u201cwas conditioned upon the filing of a tort action and entry of judgment against the [defendant],\u201d hence, \u201cuntil the stipulated judgment was entered, the [plaintiff] had no enforceable right to assignment and the [defendant] had no enforceable right to release from liability to the [plaintiff].\u201d 241 Or App at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\u201c[ORS 31.825] expressly permits a defendant in a tort action who has received an adverse judgment to assign to the plaintiff in that action any cause of action that the defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer as a result of the judgment. Here, at the time the [plaintiff] and the [defendant] entered into the \u2018Assignment of Claims and Covenant Not to Execute\u2019 the [defendant] was the defendant in an action for negligence brought by the [plaintiff], and <em>a judgment in favor of the [plaintiff] had been entered in that case. </em>As a result of that judgment, the [defendant] had a cause of action against [the insurer] for breach of the insurance contract, which the [defendant] then assigned to the [plaintiff].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">241 Or App at 174 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ORS 31.825 does not apply here, because the order of events in this case does not conform to the statutorily prescribed sequence. Here, the assignment in the March 14, 2008, settlement agreement predated the stipulated judgment that was entered November 13, 2008. Because the judgment had not \u201cbeen entered\u201d at the time of the assignment, ORS 31.825 does not operate, in contravention of <em>Stubblefield\u2019s </em>otherwise controlling principle, to preserve plaintiff\u2019s claims against Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">We turn to plaintiffs third and final alternative argument. Plaintiff invokes <em>Lancaster, </em>302 Or 62, for the proposition that a qualified covenant not to execute does not fully extinguish the legal obligation of the insured and, consequently, does not extinguish the liability of the insurer by application of the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule. Plaintiff argues that the nonexecution covenant here was materially qualified by A&amp;T\u2019s agreement noted above, 255 Or App at 393, to \u201creasonably and in good faith cooperate with [plaintiff] in pursuing the rights and claims assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Capitol responds\u2014and we agree\u2014that <em>Lancaster </em>is materially distinguishable and that the nonexecution covenant between plaintiff and A&amp;T was unambiguously unqualified. In <em>Lancaster, </em>the plaintiff in a tort action entered into a settlement agreement with the defendant insured, which provided that \u201cplaintiff agreed not to execute \u2018personally' on a judgment against [the defendant] in return for [the defendant\u2019s] assignment of his rights, if any, against [the insurance company].\u201d 302 Or at 64. The pertinent portion of the defendant\u2019s insurance policy provided that the insurer would \u201cpay all sums the insured <em>legally must pay as damages.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in Lancaster). The defendant insured stipulated to a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, who then sued the insurer for the amount of the stipulated judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer. The Supreme Court reversed, explaining that the term \u201cpersonally\u201d was ambiguous in that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201ccould have meant *** that plaintiff could not execute against [the defendant\u2019s] personal property but that [the defendant] remained liable as to his real property, or it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>could have meant that plaintiff would not execute against [the defendant] but would execute against the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 68 (footnote omitted). The court concluded that that ambiguity created a factual issue, which precluded summary judgment\u2014viz., whether the insured could be legally obligated to the plaintiff under the terms of the nonexecution covenant. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In the predicate nonexecution covenant here, plaintiff agreed that <em>\u201cin no event </em>will it execute upon or permit the execution of the stipulated judgment against A&amp;T or its assets.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff\u2019s agreement not to execute the judgment against A&amp;T was not conditioned upon A&amp;T\u2019s continued cooperation; rather the nonexecution agreement was unqualified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In sum, the operative nonexecution covenant unconditionally released A&amp;T from any liability to plaintiff. As a result, under the <em>Stubblefield </em>rule, in conjunction with <em>Reuter, </em>plaintiffs have no enforceable claims against Capitol under A&amp;T\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> As we amplify below, the circumstances in <em>Stubblefield </em>were closely analogous to those presented here, involving similar insurance policy language (under which the insurer agreed to pay those sums that the insured was \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d), as well as a settlement agreement by which the tortfeasor insured assigned its rights under the policy to the plaintiff and the plaintiff agreed not to execute on a stipulated judgment against the insured. The Supreme Court concluded that those circumstances precluded the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent action, based on the assignment, against the insurer. The Supreme Court reasoned as follows: (a) given the operation of the nonexecution covenant, the insured assignor was no longer \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d the plaintiff assignee; (b) thus, the insurer had no payment obligation to the assignor insured; and (c) consequently, the plaintiff assignee \u201cacquired no rights which are enforceable by it\u201d against the insurer. 267 Or at 401.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> OES 18.352 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">\u201cWhenever a judgment debtor has a policy of insurance covering liability, or indemnity for any injury or damage to person or property, which injury or damage constituted the cause of action in which the judgment was rendered, the amount covered by the policy of insurance shall be subject to attachment upon the execution issued upon the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> ORS 31.825 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cA defendant in a tort action against whom a judgment has been rendered may assign any cause of action that defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer as a result of the judgment to the plaintiff in whose favor the judgment has been entered.

That threshold response is unavailing in that, as we understand it, plaintiff is merely referring to ORS 742.031 as instructive context for our construction and application of ORS 18.352 in these circumstances, <em>see generally Miller v. Water Wonderland Improvement District, </em>326 Or 306, 309 n 3, 951 P2d 720 (1998) (\u201c[T]he parties may not prevent a court from noticing and invoking an applicable statute by relying only on other sources of law.\u201d). In all events, plaintiff does not advance on appeal any contention as to the operation of ORS 742.031 that differs qualitatively from its argument as to ORS 18.352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\"> That result would obtain regardless of whether plaintiff proceeded before the trial court solely under OES 18.352 or under both ORS 18.352 and ORS 742.031. <em>See Reuter, </em>299 Or at 166 (\u201cWhether [the plaintiff] would proceed against [the insurer] under ORS [742.031] or under ORS [18.352], either as garnishor or subrogee, [the plaintiff\u2019s] rights against [the insurer] are no greater than those of [the defendant insured]. As garnishor [the plaintiff] stands in the shoes of the subrogor.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> In that regard, this case is dispositively distinguishable from <em>Terrain Tamers v. Insurance Marketing Corp., </em>210 Or App 534, 152 P3d 915, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 115 (2007), which plaintiff invokes. There, we concluded that a covenant not to execute was \u201cat least arguably conditional,\u201d in part, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">\u201cit is conditioned upon the [insured\u2019s] good faith prosecution of an action against [the insurer] and the payment of any proceeds from that action. Should [the defendant insured] fail to comply with either of those conditions, it is arguable that [the insured] and its assets would be subject to the [plaintiffs\u2019] execution of the judgment for the full amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Here, unlike in <em>Terrain Tamers, </em>A&amp;T did not agree to pursue claims against Capitol; it merely assigned to plaintiff any claims that it might have against Capitol. Even more significantly, in <em>Terrain Tamers, </em>the nonexecution covenant explicitly provided that the plaintiffs would not execute the judgment \u201conly during the pendency of an action against [the insurer] and that a satisfaction of judgment [would] be entered only upon payment of any proceeds from the action against [the <em>insurer]Id. </em>at 540-41. Plaintiff here did not similarly condition its covenant not to execute the judgment against A&amp;T.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
