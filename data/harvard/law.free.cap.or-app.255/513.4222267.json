J.</author>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of assault in the second degree, ORS 163.175,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s admission of statements that he made in recorded telephone conversations from jail after his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the content of those statements was inadmissible in that it did not pertain to any \u201cnoncharacter\u201d purpose. <em>See </em>OEC 404(3). We agree and, further, determine that the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The circumstances material to our review of the asserted evidentiary error are not in dispute. Defendant was charged with a variety of offenses, including second-degree assault, arising from an encounter with police on January 3, 2010. The gravamen of the second-degree assault charge was that defendant had knowingly caused physical injury to Warrenton Police Officer Richard Kraynak by ramming his car into Kraynak\u2019s police cruiser as he was attempting to flee and elude police. The theory of the defense, as ultimately presented at trial, was that <em>Kraynak\u2019s </em>police car had struck <em>defendant\u2019s </em>car\u2014or, at least, that defendant had not deliberately caused any collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Defendant was arrested immediately after the incident and lodged in the Clatsop County Jail. While incarcerated, defendant made a number of telephone calls to his mother and sister, which jail staff recorded. Those conversations are the object of our consideration. A complete reproduction of the proffered excerpts of those conversations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>would be of no benefit to the bench, the bar, or the public. In general, defendant (a) told his mother and sister that Kraynak (whom he characterized in obscene terms) had fabricated his account of the episode and that other officers (whom he also characterized in obscene terms) had collaborated in that fabrication, and (b) vowed and threatened to take revenge (again, in the most lurid terms) against the officers if he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">For example, notwithstanding his mother\u2019s admonitions during one call that the conversations were being recorded, defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck. Let them play this in my trial. They send me to prison when I\u2019m innocent to something and they will fucking pay. * * * They will fucking pay dearly.\u201d In another of the conversations, defendant, reiterating his rage for \u201csitting in jail facing prison time for something I didn\u2019t fucking do\u201d\u2014and that \u201c[t]he police know it\u201d\u2014threatened to \u201cshove [Kraynak\u2019s] badge right up his * * * asshole\u201d and to \u201cfucking cave his fucking head in.\u201d And, in a final conversation with his mother, defendant vented his rage at police for holding him in jail while a loved one experienced a medical emergency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Do you have any fucking idea what I would do to every fucking motherfucking law enforcement in this county if my girl dies while I\u2019m in here? Any fucking idea what I\u2019ll do? They\u2019ll put me on death row, I\u2019ll tell you that much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: They\u2019ll put me on death row, I\u2019ll go crazy ***.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I fucking hate every goddamn cop, every motherfucker with a badge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTHER]: Tim, it\u2019s not their fault, okay. It\u2019s the officer that arrested you and lied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: It is their fault. It\u2019s all of them, it\u2019s all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTHER]: Tim, they weren\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-13\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: They\u2019re keeping me held in here based on his fucking lies. It\u2019s all of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Before trial, the state sought a ruling on the admissibility of both a CD, and a series of transcripts, of the excerpted conversations. The state argued that the content of those proffered exhibits was relevant for two distinct purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">\u201c[The first is] statements about what he did that night, admissions as to the property crimes [to which] he has already entered guilty pleas [,] and statements about the actual collision that is the basis of Counts 1 [the second-degree assault charge] and 2 [the assault on a public safety officer charge].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cIn other phone calls, or other portions of phone calls, he made statements that are to be threatening statements about Officer Kraynak and police officers in general\u2014those involved in this case in general, and it\u2019s the State\u2019s position that all of these are relevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">With respect to the second <em>category\u2014viz., </em>defendant\u2019s threatening statements, the state asserted that \u201cthose are admissible as they go to [defendant\u2019s] motive and intent that night.\u201d In particular, the prosecutor asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201c[T]hey very clearly show animus on the part of [defendant] towards Officer Kraynak specifically and police officers in general. I think one of the State\u2019s [exhibits] references \u2018All\u2019\u2014expletives\u2014\u2018with a badge.\u2019 And so I think they are relevant to show that animus, that intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201cThe fact that these are statements that happen after the crimes I don\u2019t think is relevant to its admissibility. Certainly, it\u2019s something [defendant] can argue\u2014[defendant] can argue as to how much weight they should be [given by] the jury, but I don\u2019t think it bears on the admissibility of the evidence because it still shows the animus of [defendant] towards the victim of this crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Defense counsel responded first with a generic hearsay objection (which defendant does not renew on appeal) and then focused on defendant\u2019s principal argument, <em>viz., that </em>the obscene, threatening statements were inadmissible\u201ccharacter evidence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">\u201cSo my concern is that these calls and all the rest of the calls that [make] up the subject matter are not the pattern [of] hatred of law enforcement but that he feels that he\u2019s being framed by the local law enforcement officers [.] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201c* * * There\u2019s a lot of foul language and it\u2019s really\u2014it\u2019s called relevant, but it\u2019s really character evidence masked as relevant information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cIn this case all these statements are in frustration about a prosecution; he doesn\u2019t feel this should be going forward; and it\u2019s after the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cSo the State is arguing that he\u2019s predisposed to hating cops because he\u2019s saying after the incident, while he\u2019s in custody feeling that he\u2019s being framed, that he hates all the cops and he says, \u2018All the cops here.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The trial court, without expressing its reasoning, ruled that the CD and transcripts were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"aeh-dedup-0\">The case proceeded to trial on three <em>charges\u2014viz., </em>second-degree assault, assaulting a public safety officer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and criminal mischief in the first degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state, in its casein-chief, submitted, without further argument or objection, the CD recording and transcribed excerpts of the recorded conversations, and the CD was played to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Ultimately, the dispute at trial focused on whether defendant had rammed Kraynak\u2019s police cruiser\u2014or whether Kraynak had struck defendant\u2019s car\u2014and, if the former, whether defendant had acted with a culpable mental state. Kraynak and defendant rendered irreconcilable accounts, and defendant also presented the testimony of an accident reconstruction expert, who concluded that the damage to the vehicles \u201cis not consistent with a deliberate attempt to ram the police vehicle and cause damage to that vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>potential injury to the occupant.\u201d In addition, defendant testified that he did not recognize Kraynak\u2019s vehicle to be a police car until after the collision, and adduced other evidence circumstantially corroborating that perception.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor\u2014who had not referred to the conversations during his initial closing\u2014highlighted them as evincing defendant\u2019s culpable mental state at the time of the January 3 incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201c[With respect to] the threats that you heard made against Officer Kraynak, the threatening language made against [everyone] with a badge, and how he hates every person with a badge. The reason the State offered those, Ladies and Gentlemen, is not to say that [defendant] is a bad guy. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cSo we\u2019re not offering those to paint him in a bad light, [but] we\u2019re offering them because they give you insight into his mind close in time to when this happened. You\u2019ll see the dates on those, they range from *** three days after the incident to about two weeks after the incident. I think that gives you a very, very clear insight into [defendant\u2019s] mind, what he was thinking about at the time of this incident * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The jury convicted defendant of second-degree assault but acquitted him of assaulting a public safety officer and second-degree criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">On appeal, defendant, invoking OEC 404(3),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reiterates that the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s threatening statements in the recorded telephone conversations. Defendant further asserts that, given the centrality of his mental state and the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis in closing on the threatening statements as evincing a culpable mental state, the admission of those statements cannot be deemed harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The state remonstrates that \u201c[t]he statements had a tendency to show that defendant knowingly rammed his car into the police cruiser on the night of the crime. At a minimum, the statements slightly increased the probability that defendant acted with the requisite mental state.\u201d Moreover, in the state\u2019s view, any error as to the admission of those statements was harmless because (however vehemently expressed) they conformed with defendant\u2019s position that he had been falsely accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The question of admissibility warrants only brief discussion. We agree with defendant that the trial court erred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, the only reasonable reading of defendant\u2019s threatening statements, individually and collectively, is that they evince, and were exclusively the product of, defendant\u2019s anger as a result of his arrest and subsequent events. Defendant repeatedly and, in context, consistently related his threats against Kraynak and the police generally to his perception that Kraynak had fabricated his account and his frustration at being unjustly accused: \u201cThey send me to prison when I\u2019m innocent to something and they will fucking pay\u201d; \u201cI fucking hate every goddamn cop, every motherfucker with a badge. * * * They\u2019re keeping me held in here based on his fucking lies. It\u2019s all of them.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Or, stated conversely, nothing in defendant\u2019s threatening statements can plausibly be understood to evince a hostility against the police that antedated the January 3 incident and, thus, was probative of his state of mind as of the time of the collision. That is, nothing in the statements even (in the state\u2019s phrasing) \u201cslightly increased the probability that defendant acted with the requisite mental state.\u201d <em>Accord State v. Klamert, </em>253 Or 485, 488, 455 P2d 607 (1969) (holding that threatening statement the defendant made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>expressing animus against police several weeks before he shot a police officer was admissible in prosecution for that shooting). Accordingly, the threatening statements were inadmissible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The more challenging inquiry is whether, in the totality of the circumstances of this case, that error requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree assault. In <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003), the court described the standard, under Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for reversing on the basis of evidentiary error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict? The correct focus of the inquiry regarding affirmance despite error is on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Again, the primary prejudice that defendant posits is that, in a case that turned on credibility\u2014and, perhaps, circumstantial inferences as to mental state\u2014the threatening statements could have been decisive. As a practical matter on this record, that proposition is hardly self-evident for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The first, and more substantial, is the jury\u2019s disposition itself. As noted, three charges were submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration\u2014second-degree assault (for \u201cknowingly\u201d causing physical injury to another (Kraynak) by means of a car); assaulting a public safety officer (for \u201cknowingly\u201d causing physical injury to Kraynak, \u201ca <em>person defendant knew to be a peace </em>officer,\u201d while Kraynak was acting as an officer); and first-degree criminal mischief (for <em>\u201cintentionally\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>causing property damage to Kraynak\u2019s police car). Again, the jury convicted on the first charge, but acquitted on the other two. The most (at least abstractly) plausible explanation of that verdict is that, (a) while jurors ultimately believed that defendant was culpably responsible for the injury-producing collision, (b) they accepted defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not know that the occupant of the other vehicle was a peace officer\u2014or, at least, jurors concluded that the state had failed to prove that element of the peace officer assault charge, and (c) the jury also determined that the state had failed to prove that defendant acted \u201cintentionally\u201d for purposes of the criminal mischief charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">If jurors had, in fact, relied on the improperly admitted statements as pertaining to defendant\u2019s purported contemporaneous mental state, or if jurors had been inflamed by the content of those statements, one might reasonably have expected that dynamic to have been manifested by way of convictions on either, or both, the peace officer assault charge and the criminal mischief charge <em>(i.e., </em>defendant intentionally rammed Kraynak\u2019s car because he knew it was a police car, and he hated the police). But that did not occur. Instead, jurors convicted only on the one charge that required neither knowledge that the victim was a peace officer nor an intentional mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">A second circumstance also at least plausibly contradicts an inference that the erroneously admitted evidence may have materially skewed the jury\u2019s consideration and, particularly, its assessment of defendant\u2019s credibility: Jurors were aware that defendant had 17 prior felony convictions, including five convictions arising from separate episodes in which he had attempted to elude police officers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, the court instructed jurors that they could consider those convictions for \u201ctheir bearing, if any, on defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d Given the number and diversity of defendant\u2019s properly admitted and properly considered felony convictions, the ultimate prejudicial impact of the erroneously admitted statements is, at least with respect to the jury\u2019s credibility assessment, questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Nevertheless, we conclude that reversal is required. That is so because the erroneously admitted statements were both \u201cqualitatively different than the evidence that the jury heard,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 34, and were presented to the jury as bearing directly on the central issues in the case, <em>viz., </em>defendant\u2019s contemporaneous mental state and his general credibility. <em>Compare Davis, </em>336 Or at 32 (noting that erroneous admission of evidence would be harmless \u201cif the particular issue to which the error pertains has no relationship to the jury\u2019s determination of its verdict\u201d), <em>with State v. Perkins, </em>221 Or App 136, 145, 188 P3d 482 (2008) (concluding that erroneous admission in DUII prosecution of coffee cup containing an alcoholic beverage, which was found in the defendant\u2019s pickup, was reversible error in that that evidence \u201cwent directly to the heart of [the state\u2019s] factual theory of the case\u201d and, thus, was not harmless (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in <em>Perkins)). </em>Indeed, as noted, 255 Or App at 519-20, the prosecutor highlighted the threatening statements in the state\u2019s rebuttal closing argument as being pivotal to the jury\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s contemporaneous mental state. <em>See Perkins, </em>221 Or App at 145 (noting prosecutor\u2019s reference to the erroneously admitted evidence in closing argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">To be sure, as noted, some aspects of the jury\u2019s verdict might belie ultimate prejudice. However, jury verdicts are inscrutable\u2014and, in all events, the jury here <em>did </em>convict defendant of second-degree assault, with its requisite \u201cknowing\u201d culpable mental state. Given the manner in which the case was framed and the content of the erroneously admitted threatening statements, which served only to impugn defendant\u2019s character, we cannot say that there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that that evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict in that potentially dispositive regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Conviction for second-degree assault reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\"> OES 163.175, as pertinent here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the second degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">\u201c(b) Intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">As described below, 255 Or App at 519, defendant also was acquitted of charges of assaulting a public safety officer, ORS 163.208, and criminal mischief in the first degree, ORS 164.365. Defendant pleaded guilty to other charges and does not challenge those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-12\"> Defendant also assigns error to an aspect of the sentence imposed on the conviction for second-degree assault.

For example, defendant did not specifically distinguish among various conversations or, for the most part, among portions of those conversations. However, the trial court was fairly alerted to defendant\u2019s fundamental contention that, within any given conversation and across the conversations collectively, the threatening statements should be excised as inadmissible \u201ccharacter evidence.\u201d <em>See generally Peeples v.
