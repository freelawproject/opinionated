On appeal, she argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss the indictment on statutory speedy trial grounds, because she was \u201cnot brought to trial within a reasonable period of time.\u201d ORS 135.747. Specifically, she argues that more than two years passed between the state\u2019s issuance of a secret indictment and warrant and her subsequent arrest\u2014a delay attributable to the state, which knew defendant\u2019s most recent address but instead attempted to serve the warrant on her at two different addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In response, the state concedes that \u201c26 months elapsed between defendant\u2019s indictment and her eventual arrest.\u201d The state further agrees with defendant that, \u201con the record before this court, that 26-month period is properly attributable to the state and that the information in the record does not demonstrate that that delay was reasonable under the circumstances of the case.\u201d Accordingly, the state concedes, \u201cthe trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession of error. The delay in bringing defendant to trial was unreasonable under the circumstances, and the court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>339 Or 69, 89, 116 P3d 879 (2005) (where \u201cnothing in the record * * * supports the conclusion, or even the implication, that there was good cause for the 21-month delay,\u201d the state \u201cfailed to bring defendant to trial within a \u2018reasonable period of time\u2019 under ORS 135.747\u201d). We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of dismissal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
