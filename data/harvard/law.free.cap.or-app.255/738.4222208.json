On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court committed plain error by failing to merge the guilty verdicts on the two offenses into a single conviction. <em>See State v. Ryder, </em>230 Or App 432, 434-35, 216 P3d 895 (2009) (accepting the state\u2019s concession that the trial court plainly erred in entering two separate convictions for second-degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon, where \u201c[b]oth of those charges arose out of defendant\u2019s concurrent conduct against the same victim-\u2014that is, defendant unlawfully used a knife, a dangerous weapon, against that victim and, by doing so, did intentionally and knowingly cause her physical injury\u201d). The state concedes that this case is materially indistinguishable from <em>Ryder </em>and that the trial court should have merged the guilty verdicts into a single conviction for second-degree assault. We agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession and, for the reasons expressed in <em>Ryder, </em>230 Or App at 435, exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Convictions on Counts 2 and 3 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a single conviction for second-degree assault; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
