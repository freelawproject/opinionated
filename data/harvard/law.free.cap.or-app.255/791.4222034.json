In that order, the director concluded that SAIF had improperly terminated claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance, finding that SAIF had not obtained \u201cnew information\u201d indicating that claimant was no longer eligible for such assistance as then required b <em>j former </em>OAR 436-120-0350 (12/1/07).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners assign error to that conclusion, specifically arguing that three new medical evaluations of claimant conducted over one year after the initial eligibility determination in fact contained \u201cnew information\u201d and that the director therefore erred in refusing to consider that information in making his determination. On review for substantial evidence and substantial reason, ORS <em>183.482(8);Portland Assn. Teachers v. Mult. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>171 Or App 616, 627, 16 P3d 1189 (2000), we agree with petitioners and conclude that the director erred in failing to consider the three new medical evaluations based on an erroneous finding that they contained no \u201cnew information.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">On November 11, 2005, claimant seriously injured his right wrist and left ankle while working as a carpenter for McIntyre. SAIF, McIntyre\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, ultimately accepted claims for \u201cnon-displaced intra-articular fracture of the right distal radius, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear, right, left ankle lateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>puncture wound, and left ankle peroneal tendon partial tear.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A vocational rehabilitation counselor subsequently-prepared an analysis of claimant\u2019s job at the time of injury, an occupational therapist conducted a physical capacity evaluation (PCE), claimant\u2019s attending physician concurred with the PCE, and the claim was initially closed on October 29, 2007, with an award of nine percent whole person impairment based on the injury to claimant\u2019s right wrist.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On that date, SAIF notified claimant that he was eligible for vocational assistance. In turn, based on that eligibility determination, claimant began an approximately 21-month vocational training program at Chemeketa Community College designed to facilitate his transition to the occupation of \u201cbuilding inspector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">As noted, on August 16, 2007, prior to SAIF\u2019s initial closure of the claim and determination that claimant was eligible for vocational assistance, a PCE was performed by an occupational therapist, Maloney. She conducted several tests to measure range of motion, strength (including grip and pinch strength), and functional capacity in claimant\u2019s right wrist. That objective testing produced the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u2022 Range of motion (right compared with left): pronation 60/60, supination 60/75, dorsiflexion 45/65, palmar flexion 30/65, radial deviation 15/20, ulnar deviation 20/30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u2022 Strength: rated 5/5 in all muscles (tested bilaterally), with the exception of \u201c5-/5\u201d strength in the right flexor carpi radialis longus/brevis and the right extensor carpi radialis \u201cwith the extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi ulnaris testing 4+/5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>\u2022 Grip and pinch strength (right compared with left): grip 55/106, lateral prehension 10/21.5, palmar pre-hension 6/16.5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-4\">\u2022 Functional capacity: limited to \u201coccasional\u201d pinching, gripping, and \u201c[d]exterity/[c]oordination\u201d on the right, unable to crawl or climb ladders, rarely able to operate hand controls with the right hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Ultimately, in assessing claimant\u2019s physical capacity in the context of the \u201cessential functions of [his] job at injury[,]\u201d Maloney opined that claimant was \u201cperforming at the light physical demand performance level\u201d and was unable to perform the full duties of his regular work as a carpenter. She specifically concluded that claimant was unable to lift objects weighing over 10 pounds with both hands, carry any object weighing more than 10 pounds for 40 feet or any object weighing more than 15 pounds for 20 feet, push with \u201cmore than rare frequency\u201d with his right hand, frequently use extension ladders, or frequently use \u201cvibrating or impact tools.\u201d She further recommended that claimant \u201c[l]imit loads and forces\u201d to 15 pounds for bilateral tasks, \u201c[l]imit right hand tasks to occasional frequency for pinching, gripping and dexterity!,]\u201d \u201c[a]void crawling and ladder climbing completely!,]\u201d and \u201c[a]void work on unprotected heights, due to slow response with right grip.\u201d Importantly, Maloney later acknowledged, in March 2009, that she \u201conly consider [ed] the findings of [her] testing valid for six months\u201d given that \u201cthe factors quite often change through the passage of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">On June 15, 2007, Dr. Tavakolian, an orthopedic hand surgeon and claimant\u2019s attending physician with respect to the wrist injury, opined that claimant was medically stationary and capable of returning to modified work with restrictions consisting of no pulling or lifting more than 30 pounds and \u201c[n]o hammering.\u201d On September 11, 2007, however, Tavakolian concurred with Maloney\u2019s evaluation and findings\u2014adding that claimant was \u201c[s]ome~ what limited\u201d in repetitive use of his right wrist. Tavakolian made the following objective findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">\u2022 Range of motion (right compared with left): dorsi-flexion 45/60, palmar flexion 35/67, radial deviation 15/20, ulnar deviation 15/25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u2022 Strength: rated 4/5 in the right wrist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Later, on April 3, 2008, claimant again saw Tavakolian, complaining of continued pain in his right wrist. Tavakolian obtained radiographs of the wrist, noted an \u201cabnormality in the cortical contour between the scaphoid and lunate fossa of the distal radius [,]\u201d and otherwise found no radiographic abnormality beyond \u201cslight evidence\u201d of the original fracture. He wrote, \u201c\u00cd would really recommend vocational retraining to [claimant]. He is considering a career in building inspection which I think would be appropriate for his right wrist.\u201d Claimant inquired about a second opinion due to his asserted level of pain and mentioned an orthopedic hand surgeon, Dr. Wilson, to whom Tavakolian referred claimant for evaluation of continued \u201cright wrist pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Wilson examined claimant on September 26, 2008, over one year after the PCE conducted by Maloney. He noted that claimant rated the pain in his right wrist at 3/10 at rest, 5/10 with light use, and 9/10 with \u201cheavier use\u201d and that claimant had \u201cbeen in a splint off and on for approximately two years.\u201d Upon physical examination, Wilson found normal range of motion in claimant\u2019s right wrist with the exception of \u201cslightly decreased active [range of motion] of the right wrist in volar flexion compared to the left.\u201d With respect to strength, Wilson found that claimant\u2019s grip strength \u201cmeasure [d] 65 pounds on the right dominant side and 102 on the left[,]\u201d while his \u201cpinch strength measure [d] 5 on the right and 18 on the left.\u201d Wilson noted \u201ctenderness diffusely across the dorsal aspect of the wrist proximal to the wrist joint in the extensor tendons in compartments 1-6\u201dbut stated that he \u201ccould find no reason that [claimant] was having pain[,]\u201d that \u201c[a] 11 of [claimant\u2019s] wrist instability tests *** [were] normal [,]\u201d and that he found \u201cno other abnormalities in the hand.\u201d Likewise, Wilson opined that X-rays with three views of the wrist \u201cwere completely normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Ultimately, Wilson recorded a diagnostic impression of \u201c[s]ymptom magnification with no evidence for an objective wrist problem [,]\u201d opining that claimant \u201ccould return to full duty without restrictions at whatever job he was doing prior to his injury.\u201d He further stated that he would \u201chighly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>recommend that [claimant] undergo an [independent medical examination (IME)] for additional confirmation of secondary gain behavior as there are literally no objective findings on this patient explaining his pain.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Consistent with Wilson\u2019s recommendation, Dr. Swan conducted an IME of claimant on December 2, 2008, including a chart review and physical examination \u201crequested to determine any ongoing need for treatment and medically stationary status\u201d as well as identification of \u201cability to work issues.\u201d Swan noted that claimant reported continued pain \u201cat a moderately severe level on the dorsum of his right wrist.\u201d After performing a physical examination, Swan made findings as to range of motion in claimant\u2019s right wrist (mirroring Maloney\u2019s methodology in comparing the right and left) as follows: palmar flexion 55/60, dorsiflexion 65/70, radial deviation 22/28, and ulnar deviation 32/36. He noted that the \u201closs of range of motion in the right wrist as compared with the contralateral uninjured left wrist\u201d were \u201cnot unexpected, given the injuries to the right wrist and their treatment.\u201d With respect to strength in the right wrist, Swan stated that \u201c[m]otor strength testing [was] graded 5/5 in all the muscles of the upper extremity including the * * * wrists and the intrinsic muscles of the hand.\u201d Grip-strength testing demonstrated \u201cgrip strength of 80 pounds on the right, [and] 120 pounds on the left,\u201d while \u201c[p]inch grip [was] 28 on the right and 30 on the left.\u201d Swan found \u201cno localizing tenderness that [was] reproducible at the wrist\u201d and \u201cno instability demonstrated in the wrist or the hand\u201d and, although he noted \u201csome increased tenderness at the radial ulnar joint dorsally at the right wrist [,]\u201d he found that it was \u201cnot consistently reproduced\u201d when claimant was distracted. X-rays depicted normal healing, and an MRI conducted on May 8, 2006, in connection with the injury \u201cdemonstrate[d] the ligaments to be intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Swan found that claimant was medically stationary and, in addressing claimant\u2019s condition as a whole in response to questions posed by SAIF, ultimately opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\u201cThe examination of [claimant] is marked by pain behavior. There is verbalization of pain, inconsistent effort on strength testing, giveway findings, which are nonatatomic [sic] and nonphysiologic. There are inconsistencies on palpation and the subjective reports of pain on palpation. There are inconsistencies between demonstrated range of motion in formal testing and in activities throughout the exam, including disrobing and dressing. Strength testing, in particular is notable, and he performs activities both in rip and usage of the wrist * * * that are very inconsistent between the examination activities and on formal testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cI do believe [claimant has] a demonstrated loss of range of motion in the right wrist[.] *** There is no *** muscle strength loss that can be demonstrated on this examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201c[Claimant] does not demonstrate on the examination today any objective valid findings that would require restrictions on his use of his right wrist * * *. There is no basis for work restrictions and [claimant] is capable of performing the regular work that he was performing at the time of injury ***. He may perform the work of a carpenter without restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">\u201cI concur with Dr. Wilson that [claimant] does show clear cut evidence of pain behavior. There is symptom magnification with inconsistent objective findings to support the subjective complaints. *** Given a setting in which [claimant] reported early on a desire not to return to the work he was performing when initially injured, and his repeated expression of his desire to do alternate work, there clearly is secondary gain involved. [Claimant] has also demonstrated, repeatedly, returning for medical care for complaints of pain that are not substantiated by new or objective findings. And given the thoroughness of his evaluation and treatment at every point in time, this also would be most consistent with secondary gain issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Tavakolian initially concurred with Swan\u2019s \u201copinions as they pertain [ed] to [claimant\u2019s] right hand and wrist conditions\u201d; however, soon after, on January 12, 2009, Tavakolian again examined claimant\u2014ultimately noting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>January 29 that his concurrence with Swan had been \u201cpartially in error.\u201d Tavakolian based that statement on claimant\u2019s \u201cclearly documented loss of wrist motion [,]\u201d which, he noted, generally leads to \u201csome loss of strength.\u201d He characterized \u201cthe secondary gain suggestion\u201d as \u201cmere speculation\u201d and ultimately opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">\u201cAlthough I believe [that claimant] may have features of secondary gain as noted in Dr. Swan\u2019s note as well as Dr. Wilson\u2019s note, I also believe that he has wrist stiffness and loss of wrist strength from his original distal radius fracture and TFCC tear. Both distal radius fractures and TFCC tears typically lead to loss of strength and motion and I believe these findings on exam are consistent with [claimant\u2019s] injuries and are not of a psychological nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Tavakolian further \u201cdisagree [d] with [Swan\u2019s] conclusion that [claimant] could return to his regular work\u201d and opined that the \u201cmost accurate assessment of [claimant\u2019s] strength is the [PCE] of August 16, 2007 * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Based on the reports of Wilson and Swan, SAIF concluded that claimant could return to his regular work as a carpenter. Consequently, on January 2, 2009, SAIF terminated claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance and reclosed the claim. Claimant appealed that action on January 29, requesting review by the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Claimant\u2019s request for administrative review of SAIF\u2019s action was initially delegated by the director to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division\u2019s Employment Services Team (EST) \u201cfor investigation and finding of facts.\u201d Subsequently, on April 1, 2009, claimant underwent a medical arbiter panel examination (MAE). Drs. Nagel, Liberatore, and Miller (the MAE panel) reviewed claimant\u2019s medical records and collectively conducted a physical examination. That examination produced the following objective findings regarding claimant\u2019s right wrist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">\u2022 Range of motion (right compared with left): dorsi-flexion 39/42, palmar flexion 66/63, radial deviation 21/30, ulnar deviation 34/54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">\u2022 Strength: rated 5/5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>In addition, the MAE panel found decreased range of motion in claimant\u2019s right elbow, measuring supination at 53 degrees compared with 90 degrees in the contralateral left elbow, and stated that \u201cthe reduced supination of the right elbow can be explained by the wrist injuries.\u201d Ultimately, notwithstanding claimant\u2019s \u201closs of right upper extremity range of motion [,]\u201d the MAE panel opined that claimant was \u201cnot significantly limited in the ability to repetitively use [his] right wrist/ forearm [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">The next day, a vocational reviewer, acting on behalf of EST as the director\u2019s delegate, issued an order setting aside SAIF\u2019s decision to terminate claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance. SAIF sought review of that order, and a hearing was convened before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on December 21, 2009. Following closure of the record, the ALJ issued a proposed and final order on November 3, 2010, affirming EST\u2019s decision to set aside SAIF\u2019s termination of claimant\u2019s eligibility. SAIF then requested director review, and, on February 17, 2011, the director issued a final order affirming both previous orders directing SAIF to restore claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance. The director, in concordance with EST\u2019s analysis, determined that the reports of Wilson, Swan, and the MAE panel \u201cd [id] not constitute new information\u201d within the meaning of OAR 436-120-0350 and therefore could not be considered as a basis for terminating claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Before setting forth the director\u2019s specific reasoning with respect to those medical evaluations, we first provide some background regarding the applicable rule and, in particular, the director\u2019s interpretation of that rule. <em>See Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994) (deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own administrative rule is required if the interpretation is \u201cplausible\u201d and not \u201cinconsistent with the wording of the rule itself, or with the rule\u2019s context, or with any other source of law\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Employment Dept., </em>187 Or App 441, 447-48, 67 P3d 984, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 60 (2003) (\u201cIf the department had interpreted its [own] rule at the conclusion of a contested case proceeding, there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>be no question that we would defer to that interpretation as long as it was plausible.\u201d). Again, OAR 436-120-0350 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">\u201cA worker is ineligible or the worker\u2019s eligibility [for vocational assistance] ends when any of the following conditions apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">\u201c(1) The worker does not or no longer meets the eligibility requirements as defined in <em>[former] </em>OAR 436-120-0320 [(12/1/07)]. <em>The insurer must have obtained new information which did not exist or which the insurer could not have discovered with reasonable effort at the time the insurer determined eligibility.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">(Emphasis added.) The director (beginning with his delegate, the vocational reviewer, in the first of the three orders issued in this proceeding) relied primarily on case law in interpreting that rule. Specifically, the director principally relied upon and adopted our 2001 construction\u2014in <em>Barrett Business Services, Inc. v. Stewart, </em>178 Or App 145, 151, 35 P3d 1055 (2001)\u2014of \u201clater obtained evidence\u201d in the context of so-called \u201cbackup denials\u201d governed by ORS 656.262(6)(a) (1997), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 526, \u00a7 1. In <em>Barrett Business Services, Inc., </em>we stated that \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or \u201clater obtained\u201d evidence \u201cdoes not include new comments on or analyses of <em>preexisting </em>factual data; it <em>includes only new facts in the narrowest sense.\u201d Id. </em>(emphases added). We further stated, mirroring the crux of the language in OAR 436-120-0350(1), that new evidence \u201cdoes not include evidence that the employer either had, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have had, at the time of [claim] acceptance, <em>nor does it include the restatement, reevaluation, analysis, or confirmation of such evidence.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The director adopted those principles in construing the term \u201cnew information\u201d in OAR 436-120-0350, and we conclude that the director\u2019s interpretation was \u201cplausible.\u201d <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com., </em>320 Or at 142.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>With that interpretation of \u201cnew information\u201d in place, the director reasoned as follows in affirming the ALJ\u2019s order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\">\u201cUnder the definition of new evidence established as precedent in the decisions discussed above, the facts upon which [SAIF] relied here do not constitute new information. <em>No new facts were developed in the examinations that occurred after [SAIF] found claimant eligible </em>[for vocational assistance]. The only additional information that became available was the opinions from different doctors [\u2014namely, Wilson, Swan, and the MAE panel]. <em>Those opinions were only a re-evaluation of facts, including claimant\u2019s physical condition, that [SAIF] possessed before it found claimant </em>eligible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">On judicial review, petitioners argue, simply, that the director based the above-quoted findings on a misreading of the record such that his conclusion was not supported by substantial reason.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is, they argue that, in comparison with the information available when SAIF initially found claimant eligible for vocational assistance on October 29, 2007\u2014most importantly the findings made by Maloney and Tavakolian\u2014Wilson\u2019s, Swan\u2019s, and the MAE panel\u2019s reports did not merely constitute \u201cre-evaluation [s]\u201d of preexisting evidence. Rather, petitioners argue, those reports contained new, objective findings based on clinical examination and testing. For instance, petitioners point to the new doctors\u2019 findings regarding both range of motion and strength in claimant\u2019s right wrist, arguing that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>findings constituted \u201c\u2018new information\u2019 compared to what even the PCE reviewer conceded were outdated findings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Claimant responds, for the most part, by addressing the record as a whole as it bears on the merits of SAIF\u2019s termination of claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance. Aside from brief statements concurring with the ALJ\u2019s and the director\u2019s ultimate conclusions that the medical evaluations at issue did not contain any new information, he fails to specifically address petitioners\u2019 contention that Wilson\u2019s, Swan\u2019s, and the MAE panel\u2019s evaluations contained \u201cnew information\u201d within the meaning of OAR 436-120-0350 as interpreted by the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">We agree with petitioners, albeit for a slightly different reason. Although, as noted, petitioners characterize the issue that they raise as one of \u201csubstantial reason,\u201d their contention that the director misread Wilson\u2019s, Swan\u2019s, and the MAJE panel\u2019s evaluations also raises a question of substantial evidence. <em>See Armstrong v. Asten-Hill Co., </em>90 Or App 200, 206, 752 P2d 312 (1988) (substantial evidence supports a finding of fact when, viewing the record as a whole, the evidence would permit a reasonable person to make that finding). That is, viewing the record as a whole, could a reasonable person have concluded that the three new doctors\u2019 reports contained nothing more than \u201cre-evaluation [s]\u201d of preexisting evidence? Stated differently, could a reasonable person have concluded that the three reports did not contain new, objective medical findings regarding the current strength and range of motion in claimant\u2019s right wrist as compared with the PCE and Tavakolian\u2019s 2007 opinions? We conclude that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In comparison with previous testing for range of motion in claimant\u2019s right wrist (prior to SAIF\u2019s initial eligibility determination), the objective findings of Swan and the MAE panel each demonstrate, with the exception of the MAE panel\u2019s findings on ulnar deviation, dramatically increased range of motion in that wrist. For instance, in testing dorsiflexion and palmar flexion in particular, Maloney found differences of 20 degrees and 35 degrees, respectively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>between the range of motion in claimant\u2019s dominant right hand and nondominant left hand. Neither Swan nor the MAE panel found a difference exceeding five degrees after performing the same tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Likewise, with respect to strength in claimant\u2019s right wrist, Maloney and Tavakolian did find some degree of weakness prior to SAIF\u2019s initial eligibility determination. However, Wilson, Swan, and the MAE panel\u2014after physical examinations and objective strength testing\u2014each rated claimant\u2019s strength in the right wrist at 5/5. Wilson additionally measured claimant\u2019s grip strength, with findings indicating an improvement (since Maloney\u2019s 2007 PCE) of at least six pounds of pressure on the dominant right side compared with the left.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Granted, in her PCE, Maloney originally rated claimant\u2019s strength in the right wrist at 5-/5 and 4+/5 and Tavakolian rated it at 4/5\u2014numbers that do not indicate drastic impairment in the first instance. Nevertheless, whatever the degree of the initial impairment findings, after conducting new physical examinations Wilson, Swan, and the MAE panel did discover and report new information\u2014 even \u201cin the narrowest sense,\u201d <em>Barrett Business Services, Inc., </em>178 Or App at 151\u2014and that new information should have been considered by the director rather than dismissed as mere \u201cre-evaluation of facts, including claimant\u2019s physical condition, that [SAIF] possessed before it found claimant eligible [for vocational assistance].\u201d For example, a greater strength rating in claimant\u2019s right wrist (as compared with a rating generated over one year earlier), assessed based on a new physical examination and objective testing, constitutes neither \u201cre-evaluation\u201d nor \u201canalysis\u201d of preexisting evidence. While <em>claimant </em>was indeed \u201cre-evaluat[ed]\u201d by the three new doctors at issue, the preexisting <em>evidence </em>was not; an increased strength rating as described above constitutes new evidence, or \u201cnew information,\u201d in and of itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Finally, our analysis of the director\u2019s factual findings, while primarily resting on review for substantial evidence, also implicates the test of substantial reason. In short, the director unreasonably misread the new medical reports as providing nothing more than \u201cre-evaluation [s]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>of preexisting evidence. <em>See Asten-Hill Co. v. Armstrong, </em>100 Or App 559, 562-63, 787 P2d 890 (1990) (determining that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board \u201cunreasonably\u201d \u201cmisread\u201d and \u201csubstantially misstated\u201d a doctor\u2019s opinion and further identifying \u201c[t]he only reasonable reading\u201d of that opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In sum, under the director\u2019s interpretation of OAR 436-120-0350, to which we defer, the physical examinations and resultant reports of Wilson, Swan, and the MAE panel\u2014 generated well over one year after SAIF initially determined that claimant was eligible for vocational assistance\u2014 provided \u201cnew information\u201d regarding claimant\u2019s right-wrist injury. The director\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was neither supported by substantial evidence nor substantial reason. We therefore conclude that the director erred in refusing to consider the medical reports of Wilson, Swan, and the MAE panel in determining whether SAIF properly terminated claimant\u2019s eligibility for vocational assistance. Accordingly, because the director\u2019s failure to consider that evidence necessarily precluded a finding that SAIF properly terminated claimant\u2019s eligibility given OAR 436-120-0350\u2019s express requirement that the insurer \u201cobtain [ ] new information,\u201d we reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\"> For ease of reading, we refer to SAIF and McIntyre collectively as \u201cpetitioners\u201d unless distinction is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\"> Although OAR, 436-120-0350 was renumbered and amended in 2009, all subsequent references to that rule refer to the December 1,2007, version.
