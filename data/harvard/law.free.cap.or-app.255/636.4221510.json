LUBA\u2019s order affirmed Yamhill County\u2019s approval of respondent Stoller\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> application for a conditional-use permit to construct a new building\u2014including a tasting room, commercial kitchen, storage, and staff offices\u2014-and to host up to 44 events (with meal service) each year\u2014on the Stoller Vineyards property, which is zoned \u201cexclusive farm use\u201d (EFU). Petitioners contend that LUBA\u2019s decision contravenes \u201cthe limits imposed on commercial uses in conjunction with farm use under ORS 215.283(2)(a).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review to determine whether LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance,\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We take the facts from LUBA\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Stoller Vineyards property consists of approximately 373 acres on the site of a former turkey farm. Over 180 acres are currently planted in vineyards, and Stoller plans to plant 30 to 40 more acres of vineyard. Stoller produces 10,000 to 12,000 cases of wine and sells an additional 220 tons of fruit annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In 2003, the county approved Stoller\u2019s application for a winery under the authority of what is now codified as ORS 215.283(l)(n) (establishing wineries as a permitted use in EFU zones) and ORS 215.452 (setting forth the requirements for permitted-use wineries in EFU zones). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>winery included a tasting room. The county\u2019s 2003 decision allowed only the sale of \u201c [i] terns directly related to wine, the sales of which are incidental to the retail sale of wine on-site and do not exceed 25 percent of the total gross receipts of the retail facility,\u201d including a \u201climited service restaurant\u201d as defined in ORS 624.010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also limited Stoller to \u201cthree events of one to three days in duration during a calendar year intended to draw customers to the site for the tasting and purchasing of wine.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On May 31, 2011, Stoller applied for a conditional-use permit (CUP), seeking approval for the construction of a new building located near the existing winery that would include a \u201ctasting room, commercial kitchen, offices and storage.\u201d It also proposed to conduct 44 events per year on the property and requested approval to provide meal service at the events. The county approved Stoller\u2019s application for the building and related activities under ORS 215.283(2)(a) (and related county ordinances) as \u201c[c]ommercial activities that are in conjunction with farm use.\u201d For purposes of our opinion, we will refer to commercial activities that are permitted under ORS 215.283(2)(a) as farm-use-related commercial activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The county\u2019s approval of Stoller\u2019s application was subject to various conditions. As to \u201cevents,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>approved a maximum of 44 events per year, conditioned as follows: (1) nine single-day events limited to 400 attendees; (2) three three-day events limited to 400 attendees per day; (3) one three-day event limited to 300 attendees per day; (4) 21 by-invitation-only, single-day events limited to 200 attendees; and (5) 10 by-invitation-only, single-day events limited to 100 attendees. The CUP further provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201c[t]he events, whether public or private, are allowed only if those events are: 1) directly related to the sale and promotion of wine produced in conjunction with the winery; 2) incidental and subordinate to the retail sale of wine on-site; 3) hosted by the winery or by patrons of the winery; and 4) feature wine produced in conjunction with the winery. The events shall be held between the hours of 8:00 AM and 11:00 PM. The total number of persons permitted on the subject property at any one time, excluding staff, for any one event shall not exceed four hundred (400) persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The CUP also allows catered meals, prepared by a commercial caterer, at any of the events, and authorizes the new on-site commercial kitchen to prepare meals for not more than 72 guests per event.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The CUP also requires annual reporting and imposes an income limitation with regard to these activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">\u201cAn annual report on the facility to show that it meets the conditions related to the events shall be filed with the Planning Director. A fee for such review may be imposed. The gross income from the non [-] wine [-] related activity may not exceed 25 percent of the gross income from the retail sale on-site of wine produced in conjunction with the winery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Petitioners appealed the county\u2019s decision to LUBA, raising three assignments of error\u2014(1) the county erred in allowing the events as a farm-use-related commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>activity under ORS 215.283(2)(a) \u201cbecause a winery is not a farm use\u201d; (2) the county erred in authorizing food service, events, and other uses that exceed those permitted under ORS 215.452; and (3) the county\u2019s findings that the proposed uses satisfy ORS 215.296\u2014the \u201cfarm impact\u201d test\u2014are not based on substantial evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> LUBA rejected each of petitioners\u2019 assignments and affirmed the county\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">On judicial review, petitioners, in a single assignment of error, assert that LUBA \u201c[e]rred in affirming the County\u2019s Decision to allow a new event venue on farm land in contravention to the limits imposed on commercial uses in conjunction with farm use under ORS 215.283(2)(a).\u201d As refined at oral argument, we understand petitioners\u2019 argument to reduce to the following two contentions: (1) the approved commercial activity\u2014in particular, the \u201cevents venue and commercial food service facility\u201d\u2014is a new use that cannot, be considered to be \u201cin conjunction with farm use\u201d under ORS 215.283(2)(a); and (2) even if it is, the level of activity exceeds the \u201cincidental\u201d limitation imposed on such activity under the applicable law. Respondents, on the other hand, contend that this case presents a straightforward application of ORS 215.283(2)(a), as interpreted in this court\u2019s and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Craven v. Jackson </em>County, 94 Or App 49, 764 P2d 931 (1988) <em>(Craven I), aff\u2019d, </em>308 Or 281, 779 P2d 1011 (1989) <em>(Craven II), </em>which the county and LUBA correctly applied. We agree with respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Before addressing petitioners\u2019 specific contentions, we pause briefly to trace the development of the pertinent law. The legislature\u2019s general policy regarding agricultural land use is set forth in ORS 215.243, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">\u201cThe Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201c(1) Open land used for agricultural use is an efficient means of conserving natural resources that constitute an important physical, social, aesthetic and economic asset to all of the people of this state, whether living in rural, urban or metropolitan areas of the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u201c(2) The preservation of a maximum amount of the limited supply of agricultural land is necessary to the conservation of the state\u2019s economic resources and the preservation of such land in large blocks is necessary in maintaining the agricultural economy of the state and for the assurance of adequate, healthful and nutritious food for the people of this state and nation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201c(3) Expansion of urban development into rural areas is a matter of public concern because of the unnecessary increases in costs of community services, conflicts between farm and urban activities and the loss of open space and natural beauty around urban centers occurring as the result of such expansion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c(4) Exclusive farm use zoning as provided by law, substantially limits alternatives to the use of rural land and, with the importance of rural lands to the public, justifies incentives and privileges offered to encourage owners of rural lands to hold such lands in exclusive farm use zones.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The statutory provision under which Stoller\u2019s application was approved was originally enacted in 1983. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 826, \u00a7 17. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201cSubject to ORS 215.288, the following nonfarm uses may be established, subject to the approval of the governing body or its designate in any area zoned for exclusive farm use:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201c(a) Commercial activities that are in conjunction with farm use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">ORS 215.283(2)(a) (1983). Thus, the key wording\u2014\u201ccommercial activities that are in conjunction with farm use\u201d\u2014has not changed since its original enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Both we and the Supreme Court addressed the meaning of that provision in <em>Craven, </em>which involved the approval of an application for a winery on EFU-zoned land. There, LUBA had affirmed Jackson County\u2019s decision approving the applicant\u2019s request to establish a winery on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>23-acre parcel zoned EFU as a farm-use-related commercial activity under ORS 215.283(2) (1987). The winery was to be constructed before the accompanying vineyard was fully planted and would process grapes grown on-site (as its vineyard matured) and at other vineyards. A condition of county approval required the applicant to plant at least 12 acres of grapes within the first five years. Among other things, the conditions also limited \u201cretail sales at the winery to wine and other products produced or bottled on the premises with the exception of cork screws, posters of the winery, wine books, postcards of the winery, glasses and T-shirts bearing the winery name and logo.\u201d <em>Craven I, </em>94 Or App at 51 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The petitioner, an adjacent land owner, sought judicial review before this court, arguing, among other things, that the winery use was not in conjunction with farm use because it would serve tourists rather than farmers. We concluded that it served both, reasoning that \u201c[a] commercial use which assists farmers in processing and marketing crops can be as supportive of agricultural operations as one which aids them in producing crops.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. We also rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201cthe tasting rooms and sale items, such as glasses and T-shirts, are not connected with farm use, whether or not the winery operation itself is.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recognizing that this presented a closer question, we nonetheless concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201c[I]t is consistent with the statute for the county to determine that incidental activities of those kinds can be permitted, to the extent that they are secondary to and support the wine processing and selling activities of the winery. <em>See Cook v. Yamhill County, </em>13 Or LUBA 137 (1985). There is, of course, a risk of the tail wagging the dog in many situations where secondary activities are permitted because they serve primary ones, but petitioner offers no reason for concluding that that risk is present here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Craven II, </em>308 Or 281. The court first considered whether the proposed winery use could be viewed as a \u201cfarm use\u201d under ORS 215.203(2)(a), which\u2014then and now\u2014defines the term to include \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>current employment of land for the primary purpose of obtaining a profit in money by raising, harvesting, and selling crops.\u201d The court concluded that a winery could not be considered to be a farm use under ORS 215.203(2)(a) because that would \u201csubvert[]\u201d the \u201cgoal of preserving land in productive agriculture.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 288. Turning to the question whether the use was permitted under ORS 283.215(2)(a), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201cThe phrase upon which the validity of the CUP turns is \u2018in conjunction with farm use,\u2019 which is not statutorily defined. We believe that, to be \u2018in conjunction with farm use/ the commercial activity must enhance the farming enterprises of the local agricultural community to which the EFU land hosting that commercial activity relates. The agricultural and commercial activities must occur together in the local community to satisfy the statute. Wine production will provide a local market outlet for grapes of other growers in the area, assisting their agricultural efforts. Hopefully, it will also make [the applicant\u2019s] efforts to transform a hayfield into a vineyard successful, thereby increasing both the intensity and value of agricultural products coming from the same acres. Both results fit into the policy of preserving farm land for farm use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cSales of souvenirs which advertise the winery may cause others to come to the area and buy the produce of the vineyards and farms roundabout. Such sales may reinforce the profitability of operations and the likelihood that agricultural use of the land will continue. At least LUBA could reasonably so find, as it did, and interpret the incidental sales of souvenirs with logos as being \u2018in conjunction with farm use.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\"><em>Craven II, </em>308 Or at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>While <em>Craven </em>was pending in the Supreme Court, the 1989 Legislative Assembly enacted legislation to authorize wineries as <em>permitted </em>uses on EFU-zoned land. Specifically, the legislation, which became effective before the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Craven, </em>amended ORS 215.283(1)\u2014which contains a list of nonfarm uses that may be established on EFU land without being subject to additional local critieria<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014to include wineries and enacted what is now codified at ORS 215.452, which established acreage requirements and wine production and marketing limitations for those permitted wineries.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For example, wineries permitted under ORS 215.283(1) were authorized to sell only \u201c[w]ines produced in conjunction with the winery\u201d and [i] terns directly related to wine, the sales of which are incidental to retail sale of wine onsite,\u201d including items \u201cserved by a limited services restaurant, as defined in ORS 624.010.\u201d ORS 215.452(2)(a), (b) (1989).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The history of that legislation indicates that it was enacted to permit certain wineries to be sited on EFU land under a process that is quicker and simpler than the conditional-use process that is available under ORS 215.283(2)(a). <em>See, e.g., </em>Testimony, Senate Committee on Agriculture and Natural Resources, HB 2903-A, May 15, 1989, Ex F (statement of Bill Nelson, Executive Director of the Oregon Winegrowers\u2019 Association) (explaining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>bill represented \u201ccompromise legislation negotiated by the Oregon Winegrowers\u2019 Association, the Department of Land Conservation and Development and by the 1,000 Friends of Oregon in order to provide a simpler means for certain types of wineries to gain land use approvals in Exclusive Farm Use zones\u201d). It is also apparent that the legislature intended to preserve the existing conditional-use pathway under ORS 215.283(2)(a) for siting wineries. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWineries which do not qualify under the fairly restrictive language of this measure can still utilize existing county conditional use permit mechanisms to gain approval for location in EFU zones.\u201d); Tape Recording, House Floor Debate, HB 2903, Apr 20,1989, Tape 15, Side 2 (statement of Rep Ron Cease) (\u201c[C]urrent arrangements for siting wineries through conditional uses by the counties * * * does not change. We are not deleting from that process whatsoever. What the difference here is we have added now, in effect, an additional process which permits some wineries that meet these conditions to be sited this additional way.\u201d); Staff Measure Summary, House Committee on Environment and Energy, HB 2903, Apr 13, 1989 (explaining that \u201c[n]othing in this bill alters the process of siting any larger or differing type winery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">During a special legislative session in 2010, the legislature amended ORS 215.452\u2014the statute governing wineries permitted under the authority of ORS 215.283(1). Or Laws 2010, ch 97, \u00a7 1. Most significantly, the legislation amended ORS 215.452 to explicitly allow those wineries to sell \u201c[i]terns directly related to <em>the sale and promotion </em>of wine produced in conjunction with the winery, the sale of which is incidental to retail sale of wine on-site * * *, wine not produced in conjunction with the winery and gifts,\u201d ORS 215.452(2)(b) (2010) (emphasis added), as well as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">\u201c[s]ervices directly related to the sale and promotion of wine produced in conjunction with the winery, the sale and delivery of which are incidental to retail sale of wine on-site, including private events hosted by the winery or by patrons of the winery, at which wine produced in conjunction with the winery is featured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">ORS 215.452(2)(c) (2010). It also clarified the meaning of \u201cincidental\u201d by imposing a limit on the gross income from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the sale of incidental items and services of not more than \u201c25 percent of the gross income from the retail sale on-site of wine produced in conjunction with the winery.\u201d ORS 215.452(3). The amendments were intended to be a placeholder and were scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2013. Or Laws 2010, ch 97, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; Audio Recording, Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, SB 1055, Feb 9, 2010, at 1:46:32.3 (statement of Sen Jackie Winters), http://www.leg.state.or.us/listn/ (accessed Mar 14, 2013) (noting that the bill was a placeholder and there was not enough time in the session to address all of the \u201cproblems that are out there\u201d with wineries, fruit stands, and other uses).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">That was the state of the law when Stoller applied in 2011 for the permit that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">With that background in mind, we turn back to petitioners\u2019 arguments on review. Before considering petitioners\u2019 primary arguments, we first reject the suggestion made by petitioners in their brief that the option to obtain approval for wineries on EFU-zoned land under ORS 215.283(2)(a) was somehow foreclosed by either the 1989 or 2010 legislation, which permitted, as noted, the siting of wineries that satisfied certain conditions without going through the conditional-use process, or that the requirements for permitted use wineries in that legislation have been superimposed on the ORS 215.283(2)(a) process. Neither enactment made <em>any </em>change to the text of ORS 215.283(2)(a). Moreover, as recounted above, the legislative history of the 1989 legislation indicates that the legislature intended to preserve the \u201cin conjunction with farm use\u201d option under ORS 215.283(2)(a) for wineries that do not meet the requirements of ORS 215.452. Similarly, there is nothing in the history of the 2010 bill to suggest that the legislature intended to foreclose or alter that option.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, as LUBA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>held, the county correctly decided that its approval of Stoller\u2019s CUP application converted its winery and tasting room operations from a permitted-use winery under ORS 215.283(l)(n) and ORS 215.452 to a conditional-use winery under ORS 215.283(2)(a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Turning now to petitioners\u2019 primary contentions, petitioners first assert that LUBA\u2019s \u201cimproper \u2018view\u2019\u201d of the approved use as an \u201cexpansion of a pre-existing winery\u201d rather than a \u201cbrand new use\u2014a \u2018wine tasting facility\u2019 hosting events at the winery and food service\u2014\u201d fatally infected LUBA\u2019s conclusion that the county did not err in approving Stoller\u2019s application under ORS 215.283(2)(a) to conduct farm-use-related commercial activities. Semantics aside,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> petitioners\u2019 argument in that regard essentially reduces to the proposition that the commercial activities at issue here\u2014 that is, a tasting facility hosting events and food service\u2014 are not, and cannot be, activities in conjunction with the vineyard\u2014viz., the \u201cfarm use\u201d\u2014but, at most, are activities in conjunction with the winery, which is a \u201cnonfarm\u201d use. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Craven.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As discussed above, in <em>Craven </em>/, we rejected a strikingly similar argument made by the petitioner in that case\u2014 that is, that tasting rooms and associated retail sale activities \u201care not connected with farm use, whether or not the winery operation itself is.\u201d 94 Or App at 54. We concluded that \u201cincidental activities of those kinds\u201d are permitted as farm-use-related commercial activities \u201cto the extent that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>secondary to and support the wine processing activities of the winery.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that LUBA was entitled to find that the incidental retail activity at issue there was \u201cin conjunction with farm use.\u201d <em>Craven II, </em>308 Or at 289. Thus, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument that a tasting facility and associated wine-marketing activities <em>categorically </em>may not be considered to be \u201cin conjunction with farm use\u201d because such activities are in conjunction with a winery rather than a viticulture farm use.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">That said, we turn to the heart of petitioners\u2019 argument on review, which, as we understand it, is that the activities authorized by the county here\u2014in particular, the 44 authorized events and the commercial kitchen\u2014exceed the scope of what is permissible under ORS 215.283(2)(a), as construed in the <em>Craven </em>decisions, and LUBA erred in concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Petitioners point out that even the limited commercial activities at issue in <em>Craven </em>(other than the winery itself)\u2014that is, the construction of a tasting room and \u201csales of peripheral items, such as glasses and T-shirts\u201d\u2014presented this court with a \u201cclose\u201d question as to whether they were properly considered to be \u201cin conjunction with farm use.\u201d Thus, according to petitioners, it follows that \u201cfacility rentals or other activities that are, at best, tangentially related to the marketing of farm products,\u201d cannot possibly fall within the limited scope established by <em>Craven. </em>They argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u201cLUBA erred in concluding that the County\u2019s approval of 13,000 visitors per year to the Stoller events center could be construed as subordinate to the vineyard, when a significant portion of the events have no connection to the act of farming. There is no comparison between such an urban draw of visitors and the commercial sales of embossed glasses and t-shirts discussed in <em>Craven\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Petitioners are correct, of course, that the nature of some of the commercial activities approved here\u2014in particular, as they emphasize, the events and food-service facility\u2014differs significantly from the sale of souvenirs, T-shirts, posters, and books that were at issue in <em>Craven. </em>However, the type of activity proposed is not necessarily the determining factor; rather, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Craven II, </em>\u201cto be \u2018in conjunction with farm use,\u2019 the commercial activity must enhance the farming enterprises of the local agricultural community to which the EFU land hosting that commercial activity relates.\u201d 308 Or at 289. As we put it in <em>Craven I,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">\u201c[a] commercial use which assists farmers in processing and marketing crops can be as supportive of agricultural operations as one which aids them in producing crops. The fact that the marketing technique may prove to be effective enough to attract travelers hardly means that the farmers whose processed produce the travelers purchase are not benefited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">94 Or App at 54. Similarly, the Supreme Court, in determining that the incidental sale of souvenirs advertising the winery was appropriately permitted as \u201cin conjunction with farm use,\u201d reasoned that that activity, because it might encourage people to visit the area and buy the produce of the vineyards and surrounding farms, may \u201creinforce the profitability of operations and the likelihood that agricultural use of the land will continue.\u201d <em>Craven II, </em>308 Or at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">That is not to say that any commercial activity that is tied, however tangentially, to the marketing of wine is allowable as a farm-use-related commercial activity in connection with a vineyard operation. Rather, it is patent from the <em>Craven </em>decisions that any commercial activity beyond the direct processing and selling of wine must, to be approved as a commercial activity in conjunction with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>farm use of viticulture, be both \u201cincidental\u201d and subordinate to the processing and selling activities of the winery. <em>Craven II, </em>308 Or at 289; <em>Craven I, </em>94 Or App at 54. As we warned in <em>Craven I, </em>the incidental and secondary winery activities cannot become \u201cthe tail [that] wag[s] the dog.\u201d 94 Or App at 54. As always, farm-use-related commercial activity must promote \u201cthe policy of preserving farm land for farm use.\u201d <em>Craven II, </em>308 Or at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">We agree with LUBA that the county\u2019s approval of 44 events annually and a commercial kitchen at the Stoller Winery comes dangerously close to creating a scenario in which the incidental and secondary activities (events and food service) overtake the primary activity (the processing and selling of wine). However, we also conclude that LUBA did not err in determining that, as conditioned, approval of Stoller\u2019s application nonetheless does not fall outside the scope of ORS 215.283(2)(a) as construed in the <em>Craven </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">As discussed, a farm-use-related commercial activity is a conditional use, determined by the county on a case-by-case, fact-specific basis, rather than a permitted use under ORS 215.283(l)(n). Here, the county required that the 44 events be \u201cdirectly related to\u201d the sale and promotion of wine produced at the winery. In addition, income from the approved non-wine-related activity may not exceed 25 percent of the gross income from onsite retail sales of wine from the winery. Moreover, the ability to provide meal service is limited to the 44 events, and the onsite kitchen may not serve more than 72 guests per event. And, Stoller must submit an annual report demonstrating that it is meeting the imposed conditions. We agree with LUBA that those conditions are designed to ensure that the event and food-service activities will remain incidental and secondary to the processing and sale of wine.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Moreover, LUBA concluded\u2014and petitioner does not appear to dispute\u2014that the event and food-service activities are intended to promote Stoller wines and can be reasonably expected to enhance Stoller\u2019s wine marketing. As LUBA concluded, \u201cthe activities, kitchen and tasting room will operate in concert to improve the chances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the Stoller Winery will be successful and continue to provide a customer for Stoller Vineyard\u2019s grapes.\u201d In short, the activities will \u201creinforce the profitability of operations and the likelihood that agricultural use of the land will continue,\u201d <em>Craven II, </em>308 Or at 289, thus promoting the goal of preserving farm land.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that LUBA did not err in affirming the county\u2019s approval of Stoller\u2019s application as \u201c[c]ommercial activities that are in conjunction with farm use\u201d under ORS 215.283(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> For convenience, we refer to respondents Bill Stoller, Stoller Vineyards, Inc., and Red Hills Farm, LLC, as \u201cStoller\u201d in this opinion; \u201crespondents\u201d refers, collectively, to those parties and Yamhill County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\"> Although ORS 215.283 has been amended several times since Stoller completed its application, subsection (2)(a) has not changed.
