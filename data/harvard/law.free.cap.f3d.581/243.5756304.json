No member of the panel nor judge in regular active service of the court having requested that the court be polled on Rehearing En Banc (Fed. R.App. P. and 5th Cir. R. 35), the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b269-24\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b269-25\">The petition for rehearing is denied. We have considered all of the arguments in the petition but limit our discussion to Benson\u2019s assertion that we failed to rule on one of the dispositive issues presented by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-26\">The district court granted summary judgment with respect to Benson\u2019s state law claims after determining that the Defendants were entitled to immunity from civil liability under the Texas Medical Practice Act (\u201cTMPA\u201d). The district court explained that, under the TMPA, peer-review participants are presumed to have acted without malice. It then found that Benson could rebut that presumption only by presenting clear and convincing evidence of malice and that such evidence had not been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>On appeal, Benson\u2019s primary argument was that the district court utilized the wrong evidentiary standard. In particular, Benson maintained that a preponderance of the evidence standard \u2014 rather than a clear and convincing standard\u2014 applied. Our opinion explained in detail that Benson did not properly preserve that alleged error for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In passing, Benson\u2019s initial brief before this Court stated that \u201csufficient evidence exists to overcome either evidentiary standard, but the proper standard to be applied is preponderance of the evidence.\u201d The brief also recounted the relevant evidence in Benson\u2019s favor, but without specific application to either evidentiary standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Benson now argues that we failed to resolve whether the evidence he presented was sufficient to overcome the presumption against malice under the clear and convincing standard. As we were not presented with that as a specific issue, we did not discuss it. Though our opinion, like Benson\u2019s brief, did not expressly apply the evidence presented to the clear and convincing standard, we did articulate this holding: \u201cThe district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity to the Defendants under the TMPA must therefore stand.\u201d Implicit in this holding was our acceptance of the district court\u2019s conclusion that Benson had not presented clear and convincing evidence of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Benson\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
