FRIEDMAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">This matter is before the Court on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court has carefully considered the arguments made by the parties in their papers and the oral arguments presented by counsel in open court on October 10, 2008. The Court has concluded that the indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are preempted by federal law and must be dismissed. The Court has also concluded that the indirect purchaser plaintiffs have stated a federal antitrust claim for injunctive relief and that this claim may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AOP\">The Multidistrict Litigation Panel consolidated eighteen separate class actions, pending in six districts, involving common antitrust allegations against the four major United States railroads and transferred them to this Court on November 6, 2007. The plaintiffs were divided into two putative classes \u2014 those who allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services directly from defendants from July 1, 2003 until at least June 30, 2007 and who were assessed a rail fuel surcharge for the transportation services, and those who allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services indirectly from the defendants and were subject to a similar surcharge. Plaintiffs in both putative classes allege that the defendant railroads violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring to fix prices through their use of fuel surcharges. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs also allege various claims arising from state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment law for the same alleged behavior by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Defendants BNSF Railway Company (\u201cBNSF\u201d), CSX Transportation, Inc. (\u201cCSX\u201d), Norfolk Southern Railway Company (\u201cNS\u201d), and Union Pacific Railway Company (\u201cUP\u201d) moved to dismiss the claims of both putative classes. The Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the direct purchasers\u2019 complaint on November 1, 2008. <em>See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 587 </em>F.Supp.2d 27, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95456 (D.D.C. 2008). The indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 (hereafter \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) complaint, and defendants\u2019 challenge to it, are discussed in this Opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Defendants move to dismiss all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Procedure. They also move to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\n<em>A. Rule 12(b)(6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows dismissal of a complaint if a plaintiff fails \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), the Supreme Court clarified the standard of pleading that a plaintiff must meet in order to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). The Court noted that \u201cFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u2019 in order to \u2018give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965 (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)); <em>see also Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007); <em>Aktieselskabet AF 21 v. Fame Jeans Inc., </em>525 F.3d 8, 15 (D.C.Cir.2008). Although \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must furnish \u201cmore than labels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\u201d to provide the \u201cgrounds\u201d of \u201centitle[ment] to relief.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65; <em>see also Papasan v. Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986). While there is no \u201cprobability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965, \u201csomething beyond ... mere possibility ... must be alleged[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1966. The facts alleged in the complaint \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1965, or must be sufficient \u201cto state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1974. The Court referred to this newly clarified standard as \u201cthe plausibility standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1968 (abandoning the \u201cno set of facts\u201d language from <em>Conley v. </em>Gibson).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \u201cmust accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2200; <em>see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965; <em>Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, </em>500 U.S. 322, 325, 111 S.Ct. 1842, 114 L.Ed.2d 366 (1991); Aktieselskabet AF <em>21 v. Fame Jeans Inc., 525 </em>F.3d at 15. It must construe the complaint \u201cliberally in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and grant plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Kowal v. MCI Communications Corp., </em>16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C.Cir.1994): <em>see also Aktieselskabet AF 21 v. Fame Jeans Inc., </em>525 F.3d at 15. The Court, however, need not accept inferences drawn by plaintiffs if those inferences are unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint; nor must it accept plaintiffs\u2019 legal conclusions. <em>See Kowal v. MCI Communications Corp., </em>16 F.3d at 1276; <em>Browning v. Clinton, </em>292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>B. Rule 12(b)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They therefore may hear only cases entrusted to them by a grant of power contained in either the Constitution or in an act of Congress. <em>See, e.g., Beethoven.com L.L.C. v. Librarian of Congress, </em>394 F.3d 939, 945 (D.C.Cir.2005); <em>Best v. United States, </em>522 F.Supp.2d 252, 254 (D.D.C.2007); <em>Srour v. Barnes, </em>670 F.Supp. 18, 20 (D.D.C.1987) (citing <em>City of Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 511, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973)). Under Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiffs bear the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>den of establishing subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994); <em>Moms Against Mercury v. FDA, </em>483 F.3d 824, 828 (D.C.Cir.2007) (citing <em>Georgiades v. Martin-Trigona, </em>729 F.2d 831, 833 n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1984)). In determining whether to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the Court must accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true. The Court, however, need not accept factual inferences drawn by plaintiffs if those inferences are not supported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must it accept plaintiffs\u2019 legal conclusions. <em>See Best v. United States, </em>522 F.Supp.2d at 255; <em>Primax Recoveries, Inc. v. Lee, </em>260 F.Supp.2d 43, 47 (D.D.C. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">III. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 ALLEGATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Plaintiffs allege that in 2003, the four defendants, who control approximately ninety percent of all rail freight traffic in the United States, sought to increase their revenues through the use of fuel surcharges. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 43. Before Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, defendants would have had to apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of an across-the-board rate increase. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 55. Following deregulation of the railroad industry, however, at least eighty percent of all rail shipments move under private transportation contracts, which are not rate regulated, or are otherwise exempt from rate regulation. Compl. \u00b6 56. Plaintiffs allege that defendants determined that the most efficient means to increase their profits was through the imposition of an across-the-board artificially high and uniform fuel surcharge. Compl. \u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The barrier to this plan, according to plaintiffs, was that many rail freight transportation contracts already included rate escalation provisions that weighted a variety of cost factors, including fuel, based on an index called the All Inclusive Index (the \u201cAll\u201d). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 61. The railroad trade organization known as the Association of American Railroads (\u201cAAR\u201d), which is dominated by the four defendants, publishes this index. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 61. Plaintiffs allege that the All (as well as a related cost index called the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor (\u201cRCAF\u201d)) already accounted accurately for the impact of fuel cost increases. Compl. 11 5, 61. Any actual increase in fuel costs, no matter how large, would be reflected in the All and the RCAF. Compl. \u00b6 61. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to remove fuel from the All so that they could apply a separate \u201cfuel surcharge\u201d as a percentage of the total cost of freight transportation. Compl. \u00b6 62. Doing so permitted plaintiffs to raise total freight prices widely by a given percentage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">According to plaintiffs, top executives from each of the defendants met regularly at various industry conferences and events in the spring of 2003 and thereafter to discuss their industry. Compl. \u00b6 64. Shortly after one such industry meeting, in July 2003, the western railroads (BNSF and UP) began charging identical fuel surcharges based on the U.S. Department of Energy On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price Index. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 65. Plaintiffs allege that this parallel and complex pricing decision was based on an agreement among the defendants. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The next step in the alleged conspiracy, according to plaintiffs, was the defendants\u2019 agreement and collective action to cause the AAR to create a new cost escalation index, the All Inclusive Index Less Fuel (\u201cAIILF\u201d), which removed fuel costs from the prior cost escalation index (the All). Compl. \u00b672. According to plaintiffs, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fendants reached this agreement during the October and December 2003 meetings of the AAR. Compl. \u00b6 71. The index was published in December 2003. Compl. \u00b6 72. Subsequently, and in furtherance of the conspiracy, according to plaintiffs, the eastern railroads (CSX and NS) announced that they would apply identical fuel surcharges based on the West Texas Intermediate Index. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1175-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Plaintiffs allege that at that point, and as a result of these collective actions, defendants each applied their fuel surcharges in the same way \u2014 as a percentage multiplier of the total base rate for rail freight transportation. Compl. \u00b6 84. They were able to do so because, under the AIILF, fuel was no longer included in the general cost escalation index. Plaintiffs allege that this approach yielded defendants billions of dollars of additional profits because the surcharge raised rates far beyond the real increased cost of fuel. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-83, 91. Plaintiffs allege that defendants, in the east and west, coordinated their computation of the surcharges. Compl. \u00b6 89. As a result of this alleged collusion, the eastern and western railroads, respectively, imposed identical fuel surcharges for more than three years. Compl. \u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In sum, relying on the uniformity of fuel surcharges, the creation and use of the AIILF, and various other allegations, plaintiffs contend that defendants conspired to fix prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act as well as the antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws of various states. Plaintiffs further allege that as a result, the members of the plaintiff class have all paid higher prices for unregulated rail freight transportation than they would have absent this asserted unlawful activity. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 112. Defendants have moved to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs have not met the <em>Twombly </em>pleading standard; that plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are all preempted by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (\u201cICCTA\u201d); that plaintiffs lack standing under Article III to claim violations of the laws of states in which they do not reside or do business; that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they have \u201cantitrust standing;\u201d and that plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment and consumer protection claims fail on a number of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The complaint alleges both federal and state antitrust claims as well as state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Plaintiffs must pursue the state claims in order to recover damages, because following <em>Illinois Brick v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 746 \u2014 17, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), only direct purchasers may obtain damage awards under federal antitrust law. As explained in further detail below, the Court finds that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are preempted by ICCTA and must be dismissed. Plaintiffs\u2019 federal antitrust claim survives, however, because they have met the pleading standard enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Twombly </em>and have standing to pursue their claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\n<em>A. The Twombly Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Defendants argue that the complaint does not meet the pleading standard for federal or state antitrust claims as articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The Court previously found that the direct purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, which are substantially similar to the indirect purchasers\u2019 allegations, met the <em>Twombly </em>standard. It therefore denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the direct purchasers\u2019 claims on November 7, 2008. <em>See In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., Mi</em>sc. No. 07-489, 587 F.Supp.2d 27, 32-33, 33-35, 2008 WL 4831214 at *4, *5-7, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95456 at *18-19, 23-26 (D.D.C. Nov. 7, 2008). The defendants do not raise any additional or different arguments as to why the indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 complaint should not be allowed to proceed under <em>Twombly. </em>For the same reasons explained in the Court\u2019s earlier Opinion, the Court finds that the indirect purchasers\u2019 complaint states claims under <em>Twombly, </em>and it therefore will not dismiss their complaint on those grounds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\n<em>B. Federal Preemption of State Law Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims are preempted by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (\u201cICCTA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 <em>et seq. </em>The preemption clause in ICCTA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">The jurisdiction of the [Surface Transportation] Board over \u2014 (1) transportation by rail carriers, and the remedies provided in this part [49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 10101 <em>et seq.] with respect to rates, classifications, rules (including car service, interchange, and other operating rules), practices, routes, services, and facilities of such carriers; </em>and (2) the construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, or facilities, even if the tracks are located, or intended to be located, entirely in one State, is exclusive. Except as otherwise provided in this part [49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 10101 <em>et seq.], </em>the remedies provided under this part [49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 10101 <em>et seq.] with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under Federal or State law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Preemption doctrine is rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. A federal statute preempts state law when (1) the preemptive intent is \u201c \u2018explicitly stated in the statute\u2019s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose\u2019 or (2) the state law \u201cactually conflicts with federal law\u201d; or (3) \u201cfederal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field \u2018as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c \u2018[T]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 of pre-emption analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608 (quoting <em>Malone v. White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504, 98 S.Ct. 1185, 55 L.Ed.2d 443 (1978)); <em>see also Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, </em>No. 9127, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 538, 543, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">The preemption language in ICCTA is plain and explicit: The remedies provided \u201cwith respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under Federal or State law.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501(b). \u201cThe language of the statute could not be more precise.\u201d <em>Friberg v. Kansas City S. Ry., </em>267 F.3d 439, 443 (5th Cir.2001). <em>See also Emerson v. Kansas City S. Ry., </em>503 F.3d 1126, 1128-29 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Green Mt. R.R. Corp. v. Vermont, </em>404 F.3d 638, 641 (2d Cir.2005); <em>City of Auburn v. United States, </em>154 F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir.1998). \u201cThe most natural reading of section 10501(b)(2) is that the federal remedies provided by the ICC Termination Act are the only remedies available as to the regulation of rail transportation, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>federal remedies are exclusive of state remedies except where the ICC Act has expressly provided otherwise.\u201d <em>CSX Transp. v. Georgia PSC, </em>944 F.Supp. 1573, 1581 (N.D.Ga.1996). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is difficult to imagine a broader statement of Congress\u2019s intent to preempt state regulatory authority over railroad operations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">While the enactment of ICCTA was the culmination of a movement toward deregulation of the railroads that began in the late 1970\u2019s, Congress did not intend that the states fill the regulatory void.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulation of railroad operations had always been \u201ca traditionally federal endeavor, to better establish uniformity in such operations and expediency in commerce, and it appears manifest that Congress intended the ICCTA to further that exclusively federal effort, at least in the economic realm.\u201d <em>Friberg v. Kan. City S. Ry., </em>267 F.3d at 443; <em>see also City of Auburn v. United States, </em>154 F.3d at 1029.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, as numerous courts have held, ICCTA preempts the economic regulation of railroads by the states, as well as state laws whose application would unreasonably interfere with a railroad\u2019s operations. <em>See PCS Phosphate Co. v. Norfolk Southern Corp., </em>520 F.Supp.2d 705, 715 (E.D.N.C.2007) (collecting cases). As the Third Circuit put it, \u201cthe Termination Act does not preempt only explicit economic regulation. Rather, it preempts all state laws that may reasonably be said to have the effect of managing or governing rail transportation, while permitting the continued application of laws having a more remote or incidental effect on rail transportation.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York Susquehanna &amp; W. Ry. Corp. v. Jackson, </em>500 F.3d 238, 252 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. City of W. Palm Beach, </em>266 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2001)). The question is always whether the action \u201cwould have the effect of preventing or unreasonably interfering with railroad transportation.\u201d <em>PCS Phosphate Co. v. Norfolk Southern Corp., </em>520 F.Supp.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The states retain their traditional police powers to protect health and safety, which is reserved to them by the Constitution, but only so long as the application of these powers is not unreasonably burdensome on railroad operations. <em>See, e.g., Green Mt. R.R. Corp. v. Vermont, </em>404 F.3d at 642 (\u201cElectrical, plumbing and fire codes, direct environmental regulations enacted for the protection of the public health and safety, and other generally applicable, non-discriminatory regulations and permit requirements would seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>withstand preemption.\u201d); <em>Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. City of W. Palm Beach, </em>266 F.3d at 1339 (application of local zoning laws to a company leasing railroad property was not preempted by ICCTA because \u201cthe zoning ordinances with which [the lessee] must comply, do not burden [the railroad] with the patchwork of regulation that motivated the passage of the ICC-TA.\u201d); <em>Maumee &amp; W.R.R. Corp. and RMW Ventures, LLC </em>\u2014 Petition <em>for Declaratory Order, </em>S.T.B. Dkt. No. 34354, 2004 WL 395835, at *1 (S.T.B. Mar. 2, 2004) (localities retain certain police powers to protect health and safety so long as they do not interfere with interstate rail operations).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">To permit plaintiffs to pursue their state antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment claims against defendant railroads in this case, however, is not the least bit similar to the exercise by states of these non-burdensome police powers through state laws whose application are remote from railroad operations. Rather, for this Court to resolve plaintiffs\u2019 claims would require the application of different state antitrust and consumer protection laws to decide what defendants\u2019 fuel surcharges should have been \u2014 creating just the patchwork of railroad regulation that ICCTA sought to preempt. As the Senate noted when it enacted ICCTA in 1995:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">The hundreds of rail carriers that comprise the railroad industry rely on a nationally uniform system of economic regulation. Subjecting rail carriers to regulatory requirements that vary among the States would greatly undermine the industry\u2019s ability to provide the \u2018seamless\u2019 service that is essential to its shippers and would weaken the industry\u2019s efficiency and competitive viability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKm\"><em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 104-176, at 6 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, p. 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that because Section 10501(b) establishes both the STB\u2019s jurisdiction as well as the preemptive effect of its decisions and remedies, any claims arising out of private railroad contracts (such as the claims at issue here) are not within the STB\u2019s statutory authority and therefore could not be preempted. This argument confuses the STB\u2019s jurisdiction with the scope of federal preemption and assumes that Congress would not have allowed ICCTA to leave a regulatory void. The argument is not supported by either the statute\u2019s language or its legislative history. The Senate Report expressly stated that \u201cnothing in this bill should be construed to authorize States to regulate railroads in areas where Federal regulation has been repealed by this bill.\u201d S. Rep. No. 104-176, at 6 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, p. 793. Similarly, the Conference Committee noted that \u201cintegrated into the statement of general jurisdiction is the delineation of the exclusivity of federal remedies with respect to the regulation of rail transportation.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-422, at 168 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995, pp. 850, 853. And the courts that have considered the matter have recognized that through its deregulation of the railroads, Congress purposely left potential plaintiffs without a federal remedy. As one of the first courts to consider ICC-TA explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">Defendants, however, read the ICC Termination Act\u2019s preemption clause to preempt state remedies only when federal remedies are provided under the Act.... Defendants\u2019 argument reflects a misunderstanding not only of the plain language of section 10501(b)(2), but also of the ICC Termination Act generally. The most natural reading of section 10501(b)(2) is that the federal remedies provided by the ICC Termination Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>are the only remedies available as to the regulation of rail transportation, and that the federal remedies are exclusive of state remedies except where the ICC Act has expressly provided otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\"><em>CSX Transp. v. Georgia PSC, </em>944 F.Supp. at 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Congress has created similarly broad preemption in other industries. Airlines are a prime example \u2014 like railroads, the operation of airlines is necessarily between states, indeed, nationwide. Congress recognized in the Airline Deregulation Act (\u201cADA\u201d) that any regulation of the airlines by individual states would create significant problems, and so it prohibited the enactment or enforcement of state laws or regulations \u201crelated to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1) (previously 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a)(1)), which the Supreme Court concluded preempted even state laws of general applicability because they \u201crelate to\u201d the airline industry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">[Petitioner advances the notion that only state laws specifically addressed to the airline industry are pre-empted, whereas the ADA imposes no constraints on laws of general applicability. Besides creating an utterly irrational loophole (there is little reason why state impairment of the federal scheme should be deemed acceptable so long as it is effected by the particularized application of a general statute), this notion similarly ignores the sweep of the \u201crelating to\u201d language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, </em>504 U.S. 374, 386, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). <em>See also Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, </em>129 S.Ct. at 548 (\u201cthe phrase \u2018relating to\u2019 indicates Congress\u2019 intent to preempt a large area of state law to further its purpose of deregulating the airline industry\u201d). One court expressly held that the ADA preempted the application of state antitrust and consumer protection laws to airlines setting of fares because they \u201crelate to ... a price of an air carrier.\u201d <em>In re Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd., Antitrust Litig., </em>567 F.Supp.2d 1213, 1220 (C.D.Cal.2008). With similarly broad language, ICCTA preempts state laws with \u201crespect to regulation of rail transportation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501(b). Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to defendants\u2019 rates and rate practices under state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws implicate a core concern of the ICCTA \u2014 the regulation of \u201ceconomics and finances of the rail carriage industry,\u201d and, just as with the airline industry, such regulation by the states is preempted. <em>New York Susquehanna &amp; W. Ry. Corp. v. Jackson, </em>500 F.3d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that ICC-TA does not preempt state regulation of contract traffic exempted by Congress from STB regulation under another section of the statute, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10709. Section 10709(c)(1) states that \u201c[a] contract that is authorized by this section, and transportation under such contract, shall not be subject to this part [49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 10101 <em>et seq.\\, </em>and may not be subsequently challenged before the Board or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this part [49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 10101 <em>et </em>seq.V\u2019 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10709(c)(1). Plaintiffs rely on the \u201cshall not be subject to this part\u201d language for their argument that ICCTA\u2019s preemption clause does not apply to any contract traffic, and thus does not apply to any of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, all of which involve contract traffic. But plaintiffs have not cited, nor has the Court discovered, any case that interprets the interplay between Sections 10501 and 10709 in the manner plaintiffs suggest, and the Court is not persuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. Read in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>entirety, the sentence makes clear that Congress intended it to mean only that the STB has no regulatory authority over contract claims, not to create an opportunity for state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">To read the \u201cshall not be subject to this part\u201d language as eliminating ICCTA preemption for all contract traffic would be inconsistent with congressional intent. Contract traffic, or otherwise unregulated traffic, accounts for eighty percent of all rail freight traffic. Compl. \u00b6 56. Through its enactment of ICCTA, Congress intended that \u201cthe Federal scheme of economic regulation and deregulation [of the railroads] ... address and encompass all such regulation and to be completely exclusive. Any other construction would undermine the uniformity of Federal standards and risk the balkanization and subversion of the Federal scheme of minimal regulation for this intrinsically interstate form of transportation.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 104-311, at 95-96 (1995), U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1995, pp. 793, 807-808. Interpreting Section 10709(c) as exempting eighty percent of rail traffic from federal preemption opens that traffic up to the risk of pervasive state regulation of \u201crates\u201d and \u201cpractices,\u201d and would make it impossible for uniform federal standards to govern railroad operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Nor does Section 10709(c)(2)\u2019s references to lawsuits in court, and not before the STB, as the exclusive remedy for alleged breaches of contract by railroads mean that all claims against railroads arising from shipments governed by contract may be brought in federal courts. Under Section 10709(c)(2), courts may rule on breach of contract claims against railroads, a grant of jurisdiction that is necessary for any industry to function. Ensured enforcement of contracts is a basic premise of our economic system. But plaintiffs are not seeking contractual remedies here. Plaintiffs\u2019 desired remedies, through their state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims, are extra-contractual. To allow shippers access to extra-contractual state law remedies against a railroad, simply because they have a contract with the railroad, would gut the purposes of ICCTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument concerning ICC-TA\u2019s evidentiary savings clause, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B)(ii), is similarly unavailing. The savings clause includes the phrase, \u201c[i]n any proceeding in which it is alleged that a carrier was a party to an agreement, conspiracy, or combination in violation of a Federal law cited in subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section or of any similar State law, proof of an agreement, conspiracy, or combination may not be inferred from [certain kinds of evidence].\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B)\u00ae. By this section, Congress provided railroads with certain evidentiary protections, but these protections cannot be transformed into a grant of authority for the enforcement of state antitrust laws that are preempted by ICCTA\u2019s express preemption clause. Had Congress intended that the entire body of state antitrust law not be preempted by Section 10501(b), it would not have created the exception so tangentially. The Court will not rely on plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of this one clause as adequate counterweight to the plain language in Section 10501(b), as well as the run of legislative history and of judicial decisions on ICCTA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">For these reasons, the Court concludes that all of plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are preempted by ICCTA and must be dismissed. Because the Court finds the state claims are preempted as a matter of law, it need not reach the issue of whether the named plaintiffs would have standing to bring state laws claims for states in which they do not reside.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\n<em>C. Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claim is a federal antitrust claim for injunctive relief. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois Brick </em>prohibits claims for damages, but not those for injunctive relief, by indirect purchasers under federal antitrust law. <em>See Illinois Brick v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 746-47, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). <em>See also Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 573, 592-94 (3d Cir.1979). Defendants contend that although <em>Illinois Brick </em>does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 claim for injunctive relief, the claim is barred on other standing grounds and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants specifically allege that (1) the indirect purchaser plaintiffs fail to allege injury resulting from the conspiracy described in the complaint, and (2) any resulting injunction would be duplicative of the results that may be achieved by the direct purchaser plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The essential standing question for antitrust claims for injunctive relief is whether the plaintiffs have alleged an antitrust injury \u2014 namely a \u201cthreatened loss or damage \u2018of the type the antitrust laws were designed to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 104, 113, 107 5.Ct. 484, 93 L.Ed.2d 427 (1986) (quoting <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 486, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977)). Defendants argue that <em>Associated General Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters (\u201cAGC </em>\u201d). which established a multi-factor test to determine whether federal antitrust plaintiffs met prudential standing requirements, governs plaintiffs\u2019 standing. <em>See Associated General Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 542, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The indirect purchaser plaintiffs are correct, however, that the \u201cefficient enforcement factors\u201d identified in <em>AGC </em>do not apply to claims for injunctive relief. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Cargill:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">[I]n <em>Associated General Contractors </em>we considered other factors in addition to antitrust injury to determine whether the petitioner was a proper plaintiff under \u00a7 4 [of the Clayton Act for damages] .... [Hjowever, many of these other factors are not relevant to the standing inquiry under \u00a7 16 [of the Clayton Act for an injunction]..... [The relevant inquiry under Section 16 is whether plaintiffs have alleged an antitrust injury because] the only remedy available is equitable in nature.... [Standing under \u00a7 16 raises no threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative recoveries [once an injunction is imposed].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-13\"><em>Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 104 at 110-11 &amp; nn. 5-6,107 S.Ct. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">The complaint alleges that \u201c[p]laintiffs and the Class have suffered injury, and will continue to suffer injury in their business or property, proximately caused by Defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct, in that they have paid supra-competitive prices for Rail Fuel Surcharges applied to unregulated rail freight transportation services during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the Class Period.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 120. Unlike in the cases cited by defendants, where the alleged injuries harmed a single competitor, through their allegations identifying defendants\u2019 supra-competitive prices, plaintiffs here have alleged an injury to competition itself. <em>See, e.g., Dial A Car v. Transportation, Inc., </em>884 F.Supp. 584, 588 (D.D.C.1995), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part </em>82 F.3d 484 (D.C.Cir.1996). This is precisely the sort of injury that the antitrust laws are intended to protect against. <em>See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., </em>479 U.S. at 115, 107 S.Ct. 484 (\u201cThe antitrust laws ... were enacted for \u2018the protection of <em>competition, </em>not <em>competitors </em>\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original); <em>In re Mercedes-Benz Anti-Trust Litig., </em>157 F.Supp.2d 355, 364 (D.N.J.2001) (\u201cWhere ... it is alleged that consumers paid a price higher than the price that would have been offered had the dealers been competing, the purpose of the antitrust laws is obviously thwarted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Once plaintiffs have alleged an antitrust injury, they must also allege a causal connection between the prohibited behavior and their injury, a requirement common to standing for all plaintiffs. <em>See Arden Wood, Inc. v. United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>480 F.Supp.2d 141, 147 (D.D.C.2007) (\u201c[standing is an Article III requirement under which the plaintiffs must show, at an \u2018irreducible constitutional minimum\u2019: (1) that they have suffered an injury in fact \u2014 the invasion of a legally protected interest; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct (a causal connection); and (3) that a favorable decision on the merits likely will redress the injury.\u201d) (citing <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). <em>See also Weaver\u2019s Cove Energy, LLC v. State of Rhode Island Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgmt., </em>524 F.3d 1330, 1332-33 (D.C.Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Defendants argue that the indirect purchasers fail to allege the necessary causal connection between the charged conspiracy and their injury. In fact, however, the indirect purchasers allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">Agway has been in the business of shipping farm products to various customs clearance yards in Chicago, Illinois and Detroit, Michigan, transferring those products to storage facilities, and re-shipping product from these storage facilities to customers of Agway. Ag-way purchased unregulated freight transport services indirectly from one or more of the Defendants during the Class Period, and paid Rail Fuel surcharges indirectly to Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">... During the Class Period, Fayus was a California-based wholesale and retail outlet for African and Caribbean food products servicing a diverse clientele ranging from small independent restaurants, institutional foodservice establishments as well as supermarkets and grocery stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">At all relevant times during the Class Period, Maroon has been in the business of shipping chemical products to various customs clearance yards ... transferring those products to storage facilities, and re-shipping said products from said storage facilities to customers of Maroon.... Maroon purchased unregulated rail freight transport services indirectly from one or more of the Defendants during the Class Period, and paid Rail Fuel Surcharges indirectly to Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">[Plaintiffs] purchased unregulated rail freight transportation indirectly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>one or more of the Defendants during the Class Period, and during the Class Period one or more of the Defendants assessed Rail Fuel Surcharges on Plaintiffs in connection with that unregulated rail freight transportation. The prices Plaintiffs paid to Defendants for unregulated rail freight transportation services on which Rail Fuel Surcharges were imposed were greater than the prices Plaintiffs would have paid absent the conspiracy alleged herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-31. Defendants\u2019 challenges to these allegations are essentially that plaintiffs purchased the rail freight services <em>indirectly, </em>a fact which, as discussed above, does not, on its own, invalidate their claims for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have alleged an antitrust injury caused by these asserted antitrust violations which their desired injunction may ameliorate; and they have alleged adequate factual detail to trace the injury to defendants\u2019 allegedly collusive activities. The Court finds that they have adequately alleged both antitrust injury and standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Defendants further argue that regardless of whether plaintiffs would otherwise have standing, the Court should dismiss their federal claims on equitable grounds. Doing so, according to defendants, would eliminate the possibility that the indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 desired injunction would be duplicative of the injunction that the direct purchaser plaintiffs seek, would protect defendants against the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees to two sets of lawyers and would promote judicial economy. The Court recognizes the possibility that allowing both the direct and indirect purchasers to proceed with their cases may result in some inefficiency. Because the outcome of the direct purchasers\u2019 case is not yet determined, however, it is not yet known' whether allowing the indirect purchasers to proceed will actually be inefficient. There is no assurance at this point that the direct purchasers will obtain an injunction against defendants. And none of the cases cited by defendants supports dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims before the potentially duplicative injunction is in place. Furthermore, it is possible that a settlement agreement could be reached between defendants and the putative direct purchaser class, a realistic possibility given that the direct purchasers\u2019 claims for money damages are viable. Even if they do not settle before trial, the two putative classes have different attorneys and may pursue different strategies during discovery or at trial, all of which may result in different outcomes. In short, the Court finds that it would be premature to dismiss the indirect purchasers\u2019 federal claim on equitable grounds at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">For these reasons, the Court will grant defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in part and will deny it in part. Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims will be dismissed. Their federal antitrust claim for injunctive relief will not be dismissed.

Congress began deregulating the industry in the late 1970's, first with the enactment of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1980, followed shortly thereafter by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. <em>See City of Auburn v. United States, </em>154 F.3d at 1029 &amp; n. 6. Congress enacted ICCTA in order to complete the railroad deregulation that the earlier statutes had begun. <em>See </em>S. Rep.

Plaintiffs argue that there is always a presumption against finding preemption. Certainly this is true when Congress has legislated in a field the states have traditionally occupied. <em>See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). Conversely, the federal government\u2019s historic regulation of the railroad system counsels against such a presumption in this case. <em>See CSX Transp. v.
