The state appeals, upon the grant of its application filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the order of the trial court dismissing its claim for damages to the state\u2019s general economy against the defendants, the Marsh and McLennan Companies, Inc., and its numerous subsidiary and operating units,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging, inter alia, that they had violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>antitrust act by conspiring to rig bids for the sale of excess casualty insurance. We conclude that the state has standing to pursue a parens patriae antitrust claim for damages to its general economy pursuant to \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The record reveals the following relevant factual allegations and procedural history.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants, who together constitute the world\u2019s largest provider of insurance brokerage and consulting services, have gained considerable market power because of mergers by other key firms in their industry. The defendants\u2019 clients rely on their expertise in choosing their insurance coverage and in deciding the appropriate costs for that coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The defendants, like most brokers, are compensated either by flat fees or by contingency fees based on percentages of the premiums that their clients pay to their insurers. Unbeknownst to their clients, the defendants entered into separate agreements with their insurers, known interchangeably as \u201cplacement service agreements,\u201d \u201cmarket service agreements\u201d or \u201coverrides\u201d (agreements). These agreements resulted in the insurers paying percentage based bonuses to the defendants in exchange for their steering a certain percentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of their clients to the insurers, either for new policies or renewals. The state alleges that the agreements were \u201cpure profit\u201d and became a \u201csignificant source of [the defendants\u2019] income\u201d; specifically, more than one half of their 2003 net income. The state alleges that the agreements created a conflict of interest between the defendants and their clients, as they had the purpose and effect of elevating prices in the market for excess casualty insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In the late 1990s, the defendants created their Global Broking Unit (unit), which required insurance companies that desired to serve their clients to negotiate with one centralized national entity, rather than with regional brokers whose decisions affected insurance placements only in their individual markets. Any insurer desiring access to the defendants\u2019 clients was required to negotiate through the unit, which meant that insurers who refused to enter into agreements with the defendants, or to participate in price fixing or false quotes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were denied access to the defendants\u2019 clients nationwide, rather than just in discrete geographic areas. Thus, the insurers typically consented to pay the agreements, and subsequently increased those payments to attract even more business from the defendants and their clients. Those payments resulted in increased premium prices, which ultimately were paid by the defendants\u2019 clients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, the agreements led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>one insurer to maintain a separate schedule of prices for insurance placed with the defendants\u2019 clients. The defendants\u2019 clients received no benefit in exchange for these increased premiums, as the brokers would place their clients with insurers that would pay them the highest commission regardless of the appropriateness or quality of the insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The state alleges that the defendants\u2019 bid rigging and price fixing scheme resulted in artificially increased premium rates, which were set by them rather than determined by the competitive market. Because of the defendants\u2019 dominant market position and the widespread nature of the scheme, this resulted in increased prices even for those consumers who purchased their coverage from other insurers that did not cooperate with the defendants\u2019 demands. The state alleges that the defendants\u2019 actions caused prices in the market for excess casualty insurance to increase by 15 to 20 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The defendants\u2019 clients that allegedly were harmed by this scheme include some of Connecticut\u2019s largest corporations, universities, hospitals and municipalities. Indeed, the state asserts that even the state government itself was harmed by a secret kickback that an insurer had paid to the defendants and rolled into the premium price, despite the existence of an agreement that the defendants\u2019 commission would be paid only by the state, in an attempt to procure the best possible insurance service and terms for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The state brought this action against the defendants, alleging that their actions violated the antitrust act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and also constituted breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation. With respect to the antitrust claims, the state seeks injunctive relief, damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>injury to its general economy pursuant to \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2), and civil penalties of $250,000 for each violation of the antitrust act pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 35-38.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to its CUTPA claims, the state seeks injunctive relief, an order for an accounting, civil penalties of $5000 for each violation, an order of restitution, an order of disgorgement and attorney\u2019s fees. The state seeks compensatory damages with respect to its common-law counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The defendants subsequently moved to strike, inter alia, the state\u2019s second and third prayers for relief on its antitrust act claim, namely, those counts seeking injunctive relief and damages to the state\u2019s general economy pursuant to \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2). The trial court, sua sponte, raised the issue of its subject matter jurisdiction, namely, whether the state had standing to seek damages to its general economy under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2). Specifically, the trial court noted that the state\u2019s authority to pursue general economic damages under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) is not altogether clear when that statute is read in conjunction with General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides that \u201cthe courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes\u201d when construing the antitrust act. The trial court determined that \u00a7 35-44b and our decision in <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>260 Conn. 59, 793 A.2d 1048 (2002), require that the antitrust act be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that states may not pursue parens patriae actions for damages to their general economies under the federal Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 et seq. See <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>405 U.S. 251, 264, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972). The trial court concluded that, because <em>Standard Oil Co. of California </em>would preclude the state from pursuing parens patriae actions in federal court under \u00a7 35-32 (d) (1) and (2), except on behalf of individuals and direct purchasers, by extension it also would preclude the state from making similar claims in state court under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the state lacked \u201cstanding to assert a claim as parens patriae for damages to the general economy,\u201d and dismissed that claim. The trial court then considered the remaining claims in the defendants\u2019 motion to strike and denied that motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This certified interlocutory appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On appeal, the state contends that the trial court improperly concluded that it lacks standing under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) to pursue a parens patriae claim for damages to its general economy. Specifically, the state argues that the trial court misinterpreted \u00a7 35-44b as requiring the complete incorporation of federal law into the state antitrust law. The state relies on our decision in <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>273 Conn. 786, 873 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>965 (2005), and contends that \u00a7 35-44b makes federal case law merely persuasive authority in the present case as the relevant state and federal statutes are fundamentally different, because, unlike \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2), the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c, does not expressly provide for the availability of general economic damages. The state also contends that it will be able to prove that the damages to its general economy are not duplicative of the defendants\u2019 overcharges to their clients, and reasonably may be estimated under the economic principle known as the \u201cmultiplier effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In response, the defendants contend that the statutory bar against duplicative recovery is consistent with the concerns expressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of </em>California, supra, 405 U.S. 251, and operates to preclude the state\u2019s claim for damages to its general economy because any such damages would be duplicative of those recoverable under subsection (c) (1) of \u00a7 35-32. Specifically, the defendants argue that the general economic damages claimed by the state, namely, a diminution of the funds available to circulate throughout the state\u2019s economy, are the same as the damages claimed by the affected businesses, namely, moneys that those victims would have been able to invest in different ways. The defendants also contend that denial of standing to pursue general economic damages is consistent with the direct purchaser rule that this state follows in antitrust cases; see <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 76-77; because those damages similarly are difficult to calculate due to their remote nature, and are not properly measured by the statistical models cited by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u201cThe standard of review for a court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss is well settled. A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>nation] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo. . . . When a . . . court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light. ... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. . . . The motion to dismiss . . . admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogswell </em>v. <em>American Transit Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 505, 516, 923 A.2d 638 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The issue in this case, namely, whether \u00a7 35-32 (c) affords the state parens patriae standing to pursue a claim for damages to its general economy, raises a question of statutory construction, which is a \u201c[question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Felician Sisters of St. Francis of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Historic District Commission, </em>284 Conn. 838, 847, 937 A.2d 39 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We begin, of course, with the language of \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2), which permits the attorney general to bring an action in the name of the state as \u201cparens patriae with respect to damages to the general economy of the state or any political subdivision thereof; provided that such damages shall not be duplicative of those recoverable under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\u201d Subdivision (1) of subsection (c) permits the attorney general to bring an action as \u201cparens patriae for persons residing in the state with respect to damages sustained by such persons, or, if the court finds in its discretion that the interests of justice so require, as a representative of a class or classes consisting of persons residing in the state who have been damaged . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-32 (c) (1). The plain language of \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) read by itself clearly permits the attorney general to bring a parens patriae action for \u201cdamages to the general economy of the state,\u201d so long as those damages are \u201cnot . . . duplicative of those recoverable\u201d under subdivision (1), which are by the state on behalf of \u201cpersons residing in the state with respect to damages sustained by such persons,\u201d or \u201cas a representative of a class or classes consisting of persons residing in the state who have been damaged . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In construing \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2), however, we also are mindful of the legislature\u2019s directive in \u00a7 35-44b, which provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d The defendants contend that \u00a7 35-44b requires us to follow the relevant federal case and statutory law, spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>cifically <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>supra, 405 U.S. 263-64, in which the United States Supreme Court concluded, inter alia, that \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1970),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> did not permit the state of Hawaii to bring a parens patriae antitrust action for damages to its general economy against numerous petroleum companies because that \u201cwould open the door to duplicative recoveries.\u201d Noting the complexity of measuring injury to a state\u2019s general economy; id., 262-63 n.14; the court reasoned that \u201c[a] large and ultimately indeterminable part of the injury to the \u2018general economy,\u2019 as it is measured by economists, is no more than a reflection of injuries to the \u2018business or property\u2019 of consumers, for which they may recover themselves under \u00a7 4 [of the Clayton Act].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 264. Although Congress reacted to <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>supra, 251, by enacting the Hart-ScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976; 90 Stat. 1394 (1976); codified in relevant part at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>to permit state attorneys general to bring parens patriae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>suits in federal court to recover, inter alia, treble damages; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c (a) (2); \u201con behalf of natural persons residing in such State\u201d; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c (a) (1); see <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Utilicorp United Inc., </em>497 U.S. 199, 218-19, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990); it is undisputed, that even the amended Clayton Act does not provide for damages to the state\u2019s general economy in a federal antitrust proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Our decision in <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC, </em>is, however, illustrative of the purpose and reach of \u00a7 35-44b. In that case, we concluded that \u00a7 35-44b did not render the state action antitrust immunity provided to municipalities by General Statutes \u00a7 35-31 (b)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> coextensive with the broader grant of immunity available under the line of federal case law starting with <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Miller\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 808. We stated that, \u201calthough there is legislative history supporting the defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 35-44b was intended to \u2018create one, national body of law,\u2019 neither that history nor the language of the statute as enacted requires: (1) the repeal of antitrust statutes unique to our state, without a parallel provision in the federal scheme; or (2) the overruling of state case law interpreting those statutes that are specific to Connecticut.\u201d Id., 809. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201c\u00a7 35-44b merely gave legislative imprimatur to what this court had been doing long before its enactment, namely, looking to case law construing relevant federal statutes as persuasive authority.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 809-10; see also <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 15-16, 664 A.2d 719 (1995) (\u201cwe follow federal precedent when we interpret the act unless the text of our antitrust statutes, or other pertinent state law, requires us to interpret it differently\u201d). Thus, we concluded that \u201c\u00a7 35-44b simply is inapplicable in the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ent case, which concerns a state antitrust statute without federal parallel.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Thus, we conclude that \u00a7 35-44b does not deprive the state of standing to pursue a parens patriae action for antitrust damages to its general economy pursuant to \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) or, put differently, require us to incorporate the federal preclusion of general economy damages into the state antitrust scheme. In concluding otherwise, the trial court improperly relied on <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 59, and incorrectly characterized \u00a7 35-32 (c) as having a federal statutory parallel, namely, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c, that requires us to adopt and apply the federal principles as a matter of state law pursuant to \u00a7 35-44b. In <em>Vacco, </em>we followed the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), and concluded that the end user licensee of computer software could not maintain an antitrust action under General Statutes \u00a7 35-35<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> against a software manufacturer because he was not the direct purchaser of the software at issue. See <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 82-84. <em>Vacco </em>is, however, inapposite because it did not involve state statutory language that differs materially from the coordinate federal provision. In contrast, in the present case, although \u00a7 35-32 (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>like the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c, permits the state attorney general to bring a parens patriae action, the statutory parallel turns perpendicular at that point because there is a crucial substantive linguistic difference between the state and federal statutes, namely, the clear authorization for the attorney general under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) to seek \u201cdamages to the [state\u2019s] general economy . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This, therefore, renders the present case more analogous to <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC, </em>which similarly presented this court with substantively different state and federal laws. See <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 808-809.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Put differently, the trial court\u2019s reading of \u00a7\u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) and 35-44b would render the general economy damages provision of \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) superfluous, a result we cannot countenance; see, e.g., <em>Small </em>v. <em>Going Forward, Inc., </em>281 Conn. 417, 424, 915 A.2d 298 (2007); in the absence of statutory language that requires the \u201cwholesale incorporation of federal [antitrust] law\u201d and the repeal of differing state law provisions. <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 809-10 n.24; see id., 812. Thus, we again emphasize that \u201c\u00a7 35-44b do[es] not necessarily counsel blind adherence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>all things federal.\u201d Id., 809-10 n.24. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) confers standing upon the state to pursue a parens patriae claim for antitrust damages to its general economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The defendants claim, however, as an alternate ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that the state\u2019s claim for general economy damages should be stricken as legally insufficient under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2) because those damages are duplicative of those recoverable pursuant to \u00a7 35-32 (c) (l).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendants argue that this statutory bar against the recovery of duplicative damages precludes the state\u2019s claim for general economy damages, which is founded on alleged overcharges by the defendants, the damages for which are measured by the difference between the illegal charges and the price that would have been paid in the absence of the antitrust violation. The defendants further claim that these claims, which could have been recoverable -under subdivision (1) of \u00a7 35-32 (c), have been abandoned by the state in light of earlier settlement agreements in the case between the defendants and certain affected companies. Relying on the rationale behind the direct purchaser rule; see, e.g., <em>Illinois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 720; as well as the common-law bar against remote and speculative damages, the defendants also reject the state\u2019s \u201cmultiplier\u201d theory of damages, under which each dollar of an overcharge that actually affected a Connecticut business is alleged to have resulted in more than a dollar\u2019s worth of harm to the state\u2019s economy. Indeed, the defendants further reject the state\u2019s reliance on statistical economic impact analyses to prove the general economy damages, noting that they \u201c[ignore] the central problem\u201d of \u201cdisentangling] the overcharges from the alleged harm to the general economy in order to avoid the duplicative recovery that the statute forbids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In response, the state emphasizes that general economy damages are more than theoretical, and that our legislature, unlike Congress, expressly made them available in parens patriae antitrust actions under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2). The state contends that multiplier damages are not duplicative of the defendants\u2019 overcharges because the complaint alleges that many of the payments were made to insurers based outside of Connecticut, thereby removing those funds from the Connecticut economy. Emphasizing its quasi-sovereign interest in the development of its economy, the state further emphasizes that only it, under the plain language of the statute, has standing to seek these damages, as they are too remote to be recovered by individuals under common-law theories. Finally, the state argues that it is inappropriate to conclude that damages are impossible to prove in the context of a motion to strike under which the court must accept as true the facts pleaded, and that the exact amounts of the damages can be determined through discovery and subsequent expert opinion, and the duplication of damages minimized by deducting damages already paid from the state\u2019s overall recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Taking all facts pleaded in the complaint as true, we conclude that the state adequately has pleaded a cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of action for damages to its general economy. Specifically, the state has pleaded that \u201cConnecticut is the home of many insurance companies as well as other large private employers,\u201d which have \u201ca substantial impact on the general economy of Connecticut.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The state further has alleged that the payments \u201cby Connecticut businesses of the illegal and unfair price increases caused by [the defendants\u2019] bid rigging conspiracy removed mon[eys] from the general economy of Connecticut that otherwise could have and would have been used by companies purchasing excess casualty insurance to invest in the expansion and maintenance of their businesses and products, the purchase of necessary goods and services, and the maintenance and hiring of existing and new employees. This decrease in funds [has] caused less funds to be available to circulate through the general economy of Connecticut for the uses described [previously], caused less economic growth and activity in Connecticut, and thereby damaged the general economy of Connecticut. This damage to Connecticut\u2019s general economy is separate and apart from the direct damage companies sustained by payment of [the defendants\u2019] inflated price.\u201d Finally, the state had alleged that the increased prices for excess casualty insurance caused by the defendants\u2019 bid rigging conspiracy increased the cost of doing business for all companies who had to purchase that insurance, and those costs were \u201cpassed on to Connecticut consumers through increased prices for goods and services . . . [that] removed mon[eys] from the general economy of Connecticut that otherwise could have and would have been used by Connecticut consumers to purchase goods and services, and create economic growth and activity in Connecticut.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>In our view, the defendants\u2019 arguments with respect to the potentially duplicative nature of the damages and injuries pleaded in the state\u2019s complaint implicate potential problems of proof rather than pleading.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is well settled that antitrust injury and damages may be determined by statistical models explained by expert testimony.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>Allapattah Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Exxon </em>Corp., 61 F.

Thus, although the defendants ultimately may be correct that the state\u2019s economic models are unable to separate its claimed general economy damages from those recoverable under \u00a7 35-32 (c) (l),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> it nevertheless would be premature for us to make that determination on the pleadings alone before any discovery has been conducted. Further proceedings surely will lead to a more reasoned evaluation of whatever statistical methodologies are ultimately proffered by the state\u2019s expert witnesses during discovery and at trial. See <em>Lorix </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp., </em>736 N.W.2d 619, 633 (Minn. 2007) (declining to \u201caccept, in the context of a motion to dismiss, [the defendant\u2019s] assertion that [the plaintiffs] damages are so speculative as to render proof impossible\u201d); see also <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>Docket No. 06 CV 5303, 2007 U.S. Dist.

September 25, 2007) (\u201c[W]hile the defendants are correct that proof of damages in this case will be difficult, they have not convinced me that any evidence of damages will be insufficient as a matter of law. After all, antitrust plaintiffs need not prove damages with exactitude at any stage, much less in the pleadings.\u201d); <em>D.R. Ward Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co., </em>470 F.

Again, this argument appears to be more of an attack on the state\u2019s proof, and is not, therefore, well taken at this point as the complaint clearly alleges damages to the general economy that go beyond those occasioned by insurance companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> Our research indicates that two other states, Nevada and Virginia, have statutes that permit expressly such \u201cgeneral economy\u201d damages claims; see Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 598A.160 (1) (2007) (\u201c[t]he Attorney General may bring a civil action for any violation of the provisions of this chapter in the name of the State of Nevada and is entitled to recover damages and secure other relief provided by the provisions of this chapter . . . [b] [a]s parens patriae, with respect to direct or indirect damages to the general economy of the State of Nevada or any political subdivision thereof\u2019); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 59.1-9.15 (d) (2006) (\u201c[t]he Attorney General may bring a civil action to recover damages and secure other relief as provided by this chapter as parens patriae respecting injury to the general economy of the Commonwealth\u201d). Indeed, Nevada specifically envisions the use of statistical evidence to prove such damages, as its statute, which like Connecticut\u2019s was enacted in the wake of <em>Hawaiiv. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>supra, 405 U.S. 251, specifically provides that the state may prove such damages via \u201c[statistical or sampling methods\u201d; Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 598A.160 (2) (a) (1) (2007); or \u201csuch other reasonable system of estimating aggregate damages as the court may permit\u201d; Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 598A.160 (2) (a) (3) (2007); in permitting it to \u201crecover the aggregate damage sustained by the persons on whose behalf this State sues, without separately proving the individual claims of each such person. . . .\u201d Nev. Rev. Stat \u00a7 598A.160 (2) (a) (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> Moreover, the legislature\u2019s adoption of \u00a7 35-32 (c) (2), despite the United States Supreme Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>supra, 405 U.S. 262-63 n.14, of the difficulty of calculating general economy damages and the potential for duplicative recoveries, indicates the legislature\u2019s confidence, which we share, \u201cin the ability of our . . . courts to manage difficult cases.\u201d <em>Lorix </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp., </em>736 N.W.2d 619, 634-35 (Minn. 2007) (permitting indirect purchaser claim to go forward notwithstanding \u201cformidable complexities of proof\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
