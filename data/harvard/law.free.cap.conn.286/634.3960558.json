Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), which permits the limited substantive use of prior inconsistent statements; and (2) his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as articulated by <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). We disagree, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The record reveals the procedural history and the following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found. The defendant is the great uncle of the victim, E.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the early spring of 2003, the defendant babysat for E, who was then five years old, and her older brother, D, at the defendant\u2019s apartment in Waterbury. During that time, the defendant engaged in numerous sexual acts with E, including cunnilingus and digital and penile penetration of her vagina. E\u2019s family did not become aware of the defendant\u2019s conduct until May, 2003, when E approached Annette Dillan, a social worker at her elementary school, and complained of vaginal itching; E then told Dillan and the school nurse that the defendant had kissed her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Dillan notified E\u2019s grandmother, C,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the department of children and families (department) about E\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>allegations, and the department initiated an investigation that was continued by Jacqueline Ortiz, a Waterbury police detective. On June 6, 2003, Sharon Kelly of the Child Guidance Center in Waterbury conducted a videotaped interview of E in conjunction with that investigation. During that interview, E stated that the defendant had kissed her vagina, and also had penetrated her vagina with his penis. E also was examined by Judith Kanz, a pediatric nurse practitioner at Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital in Waterbury, who concluded that E exhibited physical signs that were consistent with sexual abuse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The state subsequently charged the defendant with one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). The defendant was tried before a jury,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the trial court admitted into evidence, over his objection, portions of the videotaped interview of E pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 743. The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on both counts. The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of fifteen years imprisonment, with five years special parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted portions of E\u2019s videotaped interview for substantive purposes pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 743. The defendant also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tends that the admission of the videotaped statement violated <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal. Citing the Appellate Court decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Luis F., </em>85 Conn. App. 264, 856 A.2d 522 (2004), the state offered portions of the videotaped interview into evidence to establish that the defendant had penetrated E\u2019s vagina with his penis, as well as digitally and orally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>dant objected to the admission of the videotape on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ground that E\u2019s trial testimony was not inconsistent with her statements on the videotape because she had not recanted or disavowed portions of that interview; the defendant argued that her trial testimony \u201cis incomplete, not inconsistent . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>claimed that the admission of the videotape would violate <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36, because he would not be able to cross-examine E effectively. After viewing the videotape, the trial court reserved decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The following day at trial, the trial court and the parties further discussed the state\u2019s use of the videotape. The trial court noted that the videotape possibly could be used to refresh E\u2019s recollection about what had happened to her, and would not necessarily need to be played for the jury. The defendant agreed to this, and the videotape was played for the victim, who maintained that she did not remember the defendant touching her body in any way with his penis. Thereafter, Ortiz testified and laid the foundation for the admissibility of the videotape as a fair and accurate representation of the interview. At this point, the videotape was presented to the jury; see footnote 9 of this opinion; and the trial court instructed the jury as to its proper use both to evaluate the credibility of the parties in the case, as well as substantive evidence under <em>Whelan.* </em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">It is well settled that, \u201c[a]n out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>280 Conn. 361, 373, 908 A.2d 506 (2006). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, however, we adopted a hearsay exception \u201callowing the substantive use of prior written inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d \u201cThis rule has also been codified in \u00a7 8-5 (1) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which incorporates all of the developments and clarifications of the <em>Whelan </em>rule that have occurred since <em>Whelan </em>was decided.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 58, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006). In addition to signed documents, the <em>Whelan </em>rule also is applicable to tape-recorded statements that otherwise satisfy its conditions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 313, 579 A.2d 515 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Luis F., </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 267-69 <em>(Whelan </em>rule applicable to videotapes).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The <em>Whelan </em>hearsay exception applies to \u201ca relatively narrow category of prior inconsistent statements . . . [and was] carefully limited ... to those prior statements that carry such substantial indicia of reliability as to warrant their substantive admissibility. As with any statement that is admitted into evidence under a hearsay exception, a statement that satisfies the <em>Whelan </em>criteria may or may not be true in fact. But, as with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>any other statement that qualifies under a hearsay exception, it nevertheless is admissible to establish the truth of the matter asserted because it falls within a class of hearsay evidence that has been deemed sufficiently trustworthy to merit such treatment. Thus, as with all other admissible nonhearsay evidence, we allow the fact finder to determine whether the hearsay statement is credible upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances. Consequently, once the proponent of a prior inconsistent statement has established that the statement satisfies the requirements of <em>Whelan, </em>that statement, like statements satisfying the requirements of other hearsay exceptions, is presumptively admissible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 306, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Before turning to the defendant\u2019s specific claims on appeal, we note that \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>is a matter within the . . . discretion of the trial court. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. . . . On review by this court, therefore, eveiy reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 56; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 217-19, 926 A.2d 633 (2007) (Adopting \u201c \u2018hybrid\u2019 \u201d approach to review of hearsay claims and concluding that \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion. ... In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to the rale of evidence under which admission is being sought.\u201d [Citation omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that the statements in the videotaped interview are inadmissible under the <em>Whelan </em>rale because they were not made under circumstances that demonstrate their reliability and trustworthiness. Specifically, the defendant contends that \u201cE lacked credibility and the capacity to provide reliable statements\u201d because of her mental health and behavioral problems.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant also argues that E\u2019s answers to the interview questions are unreliable because those questions were inappropriately leading, rather than open-ended, and E was \u201chyperactive and fidgety\u201d throughout the entire interview, occasionally giving inappropriate responses to the questions posed to her. See footnote 9 of this opinion. In response, the state argues, inter alia, that this claim was not preserved for appellate review because the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the videotape on this ground deprived the trial court of the opportunity to fulfill its gatekeeping responsibilities with respect to the reliability of <em>Whelan </em>evidence under <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 306-307.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>and conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliability claim is unreviewable because of his failure to object to the videotape on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u201cWe have stated that [t]he standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling. . . . Once counsel states the authority and ground of [the] objection, any appeal will be limited to the ground asserted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\u201cThese requirements are not simply formalities. They serve to alert the trial court to potential error while there is still time for the court to act. . . . Assigning error to a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on the basis of objections never raised at trial unfairly subjects the court and the opposing party to trial by ambush.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>275 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>514, 530-31, 881 A.2d 247, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1048, 126 S. Ct. 773, 163 L. Ed. 2d 600 (2005); id., 531 (declining to review claim that tape-recorded statements were inadmissible under coconspirator hearsay exception when objection at trial was on \u201cdifferent\u201d ground that listener was acting as agent of police when statements were made); see also Practice Book \u00a7 5-5.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">This rule limiting appellate review of evidentiary claims to the ground asserted at trial applies with equal force to <em>Whelan </em>issues. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 388-89, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002) (declining to reach claim that <em>uWhelan </em>requires, inter alia, a finding that memory loss is feigned, not actual, in order for a prior statement to constitute an inconsistent statement\u201d because objection at trial was limited to grounds that proffered grand jury testimony was unsigned, not otherwise sufficiently reliable or trustworthy, and that witness\u2019 \u201cmemory loss rendered her functionally unavailable for cross-examination\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>87 Conn. App. 592, 597-98, 867 A.2d 57 (declining to review claims that statement in document was not sufficiently inconsistent and not made under necessary conditions of reliability and trustworthiness because objection at trial was solely on ground that declarant had not verified document), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 925, 871 A.2d 1032 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Indeed, our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 682 A.2d 972 (1996), is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim. In <em>Newsome, </em>the defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court had, at his probable cause hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>improperly admitted into evidence a witness\u2019 statement to the police that he had witnessed the defendant commit the murder at issue. Id., 594-95. Specifically, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had admitted the statement into evidence under <em>Whelan </em>\u201cbecause it failed to evince a basis for [the witness\u2019] personal knowledge of the factual allegations it contained, since the statement \u2018failed to state in so many words that the declarant actually saw the defendant shoot [the victim],\u2019 and, therefore, it \u2018left ambiguous whether the declarant had the \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d prerequisite to admitting\u2019 the statement into evidence under <em>Whelan. </em>Moreover, the defendant [also] claim[ed] that the statement failed to provide sufficient detail regarding the incident and that <em>the statement was otherwise too unreliable to be admitted.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 595. We declined to review these claims on appeal because the defendant\u2019s objection to the statement was based solely on the ground that it \u201cwas not inconsistent with his testimony and, therefore, was not admissible under <em>Whelan.\u201d </em>Id., 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s <em>Whelan </em>claim about the reliability of E\u2019s statements is unreviewable on appeal. The defendant\u2019s objections at trial, while well argued, were confined solely to whether E\u2019s trial testimony was inconsistent with her videotaped statement. See footnote 10 of this opinion. Accordingly, because the trial court did not have the opportunity to perform its gatekeeping role under <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 306-307; see footnote 14 of this opinion; this claim is not adequately preserved for appellate review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that E\u2019s trial testimony was, for the purpose of admissibility under <em>Whelan, </em>inconsistent with her videotaped statements. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Luis F., </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 266-67, because that case involved a witness who had recanted her accusations while testifying at trial. The defendant contends that E never disavowed or recanted her accusations, and did not answer, until she was pressured, that she did not recall the defendant penetrating her vagina with his penis. In response, the state argues that, in view of E\u2019s testimony as a whole, the trial court properly exercised its discretion because she testified that she could not remember telling the interviewers that the defendant had put his penis inside her vagina. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cWhether there are inconsistencies between the two statements is properly a matter for the trial court. . . . Inconsistencies may be shown not only by contradictory statements but also by omissions. In determining whether an inconsistency exists, the testimony of a witness as a whole, or the whole impression or effect of what has been said, must be examined. . . . Inconsistency in effect, rather than contradiction in express terms, is the test for admitting a witness\u2019 prior statement . . . and the same principle governs the case of the forgetful witness. ... A statement\u2019s inconsistency may be determined from the circumstances and is not limited to cases in which diametrically opposed assertions have been made. <em>Thus, inconsistencies may be found in changes in position and they may also be found in denial of recollection. . . . </em>The trial court has considerable discretion to determine whether evasive answers are inconsistent with prior statements.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 748-49 n.4; id. (trial court properly concluded that witness\u2019 testimony was inconsistent when he testified at trial that \u201che had no recollection of certain facts within\u201d his statement and \u201cwas unable to recall the specific details of the fight\u201d); see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>283 Conn. 748, 768 n.18, 931 A.2d 198 (2007) (\u201c[t]his court previously rejected a claim that a trial court improperly had determined that a witness\u2019 testimony at trial\u2014that he could not recall certain facts from a prior statement\u2014was inconsistent with his prior statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We discuss briefly the Appellate Court\u2019s well reasoned analysis and application of this general rule in <em>State </em>v. <em>Luis F., </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 264, which was relied on by both the parties and the trial court in the present case. In that case, the teenage victim stated in a videotaped interview that the defendant, her father, inappropriately had touched her breasts and vagina, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>and also had penetrated her vagina with his penis on two occasions. Id., 266. At trial, both the victim and her mother recanted their prior statements to the police about the abuse, and the \u201cvictim testified at trial that she had \u2018made everything up\u2019 \u201d in order to get out of the family\u2019s house, and also \u201cthat she did not recall stating during her interview . . . that the defendant had sexual intercourse with her.\u201d Id., 267. The Appellate Court noted that the \u201cdispositive issue [was] whether the victim\u2019s statements on the videotape were inconsistent with her testimony at trial.\u201d Id., 269-70. That court cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 748 n.4, and stated that, \u201c[although <em>Whelan </em>is not limited to diametrically opposed assertions, such is the case here\u201d because of the victim\u2019s recantations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Luis F., </em>supra, 270. Significantly, the Appellate Court further stated that <em>\u201cthe victim\u2019s testimony that she did not recall stating that the defendant had sexual intercourse with her can be considered inconsistent with her prior statement that the defendant had sexual intercourse with her, </em>as she presented herself as a forgetful witness. The court was well within its discretion to consider the victim\u2019s testimony both inconsistent with her prior statements and evasive.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis D., </em>75 Conn. App. 1, 18, 815 A.2d 191 (\u201c[t]he victim\u2019s inability to recall material facts . . . clearly satisfies the inconsistency element\u201d of <em>Whelan), </em>cert. denied, 263 Conn. 909, 819 A.2d 842 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">As we previously noted, even after attempts to refresh her memory, E testified at trial that she did not remember the defendant touching her body in any way with his penis. Because it is well settled that failures of memory and omissions in trial testimony satisfy the inconsistency element of <em>Whelan, </em>we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion by relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Luis F., </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 269-70, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>admitting portions of the videotaped interview into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The defendant next argues that the admission of the videotaped interview into evidence violated his federal confrontation clause rights under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that the videotaped interview is inadmissible under <em>Crawford </em>because: (1) it was \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature because it was performed in conjunction with the state\u2019s investigation of the allegations against him; and (2) E was \u201cfunctionally unavailable\u201d for cross-examination because she testified that she did not recall making the statements on the videotape. In response, the state argues that the defendant\u2019s claims are foreclosed by our recent decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>284 Conn. 597, 935 A.2d 975 (2007), <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 910 A.2d 931 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L. Ed. 2d 573 (2007), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 42. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">We begin by noting that the defendant preserved his <em>Crawford </em>claim at trial and that we exercise plenary review over whether the trial court properly concluded that the admission of the videotapes did not violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation clause rights under <em>Crawford. See, </em>e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>supra, 280 Conn. 592; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">\u201cUnder <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 68, the hearsay statements of an unavailable witness that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>are testimonial in nature may be admitted under the sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause only if the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Hearsay statements that are nontestimonial in nature are not governed by the confrontation clause, and their admissibility is governed solely by the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>285 Conn. 162, 169-70, 939 A.2d 1105 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Even if we were to assume without deciding that E\u2019s statements in the videotaped interview were, on the facts of the present case, \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we nevertheless conclude that the admission of the videotaped interview did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36. Our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 42, is instructive. In that case, the witness, a Mend of the defendant, had supplied a written statement to the police impheating the defendant in the murder of the victim. Id., 54-55. At trial, the witness testified, however, that he had never heard of any of these events, and said that any assertion to the contrary in his statement was false. Id., 55. After concluding that the statement was admissible pursuant to the <em>Whelan </em>rule, we concluded that its use was not barred by <em>Crawford, </em>despite the fact that it was testimonial in nature. Id., 78. We noted that <em>Crawford </em>\u201cmakes clear . . . that, when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the [confrontation [c]lause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements. ... It is therefore irrelevant that the reliability of some out-of-court statements cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The [c]lause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Moreover, in <em>Pierre, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that, \u201cdespite the fact that [the witness] took the stand and answered questions, he was \u2018functionally unavailable\u2019 for cross-examination as to the contents of his statement\u201d because of his claimed memory loss and statement that he had signed the document only to keep the police from harassing him. Id., 79. We noted that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s argument equates a declarant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to remember prior statements made to the police with a general unavailability from cross-examination in its entirety.\u201d Id. We relied on our previous <em>Whelan </em>jurisprudence, and sister state decisions that had interpreted <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>availability element; see id., 81-84; and concluded that \u201ca witness\u2019 claimed inability to remember earlier statements or the events surrounding those statements does not implicate the requirements of the confrontation clause under <em>Crawford, </em>so long as the witness appears at trial, takes an oath to testify truthfully, and answers the questions put to him or her during cross-examination.\u201d Id., 86. We concluded that, despite the fact that the witness \u201cclaimed that he could not remember ever having heard a description of the victim\u2019s murder ... he was available for cross-examination at trial, thus removing any issue under the confrontation clause.\u201d Id., 85; see id., 84 (noting that declarant \u201ctook the stand at trial, agreed to testify truthfully, was subject to cross-examination by the defendant, and answered all questions posed by defense counsel\u201d and \u201cresponded to several questions regarding his motives and interest in providing information to the police\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>supra, 280 Conn. 595-96 (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that improper admission of hearsay statements in department record \u201cimplicated the confrontation concerns at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>issue in Crawford\u201d because declarant testified at trial and his failure to remember naming corroborating witnesses, which he had done in document at issue, did \u201cnot render him unavailable for <em>Crawford </em>purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Accordingly, we follow our recent decisions in <em>Pierre </em>and <em>George J., </em>and conclude that the defendant was not denied an opportunity to cross-examine E because she was not \u201cfunctionally unavailable\u201d under <em>Crawford. </em><footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, we note that the defendant cross-examined E extensively about her memory and perception, eliciting facts including her belief in Santa Claus and his elves, her vision, and her understanding of the difference between truth and lies, and fantasy and reality, and also that she takes two medications for her \u201ctemper.\u201d With respect to the specific allegations, the defendant also cross-examined E extensively and elicited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>testimony that she had never seen a man or boy without his clothing on, and that she did not remember participating in the videotaped interview or making the accusation that the defendant had touched her with his penis, that she got in trouble when she was younger for touching herself, and that she was not afraid of the defendant. Finally, the defendant was able to utilize this information in his closing arguments to the jury. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant had an ample opportunity to cross-examine E effectively, and, therefore, his confrontation clause rights were not violated by the admission into evidence of the videotaped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-11\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

I think, if anything, her testimony is incomplete, not inconsistent, there\u2019s nothing that she\u2019s saying now that is materially\u2014the things she said now, she said on the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-18\">\u201cAnd I know that there\u2019s one thing that she says in the interview that she hasn\u2019t said and that\u2019s what the state is trying to get in. But I don\u2019t think that factually this scenario fits <em>Luis F. </em>or <em>Whelan </em>and\u2014and I don\u2019t think the tape should be admissible for [substantive] purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-19\">The defendant reiterated his claim that the videotaped statement is \u201cnot inconsistent. When she\u2019s asked about this, she\u2019s saying I don\u2019t remember. She\u2019s not testifying, so, if\u2014if the state is going to play you a portion of the tape, they\u2019re gonna play you the portion of the tape where she says the things that she now says she doesn\u2019t remember and my argument is still that it\u2019s not inconsistent. She\u2019s testified consistently with the interview on the tape and just doesn\u2019t remember that one last thing. So I don\u2019t know if the court, only watching [ten] minutes of the tape, is gonna give you enough context as\u2014as to what she\u2019s testified to and what\u2019s on that tape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-20\">Finally, the defendant responded to the trial court\u2019s questions about what makes the present case different than <em>Luis F., </em>and argued that \u201cthey talk about the witness being evasive in <em>Luis F. </em>and I don\u2019t think this witness is showing any evidence of being evasive. She\u2019s not saying I\u2014you know, I did this videotape and I lied on that videotape. She\u2019s testifying\u2014and if Your Honor [would] watch the entire videotape, she\u2019s testifying fairly consistently with what she said at the beginning of that videotape and saying she doesn\u2019t remember anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-21\">The trial court then stated that <em>\"Lids F. </em>said that a prior inconsistent statement can be admitted for substantive purposes ... if there\u2019s a lack of recollection on the part of the complaining witness and that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s exactly what we have here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The defendant responded, \u201c[b]ut it also says you have to take a look at the testimony as a whole.

In such circumstances, the trial court must act as a gatekeeper to ensure that the statement does not go to the jury for substantive purposes. We emphasize, however, that the linchpin of admissibility is reliability: the statement may be excluded as substantive evidence only if the trial court is persuaded, in light of the circumstances under which the statement was made, that the statement is so untrustworthy that its admission into evidence would subvert the fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of the fact-finding process. In the absence of such a showing by the party seeking to exclude a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>criteria, the statement is admissible as substantive evidence; like all other evidence, its credibility is grist for the cross-examination mill. Thus, because the requirements that we established in <em>Whelan </em>provide a significant assurance of reliability, it will be the highly unusual case in which a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>requirements nevertheless must be kept from the jury.\u201d See also id., 308 (concluding that trial court properly could have credited police officer\u2019s testimony that declarant appeared coherent and acted normally when he signed statement, which he had read and found to be true); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hersey, 78 </em>Conn.

We disagree. The principle articulated in <em>Pierre </em>has been held equally applicable to cases involving young victims of sexual assault who, at trial, did not recall making statements contained in videotaped interviews. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>226 S.W.3d 892, 896-97 (Mo. App. 2007) (\u201c[t]he record clearly shows that [the] [defendant had the opportunity to effectively cross-examine [the seven year old] [v]ictim under oath and call to the attention of the jury [the] [v]ictim\u2019s forgetfulness\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>158 Wash. 2d 630, 649-50, 146 P.3d 1183 (2006) (noting that four year old victim \u201cwas physically present in the courtroom and she confronted [the defendant] face to face; she was competent to testify and testified under oath; the defense retained the full opportunity to cross-examine her and in fact called attention to her lack of memory in closing; and the judge, jury, and defendant were able to view [the victim\u2019s] demeanor and body language while she was on the stand\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>724 N.W.2d 610, 618 (S.D. 2006) (\u201cAlthough [the four year old victim] may not have been able to repeat exactly what she told [the interviewer], police officers or doctors; she did remember speaking to them and responded that she remembered telling [the interviewer] \u2018the truth.\u2019 Therefore, she afforded the jury a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of her prior statements.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
