The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant, and, accordingly, reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the matter to the trial court with direction to dismiss the charge against the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>99 Conn. App. 579, 915 A.2d 883 (2007). Thereafter, we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment, limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly determined that the defendant was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>a dismissal based upon its construction of ... \u00a7 54-142a (c) and its review of the record in this case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>282 Conn. 905, 920 A.2d 311 (2007). We conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s determination was improper, and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The record sets forth the following undisputed factual and procedural history relevant to the issues on appeal. In 1998, the defendant entered nolo contendere pleas to three charges of risk of injury to a child involving sexual misconduct. On or about March 24, 2000, after having served a six year term of imprisonment, the defendant was released into the community on probation with special conditions for a period of five years. On July 12,2000, the defendant was arrested and charged in four separate cases, three for violation of probation in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 and one for failure to comply with the sex offender registration requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a), specifically, failure to register his residential address with the commissioner of public safety. On August 2, 2000, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty and elected a jury trial on the charge of failure to register. On February 28, 2001, the defendant appeared in court on all four matters and requested a continuance because he was awaiting a decision on a pending appeal of the risk of injury convictions that had led to his having been placed on probation and the condition that he register as a sex offender.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case was continued to April 6, 2001. On May 9, 2001, following a hearing on the three violation of probation cases, the court found the defendant to be in violation of probation and sentenced him to six years incarceration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Court records indicate that on that date, the matter of the failure to comply with the sex offender registration requirements\u2014the basis for the present case\u2014was placed on the firm jury trial list, without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Thereafter, on June 13,2001, the defendant\u2019s violation of probation cases appeared on a postjudgment docket together with the present case, which was marked for pretrial conference on that date, despite previously having been placed on the firm jury trial list. During this court appearance, Louis Avitabile, the special public defender who had represented the defendant in connection with the violation of probation cases and the related appeal, was appointed by the court to represent the defendant on the charge in the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the pretrial conference held that day failed to result in a plea agreement, the state informed the court that \u201cth[is] case is going to remain on the firm trial list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Three years later, on October 29, 2004, while he was in court on another matter, the defendant inquired about the status of the present case with the clerk of the court and was told that it still was pending. Thereafter, the defendant wrote a letter to the clerk of the court stating that the case had been continued at the state\u2019s request and that, because there had been no prosecution for thirteen months, the court should construe the case as having been nolled pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c). After the clerk brought the letter to the attention of the state, the case was placed on the docket for December 14,2004, and on that date, the state requested that the court place the case on the active case list for trial on January 11, 2005. The defendant thereafter filed two motions, which were ultimately consolidated in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>January 11,2005 pleading captioned, \u201cCorrected Motion To Construe A Nolle And To Dismiss With Prejudice\u201d: one motion to construe the charge as having been nolled and to dismiss with prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c), and another motion to dismiss the charge for lack of a speedy trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to that time, the defendant had not filed a motion for a speedy trial or otherwise requested that the case be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">At a hearing on both of the defendant\u2019s motions, the trial court, sua sponte, elicited testimony from Laura Leigh of the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office in geographical area number seventeen in Bristol as to the following: there were two judges assigned to the geographic area where the case had been pending during 2003-2004; ten trials had been conducted during that time, five of which were jury trials; the defendant\u2019s case had been placed on the firm jury list on May 9, 2001; and his case initially had been placed on the pretrial docket on June 13, 2001, but was returned to the firm jury list on that same date. Leigh explained that, normally, the list of firm jury cases submitted by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to the clerk\u2019s office would constitute the docket, and attorneys and pro se defendants on these cases would be called in to determine which cases were ready for trial. Leigh testified that during the time period when the defendant\u2019s case was pending, many cases were called for trial by the state, but his case had not been called until December 14, 2004. She also testified that no speedy trial motion had been filed in this case prior to the one then under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The defendant testified that he had thought that his trial would begin on June 13, 2001, but that \u201cit was conveyed to me somehow that this matter wasn\u2019t going to be pursued because I was already sentenced to the six years for the violation of probation [charges].\u201d He also stated that the records from the June 13,2001 court proceeding were unclear as to the status of his case, but that it was his recollection that the case had been either nolled or dismissed, and simply not recorded as such. Avitabile stated that he had been appointed as the defendant\u2019s special public defender in the present case on June 13, 2001, that there had been a pretrial conference that day that had failed to result in a plea agreement because the defendant maintained his innocence, and that the case had been restored to the firm jury trial list. Avitabile further stated that he could not speculate as to why the defendant believed that his case had been nolled or dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The court rejected the defendant\u2019s testimony as not credible, concluding that he had had sufficient experience with the legal system to know that cases do not \u201cdisappear.\u201d The court emphasized that the defendant had been represented by counsel who knew that the case had not been resolved and in fact had been placed on the firm jury trial list. The trial court further reasoned that the state\u2019s June 13, 2001 request that the case be moved to the firm juiy trial list reasonably could be interpreted as a defense request for a continuance for trial based on the defendant\u2019s rejection of the state\u2019s offer to reach a plea agreement. The court also noted that the defendant\u2019s view of the meaning of \u00a7 54-142a (c) would eviscerate the purpose of the speedy trial provisions, which require some affirmative action by the defendant\u2014action that the defendant had not taken in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The trial court thereafter denied the defendant\u2019s motion to construe the delay in holding the trial as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>nolle that would trigger \u00a7 54-142a (c). The court reasoned that \u00a7 54-142a (c) was \u201cdirected at prohibiting [the state] from attempting to get a defendant to serve time short of a conviction by simply placing a case on a jury docket and allowing it to stay dormant for the same amount of time . . . the person would get if the person had been convicted. It\u2019s to prohibit and prevent misconduct on the part of the [state], which is why it incorporates the statement [regarding] when the case has been on the firm jury docket for thirteen months at the request\u2014and the [state] has requested a continuance. The court found that the length of the delay was not due to the misconduct or bad motive of the state. The court further found that, because the defendant did not accept the state\u2019s plea bargain offer regarding [the sex offender registry] charge and sought a trial, the case had been continued at his request. The court also intimated that the delay had been a strategy on the part of the defendant to enable him to make this claim. The court concluded that because the case had not been continued at the request of the state, \u00a7 54-142a (c) did not apply.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 582-83. The trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, concluding that the defendant had not moved for a speedy trial, nor had he demonstrated that he had been prejudiced appreciably by the state. In connection with that determination, the court observed that, perhaps there had been \u201csome strategic disengagement [by the defense] as it relates to allowing the case to stay on the jury docket for an extended period of time without ever filing a motion for a speedy trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Thereafter, the defendant was tried and convicted by a jury on the charge of failure to comply with the sex offender registration requirements in violation of \u00a7 54-251 (a). The trial court subsequently denied the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>dant\u2019s motion for a new trial, motion for judgment of acquittal and motion in arrest of judgment, and sentenced the defendant to three years incarceration, execution suspended, and three years probation to run concurrently with the sentence he then was serving for violation of probation. An appeal to the Appellate Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The Appellate Court framed the issue on appeal as \u201cwhether the [trial] court properly concluded that \u00a7 54-142a (c) does not apply to the defendant\u2019s case and, more specifically, whether the [trial] court\u2019s finding that the defendant, not the state, had requested that the matter be continued is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 583. The court cited the June 13, 2001 statement by the state\u2019s attorney that the case was \u201cgoing to remain on the film trial list\u201d and stated that \u201c[although this statement effectively postponed the defendant\u2019s case and continued it to an indefinite time in the future, because the state did not explicitly request a continuance, it is not clear whether this is a continuance at the request of the state as contemplated in \u00a7 54-142a (c).\u201d Id., 585. The Appellate Court determined that the language, \u201cat the request of the prosecuting attorney,\u201d which had been added to \u00a7 54-142a (c) in 1981, did not have a clear legislative purpose. Id., 586. Looking to extratextual sources for guidance, the court concluded that \u00a7 54-142a (c) specifically was designed to protect speedy trial rights. Id., 586. In light of this inteipretation, the common meaning of the term \u201ccontinuance\u201d and the failure of the state to advance the prosecution of the case, the Appellate Court concluded that the statement by the state\u2019s attorney on June 13, 2001, constituted a continuance at the request of the state as contemplated in \u00a7 54-142a (c). Id., 589-90. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment and ordered that the case be dismissed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Id., 591. The state\u2019s certified appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The state contends that the Appellate Court misconstrued the intent of \u00a7 54-142a (c) as a speedy trial statute and hence misinterpreted and misapplied the statutory language included therein, \u201ccontinued at the request of the prosecuting attorney\u201d and \u201cno prosecution,\u201d when concluding that the trial court\u2019s finding that the continuance had not been at the request of the state\u2019s attorney was clearly erroneous. Alternatively, the state contends that, even if the Appellate Court properly construed the defendant\u2019s case as having been nolled by implication pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c), the order dismissing the charge was not an appropriate remedy. Because we agree with the state as to its first claim, we do not reach its second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The Appellate Court\u2019s determination as to the application of \u00a7 54-142a (c) to the defendant\u2019s case depended first on the meaning of that statute and then on the application of that interpretation to the facts of this case. \u201cAccordingly, [t]he [threshold] issue before this court involves a question of statutory interpretation that . . . requires our plenary review. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>nous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>281 Conn. 5, 16, 912 A.2d 992 (2007). Neither party has claimed that the statute is plain and unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Our starting point is the text of the statute at issue. Section 54-142a (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any charge in a criminal case has been continued at the request of the prosecuting attorney, and a period of thirteen months has elapsed since the granting of such continuance during which period there has been no prosecution or other disposition of the matter, the charge shall be construed to have been nolled as of the date of termination of such thirteen-month period . . . .\u201d Although the Appellate Court focused on the meaning of the word \u201ccontinuance\u201d and whether a statement by the state\u2019s attorney had the <em>effect </em>of a continuance; see <em>State </em>v. Winer, supra 99 Conn. App. 585, 589-90; in our view, the most significant language is the specified action necessary to trigger the continuance\u2014\u201cat the <em>request </em>of the prosecuting attorney . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The phrase \u201cat the request\u201d is not defined in the statute, and we therefore construe the term in accordance with \u201cthe commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); accord <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>281 Conn. 656, 665, 916 A.2d 803 (2007). The term \u201crequest\u201d is defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u201cto need, seek for, inquire after . . . the act of asking for something (as an object, a favor or some action desired); an expression of a desire or wish . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (defining \u201c[r]equest\u201d as \u201cto ask for something ... to solicit\u201d). These definitions militate in favor of the state\u2019s position that a request must be explicit, that is, the overt act of asking for a continuance. This interpretation is further supported when read in context with other language in \u00a7 54-142a (c), such as \u201cgranting of such continuance,\u201d which reflects an affirmative action by the court that is <em>responsive </em>to some overt action by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">It is clear that the state made no express request for a continuance on June 13, 2001, when, after a pretrial conference failed to result in an agreement, the state informed the court: \u201c[The] case is going to remain on the firm trial list.\u201d Rather, the state made a single statement that simply reflected the existing status of the case, that it was, and would remain, on the firm jury trial list, exposing the case to trial at any time under the speedy trial provisions. See footnotes 10 and 11 of this opinion. Nor did the trial court render any ruling or order in response to that statement. Although the case had been placed on the firm jury trial list on May 9, 2001, it would strain reality to view the state\u2019s action <em>allowing </em>the case to remain on that list in June, 2001, as \u201cno prosecution\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-142a (c), particularly when it was on that day that the court first appointed the defendant an attorney. Nothing that occurred at that time signified an abandonment of, as opposed to a commitment to, prosecution. Indeed, to suggest otherwise would require every firm jury list case to be called daily, in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 44-16.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>We turn next to the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 54-142a (c). The Appellate Court acknowledged that when the legislature substituted the operative language \u201cat the request of the prosecuting attorney\u201d; see Public Acts 1981, No. 81-218, \u00a7 1; it made scant reference to the purpose for this change.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 586. The court therefore turned to the statute \u201cas a whole\u201d and concluded that, because \u00a7 54-142a (c) was intended to advance speedy trial protections, the court\u2019s focus should be on whether the state actively had pursued its prosecution of the defendant\u2019s case and whether the state\u2019s action affected the time in which the defendant was brought to trial. Id., 586-90. We disagree with the lens through which the Appellate Court viewed the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">As the discussion that follows demonstrates, from its inception, \u00a7 54-142a has addressed the recording of nolles and later, the erasure of criminal records, both of which being administrative rather than substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>in intent. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (a) and (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute encouraged the docketing of cases to prevent dormancy, promoted the efficient flow of cases through the court system, and created a procedure to erase by operation of law those cases that were lost or forgotten. Unlike the detailed speedy trial provisions enunciated by statute or rules of practice; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-82c, 54-82d, 54-82\u00cd and 54-82m;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-39 and 43-40;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provide explicit mandates, \u00a7 54-142a (c) does not require that a <em>trial </em>commence within a specific time period to protect a defendant. Rather, \u201c[\u00a7 54-142a] appears to be directed ... to circumstances in which the state obtains an initial continuance and then completely ignores the case for thirteen months.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 95, 384 A.2d 326 (1977). That statute requires only that, if a case is continued at the request of the state\u2019s attorney, in order to prevent a charge from being construed as nolled, some prosecution must occur within thirteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>month intervals. It does not mandate a speedy trial within thirteen months. The defendant\u2019s protection against indefinite prosecution is found elsewhere. See footnotes 10 and 11 of this opinion. Indeed, in the present case the defendant conceded to the trial court that there would have been no basis to nolle the case if it had been docketed on the jury list every few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">As this court previously has explained, \u201c[t]he erasure provisions of \u00a7 54-142a (c) have their origins in legislation enacted in 1963. Prior to 1963, General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 54-90, which is the statutory progenitor of \u00a7 54-142a (c), provided simply that whenever a criminal case was nolled, \u2018the clerk of the court shall make a record of such nolle.\u2019 In 1963, \u00a7 54-90 was amended by No. 482 of the 1963 Public Acts, which required that the clerk also record not guilty findings, and provided that, upon a nolle or not guilty finding, \u2018the court . . . upon petition of the arrested person or his heirs, may order all police and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney pertaining to such case to be erased, provided at least three years have elapsed from the date of arrest.\u2019 A petition to the court and court action were thus required for erasure of records in cases in which either a nolle or a not guilty finding had been entered.\u201d <em>Cislo </em>v. Shelton, 240 Conn. 590, 599-600, 692 A.2d 1255 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In 1972, the legislature added the provision applicable to continued cases in what is now subsection (c) of \u00a7 54-142a. See Public Acts 1972, No. 20, \u00a7 2. Representative John A. Carrozzella, acting chairman of the judiciary committee, which had sponsored the bill thereafter enacted as Public Act 1972, No. 20, described this provision as essentially advancing an administrative, housekeeping objective in disposing of lost cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>from the old municipal courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 15 H.R. Proc., Pt. 1, 1972 Sess., pp. 84-85. These comments strongly reinforce that the amendment, like the existing scheme to which it was added, simply was designed to prevent the indefinite postponement of criminal cases in order to improve efficiency in the flow of cases through our judicial system, not to provide new substantive protections for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We recognize that, in <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 599, this court stated otherwise, noting that \u201cthe legislature specifically designed \u00a7 54-142a (c) in order to avoid the speedy trial violations that the legislature feared otherwise might occur. That fear was based on its interpretation of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967).\u201d In retrospect, however, it is clear that this statement was misguided. First, in reaching this conclusion, the court in <em>Cislo </em>had relied on one legislator\u2019s statement that was made two years after the addition of subsection (c) to \u00a7 54-251 by Public Acts 1972, No. 20, and that is unsupported by any evidence in the legislative history or text of that act itself. See <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 606 n.23, 607. Thus, the court should not have ascribed an intent to the legislature generally because of one legislator\u2019s retrospective interpretation of the motivation behind the 1972 amendment, especially when such an interpretation is not consistent with express statements in the pertinent legislative history. See footnote 12 of this opinion. Second, that legislator misinterpreted <em>Klopfer </em>and any concomitant need to amend our statutes to provide speedy trial protections in accordance with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>case. In <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>supra, 214, 217-18, 221-22, the defendant\u2019s case had been nolled over his objection and without justification, and under North Carolina\u2019s procedure, the nolle left the defendant subject to a statute of limitations that had been tolled and with no procedural mechanism to obtain a dismissal. Because the defendant had been left without any means to effectuate his speedy trial rights, the United States Supreme Court determined that the procedure violated the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights. Id., 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">It is clear that <em>Klopfer </em>presented a unique situation because the nolle without leave procedure under North Carolina\u2019s scheme was tantamount to a pending charge, thereby implicating speedy trial protections, unlike the entry of a nolle.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In Connecticut, after a nolle prosequi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>has been entered, the statute of limitations continues to run and a prosecution may be resumed only on a new information and a new arrest. Indeed, contrary to the statement in <em>Cislo, </em>this court expressly has recognized the distinction between the effect of a scheme like that in North Carolina and our own. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1975-2), </em>32 Conn. Sup. 501, 503-504, 337 A.2d 336 (1975) (\u201cUnder North Carolina law, the attorney for the state could have the case, which had been nolled, restored to the docket for trial, and in the meantime the [s]tatute of [1]imitations remained tolled. Connecticut law is different. Here the [sjtatute of [limitations runs, and prosecution may be resumed only on a new information and a new arrest. General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 . . . .\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>27 Conn. Sup. 209, 211, 234 A.2d 120 (1967) (\u201cA nolle prosequi, when unconditionally entered, is a dismissal of indictment, and no conviction can be had except by beginning a new case against the accused. . . . Nolle prosequi is nothing but a declaration of the prosecuting officer that he will not prosecute the suit further at that time. . . . Upon the entering of a nolle prosequi by the state\u2019s attorney, there is no case. The defendant is released from custody and is free to come and go as he pleases. In this case, the defendant was a free man, privileged to return to his state of residence and with no restrictions whatsoever. The defendant was not deprived of his right to [a] speedy trial, as upon the entry of a nolle prosequi there was no case pending against him. No plea had been entered by the defendant, and no trial had been started.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). Therefore, the legislator\u2019s comments made two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>after the erasure provisions had been enacted reflected a misunderstanding of <em>Klopfer </em>and overlooked other provisions of our scheme; hence, our reliance on those comments in <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 599, upon which the Appellate Court reasonably relied in the present case, was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Finally, we note that we also are not inclined to adopt the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54-142a as a speedy trial statute because that interpretation not only would be inconsistent with \u00a7\u00a7 54-82c, 54-82d, 54-82Z and 54-82m in terms of the finality they provide and the specific procedural requirements imposed upon defendants; see footnote 10 of this opinion; but it actually would undermine those provisions by allowing a defendant to circumvent the requirements that he give notice of his demand for a speedy trial. \u201cWhen the legislature amended the bill underlying the speedy trial rule [\u00a7 54-82m] to require that defendants affirmatively trigger the dismissal provision of the statute by moving for a speedy trial at the end of the twelve month period, it did so with the intent that the defendant\u2019s motion would alert both the court and the state that the clock was running and that, to avoid dismissal of the charges, the defendant would have to be afforded a trial within thirty days. See [25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18,1982 Sess.], pp. 5768-70, remarks of Representative Christopher Shays and Representative Robert G. Jaekle; id., p. 5806, remarks of Representative [Richard D.] Tulisano. The legislature recognized that institutional negligence might occur during the twelve month period, and that the defendant\u2019s speedy trial motion would remind the state that it must commence the trial within thirty days or face a dismissal. See id., pp. 5769-70, remarks of Representative Jaekle. In other words, the motion for a speedy trial is supposed to be the state\u2019s \u2018wake up call.\u2019 It is intended to \u2018[give] the state another crack from preventing that individual from being set free.\u2019 Id., p. 5768, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>remarks of Representative Shays.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McCahill, </em>265 Conn. 437, 451-52, 828 A.2d 1235 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In conclusion, the Appellate Court improperly construed \u00a7 54-142a (c) as a speedy trial statute and, accordingly, improperly determined that the state\u2019s conduct had triggered its nolle and erasure provision. The state\u2019s attorney did not request a continuance by stating to the trial court that the defendant\u2019s case would remain on the firm jury trial list. Therefore, the Appellate Court\u2019s order to the trial court to dismiss the charge against the defendant under \u00a7 54-142a (c) was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 54-251 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1999, No. 99-183, \u00a7 2, provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who has been convicted or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor or a nonviolent sexual offense, and is released into the community on or after October 1, 1998, shall, within three days following such release and whether or not such person\u2019s place of residence is in this state, register such person\u2019s name, identifying factors, criminal history record and residence address with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Commissioner of Public Safety, on such forms and in such locations as the commissioner shall direct, and shall maintain such registration for ten years except that any person who has one or more prior convictions of any such offense or who is convicted of a violation of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-70 shall maintain such registration for life. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (c) provides: \u201cWhenever any charge in a criminal case has been nolled in the Superior Court, or in the Court of Common Pleas, if at least thirteen months have elapsed since such nolle, all police and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney or the prosecuting grand juror pertaining to such charge shall be erased.

See <em>State </em>v. Talton, 209 Conn. 133, 140-41, 547 A.2d 543 (1988) (\u201cWe believe that the only reasonable construction to be placed on \u00a7 54-56b is that it is sui generis and was enacted by the legislature in order to ensure finality to a criminal defendant when the state indicates that it is unable to proceed with a prosecution. That finality is achieved by allowing a defendant to \u2018demand\u2019 a trial or a dismissal if the state attempts to enter a nolle and the state is unable to make the necessary representations to the court that would allow a nolle to enter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The defendant in the present case did not seek a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 54-56b. Rather, the defendant chose to seek a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 54-56, alleging insufficient cause to justify the continuing of the information. That statute empowers a court to dismiss a case only in the most compelling circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinchen, </em>243 Conn. 690, 703-704, 707 A.2d 1255 (1998)'(\u201cBecause discretionary prosecutorial decisions, including the decision whether to proceed to trial, ordinarily are unreviewable by the court absent a showing of prosecutorial impropriety, the power to render a dismissal under \u00a7 54-56 for insufficient cause is to be sparingly exercised and then only with great caution and awareness of the probable consequences. ... In order to ensure that this discretion is exercised in accordance with these principles, it is essential for the court explicitly to weigh all the competing factors and considerations of fundamental fairness to both sides\u2014the defendant, the state and society, and presumably the victim. . . .
