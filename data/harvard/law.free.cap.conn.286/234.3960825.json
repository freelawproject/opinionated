Biondi,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an obstetrician-gynecologist, on behalf of his minor son, Daniel Levesque (Daniel),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover for injuries that Daniel had suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence in connection with Daniel\u2019s delivery. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance therewith. On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) declined to instruct the jury that the defendant is hable for injuries that Daniel had suffered as a result of a third party\u2019s negligence in performing an emergency medical procedure on Daniel following his delivery if the jury first found that the emergency procedure was necessary due to the defendant\u2019s negligence in delivering Daniel, (2) directed a verdict for the defendant on the issue of whether Daniel\u2019s mother had given informed consent to continue her efforts to undergo a vaginal delivery, rather than a delivery by cesarean section, after repeated attempts to induce labor had failed, and (3) awarded costs to the defendant for time that her expert witness had spent preparing for a deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tion noticed by the plaintiff. We reject the plaintiffs claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of Friday, March 16, 2001, Karen Pilbin, Daniel\u2019s mother, was admitted to Bristol Hospital with elevated blood pressure. Pilbin was nearing the end of her pregnancy with Daniel, and the decision was made to induce labor. Although Pilbin had delivered her first child by cesarean section, she elected to attempt a vaginal birth with Daniel, a procedure known as a vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC), after being informed of its risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Throughout Friday night, Pilbin was administered Cervidil, a cervical ripening agent that induces labor. Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (62d Ed. 2008) p. 1167. By Saturday morning, when the defendant was on call, Pilbin had made no progress toward delivery. At that time, the defendant decided to begin administering Pitocin, another labor stimulant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At about 8:30 p.m., when Pilbin still had made no further progress in her labor, the defendant advised Pilbin that she had several options. These included continuing to take Pitocin through the night, having a cesarean section that night or stopping all efforts until the morning and then resuming induction with Pitocin. According to the defendant, Pilbin indicated that she very much wanted to have a vaginal delivery, and, together, they decided that the best way to proceed would be to resume induction with Pitocin in the morning, when Pilbin would be well rested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>On Sunday morning, after a few hours on Pitocin, Pilbin began to experience stronger contractions. At approximately 11:45 a.m., the defendant inserted an intrauterine pressure catheter (catheter) into Pilbin\u2019s uterus to ascertain the strength of Pilbin\u2019s contractions. Daniel\u2019s heart rate dropped immediately after the catheter was inserted. The defendant was not alarmed, however, because Daniel appeared healthy, and his heart rate had varied since Friday night without ever reaching a critical point. At about 11:50 a.m., Pilbin was given an increased dosage of Pitocin, with the intended effect of increasing the strength of her contractions. At approximately 11:55 a.m., the defendant returned to her office in a building adjacent to the hospital but left instructions with the nurses caring for Pilbin to call in the event that any problems arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Soon after the defendant had left the hospital, nurse-midwife Eliza Holland became concerned with changes in Daniel\u2019s heart rate, and, at 12:05 p.m., Holland paged the defendant for a consultation. At about 12:12 p.m., Pilbin again was given a higher dosage of Pitocin,* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but the administration of Pitocin was stopped completely at 12:20 p.m. when Daniel\u2019s heart rate again decreased.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At that time, Holland again had the defendant paged, and was informed that the defendant was on her way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>back to the hospital. Pilbin then was prepared for an emergency cesarean section.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">During this time period, the defendant had left her office to run an errand at a store about one mile from the hospital. As she entered the store, she received notice of Holland\u2019s page and returned immediately to the hospital to perform the cesarean section. When Daniel was bom at 12:48 p.m., he was pale, blue, had no muscle tone, did not respond to stimulation and was not breathing. At that time, Daniel was transferred to a pediatric resuscitation team headed by pediatrician Thomas G. Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Ward and his team intubated<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Daniel at 12:53 p.m., five minutes after birth. An endotracheal tube was inserted through Daniel\u2019s mouth and a nasogastric tube was inserted through his nose. The endotracheal tube was to run through Daniel\u2019s trachea to provide oxygen and the nasogastric tube was to ran into Daniel\u2019s stomach, where it would remove any air or liquid. When Daniel failed to improve, Ward ordered a chest X ray to ascertain whether the tubes had been positioned properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Radiological technician Linda Mackie took the X ray to radiologist John M. Walker, who read the film and informed Mackie that both tubes were positioned improperly. The endotracheal tube was in Daniel\u2019s esophagus, rather than in his trachea, and, therefore, the tube was not supplying air to his lungs. Walker could not tell from the X ray whether the nasogastric tube was in the trachea or in the esophagus, but he observed that it was positioned too high to perform its intended function. Mackie wrote down Walker\u2019s findings and returned to the nursery in which Daniel was being treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Mackie testified that when she arrived at the nursery, she read aloud the results of Walker\u2019s findings to Ward. At trial, however, Ward testified that he did not recall whether Mackie had said anything to him about the X ray and, if so, what she had said. Ward examined the X ray himself, however, but apparently did not recognize that the endotracheal tube was not in the proper position to provide air to Daniel\u2019s lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Shortly after examining the X ray, Walker proceeded to the nursery to check on Daniel\u2019s status. When Walker entered, Ward told Walker that he had moved the tube, and Ward made what Walker interpreted as a reassuring gesture, indicating with his hands that the tube had been moved upward in Daniel\u2019s body. Walker assumed that Ward was referring to the endotracheal tube because its improper positioning posed a much more serious problem than the improper placement of the nasogastric tube. Walker and Ward reviewed the chest X ray together, and Walker told Ward that the nasogastric tube also had to be moved. Walker then left the nursery, assuming that the problem had been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">At approximately 1:40 p.m., a neonatal resuscitation team from the University of Connecticut Health Center arrived and reintubated Daniel,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at which point his heart rate and color improved immediately. Because of the improper placement of the endotracheal tube, however, Daniel suffered from insufficient oxygenation for more than fifty minutes, leaving him with severe brain injuries and cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The plaintiff subsequently filed this action on Daniel\u2019s behalf, claiming, inter alia, that the defendant was negligent in the way that she managed Daniel\u2019s delivery. The plaintiff also claimed that the defendant improperly had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>failed to obtain Pilbin\u2019s informed consent to continue to attempt a vaginal delivery of Daniel after prolonged efforts to induce labor had failed. Near the close of the plaintiffs case, the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict on the plaintiffs informed consent claim, which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on six subspecifications of negligence that the plaintiff had alleged against the defendant. In particular, the court instructed the jury on the plaintiffs claims that the defendant (1) attempted to deliver Daniel at Bristol Hospital when she knew or should have known that Bristol Hospital did not have medical personnel immediately available to provide emergency neonatal care, (2) failed to monitor Daniel properly and to respond to changes in Daniel\u2019s heart rate, (3) improperly administered Pitocin, (4) inadequately supervised the medical personnel involved in Daniel\u2019s delivery, (5) failed to perform a cesarean section in a timely fashion, and (6) was not present and available to perform the cesarean section immediately upon being informed that the procedure was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its answers to interrogatories, the jury indicated that it had found that, although the defendant had been negligent in her care or treatment of Pilbin or Daniel, that negligence was not a proximate cause of Daniel\u2019s injuries.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly (1) declined to instruct the jury that if the defendant was negligent in delivering Daniel, then that negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries that Daniel had sustained as a result of the initial, failed resuscitation procedure even though that procedure itself had been performed negligently, and (2) directed a verdict for the defendant on the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had failed to obtain Pilbin\u2019s consent to continue to attempt a vaginal delivery after initial attempts to induce labor had failed. The trial court denied the motion to set aside the verdict and, thereafter, awarded costs to the defendant for time that an expert defense witness had taken to prepare for his deposition by the plaintiff. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly declined to instruct the jury that the defendant was liable for any injuries that Daniel had suffered as a result of the failed resuscitation procedure if the jury first found that the procedure was necessitated by the defendant\u2019s negligence in delivering Daniel. Because the charge that the plaintiff requested is not a correct statement of the law, the trial court properly declined to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. At trial, Ward acknowledged his mistake in failing to insert the endotracheal tube properly and in failing to remedy the problem in a timely manner. In addition, there appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>to be no dispute that, if that resuscitation procedure had been performed properly, Daniel would not have sustained any permanent injuries. Nevertheless, the plaintiff advanced the theory that, although Ward and his team had caused Daniel\u2019s injuries by inserting the endotracheal tube into Daniel\u2019s esophagus rather than through his trachea and by failing to rectify the problem in a timely manner, the defendant also was liable for those injuries because it was her negligence that had caused Daniel to require resuscitation in the first place. In support of this claim, the plaintiff maintained that the defendant\u2019s negligence in delivering Daniel had caused the need for remedial action, namely, the insertion of the tube through Daniel\u2019s trachea, and that the unskillful or negligent performance of Ward\u2019s resuscitation team, under our law, was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The defendant claimed that she was not negligent in delivering Daniel and that, even if she had been negligent, Daniel\u2019s injuries were attributable solely to the subsequent negligence of Ward\u2019s resuscitation team and not the defendant\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The plaintiff filed a request to charge in accordance with this theory of liability. The requested charge provided in relevant part: \u201cThe plaintiff has alleged that [Daniel\u2019s] depressed condition at birth, requiring resuscitation, was caused by the [defendant\u2019s] negligence ... in the management of labor and administration of Pitocin, including the failure to timely perform a [cesarean section]. Following this, the plaintiff alleged that other defendants were negligent in the course of the failed resuscitation. Under our law, a person who is injured is entitled to medical treatment, and if his injuries were the result of negligence, he may recover for any subsequent harm caused to him while receiving treatment for his original injuries. In other words, he may recover damages from the original wrongdoer for any worsening of his condition during the provision of subsequent medical treatment. This rule applies regardless of whether . . . anyone committed negligence during the course of subsequent treatment. As the rule applies to this case, if you find that [Daniel\u2019s] condition at birth, requiring his resuscitation, was the result of negligence on the part of [the defendant] . . . then [she] <em>would be responsible for all the consequences of the failed resuscitation, regardless of whether . </em>. . <em>you find that the failure to resuscitate was the result of negligence or some other cause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u201cUnder our law, an injured party can recover from the original tortfeasor for damages caused by the negligence of a doctor in treating the injury which the tortfea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>sor caused, provided the injured party used reasonable care in selecting the doctor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201cThe injured person must use reasonable care in the selection of the doctor or hospital, but I instruct you that in this case this condition has been met, because due to the urgency of the situation of Daniel\u2019s birth, there was no other treatment choice available. <em>Therefore, if you find that pre-birth negligence placed Daniel in such a condition that he required resuscitation, then our law holds the initial wrongdoer or wrongdoers responsible for any further injuries resulting from the failed resuscitation.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The trial court declined to give the plaintiffs requested charge, explaining that the instruction that the court intended to give on proximate cause and apportionment adequately addressed the plaintiffs claim that the subsequent negligence of Ward\u2019s resuscitation team did not break the causal connection between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and Daniel\u2019s injuries. Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cI think it\u2019s clear to the jury from the . . . charge as a whole about apportionment and proximate cause that [the defendant]-\u2014if she\u2019s found negligent, that they\u2019re to determine what her relative share of the damages is.\u201d The court also noted that counsel for the plaintiff was free to elaborate, in closing argument, on the plaintiffs theory that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of Daniel\u2019s injuries and that the defendant, therefore, was liable for some or all of those injuries, notwithstanding the subsequent negligence of Ward\u2019s resuscitation team. The plaintiffs counsel nevertheless asserted that, at a minimum, a brief clarification by the court was necessary to assist the jury in understanding the plaintiffs claim that the defendant also was responsible for Daniel\u2019s injuries even though the negligence of Ward\u2019s resuscitation team was the direct cause of those injuries. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>dant\u2019s counsel maintained that the plaintiffs requested charge was not an accurate statement of the law and, further, that the instruction that the court intended to give on proximate cause was sufficient. The court thereafter reaffirmed its decision not to instruct the jury in accordance with the plaintiffs request.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">After the close of evidence, the trial court charged the jury on the issue of proximate cause as follows: \u201cNow, what is this proximate cause concept about which you\u2019ve heard a bit today? If you find that [the] defendant was negligent in at least one of the ways alleged in the complaint, the next question you must address is, was the negligence of [the] defendant a proximate cause of any of the injuries and damages or losses which [Daniel] has suffered? If your answer to that question is no, you must return a verdict for [the] defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u201cIn proving proximate cause, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence, first, that [Daniel\u2019s] injury would not have occurred without the negligence of [the] defendant, that is, that the negligence was an actual cause\u2014what we lawyers refer to as a cause in fact of the injury. The second thing the plaintiff must show is not only was the defendant\u2019s act or omission an actual cause of [Daniel\u2019s] injury, but it was also a proximate cause of [his] injury, that is, that it was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. If an injury suffered by [Daniel] was a direct result or a reasonably probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, negligent act or omission, it was proximately caused by that act or omission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The trial court also instructed the jury on the principle of apportionment. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>essence, the court informed the jury that it was \u201cto decide what proportion, how much of the plaintiffs damages are the responsibility of each of the defendants found liable. . . . Each defendant is liable to the plaintiff only for that defendant\u2019s proportionate share of damages.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly declined to give the instruction that he had requested. The plaintiff contends that the instruction was necessary because the theory of negligence pursuant to which one party can be held hable for the subsequent negligence of another is not likely to be readily apparent to a lay juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u201cThe principal function of a jury charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which [it] might find to be established . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>282 Conn. 141, 179, 920 A.2d 236 (2007). The purpose of a request to charge is to inform the trial court of a party\u2019s claim of the applicable principle of law. E.g., <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 482, 569 A.2d 10 (1990). In determining whether a trial court improperly declined to instruct the jury in accordance with a party\u2019s request to charge, we \u201creview the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to supporting the . . . proposed charge. ... A request to charge which is relevant to the issues of [a] case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robishaw, </em>282 Conn. 628, 633, 922 A.2d 1086 (2007). It follows from this principle, however, that \u201ca request to charge must be an accurate statement of the law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 636. Indeed, it is axiomatic that a trial court should not instruct the jury in accordance with a request to charge unless the proposed instruction is a correct statement of the governing legal principles. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 231, 864 A.2d 666 (2004) (because proposed instruction was not accurate statement of law, trial court properly declined to give it), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">It is true, of course, that a tortfeasor may be held liable for the subsequent negligence of a third party if that subsequent negligence was a foreseeable consequence of the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence. Thus, in the present case, the defendant could have been found liable for injuries that Daniel had suffered as a direct result of the failed efforts of the original resuscitation team, even though that team was negligent, if the plaintiff also could establish that the team\u2019s negligence in failing to correct the improper intubation in a timely manner was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. See, e.g., <em>Wasfi </em>v. <em>Chaddha, </em>218 Conn. 200, 214-15 and n.12, 588 A.2d 204 (1991) (tortfeasor may be liable for damages caused by negligence of physician in treating injury caused by tortfeasor, provided that injured party used reasonable care in selecting physician, if physician\u2019s subsequent negligence was reasonably foreseeable consequence of tortfeasor\u2019s negligence); <em>Anderson &amp; McPadden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tunucci, </em>167 Conn. 584, 596, 356 A.2d 873 (1975) (same); <em>Lange </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>114 Conn. 590, 598, 159 A. 575 (1932) (same); see also annot., 100 A.L.R.2d 808, 811 (1965) (\u201c[t]he question whether a tortfeasor who causes personal injury is civilly liable to the person injured for the consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>of negligence, mistake, or lack of skill on the part of the physician or surgeon who treats the original injury is basically a question of proximate cause\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The request to charge that the plaintiff submitted, however, was defective because it contained language indicating that the jury was <em>required </em>to find the defendant liable for injuries that Daniel had suffered as a result of the resuscitation team\u2019s negligence if it first found that the tracheal intubation procedure had become necessary because of the defendant\u2019s negligence in delivering Daniel. In particular, the plaintiff requested that the jury be instructed that, \u201cif you find that [Daniel\u2019s] condition at birth, requiring his resuscitation, was the result of negligence on the part of [the defendant] . . . then [she] <em>would be </em>responsible for all the consequences of the failed resuscitation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs request further provided, \u201cif you find that pre-birth negligence placed Daniel in such a condition that he required resuscitation, then our law <em>holds the initial wrongdoer or wrongdoers responsible </em>for any further injuries resulting from the failed resuscitation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrary to the legal principle articulated in the plaintiffs requested charge, \u201c[t]he question of proximate causation generally belongs to the trier of fact because causation is essentially a factual issue. ... It becomes a conclusion of law only when the mind of a fair and reasonable [person] could reach only one conclusion; if there is room for a reasonable disagreement the question is one to be determined by the trier as a matter of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 597, 611, 662 A.2d 753 (1995). The proposed charge was an inaccurate statement of the law because, in the present case, the jury was required to decide, as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>fact, whether the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries that Daniel had suffered as a result of the resuscitation team\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that the jury would have been aided by an instruction explaining that the defendant\u2019s liability did not automatically terminate as a result of the resuscitation team\u2019s negligence, and that whether the defendant should be held liable for the injuries that Daniel had sustained as a consequence of the failed resuscitation effort was a factual issue for the jury to decide, in light of all the relevant circumstances. Such an instruction undoubtedly would have been helpful because lay jurors may have difficulty applying a general instruction on proximate cause to a case, like the present one, involving a claim by the defendant that the subsequent negligence of a third party broke the causal connection between the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct and the harm suffered by the plaintiff, thereby constituting the sole proximate cause of that harm. The instruction that the plaintiff requested, however, was not a correct statement of the applicable legal principles and would have misled the jury to the detriment of the defendant. Accordingly, the trial court properly declined to give it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We next consider the plaintiffs contention that the trial court improperly directed a verdict for the defendant on the plaintiffs claim of lack of informed consent. The plaintiff contends that he was entitled to a jury determination of his claim that the defendant had failed to obtain Pilbin\u2019s consent to continue attempting a vaginal birth after prolonged efforts to induce labor were unsuccessful. The defendant maintains that the trial court properly granted her motion for a directed verdict on the informed consent claim because the evidence adduced by the plaintiff was insufficient to inform the jury of the risks, benefits and hazards of continuing to attempt a vaginal birth under the circumstances of the present case. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As we previously explained, Pilbin had undergone a cesarean section during the birth of her first child. Pilbin was hopeful, however, that she could deliver Daniel vaginally. Accordingly, on August 15, 2000, early in Pilbin\u2019s pregnancy, Carmelina Luongo, an obstetrician-gynecologist employed by the same medical group as the defendant,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> informed Pilbin that there was a 1 percent chance of uterine rupture accompanying a VBAC procedure. Pilbin consented to the procedure and signed a consent form documenting that she had been advised of that risk but nevertheless had decided to attempt a vaginal delivery.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">At trial, the plaintiff presented the expert testimony of Myron W. Bethel, an obstetrician-gynecologist. Bethel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>testified that, after reviewing Pilbin\u2019s medical records, he considered her pregnancy to be high risk because she previously had undergone a cesarean section, she was of advanced maternal age and, just prior to being admitted to the hospital, she had developed symptoms of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Bethel further testified that, by Saturday evening, March 17, Pilbin\u2019s chances for a successful vaginal delivery had decreased, and it was clear that, despite many hours on Pitocin, Pilbin still was \u201cremote from delivery.\u201d In Bethel\u2019s view, because Pilbin previously had undergone a cesarean section due to cephalopelvic disproportion,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and because, all factors considered, she had a high-risk pregnancy, Pilbin should have been advised to have a cesarean section on Saturday evening. Bethel also testified that if Pilbin nevertheless had refused to have a cesarean section, Bethel would have considered that decision to be against medical advice.

The trial court granted the motion as to that claim, concluding that Bethel\u2019s testimony was insufficient to guide the jury in determining whether, as of Saturday evening, the defendant again should have obtained Pilbin\u2019s informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>consent to a VBAC in light of the changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We begin our analysis of the plaintiffs claim with the legal principles governing our review. \u201cThe standards for appellate review of a directed verdict are well settled. Directed verdicts are not favored. ... A trial court should direct a verdict only when a jury could not reasonably and legally have reached any other conclusion. ... In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict in favor of a defendant we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. . . . Although it is the jury\u2019s right to draw logical deductions and make reasonable inferences from the facts proven ... it may not resort to mere conjecture and speculation. ... A directed verdict is justified if . . . the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside a verdict rendered for the other party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Riccio </em>v. <em>Harbour Village Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>281 Conn. 160, 163, 914 A.2d 529 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u201c[U]nlike the traditional action of negligence, a claim for lack of informed consent focuses not on the level of skill exercised in the performance of the procedure itself but on the adequacy of the explanation given by the physician in obtaining the patient\u2019s consent. . . . Traditionally, a physician\u2019s duty to disclose information was measured by a professional standard which was set by the medical profession in terms of customary medical practice in the community. . . . [However, in] <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>[191 Conn. 282, 292-93, 465 A.2d 294 (1983)], we adopted a lay standard and stated that under the doctrine of informed consent, a physician is obligated to provide the patient with that information which a reasonable patient would have found material for making a decision whether to embark [on] a contemplated course of therapy. . . . We repeatedly have set forth the four elements that must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>addressed in the physician\u2019s disclosure to the patient in order to obtain valid informed consent. [I]nformed consent involves four specific factors: (1) the nature of the procedure; (2) the risks and hazards of the procedure; (3) the alternatives to the procedure; and (4) the anticipated benefits of the procedure.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Camel, </em>283 Conn. 475, 476-77 n.3, 927 A.2d 880 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The plaintiff contends that the evidence adduced at trial supported the conclusion that, by Saturday evening, March 17, the risks and benefits of a VBAC had changed since Pilbin originally consented to the procedure months earlier, and, therefore, at that time, the defendant should have advised Pilbin of those new risks and benefits in order to obtain her consent to proceed with a vaginal delivery, as Pilbin originally had planned. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that, although the risk of uterine rupture had not changed, Pilbin should have been informed that her chances of a successful VBAC had decreased.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserts that this information was necessary so that Pilbin could reconsider her earlier decision to attempt a vaginal delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We agree with the trial court that Bethel\u2019s testimony was insufficient for the jury to determine whether the defendant was required to obtain Pilbin\u2019s informed consent to continue efforts to deliver Daniel vaginally. Although Bethel did opine that the likelihood of a vaginal delivery had decreased by the evening of March 17, he did not explain why any such decrease would have been material to Pilbin\u2019s decision to undergo an immediate cesarean section. He did not testify about the risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>or hazards accompanying a decision to continue attempting to have a vaginal delivery rather than a delivery by cesarean section. Of course, by opting to attempt a vaginal birth, Pilbin always faced a 1 percent risk of uterine rupture, but there was no testimony, from Bethel or anyone else, to suggest that Pilbin faced any greater risk of uterine rupture, or any new or additional risk, if she continued to attempt to deliver Daniel vaginaily after Saturday evening. Similarly, the plaintiff adduced no evidence to establish that any continued efforts by Pilbin to attempt to deliver vaginally placed Daniel at any greater risk. In such circumstances, the jury would have been required to speculate about whether a reasonable patient would have found it material to her decision to continue to attempt a VBAC if she were informed that the likelihood of accomplishing that result had been reduced to some unknown degree. We therefore reject the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly directed a verdict for the defendant on the plaintiffs informed consent claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court improperly required him to pay for the time that the defendant\u2019s expert had spent in preparing for his deposition by the plaintiff. The plaintiff contends that the trial court lacked the authority to make such an award. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">After the conclusion of trial, the defendant claimed as a taxable cost the $1800 fee that her expert, James Greenberg, a physician, had charged for time that Greenberg had spent preparing for a deposition that had been noticed and taken by the plaintiff during the course of pretrial discovery. The plaintiff challenged the defendant\u2019s claim, asserting that the court lacked the authority to treat such a fee as a taxable cost. The trial court, relying on its reasoning and decision in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>prior case involving the same issue; see <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>47 Conn. Sup. 296, 790 A.2d 1194 (2001); concluded that, under Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the defendant was entitled to reimbursement for the fee and awarded it to the defendant as part of the court\u2019s postjudgment taxation of costs. On appeal, the plaintiff renews his claim that the trial court did not have the authority to shift the cost of Greenberg\u2019s deposition preparation from the defendant to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In support of his contention, the plaintiff relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>primarily on M. <em>DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717-18, 674 A.2d 845 (1996) <em>(DeMatteo), </em>in which this court concluded that the trial court in a tax appeal lacked the authority under General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 52-260 (f)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to award costs to the prevailing party for fees that that party had paid to its appraiser for his appraisal report.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">As the parties have observed, there is a split of authority in the Superior Court as to whether a court has the authority to treat as a taxable cost a fee charged by an expert for time spent preparing for a deposition noticed by the opposing party. Compare <em>Flis </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gastroenterology Consultants, P.C., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-02-0469142-S (July 13, 2007) (43 Conn. L. Rptr. 774) (concluding that court has authority to award costs for time spent by expert preparing for deposition), <em>Bilotti </em>v. <em>General Casualty Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Ansonia-Milford, Docket No. CV-04-0085900-S (April 5, 2007) (same), and <em>1049 Asylum, L.P. </em>v. <em>Kinney Pike Ins., Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV-02-0816344-S (June 23, 2005) (same), with <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Corvino, </em>Superior Court, judicial district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-97-0160976-S (December 8, 2004) (38 Conn. L. Rptr. 372) (concluding that court lacks authority to award costs for time spent by expert in preparation for deposition), <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-99-0366964-S (May 3, 2002) (same), <em>Alswanger </em>v. <em>Smego, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-92-0125294-S (October 12, 2001) (same). The issue is one of first impression for the appellate courts of this state. We agree with the analysis of the trial court in <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 47 Conn. Sup. 296, and conclude that the trial court properly awarded costs to the defendant for the fee that she incurred for time that Greenberg had spent preparing for his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Under Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3), \u201cthe judicial authority shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery . . . .\u2019\u2019As the court in <em>Rolfe </em>observed, this language \u201cdoes not limit the financial responsibility of the party seeking further discovery concerning an expert\u2019s testimony to the expert\u2019s time at the deposition and is broad enough to include payment of a reasonable fee not only for testimony but also for preparation . . . .\u201d <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 47 Conn. Sup. 302. Indeed, as one federal District Court has noted in analyzing the identical language of rule 26 (b) (4) (C) (i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201c[t]ime spent preparing for a deposition is, literally speaking, time spent in responding to discovery . . . .\u201d <em>Collins v. Woodridge, </em>197 F.R.D. 354, 357 (N.D. Ill. 1999). Furthermore, it is an entirely foreseeable consequence of noticing the deposition of an expert witness that the expert will devote at least some time to preparing for his or her deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In <em>Rolfe, </em>the court also concluded that \u201cthe genesis and evolution of [Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3)] as well as the application of the identical federal rule support such an interpretation.\u201d <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 47 Conn. Sup. 302. Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3) is modeled after rule 26 (b) (4) (C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the purpose of which is to \u201cmeet the objection that it is unfair to permit one side to obtain without cost the benefit of an expert\u2019s work for which the other side has paid, often a substantial sum.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, advisory committee note of 1970. Construing Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3) to permit reimbursement for time spent by an expert in preparing for his or her deposition furthers that purpose. Moreover, comments to the 1978 revisions to the Practice Book indicate that, in light of the rule set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3), \u201cthe fee aspects to further discovery will have to be weighed by any party in deciding to seek further discovery . . . .\u201d R. Ciulla &amp; R. Allen, Comments on the New Practice Book Revisions (1979) c. 8, p. 19. This commentary suggests that the time that an expert spends in preparing for his or her deposition falls within the purview of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3) because, if it did not, the party taking the deposition could do so without having to consider the expert\u2019s fee for time spent in preparing for the deposition. Indeed, as the court in <em>Rolfe </em>noted, the cost associated with the time that an expert spends preparing to be deposed is \u201cincurred only because of [the] actions of the opposing party, who is in control of the entire process from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the decision to depose the expert to the scope of the material subpoenaed for the deposition, and, thus, the scope of matters into which inquiry will be made as to the length and detail of the questioning at the deposition. . . . [I]t [therefore] is counterproductive to the goal of the speedy and efficient determination of litigation [on] its merits ... to permit the parties to take all the depositions they want without responsibility for the costs generated by those depositions.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 308. Finally, although federal courts are divided on the issue, it appears that a majority of those courts that have decided the issue have concluded that rule 26 (b) (4) (C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits the court to tax as a cost the fee charged by an expert for time spent preparing for his or her deposition. See <em>Magee </em>v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>172 F.R.D. 627, 646 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (stating that \u201c[m]ost\u201d federal courts have determined that time spent by expert preparing for deposition is taxable to party noticing deposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The plaintiff contends that this court\u2019s holding in <em>DeMatteo </em>bars the trial court\u2019s award in the present case. We disagree with the plaintiffs reading of <em>DeMatteo. </em>In that case, the plaintiff, M. DeMatteo Construction Company (DeMatteo), appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the board of tax review of the defendant city of New London (city), which declined to reduce the assessed value of DeMatteo\u2019s property. <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 711-12. On appeal to the Superior Court, DeMatteo presented the testimony of a real estate appraiser, who testified that the fair market value of the property was considerably less than the assessed value. Id., 713. DeMatteo also introduced into evidence an appraisal report that that appraiser had prepared detailing his conclusions. Id. After the trial court ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>dered judgment in favor of DeMatteo, DeMatteo submitted a bill of costs seeking, inter alia, reimbursement for the fee that it had paid to the appraiser for the preparation of his report. Id. The trial court declined to tax the cost of the appraisal report, concluding that it lacked the statutory authority to do so. Id., 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On appeal to this court, DeMatteo asserted that the trial court was authorized to award such costs under General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 52-260 (f); see footnote 24 of this opinion; which provides in relevant part that \u201cthe court shall determine a reasonable fee to be paid to\u201d any designated health care provider or real estate appraiser who \u201cis summoned to give expert testimony in any action or proceeding . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 52-260 (f). The plaintiff claimed that, \u201cbecause the work necessary to the preparation of an appraisal report is also essential to the appraiser\u2019s sworn testimony, the fee for the report must also be a taxable cost under the statute.\u201d <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 714. We rejected DeMatteo\u2019s claim, concluding that the language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 52-260 (f) was not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to overcome the common-law principle that parties are required to bear their own litigation expenses. Id., 717-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As the court explained in <em>Rolfe, </em>however, the issue raised in <em>DeMatteo </em>was whether the trial court was statutorily authorized to require the city to pay for the time that DeMatteo\u2019s appraiser had spent preparing his <em>report, </em>not the time that the appraiser had spent prepar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ing <em>to testify at </em>trial.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 47 Conn. Sup. 300. In <em>DeMatteo, </em>therefore, we did not decide whether the trial court had the statutory authority to award costs to DeMatteo for the fee that it had incurred for its appraiser\u2019s trial preparation time. We agree with the court in <em>Rolfe </em>that our holding in <em>DeMatteo </em>does not preclude a court from awarding the costs associated with the time that an expert witness spends preparing for a deposition.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The plaintiff nevertheless maintains that, because \u00a7 52-260 (f) does not expressly provide for reimbursement for the cost of the time that an expert spends in preparing for a deposition, it should not be construed to do so. We acknowledge that costs are a creature of statute, and, therefore, a court may not tax a cost unless it is clearly empowered to do so; e.g., <em>Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>ATC Partnership, </em>272 Conn. 14, 48, 861 A.2d 473 (2004); because statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed. E.g., <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 426, 927 A.2d 843 (2007). As the court in <em>Rolfe </em>explained, however, strict construction does not require \u201cgiving the words of a statute the narrowest meaning of which they are susceptible . . . and [the principle of] strict construction is in no way violated if the words of [the] statute are given their full meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>New Britain General </em>Hospital, supra, 47 Conn. Sup. 306; see also <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 35, 818 A.2d 37 (2003) (\u201c[T]he principle of narrowly construing statutes that purport to change the common law is not an absolute rule, but rather merely an important [guideline] to the determination of legislative meaning. To permit [the construction of the statute] to displace the conclusions that careful interpretation yields . . . would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based [on] the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In the present case, the plain terms of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3) encompass the costs associated with time spent by an expert in preparation for his or her deposition. We see no reason why the broad language of \u00a7 52-260 (f) should be narrowly construed to conflict with the clear import of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3). Moreover, the fact that \u00a7 52-260 (f) recently was amended to include costs incurred in connection with an expert\u2019s testimony by means of a deposition; see Public Acts 2001, No. 01-32, \u00a7 1; supports the conclusion that \u00a7 52-260 (f) was not intended to bar the taxing of costs for the time spent by an expert in preparation for a deposition. We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s award of costs to the defendant for the fee that she incurred for Greenberg\u2019s time in preparing for his deposition was proper.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> The plaintiff also named as defendants Biondi\u2019s employer, Central Connecticut Obstetricians and Gynecologists, P.C.

As we explained in <em>Barry, </em>a superseding cause may be described as \u201can act of a third person or other force which by its intervention prevents the actor from being liable for harm to another which his antecedent negligence is a substantial factor in bringing about.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 434. \u201cThus, the doctrine of superseding cause serve[d] as a device by which one admittedly negligent party [could], by identifying another\u2019s superseding conduct, exonerate himself from liability by shifting the causation element entirely elsewhere. ... If a third person\u2019s negligence [was] found to be the superseding cause of the plaintiffs injuries, that negligence, rather than the negligence of the party attempting to invoke the doctrine of superseding cause, [was] said to be the sole proximate cause of the injury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 434-35. In <em>Barry, </em>however, we abandoned the doctrine of superseding cause in favor of a proximate cause analysis in most circumstances because, inter alia, \u201c[t]he doctrine ... no longer serve[d] a useful purpose in our tort jurisprudence, especially considering our system of comparative negligence and apportionment, [pursuant to which] defendants are responsible solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>for their proportionate share of the injury suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d Id., 446; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-572h and 52-102b (setting forth apportionment scheme applicable to negligence actions). Following <em>Barry, </em>therefore, the issue of whether the subsequent negligence of a third party breaks the causal connection between the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence and the harm suffered by the injured party is determined on the basis of traditional proximate cause analysis. Because the trial in the present case occurred after the issuance of our opinion in <em>Barry, </em>the doctrine of superseding cause played no role in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\"> The principle that each of two successive tortfeasors can share liability, provided that they both are determined to be a proximate cause of the injury, is embodied in our statutory scheme of proportional liability.

As we have explained, however, the request to charge that the plaintiff had submitted at trial was not an accurate statement of this principle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> The plaintiff also challenges the trial court\u2019s jury charge on proximate cause, claiming, inter alia, that the instruction did not adequately address the concept of foreseeability for the purpose of apprising the jury of the relationship between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and the subsequent negligence of Ward\u2019s resuscitation team. The plaintiff did not raise this claim at trial, however, and he does not assert that the court\u2019s instruction on proximate cause constituted plain error. Moreover, the claim was not preserved by the plaintiffs inaccurate request to charge, which made no refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ence to foreseeability. We therefore decline to review the plaintiffs unpreserved claim. See, e.g., <em>Pestey </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>259 Conn. 345, 373, 788 A.2d 496 (2002) (appellate court will not review merits of unpreserved claim of instructional impropriety in absence of claim of plain error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> At all times relevant to this appeal, both the defendant and Luongo were employed by the defendant Central Connecticut Obstetricians and Gynecologists, P.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> There is no dispute that Pilbin gave informed consent to a VBAC at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\"> Cephalopelvic disproportion is a condition whereby the head of the baby and the pelvis of the mother are disproportionate. See J. Williams, Obstetrics (19th Ed. 1993) p. 483. Bethel testified that patients who have had a previous cesarean section because of a cephalopelvic disproportion are more likely to fail in any subsequent attempt to deliver vaginally as compared to those who previously have had a cesarean section due to \u201ca nonrecurring cause.\u201d He also testified that, in 2001, the recognized chances of a successful VBAC when the mother\u2019s prior cesarean section had been due to cephalopelvic disproportion were between 50 and 70 percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> We note that the plaintiff contends that the jury reasonably could have concluded, on the basis of Bethel\u2019s testimony, that, as of Saturday evening, March 17, Pilbin\u2019s chances of a successful vaginal delivery were remote. We disagree with this characterization of Bethel\u2019s testimony. Bethel opined that Pilbin was \u201cremote from delivery\u201d on Saturday evening, not that her overall chances of a successful VBAC were remote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b276-5\"> Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 provides in relevant part: \u201cDiscovery of facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under the provisions of Section 13-2 and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained only as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201c(1) (A) A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.
