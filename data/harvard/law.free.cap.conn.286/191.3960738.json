We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, which is dispositive of this appeal. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial. We also address the merits of the state\u2019s second and third claims because they are likely to arise on retrial. See <em>Burns </em>v. Hanson, 249 Conn. 809, 830, 734 A.2d 964 (1999). Because we do not believe that the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial impropriety is likely to arise on retrial, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On April 2, 1998, the defendant entered pleas of nolo contendere to charges of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 (2). The court accepted the defendant\u2019s pleas and sentenced him to a total effective term of twelve years imprisonment, execution suspended after five years, followed by ten years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The defendant was released from incarceration on November 15, 2002. Prior to being released from incarceration, the defendant met with the coordinator for sex offender registration at the correctional institution where he was being held, who informed the defendant of his responsibilities under the Connecticut sex offender registration law, commonly referred to as Megan\u2019s Law, General Statutes \u00a7 54-250 et seq. One such responsibility is to return address verification letters, which are sent by the sex offender registry unit (unit) of the department of public safety every ninety days. Prior to his release from incarceration, the defendant signed several forms stating that he understood his responsibilities under the registration law, and further, that he understood that noncompliance with these responsibilities would constitute a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The unit sent the first letter to the defendant in its first round<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of ninety day address verification letters on February 8, 2003, approximately ninety days after the defendant\u2019s release from incarceration. Although the defendant did not return the first letter sent by the unit for address verification purposes, he did return the second letter, which the unit received on February 27, 2003. The defendant was thus in compliance \"with his registration responsibilities for the first ninety day period. The unit sent the first letter in its next round of address verification letters on May 23, 2003. When the unit did not receive a response from the defendant, it subsequently sent two additional address verification letters. After the unit did not receive a response to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of the three letters it sent in its address verification attempts for the period beginning May 23, 2003, the defendant\u2019s status changed to \u201cfailure to verify his address\u201d and his address was considered unknown. The defendant was arrested for failure to comply with the registration requirements on February 24, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On June 9, 2004, the court appointed Attorney Christopher Sheehan to represent the defendant in response to the defendant\u2019s request for a public defender. On May 2, 2005, the defendant informed the court that he did not want Sheehan to represent him, citing his disappointment with Sheehan\u2019s lack of communication with the defendant. The judge encouraged the defendant to resolve his differences with his appointed attorney, and ordered a continuance of the case. On September 7, 2005, the defendant filed a pro se motion for a speedy trial. At a pretrial hearing on September 19, 2005, Sheehan advised the court that he did not believe it was prudent for the defendant to file the speedy trial motion, and the court agreed. The defendant decided to move forward with the motion despite Sheehan\u2019s advice, and the court granted the motion on September 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Sheehan began conducting voir dire for the defendant\u2019s jury trial on September 26, 2005, and the defendant made no mention of representing himself. Juiy selection resumed on September 30, 2005, and on that date, the defendant again informed the court that he no longer wanted Sheehan to represent him. The court discouraged the defendant from dispensing with his court-appointed attorney, and strongly encouraged the defendant to, at a minimum, retain Sheehan as standby counsel. The defendant continued to insist that he wanted to represent himself, noting: \u201cI believe that my lawyer is not effective in representing me and I\u2019m not gonna keep him.\u201d The defendant requested that the judge appoint a different attorney. The court declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>to do so. The court then canvassed the defendant concerning his decision to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The defendant indicated that he understood the implications of his decision to represent himself as outlined by the court. When the defendant again declined to have Sheehan serve as standby counsel, the court excused Sheehan from the proceedings. The defendant then conducted voir dire pro se, and subsequently represented himself at trial. The judge briefly canvassed the defendant again on October 3, 2005, minutes before opening statements were to begin. The case was tried to a jury, which found the defendant guilty of failing to register as a sex offender in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 54-251 and 54-257. On December 5, 2005, the trial court sentenced the defendant to three years incarceration, execution suspended after one year, and five years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On appeal, the defendant first claims that his waiver of counsel could not be found knowing and intelligent in the absence of anything in the record demonstrating that the defendant knew the possible term of incarceration, which implicates the defendant\u2019s right to counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.3 ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>his waiver of counsel was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because the trial court failed to inform him of the range of possible penalties that he would face upon conviction. The state concedes that the court\u2019s canvass did not inform the defendant that the offense with which he was charged carried a sentence of one to five years imprisonment. The state nevertheless contends that the record reveals that \u201cthe defendant clearly and unequivocally stated that he wanted to proceed pro se rather than be represented by his appointed public defender, that he was literate, competent and understanding, and that he voluntarily exercised his informed free will.\u201d We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. In its canvass,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the trial court asked the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>dant a number of questions regarding, for example, whether the defendant had considered the consequences of self-representation and whether he under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>stood the practical consequences of proceeding pro se (e.g., that the defendant would have to conduct cross-examination by himself and decide whether to testify). The court also informed the defendant that he did not believe the defendant\u2019s decision to proceed without an attorney was a wise one.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state concedes, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that the court never specifically advised the defendant of the range of possible penalties he faced upon conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">At the outset, we identify the applicable standard of review. \u201cWe review [a] trial court\u2019s determination with respect to whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily elected to proceed pro se for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 709, 877 A.2d 696 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We begin with several well settled principles regarding the constitutional right of an accused to represent himself. \u201cThe right to counsel and the right to self-representation present mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins. . . . Put another way, a defendant properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 654, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996). When an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ated with the right to counsel. For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must knowingly and intelligently [forgo] those relinquished benefits. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>224 Conn. 253, 256, 617 A.2d 1382 (1992). The state bears the burden of demonstrating that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Id., 260.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>274 Conn. 818, 828-29, 878 A.2d 1078 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u201c[Practice Book \u00a7 44-3] was adopted in order to implement the right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own attorney .... Before a trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, it must conduct an inquiry in accordance with \u00a7 [44-3], in order to satisfy itself that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is knowingly and intelligently made. . . . Because the \u00a7 [44-3] inquiry simultaneously triggers the constitutional right of a defendant to represent himself and enables the waiver of the constitutional right of a defendant to counsel, the provisions of \u00a7 [44-3] cannot be construed to require anything more than is constitutionally mandated. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cThe nature of the inquiry that must be conducted to substantiate an effective waiver has been explicitly articulated in decisions by various federal courts of appeals. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir. 1995) (court must inform defendant of charges, included offenses and possible range of punishment); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 583 [2d Cir.] (factors determining valid waiver include whether defendant understood that he had choice between proceeding pro se and with assigned counsel, understood advantages of having trained counsel, and had capacity to make intelligent choice) [cert. denied, 516 U.S. 903, 116 S. Ct. 266,133 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1995)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Krieken, </em>39 F.3d 277, 229 (9th Cir. 1994) (defendant must be aware of nature of charges against him, possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>penalties and disadvantages of self-representation); <em>Government of Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>James, </em>934 F.2d 468, 471 (3d Cir. 1991) (waiver must be made with apprehension of nature of charges, statutory offenses included within them, range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to charges, circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to broad understanding of whole matter); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silkwood, </em>893 F.2d 245, 249 (10th Cir. 1989) (same) [cert. denied, 496 U.S. 908, 110 S. Ct. 2593, 110 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1990)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>814 F.2d 245, 251 [6th Cir.] (model inquiry includes questioning about defendant\u2019s legal background, knowledge of crimes charged, possible punishments, familiarity with Federal Rules of Evidence and Criminal Procedure, procedure for testifying, and advice that defendant would be better served by representation by trained attorney) [cert. denied, 484 U.S. 980, 108 S. Ct. 478, 98 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1987)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 829-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u201cThe defendant, however, does not possess a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass [with respect to this inquiry]. His constitutional right is not violated as long as the court\u2019s canvass, whatever its form, is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing. ... In other words, the court may accept a waiver of the right to counsel without specifically questioning a defendant on each of the factors listed in Practice Book \u00a7 [44-3] if the record is sufficient to establish that the waiver is voluntary and knowing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The defendant in the present case asserts that the state cannot meet its burden of proving that the defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s canvass was constitutionally insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ficient because the defendant was never made aware of the range of punishments that he could face upon conviction. This court recently addressed the adequacy of a canvass under almost identical factual circumstances in <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 818. In <em>Diaz, </em>the defendant waived his right to counsel after the trial court had canvassed the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3. The defendant thereafter represented himself at trial, and a jury ultimately found him guilty on all counts as charged. Id., 819. On appeal, the defendant claimed that his waiver of counsel was not knowing and voluntary because the trial court had failed to advise him correctly about the range of possible punishments that could be imposed upon conviction. Id., 828. We reversed the judgment of the trial court, and ruled that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was not knowing and intelligent because he did not have an understanding of the range of punishment he faced upon conviction. Id., 833-34. In reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction, we were well aware that the defendant had some appreciation that he faced the possibility of a substantial period of incarceration, as the defendant had rejected the state\u2019s plea offer of fifteen years imprisonment, which had been made on the record. Id., 826. In addition, at one point during the trial in <em>Diaz, </em>the court informed the defendant that \u201c[t]hese are big prison time cases,\u201d to which the defendant responded: \u201cYes, I understand that, Your Honor. It appears to be that way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 827. Even in light of these cautionary words, however, we were not persuaded that the imprecise language used by the trial court was sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement that the defendant be advised of the range of permissible punishments he faced upon conviction, which was a period of nearly fifty years. Id., 831. <em>Diaz </em>controls the resolution of this issue in the present case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>In the present case, as in <em>Diaz, </em>there is simply no evidence present in the record from which we could infer that the defendant had any meaningful appreciation of the period of incarceration he faced if convicted of the charges he faced. \u201cIn such circumstances, it cannot be said that the defendant \u2018received a realistic picture from [the court] regarding the magnitude of his decision [to proceed to trial without counsel].\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fore, </em>169 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1028, 119 S. Ct. 2380, 144 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1999). In other words, the record does not establish that the defendant \u2018knew what he [was] doing and [that] his choice [was] made with eyes open,\u2019 as the constitution requires. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 828, 661 A.2d 539 (1995), quoting <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 833-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u201cThe right to counsel is so basic that its violation mandates reversal even if no particular prejudice is shown and even if there is overwhelming evidence of guilt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 262. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an adequate canvass to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was made knowingly and intelligently constitutes an abuse of discretion and, accordingly, requires that the defendant be granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Because of our conclusion that this case must be retried, it is appropriate for us to give guidance on issues that are likely to arise upon retrial. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 830. Thus, we will address the defendant\u2019s claim that his conviction under \u00a7 54-257 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>deprived him of his due process rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state was obligated to take further reasonable steps to contact him after he failed to respond to all three address verification forms that the unit sent to the defendant in its second round of letters. The state responds that the defendant had actual notice that he was statutorily required to verify his address every ninety days, and that he was deprived of his liberty only after a jury trial. Accordingly, the state contends, the defendant received full due process of law. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to the defendant\u2019s release from prison after conviction for sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (2), he was formally apprised of his registration responsibilities under the state\u2019s sex offender registry, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 54-256.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Specifically, prior to his release, the defendant met with Scott Tetreault, the coordinator for sex offender registration, at the Brooklyn correctional institution. At that meeting, Tetreault obtained the defendant\u2019s post-release address and gave the defendant a number of forms to complete, two of which were entitled \u201cSex Offender Advisement of Registration Requirement\u201d and \u201cSex Offender Registry\u2014Registration Form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The form entitled \u201cSex Offender Advisement of Registration Requirement\u201d contained a section captioned \u201cNotice To Registrant,\u201d which provided as follows: \u201cAs a person who has been convicted of any crime specified in [\u00a7] 54-250 ... or as one who is required to register by [\u00a7\u00a7] 54-251 through . . . 54-255 . . . inclusive, with the State of Connecticut Sex Offender Registry, you must report in person to the [unit]. Failure to comply with this requirement is a Class D Felony. After completing the initial registration you will further be required to return address verification forms that will be mailed to you at your last known address. These address verification forms must be returned to the Department of Public Safety at P.O. Box 2794, Middletown, CT 06457-9294, by first class mail. You must also notify the Department of Public Safety Sex Offender Registry within five days of changing your address and you must notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities if you move into another state. Failure to comply with any of these requirements will make you subject to arrest for a Class D Felony.\u201d Both the defendant\u2019s and Tetreault\u2019s signatures appear at the bottom of the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The defendant also signed a form captioned \u201cSex Offender Registry\u2014Registration Form\u201d at the meeting with Tetreault. The bottom of this form contained the following information, with the underlined text included: \u201cFull registration requires all of the following: completion of this form, a full set of fingerprints and a photograph taken at the time of registration, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>blood sample taken for the purposes of DNA analysis. Failure to complete ALL registration requirements is a Class D felony.\u201d Both the defendant\u2019s and Tetreault\u2019s signatures appear on this form. After the meeting, Tetreault forwarded the aforementioned forms to the unit. The unit received both forms containing the defendant\u2019s signature on November 15, 2002, the same day the defendant was released from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In accordance with its policy on address verification, the unit sent the first letter in its first round of correspondence on February 8, 2003, approximately ninety days after the defendant was released from incarceration. This letter was not returned.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The unit then sent a second letter to the defendant in an effort to verify his address. The second paragraph of this letter provides, with the bold face text included: \u201cThe . . . [unit] is required to verily your residence address every [ninety] days. This verification of your address will be accomplished via the mail every [ninety] days until you are relieved of your registration requirement. You must return this address verification letter within ten (10) days of the postmark. The address that appears with your name at the top of this letter is the address of record for you. If you move you must notify the [unit], in writing, within five (5) days of such a change. If the address is incorrect as it appears, make the necessary corrections in the residence address correction space below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">On February 27, 2003, the unit received from the defendant a completed copy of the second letter. In the space on the form following the words \u201c[residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>address correction,\u201d the defendant wrote the word \u201csame.\u201d The defendant\u2019s signature appears at the bottom of the form, followed by the date of February 25, 2003, and his telephone number. The defendant\u2019s signature appears below a paragraph stating: \u201cMy current address is correct as it appears above. I understand that failure to comply with any of the registration requirements, including the address verification and above listed notifications, is a Class \u2018D\u2019 Felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The unit sent the first letter in its next round of address verification letters on May 23, 2003. When this letter was not returned by the defendant, the unit subsequently sent two additional letters, on June 13, 2003, and June 24, 2003, respectively. When neither of these letters was returned to the unit, the unit identified the defendant\u2019s status as \u201cfailure to verify his address,\u201d and the address was considered unknown. The defendant was arrested for failure to comply with the registration requirements on February 24, 2004. Three days after his arrest, on February 27, 2004, the unit received a typewritten letter from the defendant, dated February 25, 2004, informing it that his address had remained the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We begin with the standard of review. Whether the defendant was deprived of his due process rights is a question of law, to which we grant plenary review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 520-21, 847 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The defendant asserts<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that the state was obligated to make further attempts to contact him before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>arresting him, and relies on <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>547 U.S. 220, 126 S. Ct. 1708, 164 L. Ed. 2d 415 (2006), in support of his claim. In <em>Flowers, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether, \u201cwhen notice of a tax sale is mailed to the owner and returned undelivered, the government must take additional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking the owner\u2019s property.\u201d Id., 223. The commissioner of state lands attempted to inform a taxpayer of his tax delinquency by mailing two certified letters to the address that was the object of the delinquency. Id., 223-24. Although both letters were returned \u201cunclaimed,\u201d the commissioner argued that the two letters were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice. Id., 224. The Arkansas Supreme Court agreed, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling, holding that attempting to provide notice by certified mail satisfied due process under the circumstances presented. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>359 Ark. 443, 454, 198 S.W.3d 520 (2004). The United States Supreme Court reversed, noting that while \u201c[d]ue process does not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the government may take his property,\u201d more was required under the circumstances presented. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>supra, 547 U.S. 226. Specifically, because the notice was returned undelivered, the state had a duty to take further action because no one \u201cwho actually desired to inform a real property owner of an impending tax sale of a house he owns would do nothing when a certified letter sent to the owner is returned unclaimed.\u201d Id., 229. Thus, the knowledge that something had \u201cgone awry\u201d required the state to depart from its usual method of providing reasonable notice. Id., 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Flowers </em>is misplaced. First, the defendant in the present case had actual notice of his obligation to verify his address continually with the unit as part of his responsibilities as a convicted sex offender. Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Flowers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the sender in the present case\u2014the unit\u2014had no indication that the letters that it had sent to the defendant\u2019s address never actually reached the defendant. To the contrary, because the other individuals whose names were listed immediately before and after the defendant\u2019s on the registry list received and returned their letters, the unit had every reason to believe that the defendant had received the letters. Moreover, the evidence also showed that three days after his arrest, the unit received a typewritten letter generated by the defendant himself, dated February 25, 2004, indicating that his address remained the same. Accordingly, under the facts of this case, we conclude that the defendant was not deprived of due process because the state did not take additional steps to contact him before seeking his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Our conclusion is supported by a recent opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court, <em>People </em>v. Molnar, 222 Ill. 2d 495, 857 N.E.2d 209 (2006). In Molnar, the court considered the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act, which is similar to our statutory scheme in that it requires the state police to send nonforwardable letters to the offender for address verification purposes. Id., 500-501. Under the Illinois statute, the sex offender must complete, sign and return the forms within ten days after the letter is mailed. Id., 501. The defendant in <em>Molnar </em>claimed, inter alia, that the state\u2019s registration statute was unconstitutional because the state police were not required to notify a registrant that he had violated the statute. Id., 505. The trial court agreed with the defendant, and held that a municipal ordinance imposing a registration requirement on a convicted felon was unconstitutional as applied. Id., 507. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed, however, holding that the statute was constitutional because the defendant had actual knowledge of the registration requirements. Id., 513. Specifically, the court cited as evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>defendant\u2019s knowledge the fact that upon registration, \u201c[t]he defendant signed and initialed the registration form that again notified him of his duties under the [Sex Offender] Registration Act\u201d and the fact that the registration form itself \u201cnotified the defendant that a violation of any provision of [that act] would result in a [ten] year extension of the registration period and would constitute a [c]lass 4 felony.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We find the conclusion of the Illinois Supreme Court in a case with similar facts to be persuasive. In the present case, the record demonstrates that the defendant had actual notice of his duty to register as a sex offender. Specifically, eight days before he was released from incarceration, the defendant was formally apprised of his responsibilities under the registry statutes by Tetreault. Notably, one of the forms he signed contained the statement: \u201cAfter completing the initial registration you will further be required to return address verification forms that will be mailed to you at your last known address. . . . Failure to comply with any of these requirements will make you subject to arrest for a [c]lass D felony.\u201d Additionally, approximately ninety days after he was released from prison, the defendant returned a letter sent by the unit in its first round of address verification attempts, evidence indicating that he had sufficient capacity to comply with his statutory obligations. We thus reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the state failed to take further reasonable steps to contact him before arresting him for his failure to comply with his registration obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>asserts that the trial court improperly failed to include an element of mens rea in its instruction regarding \u00a7\u00a7 54-251 and 54-257, and thait the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction that the state must prove that the defendant had a duty to return the address verification forms and that he actually knew of this duty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The state responds that the trial court\u2019s charge on the elements of failure to register as a sex offender was correct in law because failure-.to register is a strict liability offense, and because the issue of whether the defendant knew he was obligated to verify his address is not an element of the offense. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing the challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u201cIt is . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged. . . . The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 413-14, 473 A.2d 300 (1984). Consequently, the failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 483-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u201c[I]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 106, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). \u201cThe test is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. ... A jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present. . . . An instruction that fails to satisfy these requirements would violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. . . . The test of a charge is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>it is correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. . . . The primary purpose of the charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find to be established. . . . The purpose of a charge is to call the attention of the members of the jury, unfamiliar with legal distinctions, to whatever is necessary and proper to guide them to a right decision in a particular case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 509-10, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We first consider whether the trial court improperly failed to include an element of mens rea in its instruction, and that such an element is required for the statute to be constitutional. The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. At the close of evidence, the trial judge charged the jury. In doing so, the court first quoted portions of \u00a7\u00a7 54-251 and 54-257. The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIn order to find the defendant guilty as charged in count one of the information, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: One, that the defendant has been convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a [child] or that the defendant was convicted of a violation of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-70. And you heard the evidence there. These are the elements that have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I just read you number one. Two, that the defendant was released into the community on or after October 1, 1998; three, that the department of public safety mailed a nonfowardable verification form to the registrant at the registrant\u2019s last reported address in the manner described above where I spoke of ... \u00a7 54-257; four, that the defendant was required by our Penal Code to return the address verification form; five, and lastly, number five, that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>dant failed to return the address verification form as required by our law.\u201d The court then explained that the law requires convicted sex offenders to return the address verification forms regardless of whether they reside at the same address that they may have previously provided. The court then went on to define a number of terms included in the instruction including \u201cconvicted,\u201d \u201ccriminal offense against a victim who is a [child],\u201d and \u201crelease into the community.\u201d The court concluded the charge as follows: \u201cThe allegation by the state and the determination to be made by you is whether or not the defendant complied with the requirements of the sex offender registry as they relate to returning the address verification forms allegedly mailed to the defendant by the department of public safety. If you are satisfied\u2014if you are all satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the state has proven all of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant guilty. If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to any one of the elements, then you must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We begin with a brief review of our law regarding mens rea. \u201cWhile the general rule at common law was that the scienter was a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this was followed in regard to statutory crimes, even where the statutory definition did not in terms include it . . . there has been a modification of this view in respect to prosecutions under statutes the purpose of which would be obstructed by such a requirement. . . . [T]he common-law concept that criminal acts require the coupling of the evil-meaning mind with the evil-doing hand and may define crimes which depend on no mental element, but consist only of forbidden acts or omissions. . . . Whether or not a statutory crime requires mens rea or scienter as an element of the offense is largely a question of legislative intent to be determined from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>general scope of the act and from the nature of the evils to be avoided.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>178 Conn. 145, 148-49, 422 A.2d 294 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201c \u2018When the commission of an offense defined in [the Penal Code], or some element of an offense, requires a particular mental state, such mental state is ordinarily designated in the statute defining the offense by use of the terms \u201cintentionally\u201d, \u201cknowingly\u201d, \u201crecklessly\u201d or \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d, or by use of terms such as \u201cwith intent to defraud\u201d and \u201cknowing it to be false\u201d, describing a specific kind of intent or knowledge. . . .\u2019 Generally, the absence of any such requirement demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to make it an element of the crime.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>256 Conn. 412, 419, 773 A.2d 931 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">A plain reading of \u00a7\u00a7 54-251 and 54-257 reveals that neither contains an element of intent. Although there is generally a presumption that crimes having their origin in the common law contain an element of intent; <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 437, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978); the registry statutes do not have their origin in the common law and this presumption therefore does not apply. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>245 Conn. 442, 454 n.16, 718 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The absence of a mens rea element in a statute does not necessarily mean, however, that the statute is strict liability. Alternatively, the statute may require an element of general intent. As explained by the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Charles, 78 </em>Conn. App. 125, 826 A.2d 1172, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 908, 832 A.2d 73 (2003), \u201c[g]eneral intent is the term used to define the requisite mens rea for a crime that has no stated mens rea; the term refers to whether a defendant intended deliberate, conscious or purposeful action, as opposed to causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>a prohibited result through accident, mistake, carelessness, or absent-mindedness. Where a particular crime requires only a showing of general intent, the prosecution need not establish that the accused intended the precise harm or precise result which resulted from his acts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 131, quoting 21 Am. Jur. 2d 213-14, Criminal Law \u00a7 127 (1998). In <em>Charles, </em>the court considered the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights by failing to charge the jury that intent was a necessary element of the crime of violating a protective order.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, but declined to rule that the statute was strict liability, instead finding an element of general intent to be required: \u201cHaving declined to adopt the argument that criminal responsibility for the violation of a protective order requires specific intent, we have not, nevertheless, held that the statute is one of strict liability. Rather, we believe that it is a general intent statute, requiring proof that one charged with its violation intended to perform the activities that constituted a violation of the protection order.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In contrast, strict liability offenses dispense with the mens rea of a crime, meaning that the possession of a \u201c \u2018guilty mind\u2019 \u201d is not essential before a conviction can take hold. <em>Staples </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 607 n.3, 114 S. Ct. 1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994). In strict liability statutes, it is \u201cnot required that the defendant know the facts that make his conduct fit the definition of the offense.\u201d Id. The United States Supreme Court outlined the reasoning for imposing strict criminal lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>bility for public welfare offenses over one half century ago in <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 254-56, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952): \u201cWhile many of these [regulations on activities that affect public health, safety or welfare] are sanctioned by a more strict civil liability, lawmakers, whether wisely or not, have sought to make such regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to be applied by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and convictions. This has confronted the courts with a multitude of prosecutions, based on statutes or administrative regulations, for what have aptly been called \u2018public welfare offenses.\u2019 These cases do not fit neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or <em>inaction where it imposes a duty. </em>... In this respect, whatever the intent of the violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who assumed his responsibilities.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Given the legislative purpose of the sex offender registry as a whole, we conclude that the crime of failing to comply with the sex offender registry requirements is a strict liability offense. The goal of Megan\u2019s Law is to \u201calert the public by identifying potential sexual offender recidivists when necessary for public safety.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>69 Conn. App. 516, 552, 794 A.2d 1123 (2002), rev\u2019d in part, 269 Conn. 442, 849 A.2d 375 (2004). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Indeed the United States Supreme Court has noted that Connecticut\u2019s version of Megan\u2019s Law was created in response to the fact that \u201c[s]ex offenders are a serious threat in this [n]ation\u201d and that \u201c[t]he victims of sexual assault are most often juveniles . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 4, 123 S. Ct. 1160, 155 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2003). The Supreme Court noted that the particular threat sex offenders present stems from the observation that \u201c[w]hen convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Two well reasoned decisions from Illinois and New York support our conclusion that failing to register is a strict liability offense. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Molnar, </em>supra, 222 Ill. 2d 495, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>185 Misc. 2d 519, 708 N.Y.S.2d 815 (2000), the Illinois Supreme Court and the New York Criminal Court, respectively, interpreted sex offender registry statutes similar to ours and found them to impose strict liability. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Molnar, </em>supra, 502-503, the Illinois Supreme Court reviewed a sex offender registry scheme that requires the state police to send nonforwardable verification letters that the sex offender must complete and return within ten days. The provision stating the consequences of not registering provides as follows: \u201cA sex offender shall register in person annually within one year after his or her last registration. Failure to comply with any provision of the [Sex Offender Registration] Act shall extend the period of registration by ten years beyond the period otherwise required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 509, quoting 20 Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, \u00a7 1280.40 (a) (2002). The Illinois Supreme Court concluded that the offense of violating the state\u2019s registration act was a strict liability offense. Crucial to the court\u2019s analysis was the notion that \u201cthe imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>strict liability for failing to register was not as harsh as it first appeared, given that [the statute as a whole] required an offender to be given notice of his obligation to register.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Molnar, </em>supra, 523. For that reason, the court found that \u201cthe concern that a person might be subject to a severe penalty for an offense that he might unknowingly commit is not present . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In so ruling, the <em>Molnar </em>court relied heavily on the reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 185 Misc. 2d 519, wherein the New York Criminal Court considered, inter alia, whether failure to register as a sex offender<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> under New York\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act was a strict liability crime. Although violation of the statute could result in the revocation of parole and/or a felony conviction upon a second offense, the court reasoned that the state\u2019s registration act is \u201cnot a traditional criminal statute aimed primarily at punishing wrongdoing\u201d but is instead \u201cin essence a regulatory statute . . . [which] proceeds from a legislative finding that convicted sex offenders exhibit heightened rates of recidivism and that sex offenders therefore present a special danger to the public and, in particular, to vulnerable women and children. [New York\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act] is thus primarily intended as a measure to foster public safety.\u201d Id., 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In light of the legislative purpose of the statute, the New York Criminal Court reasoned that strict liability was appropriate: \u201cViewed in the light of the important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>public safety concerns that are at the heart of [the Sex Offender Registration Act], the [legislature\u2019s decision to impose strict liability for failure to register was altogether appropriate and consistent with precedent. The power of a [legislature to enact a criminal statute imposing strict liability for an essentially regulatory offense involving the public safety, health or welfare has long been recognized. ... In dealing with such offenses, the urgent public interest in protecting the community\u2019s welfare may require that in the prohibition or punishment of particular acts it may be provided that he who shall do them shall do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good faith or ignorance.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 530-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The policy justifications for imposing strict liability are compelling as well. Like the sex offender registry examined in Patterson, our registration requirements are \u201cnot intended as a punitive measure\u201d and are a \u201cseparate regulatory incident\u201d of a criminal judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>264 Conn. 484, 489, 825 A.2d 63 (2003). The imposition of strict liability for failure to register as a sex offender \u201cstrikes a careful balance between [the] defendant\u2019s due process rights and the community\u2019s interest in protecting its most vulnerable citizens from truly terrible crimes.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 185 Misc. 2d 534. That is, although \u00a7 54-256 requires that a convicted sex offender be notified of his obligations regarding the sex offender registry, the strict liability nature of the offense ensures that a sex offender will not be able to defeat prosecution under \u00a7 54-257 \u201csimply by claiming that he did not know about [the relevant registration statute], or that he unintentionally overlooked its requirements, or that he had adopted some privately held interpretation of the statute under which he was not required to register.\u201d Id. Thus, we conclude that interpreting our registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>statute to be one of strict liability is more appropriate than reading it as requiring general intent, where \u201caccident, mistake, carelessness, or absent-mindedness\u201d could potentially serve as a defense. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 78 Conn. App. 131. We thus reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the jury instructions were improper because they omitted an element of mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The fact that the penalty for violation of \u00a7 54-257 results in further incarceration for the defendant does not discourage us from ruling that the statute imposes strict liability. \u201cNeither the United States Supreme Court nor [this court] has held that the magnitude of the penalty determines the constitutionality of strict liability statutes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nanowski, </em>56 Conn.

Relying principally on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>274 Conn. 818, 878 A.2d 1078 (2005), the majority determines that the waiver was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because the omission of information as to the range of penalties, in and of itself, amounts to a violation of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel. In other words, in the majority\u2019s view, the trial court\u2019s omission, in canvassing the defendant, of one factor enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, rendered the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel not knowing, intelligent and voluntary and, as a result, the trial court\u2019s decision to accept that invalid waiver deprived the defendant of his sixth amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because, in my view, the canvass as a whole complied with the constitutional standard that we previously have enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 829-30, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 821-23, 661 A.2d 539 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(1995). Viewed in its entirety, the canvass left no doubt that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. It is undisputed that the trial court did not advise the defendant of the range of possible penalties, as specified in Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (3), which, in this instance, was a sentence of one to five years of incarceration. I would not disagree with the proposition that the trial court should have included the possible penalties in the canvass. As the majority recognizes, however, the defendant does not have a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass to accomplish the purposes of the \u00a7 44-3 inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In this regard, it is worth repeating the applicable standard from <em>Diaz. </em>\u201cThe defendant . . . does not possess a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass [with respect to this inquiry]. His constitutional right is not violated as long as the court\u2019s canvass, whatever its form, is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing. . . . <em>In other words, the court may accept a waiver of the right to counsel without specifically questioning a defendant on each of the factors listed in ... \u00a7 [44-3] if the record is sufficient to establish that the waiver is voluntary and </em>knowing.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 831; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 709, 877 A.2d 696 (2005) (\u201c[Recognizing the constitutional implications attendant to . . . review [under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989)], we do not review the proceedings for strict compliance with the prophylactic rule of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, but rather for evidence that the waiver of counsel was made knowledgeably and voluntarily\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">This leads to my first point of disagreement with the majority\u2019s analysis. While accurately reciting the constitutional standard from <em>Diaz, </em>the majority accepts the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s canvass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>was constitutionally insufficient because the defendant was never made aware of the range of punishments that he could face upon conviction.\u201d The majority refers to <em>Diaz </em>as follows: \u201c[W]e were not persuaded that the imprecise language used by the trial court was sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement that the defendant be advised of the range of permissible punishments he faced upon conviction .... <em>Diaz </em>controls the resolution of this issue in the present case.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The majority goes on to apply the reasoning of <em>Diaz </em>to the present case by indicating that \u201cthere is simply no evidence present in the record from which we could infer that the defendant had any meaningful appreciation of the period of incarceration he faced if convicted of the charges he faced.\u201d Based on this factor alone, the majority concludes that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an adequate canvass rendered the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel invalid because it was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The proper standard to use, I submit, is whether a review of the record of the entire canvass demonstrates that the waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Since a defendant has no constitutional right to any particular question or series of questions, notwithstanding the guidelines of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, we must not base our determination on the absence of a single factor. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 822, this court elaborated on the reason why the test for waiver of the right to counsel \u201ccannot be construed to require anything more . . . than is constitutionally mandated . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) \u201c[S]uch a waiver triggers the constitutional right of an accused to represent himself. . . . The multifactor analysis of \u00a7 [44-3], therefore, is designed to assist the court in answering two fundamental questions: first, whether a criminal defendant is minimally competent to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>decision to waive counsel, and second, whether the defendant actually made that decision in a knowing, voluntary and intelligent fashion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Put another way, this court, in cautioning that the right to counsel not be construed to require more than is constitutionally mandated, recognized that there are two constitutional rights at issue in the review of a waiver canvass\u2014both the right to counsel and the right to self-representation. These two rights exist in inherent tension with each other, and we have recognized that \u201c[w]hen the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">This brings me logically to the second basis for my disagreement. The record of the canvass in this case provides ample support for my conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent, despite the omission in the canvass of specific information concerning the possible sentence. The canvass, which is recited by the majority,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reveals that the defendant was adamant about discharging his attorney and exercising his constitutional right to represent himself at trial and that he appreciated the problems inherent in doing so. Although the court repeatedly warned the defendant of the dangers of self-representation, even advising the defendant that it would be unwise to do so, the defendant persisted in stating his desire to take the risks of proceeding on his own. Despite many additional opportunities for assistance offered by the court during trial, the defendant persisted in exercising his constitutional right of self-representation throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The record in the present case stands in sharp contrast to that presented in <em>Diaz. </em>The record reflects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>fact that the defendant had counsel, Attorney Christopher Sheehan, for approximately sixteen months prior to the trial. The defendant in <em>Diaz, </em>in contrast, \u201cwas represented by counsel only briefly and never, insofar as the record reflects, in connection with the narcotics charges except for bond purposes only.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 832 n. 14. We specifically noted in <em>Diaz </em>that, although the record in that case did not \u201csupport a presumption that the defendant had been apprised by counsel of the range of possible penalties that he faced if convicted . . . the existence of certain facts might give rise to such a presumption in another case . . . .\u201d Id. Despite disagreements between the defendant and his counsel, and despite the defendant\u2019s ultimate decision to proceed without Sheehan, I submit that in the present case, we may presume that, at some point in their discussions, Sheehan made the defendant aware of the possible penalties. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Caracoglia, </em>95 Conn. App. 95, 113, 895 A.2d 810 (\u201c[i]n general, a trial court may appropriately presume that defense counsel has explained the nature of the offense in sufficient detail\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 278 Conn. 922, 901 A.2d 1222 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 658-59, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996) (relying on fact that defendant was represented by counsel for four months during proceedings in concluding that the \u201crecord is sufficient to support the presumption that the defendant\u2019s counsel . . . had explained to him the nature of the offenses in sufficient detail\u201d). Even though the defendant complained about a lack of communication from Sheehan, the record indicates that the dispute between the defendant and Sheehan appeared to involve mainly disagreement over trial strategy. In addition, the defendant had prior criminal convictions and was aware that a conviction for failure to register as a sex offender and to verify his address in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 54-251 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>and General Statutes \u00a7 54-257 would be a class D felony. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 54-251 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant, like the defendant in <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 829-30, \u201cmade his position abundantly clear that he would rather risk self-representation than proceed to trial [with his counsel].\u201d In the face of such adamant refusal of representation, courts have recognized that \u201cthe potential advantage of a lawyer\u2019s training and experience can be realized, if at all, only imperfectly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Varszegi, </em>36 Conn. App. 680, 684-85, 653 A.2d 201 (1995), aff'd, 236 Conn. 266, 673 A.2d 90 (1996), quoting <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). \u201cAs long as the defendant clearly and unequivocally indicates that he wants to proceed pro se instead of proceeding [with his counsel], his waiver of counsel is knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D 'Antonio, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 718. Unlike the facts in <em>Diaz, </em>the facts in the present case indicate that specific knowledge of the relatively modest possible sentence was not a critical factor. Although the defendant faced the complexities of representing himself, about which the trial court warned him repeatedly, he did not face a sentence of magnitude, which was an important point in <em>Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">After clarifying the constitutional standard, the court in <em>Diaz </em>focused on the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the defendant about the potential penalties that he would face if he were convicted. The significance of the possible sentences in <em>Diaz, </em>however, was notably different from that in the present case. The defendant in <em>Diaz </em>faced a sentence of nearly fifty years. After his trial, he received a total effective sentence of forty-three years imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By contrast, in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>case, the maximum sentence is five years.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (7). Although the trial court in <em>Diaz </em>warned the defendant that the charges were \u201c \u2018very substantial\u2019 \u201d and that the cases were \u201c \u2018big prison time cases\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 832; the defendant was not given more specific information. The fact that the court in <em>Diaz </em>concluded that, under those particular circumstances, the defendant did not receive \u201ca realistic picture from [the court] regarding the <em>magnitude </em>of his decision [to proceed to trial without counsel]\u201d; (emphasis added) id., 833; by no means controls the present case, which involves vastly different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">It is noteworthy, as well, that the decision in <em>Diaz </em>did not turn simply on the failure to inform the defendant of one factor of \u00a7 44-3. The decision turned on the constitutional significance of the <em>magnitude </em>of the possible sentence in the overall picture. In <em>Diaz, </em>the court stated clearly that the defendant did not have the constitutional right to be questioned on each and every factor in \u00a7 44-3. Id., 831. Because of the \u201ctrue magnitude\u201d of the consequences, of which the defendant was not informed, however, the canvass as a whole did not pass constitutional muster. The application of the constitutional standard in <em>Diaz </em>does not govern the present case, in which the possible sentence factor was proportionately less significant in the overall picture. The majority\u2019s interpretation of the significance of <em>Diaz </em>would shift the well established focus of this constitutional inquiry. Reviewing courts would be led to focus on whether a single factor was omitted, rather than determining whether the canvass as a whole established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that the waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Changing the focus in this way would not take proper account of the fact that, in deciding to represent himself, a defendant is exchanging one constitutional right for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As this court stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 828, our inquiry, in determining whether a canvass sufficiently assured that a defendant\u2019s choice to forego his right to counsel and to elect his right to self-representation was made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, is aimed at discerning whether \u201cthe defendant knew what he [was] doing and his choice [was] made with eyes open. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, [422 U.S. 835], citing <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S. Ct. 236, [87 L. Ed. 268] (1942).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) \u201cWhen a defendant is faced with the choice of proceeding with counsel he is not entirely happy with or defending pro se, the trial judge must satisfy himself that if the defendant chooses to proceed pro se, he does so knowingly, with a full understanding of the risks involved. . . . This requirement, in effect, simply restates the rule that a waiver of the right to counsel must be clear and unequivocal. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, [835] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 829-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Given the full context of the canvass in this case, the defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system, and his lengthy attorney-client relationship with Sheehan, the trial court\u2019s omission of the factor concerning the possible sentence did not amount to a constitutional violation. To the contrary, the record indicates that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel, and his determination to exercise his right to represent himself, was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"> See footnotes 11 and 12 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> In <em>Dias, </em>the trial court imposed the total effective sentence of forty-three years imprisonment following the defendant\u2019s conviction of two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), two counts of possession of narcotics in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), and one count of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1). <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 819.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> The defendant was sentenced to three years imprisonment, execution suspended after one year, and five years probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
