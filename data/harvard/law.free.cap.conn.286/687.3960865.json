J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">The sole issue in this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is whether the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff, the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not eligible, under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18 (e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs after prevailing in his action against the defendants, Timothy Mellon and Goodspeed Airport, LLC,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act of 1971 (act), General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. Goodspeed Airport, LLC, operates an airport in East Haddam. Mellon is the sole member of Goodspeed Airport, LLC. The commissioner filed a three count complaint against the defendants alleging, inter alia, that they had violated the act by cutting all of the trees and other vegetation on approximately 2.5 acres of land adjacent to the airport owned by the East Haddam Land Trust and the Nature Conservancy. After a trial to the court, the court rendered judgment for the defendants on count one of the complaint alleging unreasonable impairment of wetlands and watercourses in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16, and for the commissioner on count three of the complaint alleging unreasonable impairment and destruction of floodplain forest in violation of \u00a7 22a-16. The defendants appealed to this court and the commissioner cross appealed. See <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>275 Conn. 161, 164, 881 A.2d 972 (2005). We concluded that the trial court properly had rendered judgment for the commissioner on count three and that it improperly had rendered judgment for the defendants on count one. Id. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the commissioner on count one. Id., 171. Thereafter, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Goodspeed Airport, LLC </em>v. <em>Ventres, </em>547 U.S. 1111, 126 S. Ct. 1913, 164 L. Ed. 2d 664 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">After this court remanded the case to the trial court, the commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-18 (e), filed an application for an award in the amount of $138,926.70 for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses and costs that had been incurred by the department of environmental protection in all phases of this litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court denied the application on the ground that a \u201cperson\u201d entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>to recover costs and fees under \u00a7 22a-18 (e) means natural persons and does not include public entities, such as the department of environmental protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">This appeal followed. The commissioner claims that the trial court improperly denied his application for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses and costs on the ground that a public entity is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-18 (e). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-18 (e) is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Scherwitzky Gutter Co., </em>279 Conn. 265, 273, 901 A.2d 1176 (2006). When construing a statute, \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>283 Conn. 644, 650, 931 A.2d 142 (2007). \u201cFurthermore, we presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [sjtatutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardwell, </em>246 Conn. 721, 738-39, 718 A.2d 954 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">In the present case, the commissioner contends that the word \u201cperson,\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-18 (e), is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-2 (c), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAs used in this chapter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> . . . except where otherwise provided, \u2018person\u2019 means any individual, firm, partnership, association, syndicate, company, trust, corporation, limited liability company, municipality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>agency or political or <em>administrative subdivision of the state, </em>or other legal entity of any kind.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, he contends, the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-18 (e) plainly and unambiguously includes state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The defendants contend, to the contrary, that because \u00a7 22a-18 (e) refers only to \u201cany person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity,\u201d and does not refer expressly to the public entities listed in \u00a7 22a-2 (c), \u00a7 22a-18 (e) unambiguously excludes such public entities from its scope. The defendants further contend that, if the definition set forth in \u00a7 22a-2 (c) is applied to \u00a7 22a-18 (e), the enumeration of the various types of entities in that statute would be rendered redundant. Thus, the defendants argue, \u00a7 22a-18 (e) falls within the \u201cwhere otherwise provided\u201d exception to the definition of \u201cperson\u201d set forth in \u00a7 22a-2 (c), and the word \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 22a-18 (e) means a natural person.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We conclude that the legislature\u2019s decision to exclude some of the types of entities listed in \u00a7 22a-2 (c) from \u00a7 22a-18, but to include others, raises doubt as to whether the legislature intended for the definition of \u201cperson\u201d set forth in \u00a7 22a-2 (c) to apply to \u00a7 22a-18 (e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>term \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-18 (e) is ambiguous and that we may consider extratextual sources in determining its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">After considering these sources and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 22a-18 (e) is the more reasonable one. First, as the defendants point out, if the legislature had intended for \u00a7 22a-2 (c) to apply to \u00a7 22a-18 (e), it would have had no reason to enumerate the specific classes of entities in \u00a7 22a-18 (e), each of which already is included in the statutory definition of \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 22a-2 (c), rendering further enumeration superfluous. \u201cWe generally reject a construction that renders any portion of a statute superfluous.\u201d <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>266 Conn. 130, 147, 831 A.2d 235 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Second, although the legislature enumerated certain classes of legal entities in \u00a7 22a-18 (e), it did <em>not </em>list public entities. \u201cUnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive.\u201d* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, 232 Conn. 91, </em>101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Third, as the trial court recognized, the entities enumerated in \u00a7 22a-18 (e) are identical to those that are authorized to bring an action under \u00a7 22a-16,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with the sole exception that \u00a7 22a-18 (e) omits any reference to public entities. Section 22a-16 was enacted in 1971; Public Acts 1971, No. 71-96, \u00a7 3; whereas \u00a7 22a-18 (e), which specifically references \u00a7 22a-16 in delineating the entities who may be awarded costs and attorney\u2019s fees in an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16, was enacted in 1990. Public Acts 1990, No. 90-222, \u00a7 4. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature had \u00a7 22a-16 in mind when it enacted \u00a7 22a-18 (e) and that it deliberately excluded the public entities listed in \u00a7 22a-16 from its scope.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislative history of \u00a7 22a-18 (e) strongly supports this interpretation. During the floor debate on the bill that ultimately was enacted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u00a7 22a-18 (e), Senator Steven Spellman explained that the proposed legislation \u201cauthorizes a court to award costs to any <em>private entity </em>that successfully sues for declaratory and equitable relief . . . [under the] environmental protection laws.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1990 Sess., p. 2916.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Finally, \u201c[t]he common law rule in Connecticut, also known as the American Rule, is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception. . . . Because we must respect the legislative prerogative of choosing the special circumstances under which [attorney\u2019s fees] awards may be made ... we require a clear expression of the legislature\u2019s intent to create a statutory exception [to the rule].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>267 Conn. 524, 532-33, 839 A.2d 1250 (2004). \u201cIn the absence of such language, we will not presume that the legislature intended for [a statute] to operate in derogation of our long-standing common-law rule disfavoring the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.\u201d Id., 533. Although this rule typically is invoked when the statutory language is unclear as to whether it authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees to any person, we conclude that it also applies when the legislature clearly has authorized the court to award attorney\u2019s fees but, as in the present case, the statute is ambiguous as to whether a particular entity is entitled to such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">As the trial court also recognized, the defendants\u2019 interpretation is consistent with the public policy underlying the act and the legislature\u2019s \u201cstrong commitment to the act\u2019s broad remedial goals . . . .\u201d <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>282 Conn. 791, 819, 925 A.2d 292 (2007). We previously have recognized that the act \u201cis an example of a legislative enactment of what has been described as the expanding doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of \u2018private attorney generals,\u2019 who are empowered to institute proceedings to vindicate the public interest. . . . By utilizing this procedure, the legislature expanded the number of potential guardians of the public interest in the environment into the millions, instead of relying exclusively on the limited resources of a particular agency.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transportation Authority, </em>166 Conn. 337, 343, 348 A.2d 596 (1974). It is reasonable to conclude that this was a primary purpose of the act and that \u00a7 22a-18 (e) was intended to provide an incentive for these \u201cprivate attorney generals\u201d to take on the burden of vindicating the public interest in the environment by providing a mechanism to compensate them for the costs of doing so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly concluded that, as used in \u00a7 22a-18 (e), the word \u201cperson\u201d does not include public entities such as the commissioner.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The commissioner contends, however, that this interpretation cannot be reconciled with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16a, which specifically authorize the courts to grant certain forms of financial and equitable relief \u201c[i]n any action brought by the Attorney General under section 22a-16 ... in lieu of any other penalties, damages or <em>costs </em>awarded, or in addition to a reduced penalty, damages or <em>costs </em>awarded . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commissioner points out that \u00a7 22a-18 (e) is the only statutory mechanism within the framework of the act by which a person who brings an action under \u00a7 22a-16 can obtain any form of monetary relief to recoup fees and costs. Therefore, he contends, for the quoted portion of \u00a7 22a-16a to have any effect, the attorney general must be eligible to obtain such an award on behalf of a public entity under \u00a7 22a-18 (e). We note, however, that General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 provides for an award of certain costs to the prevailing party in a civil action, including actions pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. It is clear, therefore, that \u00a7 22a-18 (e) is not the only mechanism for obtaining an award of costs under the act. Accordingly, our conclusion that \u00a7 22a-18 (e) does not provide for an award of costs to a public entity does not render the quoted portion of \u00a7 22a-16a meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\"> The commissioner of environmental protection appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\"> Arthur J. Roeque, Jr., was the commissioner when this action commenced. The current commissioner is Gina McCarthy. For clarity and convenience, all references in this opinion to the commissioner are to Roeque.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18 (e) provides: \u201cThe court may award any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity which maintains an action under section 22a-16 or intervenes as a party in an action for judicial review under section 22a-19, and obtains declaratory or equitable relief against the defendant, its costs, including reasonable costs for witnesses, and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-13\"> The commissioner\u2019s complaint also named the East Haddam Land Trust and the Nature Conservancy as defendants because they owned the properties on which Mellon and Goodspeed Airport, LLC, had conducted their unlawful activities. They are not parties to this appeal. For convenience, we refer in this opinion to Mellon and Goodspeed Airport,, LLC, as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> The commissioner sought $128,750 for attorney\u2019s fees; $6255.70 for expert fees and costs; and $3921 for trial transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\"> \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d refers to chapter 439 of title 22a of the General Statutes, of which \u00a7 22a-18 is a part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> The commissioner contends that the word \u201cperson\u201d cannot be ambiguous because, when the legislature has statutorily defined a term, \u00a7 l-2z mandates that courts must apply the definition to all uses of the word unless the legislature expressly has indicated that another statutory definition applies. As we have indicated, however, \u00a7 l-2z authorizes the courts to consider the <em>entire text </em>of a statute <em>and its relationship to other statutes </em>in determining whether its text is plain and unambiguous. Section l-2z does not require the courts to ignore the fact that the application of a statutory definition would render redundant certain language in the statute under review. Thus, in interpreting \u00a7 22a-18 (e), \u00a7 l-2z does not require us to ignore the fact that the text of the statute contains specific terms <em>other than </em>the term \u201cperson\u201d that are also contained in \u00a7 22a-2 (c). Under the commissioner\u2019s interpretation, these terms would be superfluous. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In a similar vein, the commissioner cites a number of authorities for the proposition that, when a term is defined by statute, courts have no authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>to apply a different definition. It is of course true that, <em>when a statutory definition applies to a statutory </em>term, the courts must apply that definition. The question in the present case, however, is whether the statutory definition applies in the first instance. The authorities cited by the commissioner provide little guidance on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b713-12\"> The commissioner appears to contend that this rule of statutory construction has no application because, in addition to its specific references to certain classes of entities, \u00a7 22a-18 (e) contains a general reference to \u201cany . . . other legal entity . . . .\u201d Under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, however, when a statute sets forth a specific enumeration of things, \u201cgeneral terms will be construed to embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Hackett <em>v. J.L.G. Properties, LLC, </em>285 Conn. 498, 513-14, 940 A.2d 769 (2008). Because \u00a7 22a-18 (e) lists <em>private </em>entities, the phrase \u201cother legal entity\u201d includes unenumerated private entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16 provides: \u201cThe Attorney General, any political subdivision of the state, any instrumentality or agency of the state or of a political subdivision thereof, <em>any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity </em>may maintain an action in the superior court for the judicial district wherein the defendant is located, resides or conducts business, except that where the state is the defendant, such action shall be brought in the judicial district of Hartford, for declaratory and equitable relief against the state, any political subdivision thereof, any instrumentality or agency of the state or of apolitical subdivision thereof, any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity, acting alone, or in combination with others, for the protection of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction provided no such action shall be maintained against the state for pollution of real property acquired by the state under subsection (e) of section 22a-133m, where the spill or discharge which caused the pollution occurred prior to the acquisition of the property by the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\"> We further note that \u00a7 22a-2 (c) was enacted in 1973, <em>after </em>\u00a7 22a-16 was enacted. See Public Acts 1973, No. 73-665, \u00a7 5 (c). \u201cOur ordinary presumptions are strongly against amendment by implication.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>274 Conn. 727, 745, 878 A.2d 1118 (2005) <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring). Accordingly, we must presume that \u00a7 22a-2 (c) does not apply to the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-16. This lends further support to our conclusion that, by using the language of \u00a7 22a-16 in \u00a7 22a-18 (e), and by omitting any reference to public entities, the legislature intended to exclude public entities from the scope of \u00a7 22a-18 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b716-4\"> The commissioner points out that other environmental statutes authorize an award of costs and fees to public entities. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (b) (\u201c[a]ll costs, fees and expenses in connection with such action shall be assessed as damages against the violator together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees which may be allowed, all of which shall be awarded to the commissioner, municipality, district or person which brought such action\u201d); see also <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Kovac, </em>36 Conn. App. 270, 281, 650 A.2d 626 (1994) (\u201c[t]here is nothing in \u00a7 22a-44 which countenances any distinction between fees paid a salaried employee and those paid an outside attorney at a specific hourly rate\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Therefore, the commissioner argues, construing \u00a7 22a-18 (e) to permit an award of costs and fees to public entities would not be an absurd or exceptional result. We have two responses to this argument. First, \u00a7 22a-44 (b) shows that, when the legislature intends to authorize an award of costs, fees and expenses to a public entity that prevails in an environmental action, it knows how to do so. Second, although this court avoids interpretations that <em>would </em>render an absurd result, the fact that a proposed interpretation <em>would not </em>lead to an absurd or exceptional result does not constitute affirmative evidence in favor of that interpretation. Rather, \u201c[i]f a statute can be construed in several ways, we will adopt the construction that is <em>most reasonable.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>243 Conn. 772, 782, 709 A.2d 510 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b716-5\"> Accordingly, we need not address the defendants\u2019 claim, effectively raised as an alternate ground for affirmance, that the commissioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>not entitled to an award under \u00a7 22a-18 (e) because he did not obtain declaratory or equitable relief against the defendants.
