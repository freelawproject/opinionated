J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFT\">This case concerns the valuation, for property tax purposes, of common areas owned by a neighborhood homeowners\u2019 association when those common areas are subject to extensive encumbrances that solely benefit the association\u2019s neighborhood resident members. The plaintiff, Breezy Knoll Association, Inc. (association), appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its municipal tax appeal, brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a, for lack of aggrievement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The association claims that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>improperly concluded that it failed to prove that the defendant, the town of Morris (town), had overvalued its properties for tax purposes because various easements and restrictions burdening those properties rendered them unsaleable and reduced their fair market value to a nominal amount. According to the association, pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Einbinder </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>217 Conn. 240, 584 A.2d 1188 (1991),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when taxable real property is so heavily burdened by easements and restrictions that there is no reasonable likelihood that it could be sold on the market, its value inures chiefly to the dominant estate owners who benefit from the easements and restrictions and should be reflected in the assessments of those owners\u2019 properties, rather than in the assessment of the encumbered, servient property. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The following facts, either found by the court or not disputed, and procedural history are relevant to the appeal. The association is a Connecticut membership corporation formed in 1960 for the purpose of maintaining, preserving and protecting commonly used property within Breezy Knoll, a private lakefront community in the town of Morris. Membership in the association is limited to the owners of the nineteen individual residential properties comprising Breezy Knoll.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The association holds title to three commonly used properties within Breezy Knoll that are the subject of this appeal. Those properties are a 0.84 acre parcel that is used as a parking lot, a 0.56 acre parcel on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>there is a tennis court, and a strip, 10 feet in width and 504 feet in length, located along the shoreline of Bantam Lake and adjacent to four of the residential lots within Breezy Knoll. The deeds transferring ownership of the three properties to the association subject those properties to a number of easements and restrictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The deeded easements and restrictions also have been incorporated into the association\u2019s bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The applicable provisions ensure that the residents of Breezy Knoll, as members of the association, will have continuous access to the common areas, and require the association to own and maintain them for the members\u2019 use and enjoyment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The costs of operation and maintenance are chargeable to association members by way of an annual fee. Pursuant to the deeds, the easements and restrictions \u201cshall be operative and binding on all future owners of any interest in . . . Breezy Knoll . . . for a period not exceeding twenty one years after the death of the survivor of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the now living persons who shall together constitute the original members of the [association].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The association\u2019s bylaws, however, contain no such time limitation. The easements and restrictions may not be altered, amended, revoked or terminated, nor may the lands affected be released from them, unless two-thirds of the owners of Breezy Knoll properties provide written consent. Similarly, the association\u2019s bylaws may not be amended without the approval of 80 percent of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Following a comprehensive townwide revaluation conducted in 2004; see General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 12-62, as amended by Public Acts 2004, No. 04-2, \u00a7 33; the town\u2019s assessor, Barbara Bigos, assigned new values to the association\u2019s properties for the October 1, 2004 grand list. Bigos first determined that the highest and best uses of the parking lot and tennis court properties were as lots for single-family dwellings. She then assigned those properties values of $107,957.14 and $105,328.57, respectively, on the basis of comparable sales. As to the lakefront strip, Bigos valued it at $378,000 by multiplying its total length by a per foot figure that she had derived from sales of other properties around the lake.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the association contested Bigos\u2019 valuations by appealing to the town\u2019s board of assessment appeals (board). It argued that, given the easements and restrictions encumbering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the commonly used properties, they were unmarketable and, therefore, their value had been diminished greatly to a nominal amount. Following the board\u2019s denial of its appeals, the association appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a See footnote 1 of this opinion. It subsequently amended its complaint to challenge the valuations in the October 1, 2005 grand list, in addition to the valuations in the 2004 grand list.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to both years, the association alleged that Bigos\u2019 valuations did not represent the true and actual values of its properties, but rather, were grossly excessive, disproportionate and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">At trial, Bigos, as well as three other appraisers, testified in regard to the valuation of the association\u2019s properties. As to each property, Bigos testified that she had not attributed any of its value to the association members in connection with the assessment of the members\u2019 properties. Rather, she assessed them as separate, independent units, and attributed their value to the association only as the owner of the fee. In Bigos\u2019 view, she had the alternative of doing it either way.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tioned by the association\u2019s counsel, Bigos stated that, because she believed it was inapplicable, she did not consider the rule articulated in <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 457, 464-69, 585 A.2d 712 (1990), which provides that when property is so heavily burdened by easements that it becomes unmarketable, its value should be assessed in conjunction with the properties benefiting from those easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Bigos testified that she \u201cwrestled\u201d with what consideration she should give the deeded easements and restrictions when valuing the properties, because she considered them to be a \u201cpositive benefit,\u201d not a \u201cnegative factor,\u201d and she thought that they actually \u201cenhanced the properties . . . .\u201d Because she was valuing the properties separately, however, and not attributing their value to the individual members\u2019 properties, she chose to account for the easements and restrictions by assigning the tennis court and parking lot lower building site ratings than she otherwise would have.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In regard to the lakefront strip, Bigos explained that she valued it at $750 per linear foot, the same as she had valued every waterfront property around the entire lake. Because the strip\u2019s physical characteristics pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>eluded any construction, she disregarded its ten foot width and, therefore, did not assign it additional value for its acreage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To account for the easements and restrictions, Bigos did not adjust the value of the strip itself, but assigned a lower neighborhood rating to the residential lots adjacent to it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The association presented the testimony of appraiser Barry Cunningham in support of its position that, given the easements and restrictions, the properties had only nominal value. Cunningham described the first step in the appraisal process as determining the properties\u2019 highest and best use, given what is physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible and maximally productive. The second step is determining whether, in light of that use, a market existed for the properties and, if so, examining comparable sales within that market to estimate value. In Cunningham\u2019s opinion, the highest and best use for all of the association\u2019s properties was the current use as community amenities because the deeded easements and restrictions precluded selling the properties and it was \u201chighly improbable\u201d that those restrictions would be lifted so as to make development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>possible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cunningham agreed that the easements and restrictions operated to benefit the lot owners within Breezy Knoll, and he opined that the value of community property typically was reflected in increased values of the individual properties that benefited from it. On the basis of his determination that the highest and best use of the association\u2019s properties was as community property, Cunningham concluded that the properties were not marketable and, therefore, should be assigned either no value, or only a nominal value,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for tax purposes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The trial court concluded that the association had not shown that its property had been overvalued. The court found Cunningham\u2019s testimony to be \u201ccredible and interesting\u201d and \u201cvalue[d],\u201d but nevertheless, found that of Bigos to be \u201cfar more comprehensive, reliable and persuasive.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In regard to the tennis court and parking lot, the court noted that Bigos had assigned those parcels a lower site rating in light of the easements and restrictions, notwithstanding the fact that the lot owners, as members of the association, could vote to remove the easements and restrictions and sell the properties unencumbered. As to the lakefront strip, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>court noted that Bigos had assessed the property at the same rate as all other lakefront property and had not increased the assessment to account for its acreage. After citing Bigos\u2019 testimony as to the general trend of greatly increasing property values in northwest Connecticut, in particular for lakefront property, the court concluded that the association had not met its burden of proving an overassessment and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal for lack of aggrievement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We begin with the principles governing municipal tax appeals. \u201cSection 12-117a, which allows taxpayers to appeal the decisions of municipal boards of [assessment appeals] to the Superior Court, provide[s] a method by which an owner of property may directly call in question the valuation placed by assessors upon his property . ... In a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, the trial court performs a two step function. The burden, in the first instance, is upon the plaintiff to show that he has, in fact, been aggrieved by the action of the board in that his property has been overassessed. ... In this regard, [m]ere overvaluation is sufficient to justify redress under [\u00a7 12-117a], and the court is not limited to a review of whether an assessment has been unreasonable or discriminatory or has resulted in substantial overvaluation. . . . Whether a property has been overvalued for tax assessment purposes is a question of fact for the trier. . . . The trier arrives at his own conclusions as to the value of land by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value including his own view of the property. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">\u201cOnly after the court determines that the taxpayer has met his burden of proving that the assessor\u2019s valuation was excessive and that the refusal of the board of [assessment appeals] to alter the assessment was improper, however, may the court then proceed to the second step in a \u00a7 12-117aappeal and exercise its equitable power to grant such relief as to justice and equity appertains .... If a taxpayer is found to be aggrieved by the decision-of the board of [assessment appeals], the court tries the matter de novo and the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the applicant\u2019s property.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Konover </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>242 Conn. 727, 734-35, 699 A.2d 158 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Although the question of overvaluation usually is a factual one subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review; see <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 23, 807 A.2d 955 (2002); when a tax appeal, like the present one, raises a claim that challenges the propriety of a particular appraisal method in light of a generally applicable rule of law, our review of the trial court\u2019s determination whether to apply the rule is plenary. See <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Killingly, </em>278 Conn. 252, 260, 897 A.2d 90 (2006) (applying plenary review to claim that trial court improperly rejected assessor\u2019s attribution of value of leasehold interest to lessor\u2019s property); see also <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 110, 118, 733 A.2d 817 (1999) (legal conclusions in municipal tax appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>subject to plenary review). We now turn to the issue raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The association claims that the town\u2019s valuation, which the court found accurate on the basis of Bigos\u2019 testimony, runs counter to General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 (a),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which requires the assessment of property at its \u201cfair market value.\u201d The association further claims that the town\u2019s valuation is contrary to a rule of valuation articulated in <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 41 Conn. Sup. 457, concerning the assessment of real property burdened by easements. According to the association, the easements and restrictions render the association\u2019s properties unmarketable, thus reducing their fair market values to nominal amounts. It argues, therefore, that the substantial assessments approved by the court necessarily represent overvaluations. The association claims further that, pursuant to <em>Pepe, </em>it is the owners of the residential properties within Breezy Knoll who enjoy and benefit from the easements and restrictions burdening the association\u2019s properties and, consequently, the value of the common areas properly should be reflected in the assessments of those properties and not in the assessment of the common areas themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The town argues in response that the easements and restrictions placed on the association\u2019s properties are self-imposed and do not destroy the intrinsic value of that land, which consists of highly desirable parcels in an area of consistently increasing property values. It acknowledges that the easements and restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>should factor into the valuation of the properties, but claims that Bigos\u2019 assessments properly took them into account. According to the town, the difference between attributing the value of the properties to either the association or to the residential lot owners \u201cis merely semantics because the nineteen Breezy Knoll homeowners make up the . . . [association . . . [and the] properties are owned, maintained and used by the . . . [association and its members exclusively.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the town claims that <em>Pepe </em>is distinguishable from the present matter because the association here, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Pepe, </em>retains a benefit from its ownership of the properties in question, i.e., the recreational and parking facilities that it provides for its members, the individual property owners. We agree with the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>In Pepe v. Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 41 Conn. Sup. 458, the plaintiff taxpayer was the developer of a 400 unit condominium complex.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The property subject to the tax appeal was a road that provided the only means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>of access to that complex. Upon completion of the complex, the plaintiff had granted an easement to the condominium\u2019s association, giving its members a right of ingress and egress over the road, and it became the association\u2019s responsibility to maintain and repair the road and the utilities running beneath it. Id. The plaintiff, however, retained ownership to the fee of the road, and the town of Woodbury sought to tax him on the basis of the road\u2019s full fair market value, which the town determined to be $889,242. Id., 458, 460. At trial, the plaintiffs expert testified that the road had nominal value at best because, given the easement in favor of the condominium association, there was no reasonable use for it but as a road. Id., 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The trial court, crediting the testimony of the plaintiffs expert, concluded that the plaintiff had been over-assessed. Id., 466. In so concluding, it cited the following principles of law: \u201cWhen an easement is carved out of one property for the benefit of another the market value of the servient estate is thereby lessened, and that of the dominant [estate] increased practically by just the value of the easement; the respective tenements should therefor[e] be assessed accordingly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 464. Moreover, when the nature of the easement is such that it \u201cleaves the grantor with nothing more than the naked legal title to the land, the practical effect of the conveyance is to leave the grantor with nothing of value.\u201d Id., 465. In applying these principles, the court noted that the easement in question totally had eliminated any other use for the land beneath the road, and that the value of the condominium complex had been increased substantially by virtue of the easement. Id. Accordingly, \u201c[t]he only conclusion that can be reached is that the land over which [the road] runs has a nominal value at best to the owners.\u201d Id., 465-66. The court did not conclude that the land had no value to anyone and thus could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>taxed, but rather, that \u201cits value inures to the adjacent property it serves.\u201d Id., 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The holding of <em>Pepe </em>is not anomalous, and the principles cited axe not novel. Thexe is ample authoxity for the general proposition that appurtenant easement rights enhance the value of, and should be assessed in conjunction with, the estate to which they are appurtenant, i.e., the dominant estate. <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>New Canaan, </em>85 Conn. 119, 127, 81 A. 1027 (1911), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>165 Conn. 211, 215 n.4, 332 A.2d 83 (1973); 2 American Law of Property (Casner Ed. 1952) \u00a7 8.104, p. 310; 5 Restatement, Property, Servitudes \u00a7 509, comment (d), pp. 3101-3102 (1944); 1 J.

See <em>Deerfield Village Community Assn. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>25 Mich. App. 138, 140, 181 N.W.2d 62 (1970); <em>Waterville Estates Assn. </em>v. <em>Campion, </em>122 N.H. 506, 507, 446 A.2d 1167 (1982); <em>Grandview Heights Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors, </em>176 Misc. 2d 901, 906, 674 N.Y.S.2d 571 (1998); <em>Beckett Ridge Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Revision, </em>1 Ohio St. 3d 40, 42-43, 437 N.E.2d 601 (1982); <em>Timber Trails Community Assn. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>150 Pa.

With few exceptions,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the fact that the restrictions at issue are in some sense self-imposed, given the symbiotic relationship between an association and its mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>bers, has not weighed in favor of a determination that the servient estate retained value.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Two cases are illustrative. <em>Lake Monticello Owners\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>supra, 229 Va. 207, was an appeal challenging the assessment of common areas, including a lake, golf course and clubhouse, located in a residential subdivision. The deed transferring the common areas to the plaintiff, a homeowners\u2019 association whose members were the individuals owning properties within the subdivision, included an easement over the common areas for the benefit of those lot owners. Id. The plaintiff contested the county assessors\u2019 valuation of the common areas at approximately one million dollars, arguing that because of the easements, the value of the common areas had been transferred to the dominant estates, leaving the common areas with only nominal value for tax purposes. Id., 206, 208. At trial, the assessors agreed that the common areas enhanced the values of the individual owners\u2019 properties, but explained that, in an effort to avoid double taxation, they had accounted for that circumstance by reducing each individual property\u2019s assessment by $500, then adding together all of those reductions to arrive at the value of the common areas, which then were assessed against the plaintiff. Id., 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The Virginia Supreme Court, relying on the same general rule cited in <em>Pepe, </em>agreed with the plaintiff that, \u201cwhere a servient estate is burdened by an easement for the benefit of dominant estates then, for tax purposes, the value of the servient estate is to be reduced and that of the dominant estate increased in accord with the corresponding burden and benefit.\u201d Id., 208-209. The court concluded, therefore, that the assessors\u2019 methodology was contrary to law, and it reversed and remanded the case for an assessment of the common areas at a nominal amount. Id., 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Waterville Estates Assn. </em>v. <em>Campton, </em>supra, 122 N.H. 507-508, the plaintiff, an association whose members were all of the homeowners within a condominium development, challenged the town\u2019s assessment of various recreational properties to which the association held title, arguing that the properties were so restricted by the homeowners\u2019 rights that they had no value for tax purposes. A recorded declaration stated that all of the homeowners would have a right, in the nature of an equitable servitude, to use the properties, and the homeowners\u2019 deeds provided similarly. Id., 508. The trial court agreed with the plaintiff, and ordered an abatement of the assessed value of $76,000 to a nominal value of only $100. Id. On appeal, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, rejecting the town\u2019s claim that, because a provision in the declaration allowing for removal of the restrictions upon a two-thirds vote of the plaintiffs membership rendered the restrictions transient and revocable at will, the restrictions did not destroy the value of the affected properties.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Id., 508-10. According to the court, the properties were \u201cseverely burdened\u201d by the restrictions, given the high percentage of owners necessary to effect their release. Id., 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We conclude that a similar result is warranted here. Although the law generally affords wide discretion to assessors in choosing methodology and to trial courts in evaluating testimony, the latter, \u201cin determining value . . . [are] under a legal compulsion to consider everything that might legitimately affect [it].\u201d <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>174 Conn. 380, 390, 389 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>734 (1978). The principle articulated in <em>Pepe </em>and in the foregoing case law directly was applicable to the valuation of the association\u2019s properties and, because Bigos concededly disregarded it, the trial court improperly relied on her testimony to conclude that the association\u2019s properties had not been overvalued. Although Bigos purported to account for the effect of the easements and restrictions in an alternative manner, that alternative fell short of what was legally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Particularly, as to the waterfront strip, Bigos did not apply any downward adjustment to the value of that property to account for the fact that it was encumbered, but instead, chose to devalue the adjacent residential properties by applying a lower neighborhood rating to them.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Given that all of the testifying appraisers agreed that the easement rights over the strip <em>enhanced </em>the value of the residential properties, that approach lacked coherence. Furthermore, it left the strip itself at a valuation comparable to similar, but unencumbered, waterfront property around the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">As to the parking lot and tennis court, Bigos first assumed that their highest and best use<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was as residen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>tial building lots, and only thereafter did she attempt to account for the effect of the easements and restrictions by applying a lower building site rating. For a particular highest and best use determination to be viable, however, there must be \u201ca reasonable probability that the subject property would be put to that use in the reasonably near future . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Tilcon Minerals, Inc., </em>284 Conn. 55, 65, 931 A.2d 237 (2007). The various appraisers uniformly testified, however, that the Breezy Knoll residents were highly unlikely to agree to remove the easements and restrictions,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which would be necessary to render the properties marketable as residential building lots. In view of that evidence, it was improper for the court to rely on a valuation that assumed a buildable lot.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In light of the pertinent law that Bigos did not consider applicable, the extensive easements and restrictions encumbering the association\u2019s properties, and the unanimous testimony of the appraisers that the association\u2019s members were not likely to consent to release those easements and restrictions\u2014a necessary prerequisite to marketability\u2014we conclude that Bigos necessarily overvalued the association\u2019s properties and that the court\u2019s finding to the contrary, which rested on Bigos\u2019 testimony, was improper. Because the easements and restrictions effectively precluded the properties from being sold, the properties should have been valued at a nominal amount only. Although we agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>association\u2019s properties constitute valuable amenities, their value effectively has been transferred to those parties who are entitled to enjoy them by virtue of the easements and restrictions, namely, the individual owners within Breezy Knoll who constitute the association\u2019s membership. In other words, the assessments of the individual properties owned by the association\u2019s members should reflect the enhancement to the value of their properties attributable to the easements and restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because the rule we apply today is compelled by a variety of considerations, we disagree with the town\u2019s argument that the question of whether to assess the value of the commonly used properties against either an association or its members is merely a semantic one. First, accounting for easements and restrictions by enhancing the value of the dominant property and reducing the value of servient property ensures that both properties are assessed on the basis of their true and actual values, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 12-64 (a). As previously noted; see footnote 22 of this opinion; the enhancement to a dominant property and the devaluation of a servient property caused by an easement are not necessarily equivalent. Second, in the present context, when value properly attributable to the homeowners\u2019 properties instead is attributed to association properties, it deprives the homeowners of the benefit of a deduction, for federal <em>income </em>tax purposes, of the property taxes the homeowners effectively are responsible for paying. See <em>Lake Monticello Assn. </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>supra, 229 Va. 209-10; see also 6A P. Rohan, supra, \u00a7 14.02 [2] (Taxing common facilities separately \u201cworks a hardship on the participating homeowners [who would be ultimately paying the association\u2019s real estate taxes], because they would not be entitled to an income tax deduction for the real estate taxes paid by the association. Since the association is the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>owner of the real estate and the party paying the real estate levy, the constituent owners cannot deduct their pro rata share of the association\u2019s real estate tax.\u201d). Third, when property encumbered by easements is foreclosed upon and sold due to property tax delinquencies, the easements will be subject to extinguishment unless they have been assessed in connection with the properties to which they are appurtenant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See 5 Restatement, supra, \u00a7 509 (2), comments (d) and (e); see also <em>Tax Lien Co. </em>v. <em>Schultze, </em>213 N.Y. 9, 12, 106 N.E. 751 (1914), reh. denied, 213 N.Y. 700, 108 N.E. 1109 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We note finally that Connecticut municipalities, in taxing condominium developments and planned communities, are barred by statute from assessing common areas as separate properties, as Bigos did here. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-204 (b) (2). Condominium developments differ from Breezy Knoll in that their unit owners directly possess undivided interests in the community\u2019s common elements. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (8). Planned communities, however, involve an ownership structure analogous to that of Breezy Knoll, i.e., individual units owned by residents and common elements owned by an association comprised of the unit owners. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (3), (4) and (23). Most states have statutory provisions similar to Connecticut\u2019s, on the rationale that \u201c[t]he theoretical value of the common areas or amenities to the units is taken into account within the assessed value of the units themselves.\u201d Vol. 1, Pt. 3, P. Rohan &amp; M. Reskin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Real Estate Transactions: Condominium Law and Practice (2007), \u00a7 36:03 [3], p. 36-10. The underlying appraisal theory is the same as that supporting our holding today: \u201c[T]he common areas or common amenity packages have no value since they are either encumbered with easements or are otherwise reserved and restricted solely for the use of the individual condominium unit owners. Under this view, the value of the subservient lands (the common areas) is assumed into the value of the dominant easement parcel (the individual condominium units) by virtue of the condominium declaration.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On the basis of the facts of this case and the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that the association had failed to show aggrievement due to overvaluation of its properties. Due to the extensive easements and restrictions burdening the association\u2019s properties, they should have been assessed at no more than nominal amounts, with their substantial inherent value instead being reflected in the assessments of the individual properties that benefit from the easements and restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person . . . claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the board of tax review or the board of assessment appeals, as the case may be, in any town or city may, within two months from the date of the mailing of notice of such action, make application, in the nature of an appeal therefrom ... to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\"> This court did not produce a substantive opinion in <em>Einbinder, </em>but rather, \u201cadopt[ed] the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on [the] issues\u201d raised in that case. <em>Einbinder </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 242, adopting <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>41 Conn.

Bruce Hunter, another appraiser who had been hired by the town to provide an opinion as to the values of the properties, testified similarly that there were two ways to approach valuation. According to Hunter, one method was to \u201clook at [this] as an individual valuation, which is what it is that the assessor has done, which is to value . . . each one of these parcels . . . and then . . . have that owned by and assessed to the association, and the other way that you could value this is . . . [to] take the common elements and have them reflected in the unit value.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">\u201cBut in this case it\u2019s half a dozen [of] one, six of the other.

They all have [the] benefit [of] and own the tennis court and they all have [the] benefit [of] and own the most valuable part of it which is the water frontage . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\"> Bigos explained: \u201cWhen you price a building lot . . . you start out with how many acres somebody has, the acreage.

So we actually did each individual property with a site [rating]. And the [site ratings] ranged from one to six, one being the lowest. And we did put a one on [the tennis court property] because of the restrictions.\u201d Bigos went on to explain that different site ratings would result in different multipliers, which then were applied to the base value of aproperty\u2019s acreage, potentially increasing its value. A site rating of one resulted in a multiplier of one, thus resulting in no additional value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b793-6\"> Bigos explained: \u201cYou can\u2019t build on it. I didn\u2019t necessarily think that anybody was going to use it for anything. ... It was nominal and I didn\u2019t even bother to value it. I probably should have, because everybody pays for their acreage. And I didn\u2019t even charge them for that acreage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\"> Bigos explained that every lakefront property owner, regardless of the type of property, paid $750 per linear foot of lake frontage, and that \u201cthe difference in the [quality of the waterfront] goes into the neighborhood or the site factor, but front foot is front foot.\u201d According to Bigos, \u201c[i]f the [adjacent lot owners who previously] owned [the strip] hadn\u2019t given it to [the association], those [lot owners] would be charged for that linear foot.\u201d Bigos explained further that most desirable waterfront sites such as Breezy Knoll\u2019s had a high neighborhood rating of D, which resulted in a multiplier of 5.65. Bigos stated: \u201cBreezy Knoll, all those waterfront ones ... do not have a D. They only have an A. And, again, these are self-imposed and I had wrestled with it, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and I used [a neighborhood rating of] A, which [results in a multiplier of] 5.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> R.

Oles agreed with Cunningham\u2019s opinion that the association\u2019s properties had only nominal value because the restrictions, which the association members were highly unlikely to remove, rendered the properties unmarketable.
