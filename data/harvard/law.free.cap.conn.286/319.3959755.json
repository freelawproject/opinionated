The association appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the eighth district (commissioner), ordering the association to reimburse the named defendant, Simkins Industries, Inc. (Simkins), for the portion of the benefits that Simkins otherwise would have been able to obtain from an insolvent insurer. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The named plaintiff, Nicholas Esposito (decedent), began working for Simkins in 1948, and continued in that employment relationship until May 16,1984. In February, 1999, he filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c, alleging that he had sustained an occupational disease, including asbestosis, which arose out of and in the course of his employment with Simkins. The decedent died in 2000, and Angelina Esposito, the decedent\u2019s wife and executrix of his estate, was substituted as claimant in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Throughout the decedent\u2019s employment history with Simkins, Simkins either fully insured its workers\u2019 compensation risk or self-insured that risk pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-284. Simkins was self-insured, however, during the last period of the decedent\u2019s employment, from April 1,1965, through May 16,1984.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>On the basis of the varied insurance coverage during the course of the decedent\u2019s employment history, the commissioner apportioned responsibility for the decedent\u2019s occupational disease amongst Simkins\u2019 insurers, including Simkins itself as a self-insurer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One of those insurers, American Mutual Liability Insurance Company (American Mutual), had declared bankruptcy and no longer was in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In accordance with \u00a7 31-299b, as the last insurer on the risk, Simkins administered the claim, but retained the right to pursue a claim against prior insurance carriers for an apportionment of liability and recovery of benefits expended on the claim. In its role administering the claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b, Simkins had reached a settlement with the parties that resolved all issues regarding the decedent\u2019s claim, except that of apportionment. Angelina Esposito received a $200,000 settlement to resolve her claim against Simkins and its insurers. The insurers, together with the association, had agreed to resolve the issue of apportionment of liability subsequent to settlement, and all parties agreed to the reasonableness of the settlement figure. In accordance with the percentages of responsibility allocated by the commissioner, Simkins then sought reimbursement as follows: $63,400 from the association, on behalf of American Mutual; $21,000 from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company; $2400 from American Employers Insurance Company; and $400 from Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In the proceedings before the commissioner, the association acknowledged that workers\u2019 compensation claims that previously had been the responsibility of American Mutual were being administered by the association pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The association contended, however, that it was not obligated to reimburse Simkins for American Mutual\u2019s proportionate share of the settlement because Simkins\u2019 claim was not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7 38a-841 (1), as that term is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the association contended that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>claim fell within the exception to the definition of a covered claim of \u201cany claim by or for the benefit of any . . . insurer ... as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5). The association also claimed that Simkins could not seek apportionment because it had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to making its claim for apportionment pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b. The commissioner rejected the association\u2019s contentions and ordered the insurers and the association to reimburse Simkins for their respective apportionment shares. The association appealed from that decision to the board, which affirmed the decision on the ground that the decision is controlled by <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. State, 278 Conn. 77, 896 A.2d 747 (2006), and <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 724 A.2d 481 (1999). This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On appeal, the association renews the two claims that it made before the commissioner: (1) Simkins is not entitled to seek apportionment; and (2) even if it were, it is precluded from doing so in the present case because it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The association further contends that this case is not controlled by <em>Doucette </em>and its progeny because those cases did not involve apportionment under \u00a7 31-299b. We reject the association\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">It is undisputed that, under the exception to covered claims in \u00a7 38a-838 (5), insurers are not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>obtain reimbursement under the guaranty act. The first issue we must decide, therefore, is whether Simkins, as a self-insurer, is an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act and, consequently, is precluded from recovering from the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">At the outset, we set forth the applicable standard of review. Because the facts are undisputed, the question before us solely is one of statutory interpretation. Accordingly, \u201cour review is plenary and we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are legally and logically correct and find support in the stipulated facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 453. \u201cCases that present pure questions of law . . . invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>281 Conn. 656, 663, 916 A.2d 803 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Although \u00a7 38a-838 (5) previously has been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court never has considered whether that interpretation applies in the context of a self-insurer seeking apportionment under \u00a7 31-299b. Moreover, \u201calthough statutory interpretation by the commission\u2014an administrative agency\u2014is required, the statute to be interpreted is not part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act assigned to the commission for enforcement, but, rather, is a provision of the guaranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>act. Consequently, although . . . the commission had the authority to interpret \u00a7 38a-838 [5], we afford no special deference to its interpretation.\u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 449, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997). Therefore, we turn to our well settled tenets of statutory construction to guide us in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>supra, 281 Conn. 663-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We begin our analysis, therefore, with an examination of the pertinent text of the guaranty act. Section 38a-838 (5) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Covered claim\u2019 means an unpaid claim . . . which arises out of and is within the coverage and subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, apply issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after October 1,1971, and (A) the claimant or insured is a resident of this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>at the time of the insured event . . . <em>provided the term \u2018covered claim\u2019 shall not include (i) any claim by or for the benefit of any . </em>. . <em>insurer ... as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) As we previously have noted: \u201cThe guaranty act does not define the term \u2018insurer.\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It merely defines \u2018[insolvent insurer,\u2019 which provides for the circumstances in which an insurer is to be considered insolvent so that its obligations will be met by the association; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 [6]; and \u2018member insurer,\u2019 which defines the type of insurer that is required to be a member of the association and to be subject to the association\u2019s assessments. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 [7].\u201d <em>Doucette </em>v. Pomes, supra, 247 Conn. 455; see also General Statutes \u00a7 38a-839 (\u201c[a]ll insurers defined as member insurers in subdivision [7] of section 38a-838 shall be members of said association as a condition of their authority to transact insurance in this state\u201d). Neither definition is instructive on the issue before us\u2014 whether a <em>self-insurer </em>is an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act. Indeed, the association does not contend that Simkins is a member insurer. In considering the question before us, however, we are not writing on a blank slate. We therefore turn to the two cases cited by the parties in which this court previously explored the language, legislative history and purpose of the guaranty <em>act\u2014Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 451, relied upon by the association, and <em>Doucette </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>v. <em>Pomes, </em>supra, 442, deemed to be controlling by Simkins.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Although the history of the guaranty act and the purpose in creating the association have been well documented, they bear repeating. \u201cThe association was established for the purpose of providing a limited form of protection for policyholders and claimants in the event of insurer insolvency. The protection it provides is limited based upon its status as a nonprofit entity and the method by which it is funded. Specifically, the association is a nonprofit legal entity created by statute to which all persons licensed to transact insurance in the state must belong. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-838 [7] and 38a-839. When an insurer is determined to be insolvent under \u00a7 38a-838 [6], the association becomes obligated pursuant to \u00a7 38a-841, to the extent of covered claims within certain limits.\u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Hunnihan </em>is instructive because it is one of this court\u2019s first cases to explore the interplay between the obligations imposed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the guaranty act. In <em>Hunnihan, </em>the court had to decide whether the association was obligated to pay a proportionate contribution toward a workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>sation award, pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b, when an insurer from whom reimbursement otherwise could have been sought by the employer\u2019s last insurer on the risk, Fireman\u2019s Fund, became insolvent. Id., 439-40. Because, in order to be reimbursable, a claim against the association must be a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7 38a-838 (5), the court began its analysis with that definition. Id., 449-51. The association had relied on the exclusion to that definition providing that the term \u201ccovered claim shall not include any amount due any . . . insurer ... as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 450; see General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5). Specifically, the association read the phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d to exclude the claim, contending that this phrase was intended to preclude any claims not already specifically precluded as \u201csubrogation recoveries . . . .\u201d Id., 447-48, 450. In response, Fireman\u2019s Fund asserted that the phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d modified \u201csubrogation recoveries,\u201d so that only claims based on subrogation or akin to subrogation recoveries were excluded from the definition of a covered claim. Id., 450. Fireman\u2019s Fund contended that, \u201cif the legislature had intended to bar absolutely all claims by insurers, it could have done so explicitly rather than by employing a broad, catchall phrase of uncertain meaning.\u201d Id. We endorsed the association\u2019s broad reading of \u00a7 38a-838 (5), concluding that the language \u201cencompasses all amounts claimed by insurers as reimbursement.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The court reasoned that this reading was consistent with the history and purpose behind the guaranty act. \u201cAn interpretation of the covered claim definition that excludes claims by insurers is in accord with this legislative purpose to provide protection for policyholders and claimants from insurer insolvency. The exclusion of claims by insurers leaves the risk of insurer insolvency on the insurance industry. The result is that poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>cyholders, who in effect fund the association, pay only for protection for fellow policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer becomes insolvent.\u201d Id., 452. Accordingly, the court determined that the association was not obligated to reimburse Fireman\u2019s Fund, the last insurer on the risk for the insolvent insurer\u2019s proportionate share of the award, because a claim by the last insurer for reimbursement is not a covered claim as defined by \u00a7 38a-838 (5). Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Thereafter, in <em>Doucette </em>v. Pomes, supra, 247 Conn. 456, the court determined that the plaintiff, a self-insurer under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, was not an \u201cinsurer\u201d under \u00a7 38a-838 (5), and therefore was not precluded from asserting an otherwise valid claim and recovering from the association under the guaranty act. The underlying facts can be summarized briefly as follows. Gerald Doucette, Jr., an employee who had sustained personal injuries in the course of his employment, instituted an action against two individuals pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293, which authorizes an injured employee to seek recovery from a third party, other than the employer, for work-related injuries caused by that third party. Id., 445-46. Doucette\u2019s employer, the Metropolitan District Commission (Metropolitan), which had chosen to meet its statutory workers\u2019 compensation coverage obligation through self-insurance, intervened as a plaintiff in the action, seeking to recover for the workers\u2019 compensation payments already made and for future payments that might be awarded to Doucette. Id., 448, 450-51. Thereafter, Doucette withdrew his complaint, and the defendants responded to Metropolitan\u2019s intervening complaint by asserting the guaranty act as a special defense. Id., 451. Specifically, the defendants asserted that \u201cMetropolitan is an insurer within the meaning of the guaranty act and therefore is precluded from recovering from the association because \u00a7 38a-838 [5] excludes from \u2018cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ered claims\u2019 \u2018any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . Id. They contended that the term insurer included self-insurer, and therefore no express reference to the latter was necessary. Id., 456. This court agreed with Metropolitan that, as a self-insurer, it was not an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In making that determination, we began with the exception to covered claims under \u00a7 38a-838 (5) barring recovery by any \u201creinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 455-56. Because the pertinent definitions were not set forth under the guaranty act, the court looked to the general definitions provided under General Statutes \u00a7 38a-l, which apply generally to title 38a, entitled \u201cInsurance,\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise. Id., 456-57. First, the court looked to \u00a7 38a-1 (10), which provides the general definition of \u201c \u2018[insurance.\u2019 \u201d Id., 456. The court remarked that, under this definition, \u201cthe legislature defines insurance as the assumption of another\u2019s risk for profit. An employer that self-insures for workers\u2019 compensation purposes retains its own risk; it does not assume the risk of another. Moreover, it does not receive consideration. It is merely fulfilling its obligations under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to ensure that its workers will receive compensation under the appropriate circumstances. Therefore, according to the language of \u00a7 38a-l (10), the definition of insurance does not include self-insurance for purposes of the guaranty act.\u201d Id., 456-57. The court also rejected the proposition that self-insurers fall within the general definition of insurer as entities or combinations of persons \u201cdoing any kind or form of insurance business\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-1 (11); reasoning that \u201c[t]he fact that a self-insuring employer has chosen to retain its own workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>pensation risk rather than purchase insurance does not transform a company\u2019s business to that of insurance, that is, the employer is not \u2018doing any kind or form of insurance business\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-l (11).\u201d <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 457. Indeed, the court pointed to the numerous other types of insurers defined, but not self-insurers, as evidence that the legislature had intended the enumerated types of insurers to be exclusive. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The court in <em>Doucette </em>found further support for its conclusion in the legislative history of the guaranty act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 459-61. The court noted that, \u201c[although the legislative history . . . does not contain any discussion of the definition of \u2018insurer,\u2019 there is ample evidence that the guaranty act was \u2018substantially the same as a model bill adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners [insurance association], which is an organization of the insurance commissioners of the fifty [s]tates.\u2019 \u201d Id., 460. The court pointed to equally ample evidence from the insurance association\u2019s report demonstrating that association\u2019s intent that self-insurers are not insurers for purposes of state guaranty acts. Id., 461-63. Finally, the court noted that the legislature expressly has defined \u201cinsurer\u201d so as to include self-insurers in the no-fault motor vehicle insurance context, but not in the guaranty act.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 463. Although this omission \u201c[did] not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that it intended to exclude self-insurers in the latter area . . . it is an additional factor militat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ing in favor of excluding self-insurers from the definition of insurers for purposes of \u00a7 38a-838 [5]. It is reasonable to assume that the legislature, having explicitly demonstrated its intention that the definition of \u2018insurer\u2019 includes self-insurers for purposes of our no-fault motor vehicle statutes, would have been equally clear with respect to the guaranty act if its intention had been the same.\u201d Id., 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As one might surmise from the foregoing discussion, the association relies on <em>Hunnihan, </em>contending that Simkins, like Fireman\u2019s Fund, is the last insurer on the risk seeking its proportionate contribution of a workers\u2019 compensation award pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b because a former insurer from whom reimbursement otherwise could be sought became insolvent. Simkins, on the other hand, likens itself to Metropolitan, the employer in <em>Doucette, </em>which was not licensed to transact insurance in the state, but merely had chosen to meet its statutory workers\u2019 compensation coverage obligation through self-insurance. We agree with Simkins that, like Metropolitan, \u201cit retained its character as an employer that simply elected to pay the expenses associated with its employees\u2019 work-related accidents. Although this is commonly referred to as self-insuring, there was no transfer of risk, which is generally considered to be an essential element of an insurance relationship.\u201d <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 459. \u201cThe fact that a self-insuring employer has chosen to retain its own workers\u2019 compensation risk rather than purchase insurance does not transform a company\u2019s business to that of insurance, that is, the employer is not \u2018doing any kind or form of insurance business\u2019 within the meaning of [\u2018insurer\u2019 under] \u00a7 38a-l (ll).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 457. .</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>We note that, in the nine years since our decision in <em>Doucette, </em>the legislature has revisited the definitional section of the guaranty act, \u00a7 38a-838, on three occasions, but has made no revisions to the definition of covered claims to indicate its disagreement with our conclusion therein that a self-insurer is not an insurer. See Public Acts 2003, No. 03-49, \u00a7 1; Public Acts 2004, No. 04-174, \u00a7 5; Public Acts 2005, No. 05-140, \u00a7 2. In the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, \u201cwe have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action [in such cases] as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 252, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000); see, e.g., <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 386, 698 A.2d 859 (1997) (finding support for position that insurer is not third party under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 [a] from legislature\u2019s failure to amend statute when revisiting it to address court\u2019s decisions treating \u201cthird party\u201d and \u201ctortfeasor\u201d interchangeably); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg.

Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 77. In that case, Karen Gagliardi, a state employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>acting within the course of her employment, was injured in a two car motor vehicle accident. Id., 79-80. The driver of the other vehicle had been discharged from Elmcrest Psychiatric Institute (Elmcrest) earlier that day. Id., 79. Gagliardi initiated a negligence action against the driver and Elmcrest. Id., 80. At the time of the accident, Elmcrest was insured by an insolvent insurer. Id. The state, which was self-insured at the time of the accident, paid Gagliardi benefits, and pursuant to \u00a7 31-293, sought to recover those benefits from Elm-crest. Id. The state subsequently obtained indemnity coverage for its compensation claims, but, under the terms of that original agreement, because the association had not yet approved the state\u2019s claim for reimbursement of Elmcrest\u2019s debt, the state\u2019s insurer would have received the recovery due on that claim. Id. The association then brought a declaratory judgment action disclaiming any obligation to reimburse the state, contending that the claim was \u201cfor the benefit of\u2019 an insurer and thus was not a \u201c \u2018covered claim\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 38a-838 (5). Id., 81. Thereafter, the state and its indemnity carrier executed an amendment to their insurance policy whereby the carrier waived any claim to funds recovered by the state in the underlying action. Id. The trial court rejected the association\u2019s claim, concluding that, because of the waiver, the funds at issue were not for the benefit of an insurer. Id. On appeal, this court agreed that the state was a self-insured employer entitled to reimbursement by the association. Id., 81-82. In reaching that conclusion, the court noted the uncontested principle from <em>Doucette </em>that a self-insurer is not an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act. Id., 84 n.6. The court rejected the association\u2019s contention that the state\u2019s claim was really one \u201cfor the benefit of\u2019 an insurer, the indemnity carrier, reasoning that the status of the claim before execution of the waiver could not be restored without impermissibly interfering with con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tractual relations between the state and the indemnity carrier. Id., 84-85. The court also rejected the association\u2019s contention that permitting the state to recover would thwart the legislature\u2019s expressed desire to preserve the association\u2019s resources. Id. \u201cIn fact, the association\u2019s primary purpose, the reimbursement of claims made against failed insurers, certainly is served by affording the state recovery in the present case, where, but for reimbursement, the state\u2019s claim would go unsatisfied due to insurer insolvency.\u201d Id., 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Similarly, although we acknowledge the association\u2019s warning in the present case that a result of our determination could be the significant depletion of its assets, that factor does not convince us that our reasoning in <em>Doucette </em>was flawed. Indeed, \u201cthe legislature has accounted for the possibility that the association might, at times, incur substantial liability. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (c) (\u2018[i]f the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of said association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available may be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available\u2019).\u201d <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 86. In fact, this court also has noted that, \u201c[i]n general, the legislative objective was to make the [association] liable to the same extent that the insolvent insurer would have been liable under its policy. . . . <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>217 Conn. 371, 390, 585 A.2d 1216 (1991) (association may not use exhaustion or nonduplication of recovery provisions to avoid its responsibilities for paying claims that should have been covered by insolvent excess insurer). . . . <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Fontaine, </em>[278 Conn. 779, 791-92, 900 A.2d 18 (2006)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>American Economy Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Co., </em>278 Conn. 794, 815, 900 A.2d 27 (2006). Therefore, \u201can inteipretation of the guaranty act that automatically would shift liability ... to the nearest solvent insurer when liability does not rest there already would do violence to the legislatively established scheme.\u201d Id., 815-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Finally, the association contends that, although under <em>Doucette </em>a self-insurer is not an insurer for purposes of <em>\u00a7 31-293, </em>it nevertheless is an insurer for purposes of <em>\u00a7 31-299b. </em>This argument presupposes a difference between the association\u2019s role of protecting claims brought against insolvent liability carriers and insolvent workers\u2019 compensation carriers. This distinction is not reflected either in the guaranty act or in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we decline to differentiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The association contends, however, that the question in the present case is whether the <em>association </em>is an employer or insurer, as those are the relevant parties to whom apportionment applies under \u00a7 31-299b. The association\u2019s attempt to distinguish its claim from the issue in <em>Doucette </em>by recasting the question as one of apportionment under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, rather than as one of its responsibilities under the guaranty act, is to no avail. In <em>Doucette, </em>our analysis began and ended with the guaranty act; we did not examine the association\u2019s liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or tort law for that matter, because the association\u2019s liability is dictated by the guaranty act. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act would be relevant in any given case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>only to the extent that it shed light on whether the insolvent insurer, whose obligation the association assumed, would be liable under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The association further claims, however, that, under \u00a7 31-299b, a self-insured employer is permitted to seek an insolvent insurer\u2019s share on a pro rata basis from the solvent insurers on the claim. There is, however, no language in \u00a7 31-299b to support that contention. Indeed, in light of our construction of the guaranty act in <em>Doucette, </em>under which a self-insurer is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d excluded from coverage under \u00a7 38a-838 (5), there is no evidence beyond \u00a7 31-299b from which we could conclude that the legislature intended self-insurers to seek reimbursement from solvent insurers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that a self-insured employer may seek reimbursement from the association for an insolvent insurer\u2019s apportioned share of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The association also contends that, even if we conclude that Simkins, as a self-insured employer, may obtain reimbursement from the association for an insolvent insurance carrier\u2019s share of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Simkins cannot do so in the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>because it has not exhausted its remedies as required under General Statutes \u00a7 38a-845 (l).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The association contends that Simkins was required to seek reimbursement from all the solvent insurers for their proportional shares of benefits attributable to their periods of coverage, <em>and </em>for a similarly proportional share of any benefits that were due from American Mutual. In other words, the association contends that Simkins would have to seek reapportionment or redistribution of the insolvent carrier\u2019s share among the remaining solvent insurers on the claim before seeking reimbursement from the association. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In addition to our conclusion in part I of this opinion that \u00a7 31-299b provides no right to apportionment, we note that \u00a7 38a-845 imposes no exhaustion obligation in the present case because Simkins has no rights under an insurance policy with any of the insurers that were not already satisfied. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The record reflects that those policies provided coverage to Simkins as an insured for its workers\u2019 compensation claims for insurers that fully honored their obligations under their respective policies. See <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>American Economy Ins. Co., </em>supra, 278 Conn. 814 (\u201c[t]he exhaustion requirement applies only when there is a valid claim against another insurance company\u201d); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Gailno, </em>275 Conn. 290, 306, 880 A.2d 127 (2005) (\u201ca claimant satisfies the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 38a-845 [1] by pursuing coverage under her own uninsured motorist policy prior to attempting to collect either from the [state] guaranty fund or the tortfeasor personally\u201d). The legislative objective of the guaranty act was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>to make the association liable to the same extent that the insolvent insurer would have been liable under its policy. <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 390 (association may not use exhaustion or nonduplication of recovery provisions to avoid responsibilities for paying claims that should have been covered by insolvent excess insurer). Accordingly, there is no exhaustion of remedies bar to Simkins seeking recovery against the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee suffers an injury or disease for which compensation is found by the commissioner to be payable according to the provisions of this chapter, the employer who last employed the claimant prior to the filing of the claim, or the employer's insurer, shall be initially liable for the payment of such compensation.
