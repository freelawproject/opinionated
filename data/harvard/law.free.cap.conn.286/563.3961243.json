Upon remand, the negligence claims brought by the injured named plaintiff, Norman Pelletier, and his wife, the plaintiff Reine Pelletier,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the defendant, Sordoni/Skanska Construction Company (Sordoni), were tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff. After granting the plaintiffs motion for post-judgment interest and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $41,417,065.15. On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sordoni claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that, as general contractor for the project, Sordoni owed the plaintiff a nondelegable duty of care under \u00a7 1307 of the Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc., (BOCA) National Building Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to inspect all steel welds at the construction site; (2) concluded that a violation of the building code constitutes negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>per se, rather than \u201csome evidence\u201d of negligence; and (3) declined to admit evidence of, and charge the jury on, the doctrine of excusable negligence. In his cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that, although he prevailed at trial, the court improperly precluded the jury from finding Sordoni liable on any ground other than statutory negligence when the court declined his request to charge the jury on Sordoni\u2019s duty to use due care under: (1) principles of common-law negligence; (2) the rule that a general contractor must ensure that its independent subcontractors take special precautions when the work involves a peculiar and unreasonable risk of physical harm; and (3) the rule that a general contractor who retains control over all or a portion of the work performed by its independent subcontractors must ensure that the work is properly performed. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The following undisputed facts are set forth in <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 512-14. \u201cAt the time of the incident giving rise to this action, Sordoni was the general contractor for the \u2018Pitney Bowes project,\u2019 a building under construction for a large shipping company, Pitney Bowes, Inc. (Pitney Bowes). The plaintiff was an employee of Berlin Steel Construction Company (Berlin Steel), the structural steel fabrication and erection subcontractor for the project. Sordoni hired [Professional Services Industries, Inc., (Professional Services)] to inspect the work performed by Berlin Steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">\u201cUnder its subcontract with Sordoni, Berlin Steel had the responsibility to provide all of the structural steel for the Pitney Bowes project, and to ensure its integrity. This included the duty to weld connections in the structural steel that would allow for the interconnection of steel members as a load-bearing, structural frame for the building. Furthermore, Berlin Steel had the duty to inspect those welds, ensuring their ability to bear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>weight. Under its contract with Berlin Steel, Sordoni reserved the right to inspect the structural steel, \u2018solely for [its own] benefit.\u2019 The contractual documents emphasized that Sordoni\u2019s \u2018[inspection and acceptance, or failure to inspect, shall in no way relieve [Berlin Steel] from [its] responsibility to furnish satisfactory material strictly in compliance with the [c]ontract [documents.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">\u201cOn June 20,1994, the plaintiff suffered serious physical injuries in an accident at the Pitney Bowes construction site. At the time of the accident, he was working beneath the building\u2019s large steel frame, which his employer, Berlin Steel, had been hired to build. The plaintiff was in the process of installing [sheet metal] flooring between two steel columns when several of his coworkers interrupted his work to install a two ton crossbeam between the columns. The plaintiff stepped away while his coworkers bolted the crossbeam to seat connections, which are steel flanges that enable the interconnection of large structural members, located on each of the columns. One of the seat connections, on column 313, had been only tack welded to the column. A tack weld is a weak, provisional weld, which is intended only to hold a piece in place pending a full, load-bearing weld. The tack weld on column 313 did not immediately give way under the load of the crossbeam. After his coworkers secured the crossbeam to the seat connections on the columns, the plaintiff returned to work beneath the crossbeam. Within minutes, the seat connection broke and the corresponding end of the crossbeam fell, striking him. The plaintiff suffered severe injuries and is currently recovering workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Berlin Steel for his injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On August 22,1995, the plaintiff commenced the present action. \u201cIn his complaint,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff alleged negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>gence as to both Sordoni<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Professional Services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and breach of contract as to Sordoni alone.* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both defendants moved for summary judgment. Sordoni argued that, pursuant to the rule set forth by the Appellate Court in <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>16 Conn. App. 660, 548 A.2d 461, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 822, 551 A.2d 756 (1988), it could not be held liable in negligence to the employee of its independent subcontractor. Sordoni also argued that the contract that was alleged in count two of the complaint did not exist. Professional Services argued that it did not owe a duty to the plaintiff under its subcontract with Sordoni. The trial court granted both motions for summary judgment and rendered judgment for the defendants accordingly.\u201d Id., 512. The plaintiffs appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to this court. On July 1, 2003, we reversed the judgment on the negligence claim against Sordoni and remanded the case for further proceedings, but affirmed the judgment in all other respects. Id., 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On remand, Sordoni again moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs claims of negligence and loss of consortium. Sordoni argued that the undisputed facts established that the claims did not fall within any of the exceptions recognized in <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 518, to the rule that a general contractor may not be held hable for the torts of its independent subcontractor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>granted summary judgment for Sordoni<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the plaintiff moved to reargue and reconsider. The plaintiff claimed, in part, that the trial court had not examined all of the relevant factors in determining whether Sordoni owed him a duty. These included interpretation of Berlin Steel\u2019s subcontract in light of Sordoni\u2019s other contractual and statutory duties, the duties Sordoni expressly had assumed for safety at the job site and the requirements of the Connecticut building code. On December 16, 2004, the court vacated its prior decision and denied Sordoni\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The court explained that it previously had neglected to consider Sordoni\u2019s regulatoiy obligations under the building code; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 29-252-la; to inspect the welds fabricated by Berlin Steel because the plaintiff had failed to raise the issue in its opposition to the motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court nevertheless determined, fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>lowing reconsideration,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the building code imposed a separate and distinct obligation on Sordoni, as the permit applicant, to conduct special inspections of all steel welds to ensure that they conformed to contract and building code specifications. The court explained: \u201cThe problem with Sordoni\u2019s claim [that it had no legal duty to inspect the welds] is that it sweeps away the obligation imposed on the permit applicant by various sections of the BOCA . . . [code] to provide for special inspections.\u201d The court thus concluded, in light of evidence submitted by the plaintiff that Sordoni was the permit applicant and had failed to ensure that all welds were inspected, that the motion for summary judgment had been improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On January 7, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment as to Sordoni\u2019s liability on the remaining negligence claims,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> arguing that the court had determined that there was no issue of material fact regarding Sordoni\u2019s failure to provide special inspections of all steel welds under the building code. The court denied the motion on May 5, 2005, concluding that, although Sordoni had a legal duty to inspect the welds and the undisputed facts supported the plaintiffs claim of a violation under the code, the fact finder still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>needed to determine whether the plaintiff had been negligent and, if so, whether his negligence was more than 50 percent responsible for his injuries. On May 24, 2005, Sordoni filed a special defense asserting that any injuries, damages and losses suffered by the plaintiff were directly and proximately caused by his own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The case was tried to a jury in November and December of 2005. On November 29, 2005, Sordoni moved for a directed verdict and asked the court to reconsider its prior rulings on Sordoni\u2019s duty to inspect the welds. The trial court denied the motion. In its preliminary request to charge, Sordoni also sought instructions that a violation of the building code constituted evidence of negligence, rather than negligence per se, and that the jury could consider whether Sordoni\u2019s alleged negligence was excusable under the circumstances. Having previously decided as a matter of law that Sordoni had a duty to inspect the welds, the trial court declined to instruct as Sordoni requested. The court also declined to give instructions proposed by the plaintiff regarding common-law negligence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On December 8, 2005, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded him $5,645,834.74 in economic damages, $22,710,000 in noneconomic damages and awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Reine Pelletier $3,800,000 for loss of consortium, for a total damages award of $32,155,834.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">On January 9, 2006, Sordoni filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, claiming that it did not owe the plaintiff a separate, distinct, nondelegable duty to conduct special inspections of all steel welds at the Pitney Bowes site. In the alternative, Sordoni claimed that the trial court should set aside the verdict and order a new trial because the court improperly had: (1) concluded that a violation of the building code constitutes negligence per se; (2) denied Sordoni\u2019s request to charge the jury on excusable negligence; (3) concluded that a single statement made by Sordoni\u2019s counsel during oral argument on the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment constituted a judicial admission; and (4) ordered that one of the plaintiffs requests to admit be deemed granted. Sordoni also challenged the verdict as excessive. The trial court denied the motion. The court further denied Sordoni\u2019s motion for remittitur seeking to reduce the award of damages. On March 9, 2006, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the jury verdict, granted his motion for postjudgment interest and attorney\u2019s fees and awarded him damages in the amount of $41,417,065.15. This appeal and cross appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Sordoni first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that it owed the plaintiff a nondelegable duty of care under \u00a7 1307 of the building code to inspect all welds at the Pitney Bowes site and that its failure to do so constituted negligence per se.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Sordoni specifically claims that neither the building code itself, nor any provisions incorporated therein, created such a duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and that this conclusion is supported by out-of-state case law and public policy, which militate against placing legal responsibility for compliance with the building code\u2019s numerous technical requirements on general contractors. The plaintiff responds that the building code imposed a nondelegable duty on Sordoni, as the permit applicant, to provide special inspections of all steel welds. We agree with Sordoni that it did not have a nondelegable duty under the building code to inspect all welds.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Before we address the merits of the claim, we first consider whether it was properly preserved for appellate review. The plaintiff contends that Sordoni\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of its pretrial motion for summary judgment is improper because a party cannot appeal from the denial of summary judgment following a trial on the merits. An appeal instead must be taken from the jury\u2019s verdict and the court\u2019s final judgment rendered thereon. Thus, according to the plaintiff, the only relevant issue on appeal is whether the trial court correctly charged the jury regarding Sordoni\u2019s duty to the plaintiff. Sordoni replies that it properly preserved the issue of its duty to the plaintiff under the building code by asserting the claim in its pretrial motion for summary judgment and then reasserting the claim in its motion for directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case and, thereafter, in its posttrial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or to set aside the verdict. We conclude that Sordoni\u2019s claim is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">It is well established that, \u201cabsent exceptional circumstances, a denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable where a full trial on the merits produces a verdict against the moving party. . . . The basis of this policy is that even if the motion is improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>erly denied, the error is not reversible; the result has merged into the subsequent decision on the merits. To hold otherwise would be to depart from this sound policy which allows a decision based on more evidence to preclude review of a decision made on less evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gurliacci </em>v. Mayer, 218 Conn. 531, 541 n.7, 590 A.2d 914 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We conclude that exceptional circumstances exist in the present case that permit this court to review Sordoni\u2019s claim. The issue of whether Sordoni had a duty under the building code to inspect all welds was decided by the trial court as a matter of law prior to the start of the trial. The court subsequently instructed the jury that \u201can applicant for a building permit has the duty to conduct an inspection of all welds for the steel elements of buildings and structures to ascertain that all fabrication and erection by welding is performed in accordance with the requirements of the contract documents and to make certain that ... all welds conform to the requirements of the structural welding code and to the detail drawings.\u201d The court added that the jury must decide, not whether a legal duty existed, but whether the building code had been violated by Sordoni\u2019s acts or failure to act. The court explained: \u201cThe only claim being made here is that [Sordoni] negligently failed to inspect the weld when it had an administrative duty or legal duty to do so.\u201d Thus, because the issue of Sordoni\u2019s legal duty was decided in the pretrial hearing and no further evidence on the question was presented at trial, the underlying policy that a decision based on more evidence following a full trial on the merits should preclude review of a decision made on less evidence is not violated by allowing appellate review of Sordoni\u2019s claim that it did not have a duty under the building code to inspect all welds.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Moreover, Sordoni preserved its claim, following the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment, not only in its oral motion for directed verdict, but also in its subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or to set aside the verdict and for a new trial,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which the trial court denied. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>252 Conn. 641, 661 n.19, 748 A.2d 834 (2000) (claim adequately preserved by defendant\u2019s objections in its motion for summary judgment, its motion for directed verdict that incorporated its objections and its motion to set aside verdict). We therefore conclude that Sordoni\u2019s claim may be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Turning to the merits, we begin by noting that \u201c[t]he existence of a duty of care is an essential element of negligence. ... A duty to use care may arise from a contract, from a statute, or from circumstances under which a reasonable person, knowing what he knew or should have known, would anticipate that harm of the general nature of that suffered was likely to result from his act or failure to act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>267 Conn. 539, 547, 839 A.2d 1259 (2004). The existence of a legal duty is a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. <em>David M. Somers &amp; Associates, P.C. </em>v. <em>Busch, </em>283 Conn. 396, 407, 927 A.2d 832 (2007) (\u201c[w]hen a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions are challenged . . . our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record\u201d [internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ted]); <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Arett Sales Corp., </em>246 Conn. 563, 571, 717 A.2d 215 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff alleges that the duty arises under the building code. General Statutes \u00a7 29-252 provides in relevant part that the state shall adopt and administer a building code \u201cbas*ed on a nationally recognized model building code for the purpose of regulating the design, construction and use of buildings or structures . . . .\u201d The provisions of the building code at issue are contained in the 1988 supplement to the BOCA<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> National Building Code of 1987 (building code \u00a7 1307 et seq.) and the standards articulated in the Structural Welding Code\u2014Steel of the American Welding Society, Inc., (AWS) Dl.l (welding code),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> incorporated therein, which were adopted in 1989 by \u00a7 29-252-la of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordani/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Section 1307.1 of the building cod\u00e9 requires a permit applicant to \u201cprovide\u201d special inspections of steel fabricated items as a condition for permit issuance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The applicant must submit a \u201cstatement of special inspections\u201d describing the materials and work that require special inspections, the inspections to be performed and a list of the individuals, agencies or firms to be retained for conducting the inspections.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>inspectors must keep records of the inspections, submit interim reports on their status and file a final report documenting their completion. Building code \u00a7 1307.1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The special inspections to which the building code refers include inspections of the structural loadbearing members and assemblies constructed on the premises of the fabricator\u2019s shop.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Welds are among the items that may be fabricated on the premises.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Special inspections are not necessary, however, \u201cwhen the fabricator maintains an agreement with an approved independent inspection or quality control agency to periodically conduct in-plant inspections at the fabricator\u2019s plant, at a frequency that will assure the fabricator\u2019s conformance to the requirements of the inspection agency\u2019s approved quality control program.\u201d Building code \u00a7 1307.2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Insofar as special inspections of welds are required, the building code mandates that inspections be conducted in conformance with \u00a7 6 of the welding code.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The welding code describes two types of inspections, fabrication/erection inspections and verification inspections, the former being the responsibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>contractor<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the latter the prerogative of the owner.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The welding code further mandates that fabrication by welding must be performed in accordance with the requirements of the contract documents and that the contractor is responsible for conducting visual inspections of all welds.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Sordoni claims that the trial court improperly determined that it had a nondelegable duty under the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>code to conduct special inspections of all welds and that a violation of that duty constituted negligence per se. We agree. Assuming, without deciding, that the building code imposes a duty on the permit applicant, we conclude that the applicant does not have a nondelegable duty to inspect all welds, but, rather, a duty to \u201cprovide\u201d such inspections, and, in furtherance of this duty, must submit to the state a complete list of materials and work requiring special inspections, the inspections to be performed and the individuals, agencies or firms to be retained for conducting the inspections. We also conclude, in accordance with \u00a7 1307.2 of the building code, that the permit applicant does not have a duty to inspect welds fabricated on the premises of the fabricator\u2019s shop when the fabricator maintains an agreement with an approved independent inspection or quality control agency to conduct periodic in-shop inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In support of these conclusions we initially note that the building code mandates special inspections of <em>all </em>welds because \u00a7\u00a7 1307.1,1307.2 and 1307.3.3.2 incorporate by reference provisions of the welding code that require such inspections. See welding code \u00a7 6.1.4 (\u201c[inspector shall ascertain that <em>all </em>fabrication and erection by welding is performed in accordance with the requirements of the contract documents\u201d [emphasis added]); \u00a7 6.6.1 (\u201ccontractor shall be responsible for visual inspection and necessary correction of <em>all </em>deficiencies in materials and workmanship in accordance with . . . subsections 8.15.1 . . . .\u201d [emphasis added]); and \u00a7 8.15.1 (\u201c[a]tt welds shall be visually inspected\u201d [emphasis added]). Permit applicants, however, are not required to conduct the inspections. Section 1307.1 of the building code merely requires that the permit applicant \u201cprovide\u201d special inspections. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>(Emphasis added.) That the building code does not expect the permit applicant to conduct special inspections is clear from the language of \u00a7 1307.1.1, which provides, as a condition for permit issuance, that the applicant shall submit a \u201cstatement of special inspections\u201d that includes \u201ca list of the individuals, agencies and/or firms intended to be retained for conducting such inspections.\u201d Thus, although the building code does not explicitly <em>preclude </em>the permit applicant from conducting special inspections, it clearly contemplates that such inspections will be conducted by a qualified expert retained by the permit applicant or by an approved independent inspection or quality control agency with which the fabricator maintains an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In the present case, we conclude that Sordoni did not have a duty under the building code to provide special inspections because it subcontracted the work of inspecting all welds to the fabricator, Berlin Steel. The subcontract specifically directed Berlin Steel to provide \u201call [structural [s]teel and [m]etai [d]eck and related work required\u201d for the project. This work was to be performed \u201cin strict compliance\u201d with the drawings and specifications listed in schedule A. Among the items in schedule A was drawing number S-9, entitled \u201cSteel Details and Notes.\u201d Note 13 provided that \u201c[a]ll connections shall be in accordance with [American Institute of Steel Construction, Inc.] AISC specifications.\u201d Note 21 additionally provided that \u201c[a]ll structural welding shall conform to AWS and AISC specifications. . . . Provision shall be made for all shop and field inspections and testing of <em>all welds. </em>(See specifications.)\u201d (Emphasis added.) These provisions unequivocally establish that Berlin Steel was required under the terms of its subcontract with Sordoni to inspect all welds.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>With respect to the manner of conducting the inspections, \u00a7 1.3 of the subcontract provided that the work to be performed included all work described in the structural steel specifications. Section 2.4 C of the steel specifications stated that Berlin Steel was \u201cfully responsible for inspection and testing herein required either by utilization of [o]wner\u2019s [inspection [a]gency reports, or providing [its] own [inspection and [t]esting [a]gency.\u201d Section 2.4 B of the specifications also directed that if Berlin Steel wanted to use the inspection and testing reports produced by the owner\u2019s independent inspection and testing agency, it could do so at its own \u201cresponsibility.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the alternative, it could engage its own inspection and testing agency to perform the tests and inspections required under the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Sections 14.1 and 14.2 of the subcontract further required that Berlin Steel \u201ccomply with all [federal, [s]tate, [c]ounty and [m]unicipal laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, notices and requirements\u201d and that, \u201c[w]here the [c]ontract [documents or any part thereof, conflict with law, codes, ordinances, rules, regulations, order[s], notices or requirements (collectively [l]aws), it is intended that [l]aws be followed.\u201d With respect to inspection and testing specifically, \u00a7 10.3 of the subcontract stipulated that, \u201c[w]hen the [c]ontract [documents require the [subcontractor to use an independent testing agency the [subcontractor shall submit the professional credentials of said agency to [Sordoni] for approval, at least twenty days in advance of when the inspection and/or testing is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In sum, the subcontract provisions required Berlin Steel, as the fabricator, to inspect all welds in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>dance with the building and welding codes. The subcontract expressly contemplated that Berlin Steel would hire an independent testing and inspection agency to perform the inspections because the only way it could satisfy its contractual obligation to inspect all welds as required under the codes was by retaining an agency for that purpose. Accordingly, we conclude that Sordoni had no legal duty to provide special inspections because Berlin Steel was required under its subcontract to inspect all welds in accordance with the building and welding codes.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The plaintiff contends that in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 640, 641-42, 638 A.2d 1 (1994), this court rejected the argument that a defendant could delegate his inspection duties to an agent and then wash his hands of any further responsibility. In <em>Bums, </em>the principal issue was whether a student could bring an action for the negligent maintenance of public school grounds during school hours because he was one of a foreseeable class of victims and, thus, qualified for an exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity. The named plaintiff, who slipped on an icy patch in a high school courtyard, brought a complaint against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>city, the board of education and the school superintendent, who claimed that he was not on the premises at the time and had delegated his duties to maintain and care for the high school grounds to the head custodian. Id., 642-43. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on the negligence counts and rendered judgment thereon, and the plaintiffs appealed. We observed on appeal that, under the relevant statutory and constitutional provisions, the supervisory responsibilities of the superintendent of schools are not automatically abrogated by the designation of a head custodian to undertake immediate responsibility for maintaining school grounds on any particular day.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Id., 648. Rather, \u201cthe superintendent of schools bears the . responsibility for failing to act to prevent the risk of imminent harm to school children as an identifiable class of beneficiaries of his statutory duty of care.\u201d Id., 649. Accordingly, the superintendent could not avoid liability by delegating his supervisory responsibilities to an employee under his control. The governing statutory and regulatory provisions in the present case, however, are completely different from those in <em>Bums </em>because they <em>expressly anticipate </em>that the permit applicant will retain qualified experts to conduct special inspections of all steel welds, except when the fabricator maintains an agreement with an indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>dent inspection agency to conduct the inspections. We therefore conclude that <em>Bums </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The plaintiff argues, as an alternate ground for affirmance under Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (l),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> that several other statutes compelled Sordoni, as the permit applicant and general contractor, to provide special inspections throughout construction of the project and to confirm after construction that the inspections were performed. The enumerated statutes impose penalties for violations of the building code; General Statutes \u00a7 29-254a;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> require review of building plans to determine compliance with the building code; General Statutes \u00a7 29-263;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> mandate independent review of plans and specifications to ensure compliance with the building code when construction exceeds certain threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>limits; General Statutes \u00a7 29-276b;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and require a certificate of occupancy stating that the structure or work performed substantially conforms to the building code. General Statutes \u00a7 29-265.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We disagree that Sordoni was required to provide special inspections pursuant to the foregoing statutes.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We conclude that the statutes in question merely require that the plans and specifications for proposed and completed structures substantially conform to the building code and impose no specific duty on the permit applicant, the contractor or on any other party to inspect all welds. The plaintiffs claim is therefore unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We next address the plaintiffs claims on cross appeal that the jury instructions were improper.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserts that the trial court should have instructed the jury regarding Sordoni\u2019s duty to inspect under principles of common-law negligence. He also claims that the court should have instructed the jury to consider Sordoni\u2019s duty (1) to ensure that its independent subcontractor took special precautions to avoid unreasonable risk of physical harm and (2) to exercise reasonable care with respect to those parts of the work site and inspection process over which it retained control. Sordoni responds that the trial court properly concluded that it did not owe the plaintiff a common-law duty of care because the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff was not foreseeable. Sordoni also contends that the rule regarding special precautions does not apply in the present circumstances and that it exercised no control over the instrumentality that caused the plaintiff harm. We conclude that the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury as requested by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this issue. Prior to the start of the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the parties filed preliminary requests to charge. On the issue of negligence, the plaintiff requested that the court instruct the jury to consider all \u201cspecifications of negligence\u201d against Sordoni set forth in count one of his complaint. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The plaintiff also sought instructions regarding Sordoni\u2019s duty (1) to ensure that special precautions were taken to prevent the plaintiff from being exposed to a peculiar unreasonable risk of harm and (2) to exercise due care with respect to those parts of the work site over which it retained control.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Thereafter, the trial court instructed the jury regarding negligence for failure to comply with the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>code but declined to give instructions on common-law negligence. The plaintiff took exception to the jury charge, and the trial court noted that the instruction issue had been properly preserved for review. Sordoni did not object to the charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We begin our analysis with the standard of review. When we review a challenged jury instruction, \u201c[t]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . Instructions are adequate if they give the jury a clear understanding of the issues and proper guidance in determining those issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>284 Conn. 389, 395-96, 933 A.2d 1197 (2007). The court should submit to the jury all \u201cissues as outlined by the pleadings and as reasonably supported by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goodmaster </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>225 Conn. 637, 648, 625 A.2d 1366 (1993); <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>176 Conn. 280, 281, 407 A.2d 958 (1978); 1 D. Wright &amp; W. Ankerman, Connecticut Jury Instructions (Civil) (4th Ed. 1993) \u00a7 2, p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The legal principles that govern a general contractor\u2019s liability for the negligence of its independent subcontractors are well established. As we stated in <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 518, the rule that liability may not attach is subject to several exceptions, including, \u201c[i]f the work contracted for be unlawful, or such as may cause a nuisance, or is intrinsically dangerous, or in its nature is calculated to cause injury to others, or if the contractee negligently employ an incompetent or untrustworthy contractor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>or if he reserve in his contract general control over the contractor or his servants, or over the manner of doing the work, or if he in the progress of the work assume control or interfere with the work, or if he is under a legal duty to see that the work is properly performed, the contractee will be responsible for resultant injury. <em>Norwalk Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>63 Conn. 495, 28 Atl. 32 [1893]; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>39 Conn. 586 [1873]; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sherman\u2019s Sons Co., </em>[86 Conn. 292, 293, 85 A. 514 (1912)]; <em>St. Paul Water Co. </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 566 [21 L. Ed. 485 (1873)]; <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Hartmann, </em>29 N.Y. 591 [1864]. So, too, the contractee or proprietor will be liable for injury which results from his own negligence. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>[supra, 590]. . . . <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Peck &amp; Lines Co., [ </em>89 Conn. 622, 627, 95 A. 22 (1915)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 518. \u201c[W]e have long held that, in the absence of statutory immunity based on the principal employer doctrine ... a general contractor may, depending on the circumstances, be held liable to an employee of its subcontractor for its own negligence. See, e.g., <em>Gigliotti </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>151 Conn. 114, 193 A.2d 718 (1963); <em>Greenwald </em>v. <em>Wire Corp. of America, </em>131 Conn. 465, 40 A.2d 748 (1944); <em>King </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>129 Conn. 636, 30 A.2d 549 (1943); <em>Bogoratt </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Co., </em>114 Conn. 126, 157 A. 860 (1932).\u201d With these principles in mind, we address each of the plaintiffs claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The plaintiff first asserts that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that it could find Sordoni liable on the ground of common-law negligence for violation of its duty to prevent foreseeable harm. The plaintiff claims that he presented sufficient evidence to support an instruction that his injuries were foreseeable because Sordoni did not provide the required special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>inspections and knew before the accident that the welds on column 313 had not been inspected. Thus, according to the plaintiff, it was within the province of the jury to decide whether Sordoni had breached its duty. Sordoni responds that the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on common-law negligence because the plaintiffs injuries were not foreseeable and Sordoni did not exercise control over the steel beam that caused the plaintiff harm.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Sordoni also argues that the plaintiff impermissibly bootstraps his claim of common-law negligence onto his claim of negligence under the building code. We conclude that the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on common-law negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">\u201cThe essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury. . . . Contained within the first element, duty, there are two distinct considerations. . . . First, it is necessary to determine the existence of a duty, and then, if one is found, it is necessary to evaluate the scope of that duty. . . . The existence of a duty is a question of law and only if such a duty is found to exist does the trier of fact then determine whether the defendant violated that duty in the particular situation at hand.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Considine </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>279 Conn. 830, 859, 905 A.2d 70 (2006). \u201cIf a court determines, as a matter of law, that a defendant owes no duty to a plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence from the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maffucci </em>v. <em>Royal Park Ltd. Partnership, </em>243 Conn. 552, 567, 707 A.2d 15 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\u201cDuty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact, and imperative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>to a negligence cause of action. The nature of the duty, and the specific persons to whom it is owed, are determined by the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the individual. . . . Although it has been said that no universal test for [duty] ever has been formulated . . . our threshold inquiry has always been whether the specific harm alleged by the plaintiff was foreseeable to the defendant. The ultimate test of the existence of the duty to use care is found in the foreseeability that harm may result if it is not exercised. ... By that is not meant that one charged with negligence must be found actually to have foreseen the probability of harm or that the particular injury which resulted was foreseeable, but the test is, would the ordinary [person] in the defendant\u2019s position, knowing what he knew or should have known, anticipate that harm of the general nature of that suffered was likely to result ....</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201cA simple conclusion that the harm to the plaintiff was foreseeable, however, cannot by itself mandate a determination that a legal duty exists. Many harms are quite literally foreseeable, yet for pragmatic reasons, no recovery is allowed. ... A further inquiry must be made, for we recognize that duty is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection. . . . The final step in the duty inquiry, then, is to make a determination of the fundamental policy of the law, as to whether the defendant\u2019s responsibility should extend to such results.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>241 Conn. 399, 405-406, 696 A.2d 332 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We conclude, as a matter of law, that Sordoni had no legal duty to the plaintiff under principles of common-law negligence because the plaintiffs injury was not foreseeable. No ordinary person in Sordoni\u2019s position, knowing what Sordoni knew or should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>known, could have foreseen that the plaintiff would be harmed because the defective weld had not been inspected. Berlin Steel was required under \u00a7\u00a71.2 and 1.5 of its subcontract with Sordoni to perform its work in \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with the applicable \u201cdrawings, specifications, addenda and bulletins. . . .\u201d Notes 13 and 21, respectively, of drawing S-9 required Berlin Steel to ensure that \u201call connections [would] be in accordance with AISC specifications\u201d and that \u201call structural welding [would] conform to AWS and AISC specifications.\u201d Berlin Steel also was required under its subcontract to retain an independent inspection agency to inspect all welds. Furthermore, Sordoni had retained Professional Services, a qualified expert in testing and inspections, to conduct random inspections of the welds for verification purposes. See footnote 27 of this opinion. Finally, no evidence was presented at trial that Sordoni knew, or had reason to know, that Berlin Steel had fabricated a defective weld, had failed to inspect all welds as required under its subcontract or had failed to notice at any other time prior to erection of column 313 on the Pitney Bowes site that the weld was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We have observed in other circumstances that \u201c[Reasonable care does not require that one must guard against eventualities which, at best, are too remote to be reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Schiavone </em>v. <em>Falango, </em>149 Conn. 293, 298, 179 A.2d 622 (1962). There was no reason for Sordoni to foresee that Berlin Steel would not fulfill its contractual obligations to inspect all welds. Accordingly, in light of the protections provided by Sordoni\u2019s subcontracts with Berlin Steel and Professional Services to fabricate and inspect the welds, we conclude that the physical harm suffered by the plaintiff would not have been foreseeable to an ordinary person in Sordoni\u2019s position. Consequently, Sordoni had no legal duty to the plaintiff under principles of common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>law negligence and the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that it could find Sordoni liable for failing to ensure that special precautions were taken because the fabrication and inspection of welds involved a peculiar and unreasonable risk of serious physical harm to others. The plaintiff claims that Sordoni was negligent because it knew or should have known that steel fabricated items and welds that have not been thoroughly inspected involve a peculiar unreasonable risk during the erection process that could cause serious injury to workers. The plaintiff specifically contends that Sordoni should have required Professional Services to inspect all welds on the Pitney Bowes site during the erection process. Sordoni replies that, in requiring Berlin Steel to ensure the integrity of the structural steel for the Pitney Bowes project and to inspect all welds, it took the precautions necessary to shield it from liability. Sordoni also argues that construction work is not inherently dangerous and does not pose a peculiar unreasonable risk of physical harm to others that requires special precautions. We conclude that the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">As previously stated, the test for determining the propriety of challenged jury instructions is whether they fairly present the case to the jury. See <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 395-96. Instructions satisfy this standard when they are adapted to the issues, as outlined by the pleadings, and are reasonably supported by the evidence. Id.; <em>Goodmaster </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 648. In the present case, the trial court correctly declined to give the instruction because a claim of negligence for failure to take special precautions was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>raised in the pleadings or in the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions. Although count one of the plaintiff s third amended complaint contained twenty-two allegations of negligence against Sordoni, there was no allegation of negligence for failure to ensure that special precautions would be taken by Berlin Steel or Professional Services. Thus, the issue was never \u201cdistinctly raised\u201d by the plaintiff and the trial court never decided whether there was any legal basis for such a claim under the exceptions that extend the liability of a general contractor to the employee of its independent subcontractors. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\u201c[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u201d). The fact that the plaintiff sought the instruction in its preliminary request to charge prior to the start of the trial, and then took exception when the trial court declined to give the instruction, does not excuse this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Nevertheless, even if the plaintiff properly had raised this claim, we conclude that it lacks merit. The plaintiffs request is premised on <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>149 Conn. 174, 178, 177 A.2d 670 (1962), and 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 413, pp. 384-87 (1965). In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>supra, 178, this court held that, \u201c[wjhere a party contracts for work to be done of such a character that, even if the work is duly performed, it would naturally, if not necessarily, expose others to probable injury unless preventive measures are taken by him, he is hable for that injury if, while chargeable with knowledge that the work is of such a character, he negligently fails to take preventive measures.\u201d See also <em>Bonczkiewicz </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corp., </em>148 Conn. 573, 172 A.2d 917 (1961). A similar principle is expressed in 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 413, pp. 384-85, which provides that \u201c[o]ne who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create, during its progress, a peculiar unreasonable risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused ... by the absence of such precautions if the employer (a) fails to provide in the contract that the contractor shall take such precautions, or (b) fails to exercise reasonable care to provide in some other manner for the taking of such precautions.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In the present case, we conclude as a matter of law that the fabrication and inspection of welds is not the kind of work that, when properly done, naturally would expose others to injury unless special preventive measures were taken. It is only when a weld is not fabricated and inspected properly because the fabricator or inspector failed to take ordinary or routine precautions that others may be exposed to danger, as happened in this case. Our reasoning is consistent with that of other jurisdictions that have rejected claims alleging that construction work is inherently dangerous. See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Poured Walls of Iowa, Inc., </em>553 N.W.2d 873, 877 (Iowa 1996) (excavation of trench, when done with standard precautions, involves ordinary, rather than \u201cpeculiar,\u201d risk of harm, even though trench may collapse and result in injury or death if improperly excavated); see also Rice v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>458 S.E.2d 359, 361 (Ga. App. 1995) (work on scaffolding not inherently dangerous, but only as result of contractor\u2019s negligence in constructing scaffolding improperly). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury that Sordoni had a duty to ensure that special precautions were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The plaintiff finally claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that Sordoni had a duty as the general contractor to exercise reasonable care with respect to any part of the work site or inspection process over which it retained control. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The premise underlying the general rule that an independent subcontractor is liable for losses resulting from negligence in the performance of its work is that \u201cthe assumption and exercise of control over the offending area is deemed to be in the independent contractor.\u201d <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Burrone Bros., Inc., </em>162 Conn. 187, 196, 292 A.2d 912 (1972); see also 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 409, comment b, p. 370 (\u201csince the employer has no power of control over the manner in which the work is to be done by the contractor, it is to be regarded as the contractor\u2019s own enterprise, and [the contractor], rather than the employer, is the proper party to be charged with the responsibility of preventing the risk, and bearing and distributing it\u201d). As noted previously, however, an exception to this rule is when the general contractor retains all or partial control over the work to be performed. <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 518. \u201cWhere the evidence on the question as to who had control of the area or instrumentality causing the injury is such that the mind of a fair and reasonable [person] could reach but one conclusion as to the identity of the person exercising control, the question is one for the court, but, if honest and reasonable [persons] could fairly reach different conclusions on the question, the issue should properly go to the jury. ... In addition, the contractor\u2019s control need not be exclusive; it is sufficient if it be shared with another.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Van Nesse </em>v. <em>Tomaszewski, </em>265 Conn. 627, 631, 829 A.2d 836 (2003). In the present case, the question is one for the court because a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and reasonable person could reach but one conclusion as to who exercised control over the fabrication and inspection of welds.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The plaintiff argues that Sordoni maintained control over all safety measures and programs related to the project, including special inspections, under (1) its contract with Pitney Bowes, (2) the orientation and procedures manual the plaintiff signed stating that Sordoni would conduct weekly inspections of all construction activity and (3) the subcontracts Sordoni entered into with its agents to conduct verification inspections. The plaintiff claims, however, that Sordoni failed to exercise due care in overseeing project safety, thus rendering it liable for the plaintiffs injury.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The plaintiff specifically contends that Sordoni failed to ensure that all welds were properly fabricated, failed to inspect the defective weld prior to the accident and knew that its agents had not inspected all of the welds after they were fabricated. Sordoni responds that Berlin Steel was responsible for fabricating and inspecting the welds and that Sordoni did not control or direct the manner in which Berlin Steel performed its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The plaintiff relies in part on <em>Van Nesse </em>v. <em>Tomaszewski, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 628, 629-33, in which the question of whether the general contractor exercised control over the work site was submitted to the jury because the evidence was equivocal. In that case, the plaintiff was injured when he fell off a ladder while employed by a framing subcontractor hired by the general contractor to assist in constructing a house. The ladder was owned by the subcontractor and had a broken foot. Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>629. For this reason, the ladder ordinarily was used outside the house, where the broken foot could be secured in the soil for safety. Id., 629. On the day that the plaintiff was injured, however, the ladder had been placed through an opening in the first floor of the structure, which had been covered in plywood, and its feet were planted in a large accumulation of sawdust on the concrete floor of the basement. Id. The plaintiff had climbed down the ladder to the basement without incident, but as he was climbing back up, the ladder slid out from under him, causing him to fall and sustain serious injuries. Id., 629-30. The plaintiff commenced an action against the general contractor, who argued that he did not have sufficient control over the work site to render him liable for the plaintiffs injuries. Id., 633. The court submitted the question of the general contractor\u2019s control to the jury because, although the ladder was owned by the subcontractor and the general contractor had no employees on the work site when the accident occurred, other evidence suggested that the general contractor maintained control over the area or the instrumentality that had caused the plaintiff harm. Id. This evidence included a provision in the contract between the property owners and the general contractor charging him with responsibility for keeping the property free from rubbish and waste during construction. In addition, the subcontractor\u2019s work in the basement had been completed for approximately two weeks, the ladder was the only means of access to the basement and other tradesmen had reason to be in the basement in the days immediately before the accident, thus indicating that the general contractor had not fully relinquished control of the basement area to any particular subcontractor. Id., 632. The general contractor also inspected the premises daily, and there was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the general contractor, or one of his employees, had swept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>sawdust into the basement, thus causing the footing of the ladder to become unstable. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In the present case, we conclude that the trial court properly declined to submit the question of Sordoni\u2019s control over the fabrication and inspection of welds to the jury because the evidence clearly demonstrates that Sordoni did not retain control over the \u201carea or instrumentality\u201d that caused the plaintiff harm. Sordoni subcontracted the fabrication and inspection of the structural steel elements, including all welds, to Berlin Steel. It thus had no control over the shop in which the welds were fabricated or the manner in which the inspections were to be performed, other than to require that the welds be inspected. Berlin Steel fabricated the welds at its own facility, supervised the work to be performed and was responsible under its subcontract with Sordoni for complying with the laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, codes, standards and requirements pertaining to fabrication and inspection of all structural steel for the Pitney Bowes project.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Moreover, although the orientation and procedures manual indicated that Sordoni would conduct weekly inspections to ensure compliance with its safety program, the manual was not a legally binding contract and did not grant Sordoni authority or control over specific construction activities. <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>supra, 264 Conn. 532-33. The safety manual was \u201can informational tool designed to educate the plaintiff in the protocols for the job site .... The plaintiff was required to read the manual and verify by signature that he understood its principles prior to his admission onto the work site. The language of the manual . . . [was strictly] informational ... in nature.\u201d Id. Accordingly, a fair and reasonable person could reach but one conclusion as to who exercised control over the welding and inspection process, namely, Berlin Steel. We therefore conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>trial court properly declined to submit the issue of Sordoni\u2019s control over the work of Berlin Steel to the jury or to instruct the jury that Sordoni had a duty to use due care on the ground that it continued to exercise control over the fabrication and inspection of welds.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\"> Because the claim of Reine Pelletier for loss of consortium is derivative of the claims of Norman Pelletier, we refer to Norman Pelletier as the plaintiff throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a provides in relevant part: \u201c(c) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an offer of compromise which the defendant failed to accept.

The plaintiff responded that issues of material fact existed with respect to Sordoni\u2019s: (1) control over the work of Berlin Steel; (2) legal duty under the building and welding codes to ensure compliance by Berlin Steel with certain inspection mandates; (3) hiring of an independent subcontractor that employed uncertified welders; (4) failure to exercise reasonable care; and (5) liability for direct negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> The trial court reasoned that: (1) Sordoni was not negligent in employing an incompetent subcontractor, Berlin Steel; (2) Sordoni did not have a legal duty to the plaintiff under its contract with Pitney Bowes, its subcontract with Berlin Steel, or General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-276b (c) and 29-276c (b) to inspect Berlin Steel\u2019s work to ensure compliance with approved plans and specifications; (3) there was no evidence that Sordoni maintained sufficient control over Berlin Steel and the manner in which it performed its work to establish Sordoni\u2019s liability for negligence on that ground; and (4) Sordoni was not directly negligent in causing the plaintiffs injuries because it had no common-law duty to inspect the welds fabricated by Berlin Steel and could not have foreseen the need to inspect all welds to prevent a steel column from giving way and injuring the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> We note, however, that the plaintiff raised the issue in his third amended complaint as well as in his opposition to the summary judgment motion, in which he argued that, \u201cby contract with the owner . . .
