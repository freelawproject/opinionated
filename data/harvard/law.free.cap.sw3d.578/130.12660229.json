Robbins and The Law Office of Paul A. Robbins appeals the trial\n   court's judgment granting Nacogdoches County's plea to the jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Robbins raises three appellate issues for our consideration. We modify and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Nacogdoches County District Attorney's Office (NCDA) and the Nacogdoches County Sheriff's Office (NCSO) have an interlocal agreement governing seized and forfeited property or proceeds from the seizure and forfeiture of property under Chapter 59 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Pursuant to the agreement, the NCDA receives fifty percent of all seized property and proceeds from contested forfeiture cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2014, Nicole D. Lostracco, the elected District Attorney, hired Robbins, a licensed attorney, to prosecute civil forfeiture cases on a contingency fee basis. Lostracco memorialized the terms of the contract in an email, which stated that Robbins would receive (1) one hundred percent of the NCDA's fifty percent if the amount forfeited was valued under $5,000; (2) two thirds of the NCDA's fifty percent if the amount forfeited was more than $5,000 but less than $10,000; and (3) fifty percent of the NCDA's fifty percent if the amount forfeited was more than $10,000. Thereafter, Robbins was sworn in as a special district attorney and began prosecuting forfeiture cases. At the conclusion of each case, Robbins submitted an invoice and was paid in accordance with the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In late 2015, the NCSO seized approximately $1,150,650 after an investigation. In accordance with the contract, Robbins successfully prosecuted the forfeiture. Thereafter, Lostracco and Jason Bridges, the Nacogdoches County Sheriff, met with Robbins and informed him they could not pay his fee for the forfeiture because doing so would cause unfavorable publicity. After the meeting, the parties agreed to postpone discussion on the dispute until after the primary election on March 1, 2016. On March 2, 2016, Robbins submitted an invoice for $287,662.50 for his work on the seizure. The Nacogdoches County Commissioner's Court refused to pay the invoice, and in May 2017, Robbins sued Lostracco, in her official capacity as District Attorney, for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2017, the County filed a plea to the jurisdiction claiming governmental immunity from Robbins' claims, and maintaining that its immunity has not been waived. In September, Robbins requested jurisdictional discovery, which the trial court limited to requests for admissions. Robbins requested expanded jurisdictional discovery, but in January 2018, the trial court granted the County's plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed Robbin's suit with prejudice. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Robbins's first issue, he argues that the trial court erred in granting the County's plea to the jurisdiction. Robbins argues that Lostracco's egregious conduct waived the County's immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction seeks to dismiss a case for want of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    City of Waco v.

Because Robbins's claims are against a county, and counties are specifically excluded from the scheme, he argues that\n   <em>\n    Sharyland\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203737973\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 271.151 (3). We disagree. As previously discussed,\n   <em>\n    Sharyland\n   </em>\n   forecloses the possibility of a waiver by conduct exception to immunity for breach of contract claims. Moreover, the supreme court's rationales that it is the \"Legislature's province to waive immunity\" and an \"exception would force the State to expend its resources to litigate the ... issue\" are equally applicable regardless of whether the suit is against a city or a county.\n   <em>\n    Sharyland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317136\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/407/#p414\">\n    354 S.W.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that there is no waiver by conduct exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity in breach of contract cases. Accordingly, the trial court correctly granted the County's plea to the jurisdiction. We overrule Robbins's first issue and need not address his second, alternative issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP.

He contends that the jurisdictional defect in his pleadings can be cured by obtaining a resolution from the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A dismissal \"with prejudice\" acts as a final determination on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Black v.

Generally, a dismissal with prejudice is improper when the plaintiff can remedy the jurisdictional defect.\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9242205\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/136/635/#p638\">\n    136 S.W.3d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   , the County argues that the trial court properly dismissed Robbins's claims with prejudice. However, in\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court reasoned that dismissal with prejudice was appropriate because otherwise, the plaintiff, who previously had an opportunity to amend his pleadings, could continue to\n   amend his pleadings to craft a claim that would fall within the Texas Tort Claims Act, resulting in endless litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9242205\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/136/635/#p638\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9242205\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/136/635/#p638\">\n    at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, Robbins cannot allege any additional facts that would confer jurisdiction. The only cure for the jurisdictional defect in this case is a legislative resolution granting him permission to sue. Thus, it would be illogical to dismiss Robbins's lawsuit with prejudice because it has neither definitively accrued, nor definitively failed for lack of legislative consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hirczy de Mino v.
