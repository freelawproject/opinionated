Portions of the suit were dismissed, and the Attorney General took a nonsuit. The Attorney General then filed suit in the chancery court to enforce the CIDs. The oil companies sought a protective order, which the court granted. The Attorney General appealed. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The focus of this appeal is a narrow one: whether a civil investigative demand (CID) issued by the Tennessee Attorney General remains enforceable under the circumstances of this case. In 1988, the Tennessee General Assembly passed the Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2068-215-101\">\n    Tenn.

Among other things, the act established the petroleum underground storage tank fund (\"the fund\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2068-215-110\">\n    Tenn.

The defendants have received millions of dollars in remediation costs since the creation of the fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 24, 2012, the Attorney General issued a CID to Chevron, USA, Unocal and Star Enterprise seeking to investigate possible violations of the False Claims Act and the Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Act. A second CID was issued to Star Enterprise on October 24, 2013. A third CID was issued to Star Enterprise on April 3, 2014, and a fourth CID to Chevron, regarding Chevron, Texaco and Unocal on April 4, 2014. After many discussions, the defendants never complied fully with any of the CIDs although many documents were supplied to the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Attorney General filed suit against the defendants on August 5, 2015, alleging multiple violations of the Tennessee False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204-18-101\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-215-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   --204. The Attorney General alleged that the defendants fraudulently\n   obtained double recoveries from both the fund and private insurers and that some funds were applied to ineligible sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. In an order entered March 14, 2017, the trial court dismissed some of the False Claims Act claims as time-barred and other False Claims Act claims because the Attorney General had not pled them with the specificity required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 9.02. The court also ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the claims regarding the underground storage fund. The trial court granted the Attorney General leave to file a second amended complaint, but prohibited further discovery. The Attorney General filed for a voluntary dismissal, and the trial court entered the dismissal order on March 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 8, 2017, the Attorney General filed a petition asking the chancery court to enforce the four CIDs previously issued to the companies. The State sought a finding of contempt and an order requiring full responses to the CIDs. The companies sought a protective order. The court granted the protective order and dismissed the State's petition with prejudice. The State appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A trial judge's decision to grant a protective order is reviewed by the appellate court using the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    In re NHC-Nashville Fire Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300440\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/293/547/#p560\">\n    293 S.W.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560 (Tenn.

The chancellor observed that, \"The premise the Supreme Court identified as key to fundamental fairness was that the advantage of precomplaint discovery via a CID is 'minimal and negated' upon commencement of litigation because 'the State's adversary then has full discovery rights.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942216\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/454/\">\n    612 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   458 ). The Chancellor went on to state that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This Court's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   and the premises of the CID Statute stated therein is that when a party is involved, the State makes a choice whether to continue with a CID investigatory process by means of enforcement under section 8-6-404 or, alternatively, to commence litigation, and the filing of a nonsuit does not erase the election made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that under the CID Statute there is a divide and distinction between precomplaint investigative discovery,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   before the \"commencement of litigation,\" versus the full discovery rights of a defendant in litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Applying the premise of the CID Statute stated by\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that the State's Petition for Contempt filed herein, under the circumstances of this case, is antithetical to the premises established from the CID Statute in\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   . When the series of events, unfolding from the 2012 issuance of the first CID with the massive investigation and production, to the State filing its Circuit Court lawsuit against the Defendants in August 2015, to the proceedings before Judge Binkley ending in 2017, are analyzed under the divide and distinction made in\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   of precomplaint discovery versus full discovery rights of litigation, this Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   does not countenance the State's attempt in this case to now return to an investigatory proceeding using CIDs. This Court's reading of\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   is that to assure fundamental fairness under the Tennessee CID Statute, the distinction between precomplaint investigatory discovery and litigation discovery must be maintained. The State's commencement of the Circuit Court case against these Defendants put the matter into litigation triggering the accompanying full discovery rights for the Defendants. The State crossed the proverbial Rubicon with its commencement of the Circuit Court case and the months of proceedings and rulings\n   in that case. The fundamental distinction explained in\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   is not maintained if this Court allows the State at this juncture to enforce the CIDs outside the bounds of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, from all of the foregoing-the unique facts of the lengthy, massive 2012-2014 CID process, the decision by the State not to seek enforcement under section 8-6-404 in 2015, the facts of the filing of the 2015 litigation and proceedings therein until 2017, the distinction as a matter of law in\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   between precomplaint investigative CIDs and those enforced during litigation against parties, and Tennessee nonsuit law- the Court concludes that once the State proceeded to litigation without using the section 8-6-404 enforcement remedy of the CID Statute, that statutory right was lost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   addressed several questions about the CID statutes. The Tennessee Supreme Court found that the Attorney General and Reporter must issue the CID, and that the CID in question did not sufficiently identify the parties or the conduct under investigation.\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942216\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/454/\">\n    612 S.W.2d at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further held that the CID statutes did not violate the due process, equal protection or search and seizure provisions of the State or Federal constitutions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942216\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942216\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/454/\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   did not discuss use of a CID in an instance such as the one now before this court. The Chancellor found guidance from the\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   opinion's discussion of due process, where the court found that the advantage of precomplaint discovery was negated when litigation began because the state's adversary could then have full discovery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942216\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942216\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/454/\">\n    at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We do not read\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   as prohibiting the state from using the previously issued CIDs after a nonsuit. That was not an issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Chancellor read\n   <em>\n    Shriver\n   </em>\n   as causing the State to lose the right to enforce the CIDs once the State filed litigation. Yet,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208-6-401\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-6-401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   allows the use of CIDs \"where the state is a party litigant,\" as well as when \"there is reasonable cause to indicate it will be a party litigant.\" Because a CID can be used when the State is in litigation, there is no statutory reason a pre-litigation CID would not continue to be effective after litigation is filed. Similarly, there is no statutory reason the same CID would not remain effective if the litigation was nonsuited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The chancellor's opinion and the arguments of the appellees presume that the investigatory phase of this matter has ended. It has not. The filing of litigation does not mean that the plaintiff's investigation is over. Otherwise, there would be no need for discovery. The circuit court's rulings forced the Attorney General to reconsider the theory of the case and the evidence his office needed to provide to the court. That is a valid reason for the subsequent nonsuit and the continuance of the investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the chancery court misapplied the law found in the CID statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208-6-401\">\n    Tenn.
