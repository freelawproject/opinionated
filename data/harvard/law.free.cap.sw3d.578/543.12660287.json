Pirtle, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal involves the proper construction of an assignment purporting to convey an oil, gas, and mineral interest from Neuhoff Oil &amp; Gas Corporation to Piranha Partners. The assignment in question was executed to be effective October 1, 1999, and it was recorded at Volume 467, Page 698, of the Deed Records of Wheeler County, Texas. It is the peculiarity of the description of the property or properties transferred that gives rise to this dispute. Appellants, Joe B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Neuhoff, Nancy M. Neuhoff, Thomas H. Neuhoff, Judy A. Neuhoff, Robert V. Neuhoff, Andrea D. Neuhoff, and Boca Vail, Inc. (hereinafter collectively \"Neuhoffs\") are the successors in interest to the assignor while Appellees, Piranha Partners, Randolph Mundt, Thomas H. Owen, Jr., and Charles Ray Owen (hereinafter \"Piranha\") are assignees or successors in interest to the assignee of the assignment in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Neuhoffs originally sued Piranha seeking, among other relief, a declaratory judgment that they owned all of a certain overriding royalty interest\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   accruing from an oil, gas, and mineral lease covering Section 28, Block A-3, H &amp; GN RR. Co. Survey, Wheeler County, Texas, save and except that portion assigned to Piranha by the assignment in question. The Neuhoffs contend the assignment only conveyed to Piranha their overriding royalty interest in a specific well drilled on the Northwest Quarter (NW/4) of Section 28, to-wit: the Puryear No. 1-28 well. Piranha subsequently filed a counterclaim and cross-action for trespass to try title and for a declaratory judgment finding that the assignment in question conveyed the Neuhoffs' overriding royalty interest, in its entirety, in Section 28 to Piranha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 29, 2014, Piranha filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   requesting the trial court grant summary judgment in its favor on the Neuhoffs' action to quiet title and for slander of title. Piranha further prayed that \"Piranha is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on [the Neuhoffs'] suit to quiet title and for slander of title and title to the overriding royalty interest burdening the Puryear Lease (covering the full section) should be quieted in Piranha.\" On May 29, 2014, the Neuhoffs filed their own\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   requesting the trial court grant summary judgment declaring that they hold title to and own the overriding royalty interest as to \"all oil and gas produced within Section 28, save and except that oil and gas in place in the Northwest Quarter of Section 28, which is produced from the Puryear 1-28 Well.\" A hearing on the competing motions for partial summary judgment was heard, and on March 21, 2016, the trial court entered an order providing, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   It is, therefore, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Piranha Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is in all matters GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that The Neuhoff's [sic] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Directed Against Piranha Partners, Its Partners and Charles R. Owen is in all matters DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to the two paragraphs cited above, the order severed the remaining claims, counterclaims, and causes of action pertaining to other parties from the action in this case, presumably to make the summary judgment order a final, appealable order. All other relief not expressly granted was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A question concerning the finality of the judgment arose because the order being appealed did not declare anything other than that Piranha's partial motion for summary judgment was granted and the Neuhoffs' partial motion for summary judgment was denied. Because the order was facially incomplete in that it required extrinsic\n   evidence to clarify, explain, or give meaning to its terms, this court ordered the trial court to enter a judgment which more accurately reflected the ruling of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neuhoff v. Piranha Partners\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-16-00136-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205781033\">\n    2016 WL 5781033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, 2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 10713, at *4 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Sept. 20, 2016, order). Thereafter, on October 20, 2016, the trial court entered its\n   <em>\n    Order Clarifying This Court's Prior Order\n   </em>\n   , declaring Piranha to be the owner of the overriding royalty interest covering the entirety of Section 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Raising four issues, the Neuhoffs contend the trial court erred by (1) granting Piranha's motion for partial summary judgment, (2) denying their motion for partial summary judgment, (3) excluding certain summary judgment evidence, and (4) implicitly excluding other summary judgment evidence. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and render judgment declaring Piranha to be the owner of the overriding royalty interest covering the Northwest Quarter of Section 28 only and we remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 21, 1975, Billie Jean Mallot, and others, acting as Lessors, and Marie Lister, acting as Lessee, executed an\n   <em>\n    Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease\n   </em>\n   (the \"Puryear Lease\") covering all of Section 28, Block A-3, H &amp; GN RR Survey, Wheeler County, Texas. The Puryear Lease was recorded in the deed records of Wheeler County at Volume 247, Page 818.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Later that same year, Lister, as assignor, executed an\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Oil and Gas Lease,\n   </em>\n   conveying an undivided two-thirds interest in the Puryear Lease (covering all of Section 28) to Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp., as assignee. This assignment was recorded in the deed records of Wheeler County at Volume 247, Page 898. A correction assignment of the same property was later recorded in the deed records of Wheeler County at Volume 268, Page 760, on August 16, 1978.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Three years later, on August 14, 1978, Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp. and Three \"L\" Oil Company assigned all their right, title, and interest in the Puryear Lease (covering all of Section 28) to Bobby Reeves, subject to \"the Landowners' Three-Sixteenths (3/16th) Royalty Interest\" and a \"one-sixteenth (1/16th) Overriding Royalty Interest\" reserved and retained by the assignors. This assignment was recorded in the deed records of Wheeler County at Volume 269, Page 209, on September 6, 1978.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In September of 1999, Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp. offered certain properties for sale at an auction conducted by The Oil and Gas Asset Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse furnished all prospective buyers with an auction catalog describing the properties being offered. Included within the properties being sold by Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp. was Lot 320.2, described as \"Puryear 1-28\" in Wheeler County, Texas. The \"property data sheet\" for Lot 320.2 referenced only production data from the Puryear 1-28 well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to bidding on the property, Piranha made its own investigation regarding the properties being sold and it was provided for review a form assignment, identical to the assignment it eventually received, save the omission of the name of the grantee. The form assignment contained the same property description as the final assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp. did not make any oral representations to Piranha prior to or at the auction sale. At the auction, Piranha submitted the winning bid for Lot 320.2 and the Clearinghouse subsequently\n   delivered Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp.'s assignment. At no time did Neuhoff or its affiliates make any oral representations to Piranha prior to or at the time the Clearinghouse delivered the assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In that assignment, dated October 1, 1999, Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp. assigned to Piranha, without warranty, \"all of Assignor's right title and interest in and to the Properties described in Exhibit 'A' (the 'Properties').\" This language was immediately followed by a paragraph limiting the interests being transferred to \"interests, INSOFAR AND ONLY INSOFAR AS set out in Exhibit A.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Exhibit \"A\" attached to the assignment of overriding royalty interest describes the \"properties\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-30\"><em>Lands and Associated Well(s)</em>: Miles Unit #1 Wheeler County, Texas Tract 1: All of Section 2, Block-4, H&amp;GN RR Survey, containing 640 acres, more or less. <em>Oil and Gas Lease(s)/Farmout Agreement(s)</em>: Oil &amp; Gas Lease(s): [Followed by a description of ten leases designated: A. - J.] Only insofar as these leases cover the lands described hereinabove. <em>Lands and Associated Well(s)</em>: Puryear # 1-28 Wheeler County, Texas NW/4, Section 28, Block A-3, H&amp;GN Ry Co. Survey <em>Oil and Gas Lease(s)/Farmout Agreement(s)</em>: Lessor: Billie Jeanne Mallot, et al. Lessee: Marie Lister Recorded: Volume 297, Page 818</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This assignment, the assignment at issue in this case, was recorded at Volume 467, Page 698, of the Deed Records of Wheeler County, Texas. Part of the problem in this case is the fact that the property description in that assignment, as it pertains to the Puryear 1-28 well, references an oil and gas lease recorded at Volume\n   <em>\n    297\n   </em>\n   , Page 818; whereas the Puryear Lease was recorded at Volume\n   <em>\n    247\n   </em>\n   , page 818. The instrument recorded at Volume\n   <em>\n    297\n   </em>\n   , Page 818, of the Deed Records of Wheeler County, Texas, is a\n   <em>\n    Ratification and Adoption\n   </em>\n   of a lease of property located in Section 6, IRR Co. Survey, Wheeler County, Texas, involving different lessors and lessees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   More than ten years later, in December 2012, a dispute arose as to the ownership of the overriding royalty interest pertaining\n   to production from wells situated in Section 28, other than the Puryear 1-28 well. The payor, Linn Energy, stopped making payments to the Neuhoffs and began making payments to Piranha. The Neuhoffs brought suit against Piranha and others, seeking a declaratory judgment that Piranha received an assignment of Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp.'s interest in the Puryear 1-28 well only. Piranha counter-sued for a declaratory judgment that it received Neuhoff Oil and Gas Corp.'s interest in the entire Puryear Lease-specifically, Section 28, in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Both parties filed traditional motions for summary judgment and both parties filed objections to the others' summary judgment evidence. The Neuhoffs objected to the admissibility of the Puryear Lease as parole evidence concerning the proper description of the property assigned and Piranha objected to the Neuhoffs' summary judgment evidence regarding the auction and the circumstances surrounding the execution and delivery of the assignment in question. The trial court sustained Piranha's objections as to the Neuhoffs' summary judgment evidence, save and except (1) the Puryear Lease (Volume 247, Page 818), (2) the assignment to Piranha (Volume 467, Page 698), and (3) the\n   <em>\n    Ratification and Adoption\n   </em>\n   (Volume 297, Page 818).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court then granted Piranha's motion for summary judgment, denied the Neuhoffs' motion for summary judgment, and entered an order declaring Piranha to be the owner of the Neuhoffs' overriding royalty interest covering the entirety of Section 28. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The standard of review for a traditional summary judgment under Rule 166a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is well established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nixon v.

There are several problems, however, with this construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   One problem already alluded to is the fact that the lease described is not the Puryear Lease. While it may be reasonable to assume that the 297/247 discrepancy is nothing more than a scrivener's error, Piranha has not taken any steps to obtain and file a correction assignment pursuant to the provisions of section 5.028 or 5.029 of the Texas Property Code. TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 5.028 -.029 (West 2014). Accordingly, we cannot say with absolute certainty that the assignment referenced the Puryear Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even if we were to assume that the intent of the parties was to describe the Puryear Lease, another more significant issue is the fact that we must construe the assignment in light of the circumstances surrounding its execution and we must examine the entire document with an eye towards harmonizing and giving effect to all of its provisions. With those considerations in mind, we note that the assignment was the result of a large scale auction of numerous overriding royalty interests-not a direct negotiation between the assignors and the assignee. In the course of such a transaction a prospective purchaser like Piranha was required to conduct its own due diligence. Here, Piranha was provided with information concerning the productivity of a specific well-the Puryear 1-28, and it was not provided any accurate information concerning the Puryear Lease. Furthermore, it is reasonable to conclude that Piranha purchased the other overriding royalty interest conveyed by the same assignment (the Miles Unit # 1) on the same terms and conditions as they purchased the Puryear 1-28 overriding royalty interest. In that context, we note that the assignment clearly and specifically qualifies the leases assigned as being \"only insofar as these leases cover the\n   <em>\n    lands described hereinabove\n   </em>\n   .\" Under this construction, the property described is determined by a reading the \"Lands and Associated Well(s)\" provision in conjunction with the \"Oil and Gas Lease(s)/Farmout Agreement(s)\" provision-not separately. In this way, we harmonize the various descriptors of the\n   property interest being conveyed to arrive at an interpretation that gives meaning to all of the descriptors. This construction is further supported by the similar \"INSOFAR AND ONLY INSOFAR AS SET OUT IN Exhibit A\" language that appears in the body of the assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Applying that construction to the interests at issue here, the description of the lease between Billie Jeanne Mallot, et al., as Lessors, and Marie Lister, as Lessee, serves to qualify the assignment of that lease \"only insofar\" as it covers the specifically described lands-the Northwest quarter of Section 28-being that portion of the lease upon which the Puryear 1-28 well was situated. In other words, the Northwest quarter of Section 28 harmonizes the three descriptors used in the assignment: (1) the Puryear # 1-28\n   <em>\n    well\n   </em>\n   , (2) the Nothwest quarter of Section 28\n   <em>\n    lands\n   </em>\n   , and (3) Mallott to Lister\n   <em>\n    oil and gas lease\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because the assignment in question can be given a definite and certain meaning as a matter of law, it is not ambiguous. As such, the trial court erred in declaring that the assignment conveyed the Neuhoffs' interest in the entire Puryear Lease, and it erred in failing to declare that the assignment conveyed the Neuhoffs' overriding royalty interest in the Northwest quarter of Section 28 only. Issues one and two are sustained and issues three and four are pretermitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and judgment is rendered declaring that, by the assignment in question, Neuhoff Oil &amp; Gas Corporation assigned to Piranha Partners, without warranty, all of its right, title, and interest in the lease from Billie Jeanne Mallot, et al., as Lessors, and Marie Lister, as Lessee, only insofar as it covers the Northwest quarter of Section 28, Block A-3, H &amp; GN RR Co. Survey, Wheeler County, Texas. Because the trial court has not addressed the Neuhoffs' prayer for recovery of attorney's fees pursuant to this disposition, this matter is otherwise remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and entry of a new judgment in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    An \"overriding royalty interest\" is an ownership interest expressed as a percentage of production or production reserves, free of the cost of production, created by the lessee, company, and/or working interest owner and paid by the lessee, company, and/or working interest owner out of the revenue from the well.\n    <em>\n     See Schlumberger, Oilfield Glossary,\n    </em>\n    found at http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com (last visited April 24, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
