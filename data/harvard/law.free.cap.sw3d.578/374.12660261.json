Because he failed to comply with Rule 52.12 governing intervention and his motion was never ruled on prior to the grandmother's voluntary dismissal of her suit, he never became a party to the grandmother's suit. Rule 74.06(b) does not authorize a non-party to file a motion to set aside the judgment. Moreover, there was no judgment to be set aside because the grandmother voluntarily dismissed her suit and that dismissal took effect immediately upon filing, without order of the court, under Rule 67.02(a). Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in overruling Williams' motion to set aside the dismissal of the grandmother's suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2009, the police shot and killed Darrell Williams\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   after a high-speed chase. Because of the circumstances of the chase, members of Darrell's family were suspicious of wrongdoing by the police. Darrell's grandmother, Delores Henry, quickly filed a petition alleging wrongful death in January 2010. In her petition, Ms. Henry claimed she was Darrell's \"next of kin,\" but that was not the case. Darrell was also survived by his father, Darrell Williams Sr., and his mother, Kathryn Love. The parties agree that, because Darrell's mother and father were alive, under section 537.080,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   his grandmother was not a proper plaintiff to bring the wrongful death suit. But the grandmother nonetheless filed suit, perhaps because both parents were incarcerated at the time of Darrell's death. The defendants filed an answer to the grandmother's petition, and the case proceeded without addressing her authority to bring suit under section 537.080.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in August 2010, six months after the grandmother filed her suit, and\n   periodically over the next nine months, while incarcerated on unrelated crimes, Mr. Williams sent the court at least six letters. Identifying himself in the letters as Darrell's father, on August 30, 2010, he asked whether a complaint had been filed for his son's death and, if it had, whether the circuit court could provide him with a copy; on November 12, 2010, he asked for a copy of the docket sheet and the contact information for Ms. Henry's attorney; on November 22, 2010, and again on December 16, 2010, he said he wanted to become a plaintiff and asked for the current discovery; and on February 25, 2011, he requested the docket sheet. The record shows each of Mr. Williams' letters was docketed, and the circuit court sent Mr. Williams some of the information he had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, in May 2011, Mr. Williams sent the circuit court a handwritten letter attaching a handwritten motion to join in the grandmother's suit. The motion had the caption to the grandmother's case and, in full, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Comes now, plaintiff Darrell Williams, pro se, requesting to become a plaintiff in cause #1022-CC00155, for the following reason:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Darrell Williams Sr[.], is the father of the deceased Darrell Williams Jr.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Wherefore plaintiff requests that this motion be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While Mr. Williams' motion conveyed his desire to become a plaintiff and should have been understood as an attempt to intervene, it failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 52.12(c), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion upon all parties affected thereby. The motion shall state the grounds therefor, and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. The same procedure shall be followed when a statute of this state gives a right to intervene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Williams did not serve his motion on the other parties to the lawsuit, nor was it accompanied by a pleading setting out the claim for which intervention was sought, as required by Rule 52.12(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The father did not attempt to correct the deficiencies in his motion in the succeeding three years in which the grandmother's suit was pending prior to April 2014, when, shortly before trial was to occur, the grandmother voluntarily dismissed her suit. Her voluntary dismissal became effective upon filing under Rule 67.02.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The father did not argue to the circuit court that he still had a live claim due to his pending motion to intervene, nor did he attempt at any time to get a ruling on the motion or otherwise correct the motion's deficiencies or object to the voluntary dismissal or attempt to appeal it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By the time the grandmother dismissed her lawsuit, the three-year statute of limitations on the wrongful death claim had run.\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 537.100.1.\n   </em>\n   But Rule 67.02(c) provides that a voluntary dismissal under Rule 67.02(a) is without prejudice, and under\n   section 537.100, the grandmother had one year in which to refile her lawsuit because her original lawsuit had been timely filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While the grandmother did not refile within one year, the mother did attempt to file a wrongful death suit in August 2014, just four months after the grandmother's voluntary dismissal. The mother's suit was dismissed the following year after the defendants filed a motion arguing the mother could not take advantage of the grandmother's right to refile her suit within one year because the mother had not been a party to the prior suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of the mother's petition in\n   <em>\n    Love v. Piatchek,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177367\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/318/\">\n     503 S.W.3d 318\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Mo.

Rule 74.06(b) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve\n   <em>\n    a party or his legal representative\n   </em>\n   from a final judgment or order for the following reasons: ... (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,\n   <em>\n    or it is no longer equitable\n   </em>\n   that the judgment remain in force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added). Mr. Williams argued it was not equitable for grandmother's voluntary dismissal to remain in place because he filed a timely motion to intervene in the suit prior to its dismissal and prior to the running of the statute of limitations. He asserted that because under section 537.080, a parent is entitled to sue for his or her unmarried child's death, and because Rule 52.12(a) permitted him to intervene as of right,\n   <em>\n    see Martin v. Busch,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317710\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/360/854/#p857\">\n     360 S.W.3d 854\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 857 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011)\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court had no authority to do anything other than sustain his motion to intervene. Therefore, he argued, he should be treated as a party just as if he had been granted intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The circuit court held that it had no authority to sustain Mr. Williams' Rule 74.06 motion because grandmother had voluntarily dismissed her suit as permitted by Rule 67.02(a). This meant there was no suit for Mr. Williams to join and no judgment for the circuit court to set aside. Mr. Williams appealed.

Like those who sought to intervene in\n   <em>\n    Wolfner\n   </em>\n   , he failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 52.12(c) governing intervention. He never served his motion on the affected parties. He never attached to his motion any pleadings setting out his claim for which intervention was sought or, indeed, even mentioning the word intervention or the rule governing it. And, while Mr. Williams was proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and minor procedural variations might be anticipated, this Court has repeatedly held the fact that a litigant is not represented by counsel does not authorize him or her to ignore\n   this Court's procedural rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In any event, even if Rule 74.06 allowed a non-party to move to set aside a judgment, it would not entitle Mr. Williams to relief here.

CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case is tragic, and not only in the facts of the underlying death. The grandmother was not entitled to file a lawsuit over her grandson's wrongful death. Mr. Williams was entitled to sue and attempted to join the grandmother's suit, but he failed to comply with the strictures of Rule 52.12(c). As a consequence, he never became a party to the only wrongful death suit filed within the statutory time period, nor did the circuit court rule on his motion before the suit was voluntarily dismissed. As a non-party, and because the grandmother's suit was resolved by voluntary dismissal rather than by a judgment, Mr. Williams could not seek to set aside that voluntary dismissal. In these difficult circumstances, the circuit court had no option other than to overrule Mr. Williams' motion to set aside and motion to intervene.
