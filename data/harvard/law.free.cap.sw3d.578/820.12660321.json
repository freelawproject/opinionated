Parker (\"Movant\") appeals from the judgment denying his amended Rule 24.035 motion, arguing that the five-year sentence of imprisonment he received for stealing over $500 was not permitted under\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016), which held that stealing over $500 was a misdemeanor offense, not a felony.\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   , however, was handed down after Movant was sentenced, and as the State argued to the motion court,\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   applies only prospectively, and not retrospectively, except to cases pending on direct appeal, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Windeknecht v. Mesmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386985\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/500/#p503\">\n    530 S.W.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (Mo. banc 2017). The motion court did not clearly err by denying Movant's amended Rule 24.035 motion on the basis that\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   does not apply retrospectively to his case. The same has been held in\n   <em>\n    Watson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656378\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/909/#p915\">\n    545 S.W.3d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 915 (Mo.
