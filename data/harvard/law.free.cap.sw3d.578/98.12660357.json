He presents two issues on appeal. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beasley was involved in a motor vehicle accident in October 2007. At the time of the incident, he was a covered person under an automobile insurance policy issued by Farmers which included personal injury protection (PIP) benefits with a $2,500 limit. Subsequently, Beasley sought medical care from health care providers for treatment of injuries he sustained who submitted their bills totaling $2,662.54 to Beasley's medical health care insurer, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Texas (BCBS). Pursuant to its contractual agreement with the providers, BCBS discounted the charges and paid a total of $1,068.90 to the providers who accepted the monies as payment in full for the medical services provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010, Beasley made a claim for PIP benefits and submitted the medical provider's bills totaling $2,662.54 to Farmers for payment under the policy. In response, Farmers paid Beasley the amount that BCBS paid the providers ($1,068.90) advising Beasley that this amount represented the medical expenses incurred, per the insurance policy, because it was the amount his medical providers agreed to accept in full payment of the medical services rendered. Thereafter, Beasley submitted a provider affidavit stating the charges of $2,662.54 were reasonable for the medical services provided and requested that Farmers reconsider his claim and pay him PIP limits of $2,500. Farmers refused to pay any additional monies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beasley sued Farmers alleging breach of the insurance contract, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and violations of the Texas Insurance Code. According to Beasley, Farmers was contractually obligated to pay him $2,500 under the policy because the medical charges of $2,662.54 exceeded the PIP policy limits and were both reasonable in amount and necessary to treat the injuries\n   he received in the motor vehicle incident. Because Farmers paid less than the reasonable charges for this necessary treatment, Beasley alleged Farmer's breached the insurance contract and violated the DTPA and insurance code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Farmers filed a plea to the jurisdiction contending that Beasley lacked standing because he suffered no injury. According to Farmers, Beasley failed to allege an actual injury because he is not legally responsible for any remaining payment on his medical bills which were discounted pursuant to the provider's contracts with BCBS and those discounts are not collateral sources under the PIP statute. The trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed Beasley's lawsuit. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his first issue, Beasley argues that the trial court should not have granted the plea to the jurisdiction. He contends that (1) in granting the motion, the trial court impermissibly considered the merits of the case, and (2) that he pleaded allegations establishing standing to pursue his claims against Farmers. In his second issue, Beasley argues that the trial court erred by dismissing his DTPA claim when it granted the plea to the jurisdiction on his breach of contract claim. Farmers responds that Beasley failed to allege an actual injury and, therefore, lacks standing to pursue either his breach of contract or statutory claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction is proper to challenge a party's lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vernco Constr., Inc. v.

In his petition, Beasley asserted causes of action for breach of contract and violations of the Texas Insurance Code and DTPA. He alleged that Farmers paid him less than the contractually agreed benefits of his insurance policy, that he incurred medical expenses totaling $2,662.54, and that he is entitled to receive the maximum benefit of $2,500 under his PIP policy because the expenses he submitted were for necessary treatment and were reasonable in amount. Beasley contended that Farmers breached the contract by paying benefits totaling $1,068.90 and requested compensatory damages in the amount of $1,432.10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At no time has Beasley abandoned his claim for monetary damages. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Forth\n   </em>\n   , because Beasley pled that he suffered economic damages resulting from Farmers' breach of the insurance contract, he has alleged an actual and concrete injury in the form of money damages representing the difference in the account of the medical bills submitted and reimbursed up to the PIP limits available under the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2328369,10202694\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/245/484/\">\n    245 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   486 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11696707\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/974/351/#p354\">\n    974 S.W.2d at 354-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This same economic loss forms the basis of the actual damages claimed in the contractual and statutory causes of action pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nevertheless, Farmers argues that Beasley has no actual injury as a matter of law for any of the causes of action pleaded because he had no legal financial obligation to pay anything more to the medical providers when they accepted the contractual discounted payment from BCBS. According to Farmers, because Beasley has not, nor ever will, suffer any personal financial consequence resulting from BCBS's payment of his medical bills, he has no legally cognizable injury. Farmers further disputes that BCBS's contractual discount was a collateral source prohibited under section 1952.155(a)(2) of the Texas Insurance Code. The central theme of this argument is that Farmers was only contractually obligated under the policy, and legally under the PIP statute, to pay the amount the medical providers accepted as full payment for medical services rendered. Whether pursuant to a health insurer's negotiated contractual discounts with providers or through direct negotiation between the insurer and the provider, such as in\n   <em>\n    Forth\n   </em>\n   , Farmers argues that whether an actual injury occurred depends on whether the payment accepted by the provider fully discharges the obligation owed\n   by the insured to the providers for the medical treatment received. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Beasley alleges he suffered an economic harm resulting from Farmer's failure to pay him, pursuant to both statutory directives and contractual terms, the reasonable cost of necessary medical treatment arising from an accident that was incurred within three years of the date of the accident up to the PIP limits of $2,500. It is undisputed that Beasley timely submitted a claim for PIP benefits to recover medical expenses necessary to treat injuries he suffered in a covered accident in the amount of $2,662.54, which was verified through a provider's affidavit as being reasonable. Both the PIP statute and the insurance policy required Farmers to pay the reasonable amount of necessary medical, surgical, x-ray, or dental expenses that arose from the accident and were incurred within three years from the date of the accident. Though reasonable medical expenses of $2,662.54 were submitted, Farmers paid Beasley $1,068.90, an amount less than the PIP limits available under the policy. We accept these factual allegations as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Axtell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9507029\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/69/261/#p264\">\n    69 S.W.3d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Whether the sum of $2,662.54 or $1,068.90 constitutes the reasonable cost of the medical treatment provided to Beasley, which Farmers was obligated to pay under the policy and PIP statute, is the threshold determination. This determination requires both statutory and contractual analysis, in conjunction with the facts, as to (1) the significance and applicability of the contractual discounts available to BCBS when it paid the providers less than the charges billed to Beasley, and (2) the payment's impact on Farmer's obligation under the policy and PIP statute. To conclude, as Farmers requests, that Beasley suffered no actual harm as a matter of law, would require us to make a merits based determination as to the legal effect of the BCBS contractual discount on Farmer's obligation under its policy with Beasley and the plain language of the PIP statute. A plea to the jurisdiction is not a mechanism for us to make this determination. It is only intended to explore whether there is a jurisdictional reason why the merits of the case should not be reached.\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162613\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/34/547/#p555\">\n    34 S.W.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, our review in this proceeding is limited to whether the trial court erred in finding that Beasley failed to plead a cognizable injury. We conclude that he did so by alleging submission of medical expenses, which were averred to be reasonable, that exceeded the PIP limits available under the policy and Farmer's payment of a lesser sum which he alleged to be actionable both contractually and statutorily under the DTPA and Insurance Code. We determine these facts allege an actual injury that is not hypothetical, but which is concrete, particularized, and personal to Beasley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Linegar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775065\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/276/#p279\">\n    495 S.W.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any other conclusion would require a determination of the merits of Beasley's case which would be premature at this point in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As a result, we conclude that Beasley's petition on its face affirmatively demonstrates the trial court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9256802\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/217/#p227\">\n    133 S.W.3d at 226-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
