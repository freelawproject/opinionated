(\"EDOC\") was subject to the Open Meetings Act and the Public Records Act. The complaint specifically stated that it was brought pursuant to those acts, as well as the Declaratory Judgment Act. The complaint further alleged that EDOC was not complying with the Open Meetings Act and had failed to produce documents pursuant to valid public record requests. Plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a declaration that the EDOC was subject to the Open Meetings Act and Public Records Act, an injunction preventing the EDOC from continuing to violate the acts, and attorney's fees for past violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Eventually, a bench trial occurred in which the trial court ruled that the EDOC was not subject to the Open Meetings Act and the Public Records Act. This Court reversed on appeal and \"remanded to the trial court for such further proceedings as may be necessary, consistent with this opinion.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wood v. Jefferson Cty. Econ. Dev. Oversight Comm., Inc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , No. E2016-01452-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204277711\">\n    2017 WL 4277711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 26, 2017),\n   <em>\n    perm. app. denied\n   </em>\n   (Tenn. Feb. 14, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the issuance of the mandate from this Court, Plaintiffs filed a motion for the entry of permanent injunction, an award of attorney's fees, and discretionary costs. The trial court entered an order on June 5, 2018, granting an order \"in conformity with the Court of Appeals opinion and for costs, including discretionary costs.\" The order, however, denied the request for an award of attorney's fees on several grounds. Finally, the order directed counsel for Plaintiffs to submit affidavits delineating discretionary costs. The affidavits were filed and the trial court entered an order awarding costs on July 16, 2018. A notice of appeal was filed on July 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs appeal the trial court's denial of their claims under the Open Meetings Act and Public Records Act, particularly the trial court's refusal to issue an injunction and award attorney's fees. At oral argument in this case, this Court raised,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the issue of whether it possessed subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffs' appeal under Rules 3 and\n   4 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure. Specifically, the initial question presented in this appeal is whether the time for filing a notice of appeal was triggered when the trial court entered (1) the June 5, 2018 order denying Plaintiffs' requests for a permanent injunction and attorney's fees and awarding discretionary costs; or (2) the July 16, 2018 order awarding discretionary costs to Plaintiffs in an amount certain. If the time for appealing was triggered by the June 5, 2018 order, Plaintiffs' notice of appeal was untimely and this appeal must be dismissed. If, however, the July 16, 2018 order triggered the time for filing a notice of appeal, Plaintiffs' appeal is timely. As such, each party was invited to file a supplemental brief concerning this Court's jurisdiction. After our review of the applicable law and the parties' filings, we must conclude that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 4 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure provides the time limit for filing a notice of appeal to this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In an appeal as of right to the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals or Court of Criminal Appeals, the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 shall be filed with the clerk of the appellate court within 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment appealed from;....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Tenn.

Motions for discretionary costs are governed by Rule 54.04 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04. As is evident from the previously discussed rules, a motion for discretionary costs is not among the motions that toll the time for taking an appeal.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Goins\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , all of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed by order of May 9, 2016.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *1.

As such, we concluded that the final judgment was entered when the trial court dismissed all the claims raised in the plaintiff's complaint.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The plaintiff's notice of appeal, filed more than thirty days following the May 9, 2016 final order, was therefore untimely and we were deprived of jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   As such, the plaintiff's appeal was dismissed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The case-at-bar, while similar to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Goins\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , is not an exact analog to the facts presented in that case. Importantly, while the\n   motion for discretionary costs in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Goins\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was filed following the entry of the final judgment, in this case, Plaintiffs filed their motion for discretionary costs concurrently with their motion for the entry of a permanent injunction and for attorney's fees. As such, Plaintiff contends that the June 5, 2018 order was not final as it \"adjudicate[d] fewer than all of the claims\" at issue. Tenn. R. App. P. 3(a). Thus, we must determine whether the timing of the request for discretionary costs has any effect on whether the judgment was final in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In determining this issue, we first consider the rule governing discretionary costs, Rule 54.04 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 54.04 expressly contemplates that a motion for discretionary costs should be filed \"within thirty (30) days\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   entry of judgment.\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) (emphasis added) (stating that a court retains jurisdiction over the motion even though a notice of appeal has been filed). The same timeline applies following a reversal on appeal and remand to the trial court, where the appeal results in a final disposition of the case.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (allowing thirty days following the entry of the appellate court's mandate for the new prevailing party to file a motion for discretionary costs). The advisory committee comments make clear, however, that this timeline applies only when the appeal results in a final disposition of the case. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04 advisory committee's cmt. to 2005 amend. Where the case is remanded for further proceedings, a motion for discretionary costs \"may be filed following the trial court's ultimate judgment on remand.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This second scenario was at issue in this case. As previously discussed, the Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gunn I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not enter a final disposition of this case but expressly remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Indeed, there can be no dispute that Plaintiffs' substantive requests for relief, including a request for a permanent injunction and attorney's fees, were still outstanding following remand. As such, Plaintiffs' motion for discretionary costs filed prior to the trial court's ruling on attorney's fees and injunctive relief was premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We also find guidance from the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evans v. Wilson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    776 S.W.2d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 1989). In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evans\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the plaintiff filed several post-trial motions, including a motion for discretionary costs, a motion to alter or amend, and a motion for new trial.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court entered an order denying the motion for discretionary costs and to alter or amend, but did not enter a final order on the issue of the new trial.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    at 941-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the order entered by the trial court on the motion for new trial was merely \"provisional\"). The plaintiff appealed and the Tennessee Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. In reaching this result, the court explained that \"the disposition of the motions specified in Rule 4(b) could potentially affect the judgment entered by the trial court. So long as such a motion is pending, there is no final judgment for purposes of T.R.A.P. 3(a).\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020470\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/776/939/\">\n    at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The opposite is true in this case. Here, the motion that remained pending before the trial court was solely a motion for discretionary costs, which does not toll the time for taking an appeal pursuant to Rule 4(b). Moreover, the grant or denial of a motion for discretionary costs has no potential to affect the underlying judgment; it merely concerns the award of costs to the prevailing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, we note that the assessment of costs is generally not a bar to a final judgment. Nearly a century ago, the Tennessee Supreme Court opined that \"[a] decree will be treated as final, and an appeal entertained only where there is\n   nothing left for future determination except the adjudication of the costs.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mengle Box Co. v.

Because the notice of appeal was untimely, we dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A motion for discretionary costs demands the same treatment.

Likewise, the nature of discretionary costs as ancillary does not depend on the timing of such a motion, but on the nature of the relief sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the time the trial court entered its June 5, 2018 order, nothing was left for future determination except the award of discretionary costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mengle Box Co.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=230%20S.W.%20963\">\n    230 S.W. at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, even the issue of whether discretionary costs should be awarded had been adjudicated by the trial court, leaving only the issue of the amount of discretionary costs at issue.

Moreover, Rule 54.04 directs litigants to file motions for discretionary costs following the entry of judgment. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04.

Parties should not be rewarded for failing to comply with the clear import of our procedural rules. Given the foregoing, we conclude that a motion for discretionary costs does not \"arrest the finality\" of the trial court's judgment for purposes of appellate jurisdiction, regardless of whether the motion is filed prior to the entry of final judgment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905094\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/448/891/#p898\">\n    448 S.W.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Graybeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204459807\">\n    2012 WL 4459807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court's June 5, 2018 order fully adjudicated all of the substantive claims other than the assessment of discretionary costs.
