Movant was convicted, following a jury trial, of two counts of robbery in the first degree (counts 1 and 5), in violation of Section 569.020 RSMo.; one count of attempted robbery in the first degree (count 3), in violation of Sections 569.020 and 564.011 ; three counts of armed criminal action (counts 2, 4, and 6), in violation of Section 571.015; one count of tampering with a motor vehicle in the first degree (count 7), in violation of Section 569.080; one count of unlawful use of a weapon (count 8), in violation of Section 571.030; and one count of resisting a lawful stop or detention (count 9), in violation of Section 575.150. Movant was found to be a prior and persistent offender, and sentenced to concurrent sentences of 25 years' imprisonment for counts 1-6, 15 years' imprisonment on count 7, 7 years' imprisonment on Count 8, and 1 year of imprisonment on count 9. This Court affirmed those convictions on appeal in\n   <em>\n    State v.

No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment is affirmed pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
