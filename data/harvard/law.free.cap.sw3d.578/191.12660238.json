Worthen, Chief Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) appeals the trial court's order granting an expunction of L.M.W.'s arrest for public intoxication and deadly conduct. DPS presents two issues on appeal. We reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   L.M.W. was arrested on October 24, 2016, and charged with deadly conduct and public intoxication. She completed a pre-trial diversion program for dismissal of the deadly conduct charge. She pleaded no contest to the public intoxication charge, for which she was convicted, sentenced to a fine of $ 215.00, and granted one day of jail time credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2018, L.M.W. filed a petition to expunge any and all of the records arising from the October 2016 arrest. She alleged that the arrest did not result in a final conviction. DPS filed an answer and general denial asserting that L.M.W. did not qualify for expunction of her records because the October 24, 2016, arrest resulted in a final conviction for public intoxication. Copies of the information, arrest report, probable cause affidavit, final judgment, and payment receipts were attached to DPS's answer. After a hearing in which DPS did not participate and L.M.W. was\n   the only witness, the trial court granted L.M.W.'s petition. This restricted appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    EXPUNCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its second issue, which is dispositive, DPS contends L.M.W. did not present legally sufficient evidence to support her assertion that the public intoxication charge did not result in a final conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A party can prevail in a restricted appeal only if (1) it filed notice of the restricted appeal within six months after the judgment was signed, (2) it was a party to the underlying lawsuit, (3) it did not participate in the hearing that resulted in the judgment complained of and did not timely file any postjudgment motions or requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, and (4) error is apparent on the face of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

At the hearing on her petition for expunction, L.M.W. testified that she was charged with deadly conduct, for which she was placed on pretrial diversion, but did not remember receiving a citation for Class C public intoxication. Nor did she recall speaking with a judge. She denied pleading guilty or no contest to a public intoxication charge or paying a fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   However, for purposes of this restricted appeal, we review the entire case; the face of the record consists not only of the reporter's record, but all papers on file in the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11892879\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/955/269/#p270\">\n    955 S.W.2d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ANN. art. 27.02(5) (West 2006) (plea of nolo contendere, with an exception not applicable here, has the same legal effect of a guilty plea). The court accepted the plea and assessed a fine of $ 248, with court costs of $ 67 for a total of $ 315. The court allowed L.M.W. to pay with a partial jail credit of $ 100, which left a balance of $ 215.
