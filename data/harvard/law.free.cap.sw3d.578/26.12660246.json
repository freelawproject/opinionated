Steven Stafford, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff/Appellant Nationwide appeals the trial court's grant of Defendant/Appellee's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. Defendant's motion was based on the argument that Plaintiff's claim was time-barred pursuant to the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act, and that Tennessee Code Annotated section 20-1-119 did not allow Plaintiff to timely add Defendant to the suit. Because we conclude that the trial court incorrectly applied Tennessee's comparative fault statute, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case was initiated after a fire damaged the home of Freddie and Linda Lavallais on August 5, 2015. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\" or \"Appellant\") insured the Lavallais home and is the subrogee under the Lavallais's insurance policy. As such, Nationwide now brings this action as the real party in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nationwide filed its original complaint against Brass-Craft Manufacturing Company\n   (\"Brass-Craft\") on April 19, 2017, alleging that the fire in the Lavallais home was caused by the failure of a gas flex line manufactured by Brass-Craft. Brass-Craft answered the complaint on May 24, 2017; in its answer, Brass-Craft urged that the fire may have been caused by an electrical surge and/or by overhanging tree branches that had not been properly maintained by Memphis Light, Gas and Water (\"MLGW\" or \"Appellee\"). Brass-Craft went on to argue that Nationwide's claim should be denied due to the fact that MLGW was an indispensable party that Nationwide failed to name in its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to the allegations against MLGW, Nationwide filed an amended complaint on July 24, 2017. Therein, Nationwide added allegations as to MLGW, averring that MLGW was the owner and operator of the electrical distribution system that delivered and supplied power to the Lavallais home at the time of the fire. Nationwide alleged that MLGW was responsible for Nationwide's damages in that MLGW \"failed to remove, repair and/or otherwise correct [a] dangerous condition existing within their electrical supply ... [which] ultimately resulted in the losses alleged\" by Nationwide. Nationwide also noted that the amended complaint was filed in a timely manner pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 20-1-119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the amended answer was filed, Nationwide filed a notice of intent to nonsuit Brass-Craft on September 13, 2017. Thereafter, MLGW filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the one-year statute of limitations applicable to MLGW under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act (\"GTLA\") had lapsed, thus foreclosing Nationwide's claim. In its motion, MLGW noted that Nationwide's claim was subject to two different statutes of limitation, the first being the three-year statute for property damage as alleged against Brass-Craft,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the second being the one-year GTLA statute applicable to MLGW. According to MLGW, Nationwide \"did not commence [its] action within the statute of limitations\n   <em>\n    applicable to its claims against MLGW\n   </em>\n   ; therefore, Nationwide cannot rely on the 90-day grace period\" found in section 20-1-119. Simply put, MLGW asserted that despite the ninety-day grace period provided in Tennessee Code Annotated section 20-1-119, Nationwide's claim was nonetheless time-barred because the statute requires that the plaintiff's original complaint be filed \"within the applicable statute of limitations,\" and Nationwide's claim against MLGW was not filed within one-year after the fire occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Circuit Court for Shelby County (\"trial court\") granted MLGW's motion to dismiss on December 1, 2017. In its final order, the trial court noted that the legal issue facing the court was how to construe the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations\" found in section 20-1-119(a). \"Specifically, does the filing of the original complaint within the 'applicable statute of limitations' refer to the three (3) year statute applicable to [Nationwide's] original claim against the original defendant Brass-Craft, or to the one year GTLA statute of limitations applicable to [Nationwide's] new claim against MLGW?\" In answering this question, the trial court adopted MLGW's interpretation of section 20-1-119(a) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on its analysis of the text of the statute and applicable case law, and the fact that the GTLA must be strictly construed, this Court finds that the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations\" found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-1-119\">\n    Tenn.

A plaintiff files a claim against a defendant. The defendant thereafter raises the comparative fault of a non-party in its answer. So long as the initial complaint was filed within \"the applicable statute of limitations,\" plaintiff then is allowed a ninety-day grace period to file an amended complaint naming the new party, or comparative tortfeasor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-1-119\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-1-119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Under this typical scenario involving two private defendants, both the claim against the original defendant and the claim against the comparative tortfeasor are governed by the same statute of limitations based on the type of claim alleged. What constitutes \"the applicable statute of limitations\" for determining the timeliness of the original suit and the concomitant ability of the plaintiff to rely on the ninety-day grace period is therefore usually not in doubt. The dispute in this case arises because, even though the claim is the same, the statutes of limitations applicable to the original claim against the private defendant, Brass-Craft, and the claim against the comparative tortfeasor, MLGW, are different. If the timeliness of the initial complaint rests on the statute of limitations applicable to Brass-Craft, there can be no dispute that the ninety-day grace period was triggered. If, however, the timeliness of the initial complaint is determined by reference to the statute of limitations applicable to MLGW, the ninety-day grace period is unavailable and the trial court was correct to dismiss the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, the central dispute between the parties is the meaning of the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations\" as used in section 20-1-119(a), and whether the statute allows the joinder of a governmental defendant even where the one-year statute of limitations in the GTLA had lapsed at the time original complaint was filed. Appellant argues that \"applicable statute of limitations\" as first used in subsection (a) refers to the statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   claim against the\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   defendant. According to the Appellant, the claim against MLGW survives because the original complaint was filed within the three-year property damage statute of limitations applicable to the claim against Brass-Craft,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and because the Appellant added MLGW as a defendant within ninety days of Brass-Craft naming MLGW in its answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In contrast, MLGW argues that all three occurrences of the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations\" in section 20-1-119(a) refer to the same statute of limitations and that this use of the phrase must mean the statute of limitations applicable to MLGW as that comparative tortfeasor. Because the Appellant filed its complaint more than one-year after the cause of action arose, and therefore outside the statute of limitations applicable to MLGW under the GTLA, MLGW contends that Appellant cannot benefit from the grace period provided in section 20-1-119(a).Appellee\n   avers that to hold otherwise would be to contravene the plain language of section 20-1-119(a) and would result in an inappropriate judicial expansion of the GTLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties in this appeal insist that the dispute is an issue of first impression for this Court; such is not the case. Indeed, this Court addressed a similar question in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Queen's Tree Surgery v. Metro.

That occurrence creates the grace period and confirms that a plaintiff may assert a claim notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations that would otherwise be applicable to the claim to be asserted against the prospective defendant, not the statute applicable to the original defendant. Indeed, the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations\" in that instance is quite clearly referring to the statute of limitations that would otherwise bar the claims against the prospective defendant (or, in this case, MLGW). No other reading of that provision would even make sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Appellee essentially argues that the \"90-day grace period should only be triggered if the initial suit was likewise filed within the same 'applicable statute of limitations' as the claims to be asserted against the prospective defendant.\" Based on the Appellee's assertions, a reiteration of Tennessee's rules of statutory construction is helpful here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court has recognized that statutes are \"not always clear\" and that in the face of confusion over a statute, \"we must resort to the rules of statutory construction and other external sources to ascertain the General Assembly's intent and purpose.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lee Med.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324290\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/312/515/#p526\">\n    312 S.W.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

Under this interpretation, the \"applicable statute of limitations\" in this case must refer to the one-year statute provided for in the GTLA. To Appellee's credit, it is correct that \"[i]n the absence of statutory language indicating that the definition of the phrase differs from one sentence, or subsection, to the next, we decline to assign inconsistent definitions to the same phrase.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mills v.

Indeed, the first two uses of the phrase are modified by the article \"the,\" while the third use of the phrase is modified by the article \"any.\" Again, in construing statutes, we must consider the grammar employed by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hawkins\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9008195\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/165/296/#p300\">\n    165 S.W.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In our view, the addition of the adjective \"any\" typically denotes the use of a plural, while the use of the article \"the\" denotes a singular.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage\n   </em>\n   65 (3d ed. 2011) (stating that while \"any\" may be either singular or plural, the singular is rare and \"really is an elliptical for any one\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Webster's New College Dictionary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   64 (5th ed. 2014) (defining \"any\" as \"one, no matter which, of more than two\"), with\n   <em>\n    Webster's New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   at 1501 (defining \"the\" as, variously, \"that (one) being spoken of or already mentioned\" or \"that (one) which is present\" or \"referring to that one of a number of persons or things which is identified by a modifier\"). Considering only the language of the statute, then, the statute simply does not foreclose the possibility that the General Assembly intended different definitions to apply to the different uses of the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations.\" Indeed, the plain language utilized by the legislature suggests that while the first two uses of the phrase \"applicable statute of limitations\" was meant to be limited to only a single statute of limitations, the third use of the phrase encompasses the consideration of additional statutes of limitations. This language therefore directly contradicts Appellee's argument that consideration of only a single statute of limitations, the statute applicable to the comparative tortfeasor, was intended by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We are also mindful that we must not determine the meaning of a statute by considering only a few words without considering the statute as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Steele v.

Here, it important to consider the context of each use\n   of the term \"applicable statute of limitations.\" For instance, the first two uses of the term \"applicable statute of limitations\" occur in the context of the original complaint against the original defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-1-119\">\n    Tenn.

The use of the term \"the applicable statute of limitations\" in this context therefore generally means the statute of limitations applicable to the \"one already mentioned,\" i.e., the defendant named in an original complaint. Indeed, section 20-1-119(a) does not even refer to the comparative tortfeasor added by this section as a defendant, but rather simply as a \"person.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-1-119\">\n    Tenn.

The drafters of section 20-1-119 therefore draw a distinction between the statute of limitations applicable when the suit is initiated and the more broadly characterized statute of limitations that may be applicable to the comparative tortfeasor. This analysis leads us to believe that the drafters contemplated the possibility that the original complaint and the claim against the comparative tortfeasor could be governed by different statutes of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-1-119\">\n    Tenn.
