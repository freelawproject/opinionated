(R&amp;M), is a Texas Corporation that owns and operates several bar and grill establishments including Mavericks Bar &amp; Grill (Mavericks), located in El Paso, Texas. R&amp;M filed third-party petitions against Safe Harbor Benefits, Inc. (Safe Harbor), USG Insurance Services, Inc., (USG), Ryan Specialty Group Services,\n   LLC and/or Ryan Specialty Group, LLC (collectively, Ryan Specialty Group), which it named as successors to entities including WKF&amp;C Agency Inc., WKF&amp;C Agency, Inc. of Texas, and WKF&amp;C Agency (collectively, WKFC), asserting a claim of negligence coupled with violations of the Texas Insurance Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Collectively, the Appellees here only include Safe Harbor, USG, Ryan Specialty Group, LLC, and Ryan Specialty Group Services, LLC (Appellees or third-party defendants), as the WKFC entities were never served with process and are not parties in this suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, R&amp;M challenges the trial court's order granting summary judgment in its entirety in favor of Appellees. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Purchase of the Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Richard Chavez and his brother Raymond (\"Mike\") Chavez owned and operated R&amp;M with Richard serving as President and Mike serving as vice-president. Along with other duties, Richard assumed responsibility for procuring liquor liability protection for the bar and grills that R&amp;M operated. In 2006, he approached Victoria Weir, an agent for Appellee Safe Harbor, to assist him in obtaining insurance coverage. Although Safe Harbor could not write a policy directly, Weir contacted a wholesale broker, Appellee USG, to assist with procuring a policy for R&amp;M. In December 2006, R&amp;M purchased its first liquor liability policy from First Mercury, a surplus lines company, which it then renewed a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the policy expired in December of 2008, R&amp;M asked for a new quote, and at that time, Safe Harbor again contacted USG, which then contacted WKF&amp;C Agency, a managing general underwriter, which then contacted Indemnity Insurance of DC Group (Indemnity) from whom it received a quote for coverage along with financial information and disclosures about the company. The information indicated that Indemnity had received an \"A-\" rating from A.M. Best, a well-known rating company, which placed Indemnity in the \"excellent\" category, among other companies rated. The information also described Indemnity as being licensed to operate in various states, including Texas, by respective departments of insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, Safe Harbor provided R&amp;M with written notice that Indemnity was registered with the State as a Risk Retention Group (RRG), which under Texas law, meant it did not participate in the Texas insolvency guaranty fund. Safe Harbor further informed R&amp;M that an RRG is a \"non-traditional market,\" and R&amp;M needed to be \"aware of certain information about this market.\" Through a series of transactions involving the Appellees, and formerly owned entities such as WKF&amp;C, R&amp;M purchased a liquor liability policy issued by Indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 18, 2008, Richard Chavez signed an \"acknowledgment\" stating that he understood that the \"coverage written [was] not subject to the protection and benefits of the state guaranty associations,\" and that R&amp;M had agreed to hold Safe Harbor and WKF&amp;C harmless with respect to \"any future loss, damage, expense, or other financial risk and/or any other dispute that may arise relative\" to its placement of coverage with Indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As well, the policy itself contained a notice stating that: \"Insurance Insolvency guaranty funds are not available for your risk retention group.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, R&amp;M renewed its policy with Indemnity in 2009 and 2010, through the same series of transactions as before, thereby obtaining coverage through December 2010. With each renewal, R&amp;M received the same information as before about Indemnity's rating with A.M. Best and the nature of its operations. At renewal, Indemnity had received an \"A-\" rating from A.M. Best. Once issued, the policy itself contained a notice that Indemnity continued operating as an RRG in the issuing state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Dram Shop Lawsuits and Indemnity's Liquidation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September 2011, two different customers who were served liquor at Mavericks were involved in separate accidents. In July of 2012, victims of the first accident filed a lawsuit against the driver who had been served liquor at Maverick's, and against R&amp;M under the Dram Shop Act. A year later, a similar suit was filed by the victims of the second accident. Initially, Indemnity proceeded to defend R&amp;M in both suits by contracting and paying attorneys to enter appearances and defend against all allegations asserted. By April of 2014, however, circumstances changed after Indemnity suffered a precipitously-occurring financial calamity that resulted it its eventual liquidation, not only causing attorneys representing R&amp;M to withdraw and leave R&amp;M to defend itself, but also exposing it to liability without insurance coverage. The record indicates that A.M. Best had downgraded Indemnity's rating on September 24, 2013, when it issued a revision indicating that Indemnity had suffered a \"precipitous decline\" in its capitalization structure. At that time, the rating agency placed Indemnity \"under review,\" and downgraded its rating to a \"B.\" The revision stated that it still had faith in Indemnity's ability to address its capitalization issue given its history and expertise in the insurance industry, but further warned that another \"negative rating action may occur if capital levels do not continue to support the ratings and if compliance does not improve.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, on July 26, 2013, the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware, where Indemnity was incorporated, filed a Liquidation Petition, seeking entry of a Liquidation and Injunction Order, in light of Indemnity's financial issues. Following an investigation, the Commissioner determined that Indemnity's financial situation had not improved, and that its financial condition was so \"unsound\" and \"impaired\" that any further transaction of insurance as a going concern posed a hazard to its policy holders. Therefore, on November 7, 2013, a court of chancery in the State of Delaware issued a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order, enjoining Indemnity from conducting any additional business and appointed the Insurance Commissioner as a receiver to conduct business on behalf of Indemnity and to take control of its assets. On April 10, 2014, the court entered a \"Liquidation and Injunction Order,\" indicating that the Commissioner had uncovered several areas of \"high concern\" regarding Indemnity's financial viability, and information indicating that Indemnity's principal, Jeffrey B. Cohen, had engaged in possible fraudulent conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that Indemnity\n   was unable to develop a Rehabilitation Plan to remediate and correct its financial issues, and that liquidation was in order, thereby requiring that all insurance policies issued by Indemnity be cancelled, and that anyone holding a policy had the right to file a claim with the receiver on or before January 16, 2015 for any losses incurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    The Third-Party Lawsuits and the Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Indemnity became insolvent and its lawyers withdrew from the litigation, R&amp;M filed its initial third-party petition, in March of 2015, against Safe Harbor and USG. Months later, in July 2015, R&amp;M supplemented to add WKF&amp;C, and its related entities, Ryan Specialty Group, LLC, and Ryan Specialty Group Services, LLC (collectively, the Ryan Specialty Group).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its supplemental petition, R&amp;M alleged that WKF&amp;C was a division, component, or subsidiary of the Ryan Specialty Group, and these entities provided insurance related services pertaining to the series of transactions that included Safe Harbor and USG, which led to R&amp;M's purchase of the Indemnity insurance policy at issue in this case. R&amp;M asserted a variety of allegations against the third-party defendants, contending that they had made misrepresentations and/or had failed to disclose material information with regard to R&amp;M's purchase of the Indemnity policy; that they were negligent in their actions or omissions; and that they had engaged in violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and the Texas Insurance Code. After a period of discovery, the Ryan Specialty Group filed motions for summary judgment against all claims asserted by R&amp;M. The trial court subsequently entered an order granting summary judgment in its entirety in favor of Ryan Specialty Group, LLC, and Ryan Specialty Group Services, LLC. Thereafter, USG and Safe Harbor filed traditional and no-evidence motions for summary judgment challenging all claims asserted against it. Issuing a final judgment, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment filed by USG and Safe Harbor, which effectively disposed of all parties and all claims. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, we review a trial court's order granting both no-evidence and traditional motions for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.

Thereafter, WKF&amp;C voluntarily dissolved in 2013. Because of its inability to name WKF&amp;C as a third-party defendant in the underlying lawsuit, R&amp;M ultimately named the Ryan Specialty Group, i.e., Ryan Specialty Group Services, LLC, and Ryan Specialty Group, LLC, as third-party defendants, contending that WKF&amp;C had \"merged\" into and/or had been \"acquired\" by the two Ryan Specialty Group Defendants. R&amp;M further contended that WKF&amp;C was a \"division, component or subsidiary of the Ryan Specialty Group\" entities as referenced in the petition, and/or was an alter ego of the Ryan Specialty Group Defendants, and sought to hold them liable for WKF&amp;C's conduct in procuring the Indemnity insurance policy on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Effective May 1, 2012, by means of an Instrument of Assumption included in the purchase agreement, another entity identified as WKFC Underwriting Managers, (WKFC), a series of RSG Underwriting Managers, LLC, assumed certain liabilities of the WKF&amp;C companies, as assignee of RSG Underwriting Managers, LLC. The Instrument of Assumption, however, also expressly excluded all obligations of WKF&amp;C, and its related entities, unless specifically stated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In their traditional motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss this claim, the Ryan Specialty Group argued that they could not be held liable, as a matter of law, for the actions of WKF&amp;C, as they were not involved in any of the transactions in question, they were not the actual parties to the Purchase Agreement, there was no merger between WKF&amp;C and any of the Ryan Specialty Group entities, and none of the Ryan Specialty Group entities agreed to assume any liabilities for WKF&amp;C's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To the contrary, the Ryan Specialty Group pointed out that the Purchase Agreement itself expressly stated that WKFC Underwriting Managers-an entity separate and apart from WKF&amp;C-assumed specified liabilities of WKF&amp;C's, including liabilities of the type under consideration herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, the Ryan Specialty Group attached excerpts from a deposition given by their attorney, Ian Ackerman, as well as Ackerman's affidavit, stating that there was no merger between the various entities-as there was no exchange of shares and that it was instead, an arm's length transaction in which WKF&amp;C's assets were sold for cash only. In addition, Ackerman stated that the various entities involved in the sale had no common ownership before the purchase, had no commingled funds, and that WKF&amp;C's owners remained separate and discrete from any of the Ryan Specialty Group entities throughout the sale. The Ryan Specialty Group therefore argued that they could not be held liable on either an alter ego or a successor liability theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In response, R&amp;M argued that a material issue of fact existed on the issue of whether WKF&amp;C could have been held liable for Indemnity's fraudulent conduct, as WKF&amp;C was acting as Indemnity's agent in the marketplace. R&amp;M further contended that a question of fact existed on whether the Ryan Specialty Group's purchase of WKF&amp;C was used as a sham to avoid liability for claims of this nature involving Indemnity. According to R&amp;M, if in fact the acquisition was for the purpose of escaping liability, the Ryan Specialty Group should be held liable on that basis. R&amp;M contended that the transaction described as a sale and acquisition was \"nothing more than a shell game in which the assets, key employees, and operations of [WKF&amp;C] were moved as a going concern into a new entity and where the litigation liabilities of [WKF&amp;C] were left in a dormant entity and eventually done away with.\" R&amp;M then concluded that for \"legal and equitable reasons, the corporate fiction must be disregarded,\" and that the court should therefore treat WKFC, as successor of WKF&amp;C, as either a \"continuing entity or as having de facto merged\" with the Ryan Specialty Group Services, LLC, and with the Ryan Specialty Group LLC, or collectively the \"Ryan Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In reply, the Ryan Specialty Group supplemented their motion for summary judgment with excerpts from Ackerman's deposition testimony, in which he averred that the Ryan Defendants did not acquire WKF&amp;C as part of any fraudulent scheme to defeat R&amp;M's interests, stating that WKF&amp;C did not share any concerns about Indemnity's financial stability at the time of the sale, and that he did not believe there was any cause for concern at the time of the sale in any event. In addition, the Ryan Specialty Group argued that there was no evidence that the various entities were alter egos of each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment of Ryan Specialty Group and ordered that R&amp;M take nothing on their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Arguments on Appeal\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On appeal, R&amp;M argues that the trial court erred in granting the Ryan Defendants' traditional motion for summary judgment, asserting that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they were WKFC's alter ego, and were therefore liable for WKFC's alleged \"errors and omissions\" in procuring the insurance policy through Indemnity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   R&amp;M contends\n   that the Ryan Defendants purchased WKFC's assets in a sham transaction so that WKFC could avoid liabilities. R&amp;M further contends that the purchase was \"nothing more than a shell game in which the assets, key employees, and operations of WKFC were moved as a going concern into a new entity and where the litigation liabilities of WKFC were left in a dormant entity and eventually done away with,\" asserting that the corporate \"shell\" entity that retained liabilities, i.e., WKFC Underwriting Managers, was \"wound down and does not exist anymore.\" R&amp;M contends that the Ryan Defendants used the \"corporate structure\" as a \"sham to avoid liability based on WKFC's procurement of 'worthless' insurance.\" R&amp;M contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether WKFC could be considered the alter ego of the Ryan Defendants, and consequently \"whether the corporate fiction of a corporate transaction should be disregarded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   R&amp;M's argument fails for several reasons. First, as the Ryan Defendants point out, an entirely different corporate entity, RSG Underwriting Managers, LLC., acquired WKFC's assets pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and the two Ryan Defendants were not named in the purchase agreement and were not involved in the purchase. Further, R&amp;M fails to explain why it did not name Ryan Underwriting as a defendant, and why it instead chose to name the Ryan Specialty Group as defendants, other than to mention in passing that RSG Underwriting Managers is a subsidiary of the Ryan Specialty Group. Similarly, while R&amp;M contends that we should find the Ryan Defendants liable for WKFC's actions, their reasoning also appears to be based on the contention that WKFC was a subsidiary of the Ryan Defendants, and/or that the Ryan Defendants and WKFC were operated as a single business enterprise, contending that the evidence demonstrated that they had overlapping finances and operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a matter of law, however, none of these arguments serve as a basis for piercing the corporate veil. The fact that a corporation may be a parent of a subsidiary corporation does not automatically render it liable for the actions of its subsidiaries. For the purpose of legal proceedings, subsidiary corporations and parent corporations are considered \"separate and distinct 'persons' as a matter of law, and the separate entity of corporations will generally be observed by the courts even where one company may dominate or control the other company, or treats the other company as a mere department, instrumentality, or agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Formosa Plastics Corp., USA v.

As explained above, there is no evidence that the Ryan Defendants were aware of Indemnity's financial instability at the time RSG purchased WKFC's assets, nor that Indemnity would later experience a forced liquidation. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that at the time of the purchase, Indemnity had retained an A- rating and had remedied capitalization concerns raised by regulators and the rating agency. Although issues arose, Indemnity's rating was not downgraded until September 24, 2013-a year and a half after the asset purchase of April 2012. Further, the Delaware Insurance Commissioner did not institute proceedings against Indemnity until July 26, 2013, well over a year after that purchase took place. As well, attorney Ackerman testified that WKFC did not share any concerns about the financial stability of Indemnity at the time of the sale, and he did not believe that they had any reason to have any concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The evidence therefore does not support a finding that the Ryan Defendants used WKFC to perpetrate an actual fraud on R&amp;M with respect to Indemnity's financial situation, i.e., that the Purchase Agreement was made with the intent to deceive or defeat R&amp;M's claims. As such, we find no basis in the record for finding the Ryan Defendants liable for WKFC's actions, and we therefore conclude that the trial court properly granted the Ryan Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AvenueOne Properties, Inc. v.

The Code provision provides as follows: \"An insurance contract effective in this state and entered into by an unauthorized insurer is unenforceable by the insurer.

In fact, after suit was filed against R&amp;M, Indemnity initially provided coverage, which initially included attorneys retained to assist in the defense of the case. The fact that Indemnity later became insolvent does not change the fact that at all times prior to the date of R&amp;M's loss, a valid liquor liability policy had existed and that R&amp;M had been informed of the coverage and nature of the risk associated with contracting with an RRG. As such, we conclude that there is no evidence that either USG or Safe Harbor failed to procure the requested insurance on behalf of R&amp;M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Duty to Exercise Due Diligence to Ensure the \"Solvency and Legitimacy of the Carrier Offering the Insurance\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   R&amp;M's next argument appears to be at the heart of its belief that USG and Safe Harbor were negligent in procuring the liquor liability policy from Indemnity. R&amp;M alleges that USG and Safe Harbor had a duty to exercise due diligence in the form of a \"basic security review,\" to ensure Indemnity's \"solvency and legitimacy\" as an insurance carrier, and that they breached that duty by failing to adequately investigate Indemnity's financial condition before recommending that R&amp;M obtain coverage through Indemnity. In support of its argument, R&amp;M cites a line of cases in which customers were told by insurance agents that they were covered under an insurance policy that was issued by companies that were already insolvent at the time the policies were issued, or that became insolvent before the date of the customer's loss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hancock v.

App.-Dallas 1915, no writ)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   These cases, however, are inapposite to the present situation. In the present case, there is no evidence that either USG or Safe Harbor knew that Indemnity was facing insolvency and/or that Indemnity's president had committed fraud at the time the policy was purchased, at the time it was renewed, and/or at any time prior to the date of R&amp;M's loss in September of 2011. To the contrary, as set forth above, at all relevant times, Indemnity maintained an A- rating from A.M. Best for at least the following two years; the issues pertaining to Indemnity's financial instability did not become apparent until A.M. Best downgraded its rating in September of 2013. Further, the Delaware Insurance Commissioner had not taken any action against Indemnity until July of 2013, when it first filed a petition against Indemnity asserting that its financial condition had deteriorated to such a degree that current and further transaction of insurance as a going concern remained hazardous to policyholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   R&amp;M, however, believes that there were certain \"red flags\" that occurred earlier-prior to the date of R&amp;M's loss-which should have alerted USG and Safe Harbor to Indemnity's precarious financial condition and negative rating outlook while there was still time to obtain different coverage. R&amp;M finds it significant that, in December of 2009, A.M. Best reported concerns over Indemnity's capitalization when a letter of credit was withdrawn from the company's balance sheet, causing a downgrade of its rating to a \"B-.\" The record reveals, however, that Indemnity successfully appealed the rating downgrade after it agreed it would infuse capital into the company. Mr. Cohen promised he would transfer ten million dollars to boost the company's capital. After infusion of this additional capital, A.M. Best upgraded Indemnity's rating to an \"A-,\" and it remained at that level until September of 2013. As this situation was remedied well before R&amp;M's loss occurred, this seemingly temporary downgrade of rating would not have alerted either Safe Harbor or USG of a high risk of insolvency, or to the possibility of fraud occurring up to four years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Next, R&amp;M points out that in 2006, there was a negative regulatory report on Indemnity from the District of Columbia Department of Insurance Securities and Banking (DISB), the state agency having regulatory jurisdiction over Indemnity given its domicile in the District. DISB noted that Indemnity had issues with its capitalization structure; however, these issues were remedied by Indemnity pursuant to a Consent Agreement. No further information indicated that the problems identified in the report were not addressed, or that Indemnity's situation as it existed in 2007 would have alerted anyone to the issues that occurred over seven years later when Indemnity became insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Similarly, R&amp;M points to a report on Indemnity from DISB that was adopted as final on August 20, 2010. This report chronicled the financial issues that Indemnity faced with the withdrawal of the letter of credit discussed above, but also noted that Cohen had infused the company with the above-described capital to address the situation. The report also chronicled some of the other issues that it perceived with respect to such matters as Indemnity writing policies in excess of approved limits,\n   but the report also indicated that these issues were also addressed in the Department-approved Consent Agreement with Cohen. The report also made several recommendations regarding Indemnity's policy-writing practices and recommended that it generally \"perform a review of its underwriting and policy issuance system\" including the adequacy of the controls within the system. However, the report concluded that Indemnity's \"capital and surplus funds exceeded the minimum requirements during the period under examination,\" and there was no indication that DISB intended to take any further action against Indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As well, the record indicates that Indemnity responded to DISB's report, by either refuting the findings and/or agreeing to perform a review of its procedures. In turn, DISB expressly found Indemnity's response to be \"adequate\" with respect to the financial issues and recommendations that had been made. In short, there is nothing in the record to suggest that DISB intended to take any action against Indemnity, conduct any additional investigations, or that it otherwise considered Indemnity unfit to continue providing insurance at that time. As such, there is nothing in the report that would have suggested to either USG or Safe Harbor that Indemnity had not adequately responded to regulators as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   R&amp;M also contends that Indemnity's own brochures, which it supplied to USG and Safe Harbor at the time R&amp;M purchased its policies, contained certain \"red flags\" which should have alerted USG and Safe Harbor to the fact that Indemnity was overstating its financial stability. R&amp;M contends that the brochure stated that Indemnity had assets in excess of some of the country's leading insurance companies, which, in effect, R&amp;M believes USG and Safe Harbor should have known was not true. As well, R&amp;M contends that USG and Safe Harbor should have known that Indemnity's \"pricing and product details were unusually aggressive,\" and \"unusually good for customers,\" in comparison to other liquor liability carriers, which R&amp;M apparently believes \"were too good to be true,\" and should have made them realize that Indemnity was not a legitimate carrier. R&amp;M's arguments, however, are highly speculative in nature with regard to how Indemnity's representations were, or should have been, interpreted by USG and Safe Harbor; again, during the time Indemnity made these claims there was no evidence that they were false, and we do not believe that this type of information would cause a reasonable insurance agent and/or a wholesale broker to believe that Indemnity would face financial collapse years in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   And finally, R&amp;M points out that at least two lawsuits were filed against Indemnity in 2011 and 2012 in D.C.-two of which were filed shortly before the date of loss herein in February or March of 2011-in which parties were claiming that Indemnity had refused to pay claims, and/or that Indemnity had engaged in fraud. R&amp;M apparently believes that USG and Safe Harbor should have been aware of these lawsuits and inferred from their existence that Indemnity was not a reliable carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There are several problems with this argument. First, we know of no case law, and R&amp;M has cited none, that would require an insurance agent or wholesale broker to be aware of and/or monitor lawsuits pending throughout the country with respect to each and every carrier they have utilized for their customers. To the contrary, we believe that requiring an agent and/or wholesale broker to do so would place an undue burden on them absent controlling legal authority. More importantly,\n   we note that while these two lawsuits were filed approximately six months before the date of R&amp;M's loss, there is no evidence that they were resolved before then-in other words, there was no evidence that a judgment had been entered against Indemnity in either of those cases, or that any findings had been made to the effect that Indemnity had wrongfully refused to pay any claims or that it had engaged in fraudulent conduct-in other words, at that point in time, the lawsuits contained nothing but allegations that had not yet been proven. As such, we conclude that the filing of these lawsuits would not support a finding that either USG or Safe Harbor either knew or should have known that Indemnity was facing potential insolvency prior to R&amp;M's date of loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In various other cases, courts around the country have concluded that an insurance agent is not liable for a customer's lost claim due to the insurer's insolvency \"if the insurer is solvent at the time the policy is procured, unless at that time or at a later time when the insured could be protected, the agent knows or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should know, of facts or circumstances which would put a reasonable agent on notice that the insurance presents an unreasonable risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham &amp; Associates, Inc. v.

Thus, in a similar situation, our sister court reversed a jury's verdict finding an insurance agent liable for his customer's loss due to the insurer's insolvency, where there was no evidence that the agent had actual knowledge of an insurer's financial instability and/or that he reasonably should have known that the coverage would represent an unreasonable risk, either at the time of purchase or prior to the customer's loss.\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9961145\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/738/45/#p47\">\n    738 S.W.2d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in that case found it significant that the insurer was registered in Texas, and that the insurer had a B+ rating from A.M.

There is simply no evidence that USG or Safe Harbor knew or reasonably should have known that Indemnity would face financial collapse at the time the policy was purchased and/or at any time prior to the date of loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Safe Harbor's Duty to Inform R&amp;M that Indemnity was an RRG, and to Explain the Risks Associated with Purchasing a Policy from an RRG\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   R&amp;M next contends that Safe Harbor owed it a duty to inform R&amp;M that Indemnity was an RRG, and to explain the risks associated with purchasing a policy from an RRG, citing primarily to section 2201.206 of the Texas Insurance Code. In addressing this issue, we note that this Code provision expressly provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Any policy issued by a risk retention group must contain in 10-point type on the front page and on the declarations page the following notice:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   This policy is issued by your risk retention group. Your risk retention group may not be subject to all of the insurance laws and regulations of your state. State insurance insolvency guaranty funds are not available for your risk retention group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 2201.206. In the present case, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that policies issued by Indemnity to R&amp;M contained the requisite notice, including the policy that was issued in December of 2010 that was in existence at the time of R&amp;M's loss. As such, we find, as a matter of law, that this Insurance Code provision was not violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   R&amp;M contends, however, that Safe Harbor had a duty to personally explain to R&amp;M, and Richard Chavez in particular, the risks associated with purchasing insurance from an RRG, and that Safe Harbor failed in this regard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   R&amp;M points to Chavez's deposition testimony in which he asserted that Safe Harbor's agent, Victoria Weir, did not fully explain to him the true nature of an RRG, or the risks inherent in purchasing the Indemnity policy, and that he had no understanding of such. R&amp;M contends that this evidence raises a question of fact regarding whether Safe Harbor breached its duty in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we agree that in general, an agent who is working on behalf of an applicant has a duty to either explain the terms of the application form, or otherwise inform the applicant of the nature and scope of coverages included\n   in the application.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeill v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied) (affirming jury instruction that the agent has a duty to explain the terms of the application to the client). In the present case, however, despite Chavez's testimony to the contrary, the record contains undisputed evidence establishing that when Safe Harbor first placed coverage with R&amp;M in December of 2008, Safe Harbor sent R&amp;M a letter advising it that it was proposing to place its coverage with an RRG and explaining that an RRG is a \"non-traditional market.\" More importantly, it then obtained a written disclaimer signed by Richard Chavez and dated December 18, 2008, acknowledging receipt of Safe Harbor's letter, and acknowledging that he understood the risk disclosed including the warning that the proposed coverage was \"not subject to the protection and benefits of the state guaranty associations[.]\" As such, we conclude that the undisputed summary judgment evidence belies R&amp;M's contention that it was not informed of the true nature of the risk associated with contracting with an RRG, and/or that it was not aware of the fact that an RRG does not participate in the guaranty fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Whether Safe Harbor or USG violated any provision of Chapter 981 of the Texas Insurance Code\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   R&amp;M next contends that Safe Harbor and USG violated two provisions in Chapter 981 of the Texas Insurance Code, regarding an agent's duty to obtain declinations from admitted carriers prior to procuring insurance from a non-admitted carrier, citing to TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 981.001 and 981.004. Chapter 981 of the Code, however, relates solely to surplus line carriers, and not to RRG's, and are therefore not applicable to the present case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 981.001(c) (recognizing that the purpose of Chapter 981 is to regulate and tax surplus lines insurance carriers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Further, R&amp;M has not cited any other statutory or case law imposing a similar duty on agents to obtain declinations from admitted carriers prior to procuring insurance from an RRG. As such, we conclude, as a matter of law, that neither Safe Harbor nor USG violated these Code provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Alleged Misrepresentations and Deceptive Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   And finally, R&amp;M contends that USG and Safe Harbor could be held liable for making misrepresentations and engaging in deceptive practices, in violation of both the DTPA and the Texas Insurance Code when placing R&amp;M's coverage with Indemnity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   R&amp;M contends that USG and/or Safe Harbor made at least three misrepresentations regarding Indemnity's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, R&amp;M contends that Appellees falsely stated that they were \"selling liquor\n   liability insurance that was actually not insurance, but rather, merely a ticket into a Ponzi scheme that collapsed[.]\" And second, in a related argument, R&amp;M contends that Appellees falsely stated that its \"premium payments would be used to purchase insurance, which was false[.]\" These contentions, however, are wholly without merit. As discussed above, Indemnity was a registered RRG in the State of Texas and was authorized to provide liquor liability insurance at the time of R&amp;M's initial purchase and at the time of each policy renewal. Further, at the time of purchase and renewal, R&amp;M's premium payments did in fact go toward the purchase of liquor liability insurance from Indemnity; the fact that Indemnity later became insolvent does not change the fact that R&amp;M did in fact purchase and pay premiums for a valid liquor liability policy at the time in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Second, R&amp;M contends that Appellees stated that \"they sold only 'A rated' policies when in fact the Indemnity policy at issue was 'A-minus' rated and had negative reports issued.\" This, however, is contradicted by the record. The undisputed evidence established that Safe Harbor expressly advised R&amp;M in writing that Indemnity had an A-minus rating, and in response, Richard Chavez acknowledged in writing that he had been given that information. And more importantly, even R&amp;M had been told that Indemnity had an \"A-\" rating, rather than an \"A\" rating, R&amp;M does not explain how this could have resulted in any harm to them. As set forth above, an A- rating is considered \"excellent,\" and the fact that Indemnity had a slightly lower rating was in no way the cause of the damages that R&amp;M suffered when Indemnity later became insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Third, R&amp;M contends that Appellees generally misrepresented the nature of the policy and/or failed to disclose information concerning the true nature of the policy, in violation of the DTPA. Again, the record contains no evidence that Appellees misrepresented the nature of the liquor liability policy that they procured from Indemnity, and/or made any misrepresentations about Indemnity's status as an RRG. To the contrary, as set forth above, Richard Chavez signed a written disclaimer indicating that he understood he was receiving a policy through an RRG, and that he understood that the \"coverage written [was] not subject to the protection and benefits of the state guaranty associations[.]\" And, once again, we note that the policy itself contained a notice stating that: \"Insurance Insolvency guaranty funds are not available for your risk retention group.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the record does not contain a scintilla of evidence to support any of R&amp;M's claims against Appellees for negligence, and/or its claim that Appellees committed any violations of the DTPA or the Texas Insurance Code. We therefore hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees. R&amp;M's Issue Two is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ISSUE THREE: WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY STRIKING R&amp;M'S EXPERT WITNESS AFFIDAVIT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   R&amp;M next contends that the trial court erred by striking the expert witness affidavit of George Biehl prior to ruling on Appellees' motions for summary judgment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As we recently noted, an expert witness must meet the basic qualification requirements found in TEX. R.

In the present case, we need not consider the issue of whether Biehl was qualified as an expert because we conclude that his testimony would not have helped the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In his affidavit, Biehl expressed several opinions about duties and responsibilities owed by Safe Harbor and USG to R&amp;M. However, as set forth above, the question of what duties Safe Harbor and USG owed to R&amp;M are questions of law for a court to decide and not questions of fact for a jury. Moreover, although Biehl concluded that Safe Harbor and USG violated those duties, the evidence belies his conclusions. Accordingly, we conclude that R&amp;M has failed in its burden of establishing that the trial court abused its discretion in striking Biehl's testimony.

We note, however, that the question of whether R&amp;M could have purchased other policies or not does not weigh in our decision with regard to whether Safe Harbor or USG committed negligence and/or whether they violated the DTPA or the Texas Insurance Code. As set forth above, the record established, as a matter of law, that neither USG nor Safe Harbor were negligent in procuring the policy from Indemnity on R&amp;M's behalf, as Indemnity was, at the time, financially solvent and registered to operate as an RRG in the State of Texas. As well, the record established as a matter of law that Safe Harbor adequately warned R&amp;M about the true nature and risks of purchasing an RRG policy, and the record belies R&amp;M's contention that it did not understand or was otherwise misled by either Safe Harbor or USG. Therefore, the question of whether R&amp;M could have purchased alternative liquor liability insurance is simply not relevant to our inquiry.
