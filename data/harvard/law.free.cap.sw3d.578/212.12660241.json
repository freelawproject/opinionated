On May 15, 2019, Relators filed a Rule 11 agreement with this Court, which reflects that the parties resolved the discovery issues\n   raised in this proceeding. On May 22, Wells filed a response, which indicates that the parties resolved their dispute and Respondent signed an order effectuating their agreement. Respondent's order demonstrates that Relator's complaints regarding Requests for Production 89 and 96 and Interrogatories 3 and 15 have been resolved. On May 24, Relators filed a motion to dismiss this proceeding as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   If a controversy no longer exists between the parties, the case becomes moot.\n   <em>\n    Reule v.
