App. P. 9 application for permission to appeal concerns whether portions of a trial court order and a transcript, both of which reference Plaintiff Jane Doe's medical history, should be placed under seal. Pursuant to an October 2, 2018 order of remand from this court in Appeal No. M2018-01611-COA-R10-CV\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the trial court determined that portions of the documents should be redacted, but that certain portions of the transcript and order which include references to Jane Doe's medical history should not be placed under seal. The trial court subsequently granted Jane Doe and John Doe permission to appeal under Tenn. R. App. P. 9. We concur with the trial court that this is an appropriate case for an interlocutory appeal. Furthermore, because the application and answer fully set forth the parties' positions and the material facts, we dispense with further briefing and oral argument and proceed to the merits of the appeal in order to save the parties additional time and expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of an alleged sexual assault of a minor, John Doe, in a middle school locker room. John Doe by his next friend Jane Doe filed a complaint against the school and several individual defendants. Although the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaint without prejudice under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01 in June of 2018, ancillary matters remained pending before the trial court. On September 4, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an application for an extraordinary appeal under Tenn. R. App. P. 10. No. M2018-01611-COA-R10-CV. In connection with the application, the parties filed several exhibits that had been placed under seal in the trial court pursuant to the trial court's blanket order entered on November 15, 2017. The November 15, 2017 order reads in pertinent part, \"the Court hereby requires that all documents filed in this case initially be placed under seal. The Court will then do an in camera inspection of each document and decide whether or not to unseal the document.\" No such in camera inspection of the relevant documents had occurred at the time the Tenn. R. App. P. 10 application was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Documents previously filed under seal in the trial court pursuant to a specific order of the trial court remain under seal in this court. Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15(b)(i). However, \"[f]or a document to be filed under seal in the appellate court pursuant to subdivision\n   (b), the trial court must have made an individualized determination that the particular document should be filed under seal.\" Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15(b)(ii). Because the November 15, 2017 order did not include the individualized determination required by Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15, we remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to make specific findings and conclusions needed to justify sealing any specifically identified documents or portions of documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 1, 2018, the trial court entered an order placing several documents, or portions thereof, under seal and removing the seal from several other documents. At issue in this appeal is the trial court's determination that certain portions of a February 5, 2018 order and a November 9, 2017 transcript, both of which reference Jane Doe's medical history, should not be placed under seal. The trial court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show a \"compelling reason\" to justify sealing these portions of the record because they contained a discussion about Jane Doe's medical information, not Jane Doe's actual medical records. The trial court subsequently granted the plaintiffs permission to appeal under Tenn. R. App. P. 9. The plaintiffs timely filed a Tenn. R. App. P. 9 application in this court, and the defendants filed an answer in opposition to the application. In addition, the plaintiffs have filed a motion to file portions of their application and supporting documents under seal pursuant to Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15. We emphasize at this point that the only issue before us in this Tenn. R. App. P. 9 appeal is public access to the two documents in question. Neither the defendants' access to the documents nor the documents' admissibility is at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We review the trial court's orders to seal its records under an abuse of discretion standard.

Protecting the medical records themselves but allowing public disclosure of their contents would provide no protection for confidential information.

Further, the redaction of only those few lines which reveal the confidential information is narrowly tailored to serve that compelling reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The foregoing notwithstanding, defendants assert that the application of the plaintiffs to seal Jane Doe's medical records and information derived therefrom should be denied because the plaintiffs publicly disclosed in their application the very medical history they seek to have sealed. In the original public version of their Tenn. R. App. P. 9 application, filed in accordance with Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15(d), the plaintiffs failed to redact two key lines which reveal information about Jane Doe's medical history. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an amended public version correcting the error. Although not initially placed under seal, we decline to disregard the confidentiality of the information based on what amounts to a typographical error or oversight of an intended redaction. Therefore, the clerk is directed to file the amended public version as the public version and place the original public version under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The application for permission to appeal is hereby granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The portions of the trial court's November 1, 2018 order denying the plaintiffs' request to seal the portions of the February 5, 2018 order and November 9, 2017 transcript that reference Jane Doe's medical history are reversed and those portions of the February 5, 2018 order and November 9, 2017 transcript shall be placed under seal. All other provisions of the November 1, 2018 order remain in full effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs' motion to file portions of their application and exhibits under seal is also granted. The unredacted documents that were filed under conditional seal in accordance with Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15 shall remain under seal. Likewise, the original public version of the application shall be placed under seal due to the inadvertent failure to redact all the necessary information. The clerk shall file the amended public version of the application as the public version under Tenn. Ct. App. R. 15(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The costs of this appeal are taxed to the defendants/appellees, jointly and severally.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    This court denied the Tenn. R. App. P. 10 application for an extraordinary appeal in Appeal No. M2018-01611-COA-R10-CV on October 4, 2018, and mandate issued on November 5, 2018. Despite the denial of the application, the issues concerning which documents held by the clerk should be placed under seal remains a live controversy, over which this court has jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Contemporaneously with this opinion, this court is also filing orders in Appeal Nos. M2018-01611-COA-R10-CV, and M2018-01975-COA-R10-CV which arise out of the same case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
