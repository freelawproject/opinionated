The dispositive issue is whether an employer of an obligor has an affirmative duty to determine whether the aggregate amount of wages to be garnished from an obligor's multiple employers exceeds the aggregate disposable earnings limits provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-106\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An employer of the obligor, Blue Shield EMS (\"Blue Shield\"), was served with a garnishment while a pre-existing wage assignment of the obligor's wages from another employer was still in effect. Although none of the obligor's wages from Blue Shield had been previously garnished, Blue Shield filed an answer to the garnishment stating, \"We cannot process any deductions from [the obligor's] paycheck at this time due to his total income already being garnished greater than 25%.\" Upon motion of the obligor's former wife for a conditional judgment, the trial court found that \"Blue Shield did not have a valid legal reason for failing to withhold twenty-five percent (25%) of the employee's net wages\" and ordered Blue Shield to pay into the court the wages that should have been garnished and to honor the garnishment going forward until the judgment was satisfied. Having determined that an employer has no duty to consider the aggregate effect of garnishments served on other employers when answering a garnishment, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pursuant to a Final Decree of Divorce, the appellant, Matthew Davis Kendle (\"Father\"), was ordered to pay spousal support to his former wife, Julie Ann Kendle (\"Mother\"), and child support for the benefit of their minor child. Since the divorce, Father incurred monetary judgments for failure to pay child support and spousal support and for attorney's fees related to the enforcement of a child support order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August 2017, Mother served a garnishment on Blue Shield to satisfy a judgment against Father for attorney's fees incurred due to his failure to pay child support. Blue Shield responded to the garnishment in a letter to the circuit court clerk stating, \"We cannot process any deductions from [Father's] paycheck at this time due to his total income already being garnished greater than 25%.\" Although it is not mentioned in Blue Shield's letter to the clerk, a pre-existing wage assignment of twenty-six percent (26%) on Father's\n   disposable pay from his primary employer, Wilson County Emergency Management Agency (\"WEMA\"), was in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Unaware of Blue Shield's letter to the clerk, Mother filed a Motion for Conditional Judgment against Blue Shield for failing to honor the garnishment. Blue Shield's attorney filed a response, contending his client sent a letter to the circuit court clerk after receiving the garnishment and restating that Father's \"aggregate income to be garnished exceed[ed] the statutory amount of 25%.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the hearing on the motion for the conditional judgment, Father and Blue Shield argued that Blue Shield was precluded from garnishing Father's wages because of the pre-existing wage assignment of approximately 26%, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-5-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-5-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of his earnings from WEMA. They also argued, relying on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-224\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), that the garnishment could not attach to his earnings from Blue Shield concurrently while the pre-existing wage assignment with WEMA remained in effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To support this reasoning, Blue Shield represented to the trial court that it used a business form entitled \"Administrative Wage Garnishment Calculator\" which it obtained from the United States Department of the Treasury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Blue Shield and Father argued that an employer who uses this form is first to calculate the maximum amount of the employee's earnings subject to garnishment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-106\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is the lesser of 25% of the worker's weekly disposable earnings or the amount by which the disposable earnings for that week exceeds thirty (30) times the federal minimum hourly wage at the time the earnings are due. They further claimed that the employer is then to subtract from this amount \"any amounts withheld under other wage withholding orders with priority\" in order to determine the amount the employer should withhold. According to Blue Shield's calculations, 25% of Father's Blue Shield wages (paid biweekly) would be $ 474.07. Father maintained that WEMA was already withholding $ 491.99 from his biweekly earnings from that job. Because $ 474.99 minus $ 491.99 yielded a negative number, Father and Blue Shield contended that Blue Shield could not withhold any of Father's Blue Shield earnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mother disputes the applicability and methodology of the \"Administrative Wage Garnishment Calculator.\" She also contends that the 50% limit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-5-501\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , applies\n   because the judgment to be satisfied by the Blue Shield garnishment regarded a child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the hearing and after finding that \"[w]hatever is being deducted [from Father's wages at WEMA] pursuant to 36-5-501 has nothing to do with this entity of Blue Shield Ambulance,\" the trial court entered an order stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2.

Blue Shield does not challenge the trial court's order and is not a party to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Father's issue, as we have rephrased it, is whether a garnishee has an affirmative duty to consider all wages the obligor earns from other employers, as well as the amount of wages being withheld by those employers, to determine whether its garnishment will result in withholdings that exceed the aggregate disposable earnings limits provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-106\">\n    Tenn.

Statutory interpretation is a matter of law, which this court reviews de novo with no presumption of correctness accorded to the trial court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Hayes v. Gibson County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301330\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/288/334/#p337\">\n    288 S.W.3d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (Tenn. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When interpreting a statute, our primary task is to ascertain and carry out the General Assembly's intent.\n   <em>\n    Osborn v.

If\n   the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we consider \"the natural and ordinary meaning of the statutory language,\" and in doing so, we try to avoid a forced interpretation that would broaden or restrict the statute's meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286855\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/127/737/#p740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, as our Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   When courts are attempting to resolve a statutory ambiguity, the rules of statutory construction authorize them to consider matters beyond the text of the statute being construed. The courts may consider, among other things, public policy, historical facts preceding or contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute being construed, and the background and purpose of the statute. The courts may also consider earlier versions of the statute, the caption of the act, the legislative history of the statute and the entire statutory scheme in which the statute appears.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. DUTIES OF AN EMPLOYER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Contrary to Father's contentions, Tennessee's statutory scheme does not place an affirmative duty on an employer to consider any wages the obligor employee earns from other employers or the amount of wages being withheld by those employers. This is significant because garnishment is purely a statutory proceeding and is in derogation of the common law.\n   <em>\n    General Truck Sales, Inc. v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8528351\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/208/51/\">\n    208 Tenn. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20S.W.2d%20884\">\n    343 S.W.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 885 (1961) ;\n   <em>\n    Third Nat'l Bank v.

Ct. App. May 14, 1986). Moreover, as this court noted years ago while identifying the duties of the garnishee, \"[o]ur statutes creating the [garnishment] proceeding and giving it direction are found in T.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 26-2-201 et seq.\"\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%205548\">\n    1986 WL 5548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Thus, a garnishee has no duty unless such a duty is set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026-2-201\">\n    Tenn.

This is evident from the plain reading of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-202\">\n    Tenn.
