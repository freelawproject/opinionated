Michael Swiney, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Amy Elizabeth Luker (\"Petitioner\"), asserting she was raped, obtained an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection against her husband Terry Eugene Luker (\"Respondent\") in the Chancery Court for Williamson County (\"the Trial Court\"). Respondent asked for time to conduct discovery before the hearing on whether to extend the order of protection. The Trial Court permitted Respondent to subpoena certain records but otherwise ruled he had no right to conduct discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. After a hearing, the Trial Court ruled in favor of Petitioner and extended the order of protection. Respondent appeals, arguing principally that the Trial Court erred in blocking discovery and in excluding Respondent's proposed witnesses. We affirm the Trial Court in its decision regarding the witnesses. However, we hold that the Trial Court erred in determining categorically that Respondent had no right to conduct discovery. We vacate and remand for a new hearing. On remand, the parties shall state specifically what discovery if any they want and the Trial Court is to exercise its discretion in deciding what limited discovery to allow and the time frame. The\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection shall remain in effect in the interim. We affirm, in part, and vacate, in part, the judgment of the Trial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2017, Petitioner and Respondent were in the midst of divorce proceedings. The two continued to reside together in the marital residence, albeit in different rooms. Following the signing of the marital dissolution agreement, the divorcing couple had consensual sexual relations some number of times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The event giving rise to this appeal occurred on November 14, 2017, when Petitioner alleges she was raped by Respondent. The two parties put forward contrasting accounts of what happened. Respondent's theory of the case throughout has been that there was no rape and that Petitioner and her sister conspired to set him up. In Respondent's account, he and Petitioner had consensual sex and afterward, when Respondent denied Petitioner's request for money, she flew into a rage and accused him of rape. According to Petitioner, she did not want to have sex with Respondent on this occasion and expressed this to him, but he proceeded to rape her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 16, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition for order of protection in the Trial Court. A temporary,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection was entered against Respondent. The case was set for December 1. On November 30, 2017, Respondent filed a motion to continue in order to request discovery. The Trial Court entered an order granting Respondent's motion in part, stating as pertinent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   After argument by counsel and review of the record as whole, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Husband's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Continue Hearing\n   </em>\n   on the express grounds of due process. While the Court understands the legislative intent to provide domestic abuse victims with enhanced protection which includes expedient and summary hearings under the Domestic Abuse Act, the Court finds that Husband needs additional time to marshal his defense and proof for this proceeding and issue subpoenas. In balancing these competing interests, the Court finds that it should grant Husband a brief continuance\n   in this matter but denies his request to conduct discovery in these proceedings prior to final hearing on Wife's\n   <em>\n    Petition for Order of Protection and Order for Hearing.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Husband's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Continue Hearing.\n   </em>\n   Wife's hearing on\n   <em>\n    Petition for Order of Protection and Order for Hearing\n   </em>\n   is continued until December 21, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. Husband, however, does not have the right to conduct discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure during this continuance and shall conduct no depositions and issue no interrogatories, requests for production, or requests for admission to Wife. The Court's\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Order of Protection\n   </em>\n   previously issued on November 16, 2017, shall remain in full force and effect pending further order of this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 8, 2017, the Trial Court conducted a telephonic hearing regarding the scope of subpoenas. The Trial Court entered an order stating, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. Respondent can subpoena Petitioner to bring to the December 21, 2017, hearing the following items: copies of all written communications between Petitioner and her sisters for the time period of June 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, written communications to include emails, texting, messaging, notes and letters; copies of all written communications with law enforcement regarding the allegations contained in the\n   <em>\n    Petitioner's Order of Protection and Order for Hearing\n   </em>\n   , written communications to include emails, texting, messaging, notes and letters; a copy of Petitioner's call logs for the time period of June 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017; and a copy of the recording referenced by Petitioner in her\n   <em>\n    Order of Protection and Order for Hearing.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Counsel for the parties shall meet at the Court prior to the hearing in order for counsel for the Petitioner to give counsel for the Respondent the above referenced items so she may review the same and so as not to cause delay of the hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. Petitioner may file a written motion to appeal this Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 18, 2017, Petitioner filed a motion to quash, arguing that the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 45.02 was an improper means for seeking documents or digital files from an opposing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 21, this case was heard on its merits. As an initial matter, the Trial Court denied Petitioner's motion to quash. Respondent made an oral motion to dismiss on the basis that his counsel had only two hours before the hearing to review an hour and a half recording (consisting of the parties speaking after the incident) as well as call logs. Respondent also alleged that Petitioner failed to produce all the subpoenaed material. The Trial Court denied Respondent's motion to dismiss and the hearing proceeded. Respondent and Petitioner both testified to their different accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Respondent proposed calling as additional witnesses: (1) an appraiser and his wife who were scheduled to come to the marital residence later in the morning on the day of the incident for the purpose of demonstrating that Respondent would not invite company over if he intended to rape his wife; and, (2) Respondent's therapist, for the purpose of shedding light on Respondent's mental state. The Trial Court declined to allow these proposed witnesses to testify, concluding that the appraiser and his wife could add nothing relevant and that the therapist's testimony did not fit under a hearsay exception. The Trial\n   Court did, however, hear statements from the therapist in the form of an offer of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Trial Court found in favor of Petitioner and extended the order of protection. In January 2018, the Trial Court entered its order on the extension, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This matter came to be heard on December 21, 2017 before the Honorable Robert E. Lee Davies for a final hearing on Amy Luker's (hereinafter \"Wife\")\n   <em>\n    Petition for Order of Protection.\n   </em>\n   After preliminary argument by counsel and review of the record as whole, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Wife's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Quash\n   </em>\n   the December 8, 2017 subpoena issued by Terry Eugene Luker (hereinafter \"Husband\") and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Husband's oral motion to dismiss with prejudice. Following a hearing on the merits, argument of counsel, testimony and cross-examination of Wife, Husband, and Catherine Mosley [Petitioner's sister], and a review of the record as a whole, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that on the morning of November 14, 2017 Husband committed an act of sexual assault on Wife and therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Wife's\n   <em>\n    Petition for Order of Protection\n   </em>\n   extending the order of protection for a period of one (1) year pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support thereof, the Court finds as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. The Parties have a complicated relationship in which Wife clearly loves her husband and Husband clearly cares for Wife. For whatever reason, however, Husband continued to have affairs which has made the Parties' relationship very complicated and contributed to the breakup of their marriage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. In the context of their divorce proceedings, the Parties have entered into and signed a\n   <em>\n    Marital Dissolution Agreement\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Permanent Parenting Plan\n   </em>\n   as a result of a mediation that took place on October 23, 2017. At that point, the Parties were still very torn and upset by following through on the divorce and held conflicting feelings for each other. Even though they had agreed to formally part ways, they continued to have sexual relations after signing the\n   <em>\n    Marital Dissolution Agreement.\n   </em>\n   The Court finds it immaterial whether the Parties had such relations only twice, as testified to by Wife, or up to six times, as testified to by Husband. Regardless, the Court finds that those instances of sexual relations were consensual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. On November 13, 2017, the testimony and evidence show that Wife may have been upset with Husband concerning his alleged continued communication with a co-worker with whom he had previously had an affair. The Court finds, however, that Wife was really upset concerning certain aspects of the divorce decree and especially her obligation for the final amount of her attorney's fees which were more than initially anticipated as well as other costs incidental to the divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4. While Wife was upset with Husband concerning these matters, the Court finds that Wife was primarily upset with her former counsel, regarding her representation of her. As a result of Wife's frustration with her former attorney, she sent her an email sometime after 6:30 p.m. on the evening of November 13, 2017 while Husband was absent from the marital residence taking care of his grandchildren. The Court finds that this email was logical and well-reasoned and that Wife raises what she believes were legitimate concerns about why her final bill was so high. The Court does not believe that this email was written by a\n   woman out of control as contended by Husband.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   5. Later on the night of November 13, 2017, there is no dispute that the Parties temporarily reconciled. As a result, the Parties resolved any differences they may have had at that particular point. That night, after Husband laid down on his bed, Wife sat down on the side of the bed and they had a civil discussion, at the conclusion of which Wife left to sleep in her separate bedroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   6. On the morning of November 14, 2017, Wife woke up when hearing Husband leave the house. As a result, Wife sent Husband an innocuous text message saying \"You didn't say goodbye.\" The Court places no weight on the fact that Wife sent this message, finding it neither supports or diminishes either of the Parties' positions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   7. Husband returned to the marital residence that morning, entered Wife's separate bedroom uninvited, and got into bed with Wife. The Court finds that Husband entered the bedroom uninvited, but that Wife did not tell Husband \"no\" when Husband got into bed with her. At this point, Husband tried to initiate sexual relations with Wife. The Court finds that there was not anything wrong with this initial interaction at that point considering the circumstances that the Parties were living in up to that point in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   8. Wife, however, at that point objected to Husband's sexual advances, and Husband did not stop. There was a gradual sexual progression by Husband, and, even though Wife repeatedly protested, Husband did not stop. Husband eventually took off Wife's clothes against her will, and forced himself upon her, and the Court finds that Husband sexually assaulted Wife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   9. The Court finds that there was no conspiracy to fabricate this event as alleged by Husband between Wife and her sister, Catherine Mosley, whom the Court finds to be credible in all respects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Wife's\n   <em>\n    Petition for Order of Protection\n   </em>\n   extending the order of protection for a period of one (1) year from the date of final hearing pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n    Tenn.

This order, however, shall have no effect on the Parties' October 23, 2017\n   <em>\n    Permanent Parenting Plan.\n   </em>\n   To that end, under this protective order Husband shall be permitted to communicate with Wife via text and email only on issues pertaining to their son.... Likewise, the Court places no restriction on Husband's ability to communicate freely with [his son] and places no restrictions on Husband's ability to be around his son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. Husband shall not possess firearms of any kind during the duration of this order of protections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   3. Wife shall turn over to Husband possession of the Parties' marital residence.... no later than 5:00 p.m. December 22, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   4. Wife is awarded a judgment [in the amount of $ 9,450.00]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for which execution may issue for her attorney's fees associated with the filing, issuance, hearing, obtaining, and enforcing the ex parte order of protection and petition for order of protection in an amount to be determined pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-617\">\n    Tenn.

Should Husband have objection to the requested fees, he shall file the same with the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Footnote added). Respondent timely appealed to this Court. Respondent filed a motion in the Trial Court to stay execution on the judgment for attorney's fees, which was granted by the Trial Court pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We restate and consolidate, as dispositive, the issues Respondent raises on appeal as follows: 1) whether the Trial Court erred in excluding certain of Respondent's proposed witnesses; and, 2) whether the Trial Court erred in denying categorically Respondent's request for discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. Petitioner raises her own issue of whether, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-617\">\n    Tenn.

Respondent asserts these witnesses were excluded wrongly: (1) an appraiser and his wife; (2) Respondent's therapist; and (3) a police detective who worked on the case. Respondent submits that his substantial right to put on proof under Tenn. R. Evid. 103(a) was affected by these exclusions. Initially, we observe that the Trial Court did not exclude the police detective because Respondent never actually offered her as a witness, so we may dispense with that aspect of Respondent's argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With respect to the appraiser and his wife, Respondent argues that his inviting them over suggests, somehow, that he did not rape Petitioner because he would not be amenable to having guests over after a rape. Laying aside the dubious assumptions there, no one disputes that the appraiser and his wife were scheduled to come over. Petitioner concedes this. It would be pointless for the appraiser and his wife to testify that they were scheduled to show up when that is an uncontroverted fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Regarding Respondent's therapist, the Trial Court heard her statements as an offer of proof. Respondent states that the therapist could corroborate his existing mental, physical, and emotional condition regarding the parties' sex life. The Trial Court ruled this was hearsay and did not fit under the hearsay exception at Tenn. R. Evid. 803(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent makes no argument\n   on appeal as to how the Trial Court erred as it relates to this rule, which was the basis for the Trial Court's decision. We, therefore, affirm the Trial Court in its exclusion of Respondent's proposed witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We next address whether the Trial Court erred in denying categorically Respondent's request for discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. Respondent essentially argues that he was rushed into a hearing without adequate time or opportunity to develop his case. Petitioner, in response, argues that the Domestic Abuse Act contemplates quick, summary proceedings for the benefit of victims, and that allowing ordinary discovery would undermine that goal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n    Tenn.

Thus, the general assembly intends that the official response to domestic abuse shall stress enforcing the laws to protect the victim and prevent further harm to the victim, and the official response shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior is not excused or tolerated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kite v.

The issue in\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   was whether the ten day time period in which a hearing must be conducted after service of\n   an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection was jurisdictional or simply intended to limit the duration of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The respondent argued that when a hearing was not conducted within ten days as required by the statute, the trial court was divested of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n    at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner argued that when a hearing was not conducted within ten days of service, the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order expired but the trial court retained jurisdiction and could still issue an order of protection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Our Supreme Court, after quoting the legislative intent set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-618\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   concluded that the legislative intent of the statute was to (1) provide enhanced protection to the victims of domestic abuse; (2) promote uniform law enforcement intervention regardless of whether the crime was domestic or committed by strangers; and (3) communicate a position of intolerance to domestic abuse perpetrators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 805. In determining that the ten day time period in which to conduct a hearing was not jurisdictional, our Supreme Court stated that the legislature's use of the term \"enhanced protection\" in Tenn. Code Ann \u00a7 36-3-618 was significant. The Court then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The present statute mandates a hearing within ten days of service of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   protective order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The ten-day period, therefore, commences upon the service of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   protective order on the respondent. If\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   relief is not granted, commencement of the ten-day period will not be triggered. Accordingly, the legislative mandate of a hearing within ten days is applicable only when\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   relief has been issued. We find it illogical that the legislature intended to create a jurisdictional bar to be applied exclusively to those petitioners demonstrating cause, immediate and present danger of abuse, for\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   relief.... We shall interpret the legislature's intention of the ten-day requirement consistent with their stated policy of providing enhanced protection.... The prompt hearing requirement limits the potential for abuse by protecting respondents from possible ongoing frivolous or retaliatory\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   protective orders. The ten day hearing requirement is, therefore, merely a limitation on the duration of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   protective order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196957\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/803/\">\n    22 S.W.3d at 805-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As opposed to the scenario in\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   , Respondent does not argue that the Trial Court lost jurisdiction because the hearing was conducted after the statutory time limit of 15 days. In fact, Respondent seeks additional time in which to conduct discovery pursuant to the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure and accepts that the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection will remain in effect until the hearing because the delay is at his request. Petitioner argues in response that a trial court is forced to make the difficult choice to either conduct a hearing within 15 days, ready or not, or delay the hearing beyond 15 days and let the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order dissolve leaving the alleged domestic abuse victim with no court-ordered protection. For reasons we will discuss, we disagree with Petitioner that a trial court is forced by the statute into such a choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the present case, the Trial Court attempted to find a middle ground. The Trial Court extended, impermissibly in Petitioner's eyes, the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection for 20 days. However, the Trial Court restricted discovery to the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 45.02. Petitioner argues that Tenn. R. Civ. P. 34 is the appropriate\n   method for obtaining documents from an opposing party all while agreeing with the Trial Court that Respondent has no right to avail himself of any discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 34. Meanwhile, Respondent protests the categorical denial of his right to the full range of discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. Neither party was satisfied with the compromise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The end result, unfortunately, was a rushed hearing. Perhaps the most illustrative problem with this case is that Respondent's counsel had two hours before the hearing to review a one and a half hour recording, along with call logs produced pursuant to the subpoena duces tecum. We believe it impractical to expect a lawyer to review call logs and listen to a one and a half hour recording two hours before a hearing and be adequately prepared for that hearing. What if the recording or call logs opens additional lines of inquiry? What if there is a problem with the audio, requiring multiple attempts to hear? This simply was not meaningful discovery. Had Petitioner's position on appeal been adopted and the case was slotted arbitrarily into a 15 day window, Respondent never would have had an opportunity to review the evidence at all. We cannot accept that the General Assembly, or the\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   court, envisioned this sort of detrimental haste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The 15 day limit for\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders of protection under the Domestic Abuse Act and\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   is, in our judgment, designed to protect a respondent and not a petitioner. As stated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he prompt hearing requirement limits the potential for abuse by protecting respondents from possible ongoing frivolous or retaliatory\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   protective orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196957\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/803/\">\n    22 S.W.3d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After all, upon service of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection, a petitioner already has what he or she wants-immediate court ordered protection from the alleged offender. \"The legislature apparently inserted this requirement [the then ten-day hearing requirement] to insure a prompt hearing to determine the validity and necessity of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196957\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/803/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the statutory dissolution of that\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order after 15 days serves to help only a respondent by expediting the matter and allowing him or her to bring a speedy resolution of the petition. We, however, see no barrier under the Domestic Abuse Act to a respondent, such as in this case, requesting that the hearing be put off for some definite and limited period of time so he or she can request reasonable discovery, subject to the trial court's management, with the proviso that the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection remains in place until that hearing. In other words, the 15 day limit to an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection may not be used offensively to ambush a respondent, the very party the 15 day limit is intended to protect. What cannot be forgotten is that prior to the hearing to determine whether the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order is to be dissolved or extended, a respondent is accused of being but is not yet found to be an abuser. Consistent with the Domestic Abuse Act and\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   , it is only a respondent who has the ability to request that the hearing be postponed to allow for discovery with the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection remaining in effect. A petitioner cannot extend the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection beyond the 15 day limit by requesting discovery. However, if the 15 day period is extended and the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order remains in effect because of a request for discovery by a respondent, a petitioner likewise is allowed reasonable discovery as determined by a trial court in its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nothing in our research supports the proposition that discovery under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure is\n   prohibited in order of protection cases. The Trial Court had the discretion to manage discovery but did not exercise its discretion. Rather, the Trial Court concluded summarily that Respondent had no right to conduct discovery pursuant to the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, which we hold was error. Our holding comports with\n   <em>\n    Kite\n   </em>\n   and the Domestic Abuse Act in that it ensures continuity of enhanced protection for the alleged victim while also preventing the kind of frantic case disposition seen here. While not a criminal matter, an order of protection exposes a respondent to an array of restrictions, including severe limitations on his or her Second Amendment rights. A respondent deserves a meaningful due process opportunity to present his or her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We, therefore, vacate the judgment of the Trial Court extending the order of protection against Respondent. We remand for a new hearing. On remand, the Trial Court is to exercise its discretion to determine the parameters of discovery. The parties must state what discovery, if any, they want. The Trial Court then must exercise its discretion as to what discovery to allow and the time frame. In the meantime, the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection shall remain in effect through the new hearing, at which point it will be dissolved or extended. We take absolutely no view as to the underlying merits of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The final issue we address is Petitioner's issue of whether she should be awarded her attorney's fees and costs incurred in defending this appeal. Regarding attorney's fees and costs for domestic abuse victims,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-617\">\n    Tenn.
