This Court holds the circuit court's order was appealable pursuant to sections 515.665 and 512.020(2), RSMo 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court further holds the circuit court's order did not have to be denominated a judgment pursuant to Rule 74.01(a) for an appeal to be taken because it was an interlocutory order that did not fully resolve at least one claim and did not establish all of the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to that claim. The case is retransferred to the Southern District for it to review the underlying merits of the circuit court's order as asserted in Maple Grove's remaining points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In October 2011, Maple Grove was formed for the purpose of owning and operating a dairy farm in Barry County, Missouri. Meadowfresh Solutions USA, LLC (hereinafter, \"Meadowfresh\") was formed simultaneously to own a majority membership in Maple Grove. Meadowfresh subsequently sued Maple Grove and sought the appointment of a receiver for Maple Grove. The circuit court sustained Meadowfresh's motion. Maple Grove filed a \"Motion for Order Revoking, or in the Alternative, Modifying and Changing Interlocutory Order Appointing Receiver.\" The circuit court issued an order overruling Maple Grove's motion. This order was not denominated a judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Maple Grove filed a timely notice of appeal, relying on section 515.665, which provides, \"Orders of the court pursuant to sections 515.500 to 515.665 are appealable to the extent allowed under existing law, including subdivision (2) of section 512.020.\" Section 512.020(2) explicitly permits an aggrieved party to appeal any \"[o]rder refusing to revoke, modify, or change an interlocutory order appointing a receiver....\" The Southern District dismissed Maple Grove's appeal, finding the circuit court's order overruling Maple Grove's motion to revoke the receivership appointment was not denominated a judgment pursuant to Rule 74.01(a).

Maple Grove urges this Court to adopt a \"substance over form\" analysis that would require an examination of the content, substance, and effect of the circuit court's order to determine whether it constitutes a judgment before requiring it to be denominated as such for purpose of appeal. Maple Grove maintains such an examination reveals the circuit court's order was interlocutory and, therefore, did not need to be denominated a judgment before an appeal could be taken pursuant to sections 515.665 and 512.020(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court recently clarified the \"persistent confusion surrounding the issues of what a judgment is, what form it takes, and when it is entered.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

(Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By contrast, an interlocutory order \"is an order that is not final and decides some point or matter between the commencement and the end of a suit but does not resolve the entire controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Buemi v.

Accordingly, because it does not fully resolve one claim or establish all of the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to that claim per\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court's order cannot constitute a judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meadowfresh argues this Court is bound by its decision in\n   <em>\n    Spiece v.

This Court held section 512.020 must be read in conjunction with Rule 74.01(a), which states, \" 'Judgment' as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.

Requiring the circuit court to inaccurately label its clearly interlocutory order as a judgment for the sole purpose of allowing Maple Grove to perfect an appeal, which is authorized expressly by two different statutes, defies reason and elevates form over substance.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Spiece\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   are overruled to the extent they are inconsistent with this opinion.
