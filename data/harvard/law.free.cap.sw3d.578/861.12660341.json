Bechtol appeals his conviction following a jury trial on the class D felony of rape in the second degree. Bechtol asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his requests to exclude the victim from the courtroom during trial. Because a formal, published decision would serve no jurisprudential purpose, we affirm Bechtol's conviction by summary order. A\n   memorandum explaining our decision has been provided to the parties. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
