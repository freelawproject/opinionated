Heather Miller, a certified nursing assistant employed by Defendants, provided care for Deceased while Deceased was a resident under Defendants' care.

In her deposition, Ms. Miller testified that defendant's employee, Ms. Jennifer Solomon, insisted that the fall occurred earlier and that Ms. Miller should change her statement.
