Movant was convicted, following a jury trial, of one count of forcible rape, in violation of Section 566.030 RSMo.; one count of incest, in violation of Section 568.020 RSMo.; and four counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, in violation of\n   Section 566.062 RSMo. Movant was sentenced as a prior and persistent offender to two consecutive life terms, one concurrent seven-year term, and three concurrent life terms of imprisonment in the Missouri Department of Corrections. This Court affirmed those convictions on appeal in\n   <em>\n    State v.
