Russell, Judge\n   D.C.M. appeals a judgment of the circuit court finding he committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the felony of making a terrorist threat in the second degree in violation of section 574.120.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evidence adduced at the adjudication hearing demonstrated D.C.M. was sitting in the school cafeteria talking to another student, Jonathan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   when D.C.M. stated he felt like \"blowing the school up\" or wanted to see how it feels to \"shoot the school up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   D.C.M. argues his attorney (\"Counsel\") was ineffective in representing him in the juvenile proceeding by failing to investigate and call Jonathan to testify at the adjudication hearing. He also argues the circuit court abused its discretion in denying Counsel's request for a continuance to subpoena Jonathan. Finally, he argues the circuit court lacked sufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the felony of making a terrorist threat in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Counsel's request for a continuance, and, further, when viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, there was sufficient evidence for the circuit court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that D.C.M. committed an act, which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the felony of making a terrorist threat in the second degree. The record is insufficient, however, to determine whether Counsel was ineffective. As a result, these claims cannot be addressed on direct appeal. The case is remanded to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Counsel was ineffective. In all other aspects, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   D.C.M. was a 16-year-old high school student with autism, when the juvenile officer in Pemiscot County filed a petition against him. The petition alleged he had committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the felony of making a terrorist threat in the second degree, and, as a result, he was subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile division. Evidence adduced at the adjudication hearing demonstrated that D.C.M. was sitting in the high school cafeteria when another student, Tamara, overheard D.C.M. tell a classmate, Jonathan, \"I feel like blowing the school up.\" A student named Zachary testified he heard D.C.M. say that \"he wanted to see how it feels like to blow up the school and wanted - shooting up the school.\" Zachary further testified, \"He said that he might do it tomorrow, the day - same day at - He said he's going to do it tomorrow.\" After hearing D.C.M.'s comments, Tamara left the cafeteria and told the school principal. The principal called the police, and the staff isolated\n   D.C.M. in a classroom until law enforcement officers arrived. Officers then took D.C.M. to the juvenile office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Police interviewed D.C.M., who denied making any threatening statements and said he was only joking. Police also interviewed Jonathan. The police report provided, \"Jonathan stated that he did not recall [D.C.M.] making any threats or statements but that he didn't doubt it. [Jonathan] stated that [D.C.M.] has made racial comments towards other students but that he had not heard [D.C.M.] make any statements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The juvenile officer filed a petition, and an adjudication hearing was held 12 days later. The juvenile officer called seven witnesses: four students, a police officer, and two school principals. Two witnesses, Tamara and Zachary, testified they heard D.C.M. make the threatening statements. D.C.M. testified he did not make any threatening statements and said the other witnesses were lying. Counsel then requested a continuance to subpoena Jonathan as well as two other students, Joshua and Marcus, who were also sitting at the table with D.C.M. The juvenile officer objected, asserting Counsel had access to the police report that named all of the witnesses and, therefore, had a sufficient opportunity to obtain the witnesses' presence at the hearing. The circuit court denied the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the evidence presented at the adjudication hearing, the circuit court continued jurisdiction over D.C.M. and placed him in the custody of the division of youth services for an indefinite term.

If a case is moot, this Court can exercise its discretion to decide the case on the merits if one of two narrow exceptions to the mootness doctrine exist: \"(1) when a case becomes moot after submission and argument; and (2) when the issue raised is one of general public interest and importance, recurring in nature, and will otherwise evade appellate review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

While D.C.M. recently turned 18 and has since been released from supervision, a record of his adjudication would remain. Juvenile records for offenses that would be felonies if committed by an adult are open to the public to the extent criminal proceeding records are open to the public. Section 211.321.2(2). The offense of making a terrorist threat in the second degree is such a felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section 574.120.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question whether an appeal of a case in which a juvenile has been released from supervision implicates the mootness doctrine is one of first impression for this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a case factually analogous to the one here, but in a criminal context, this Court addressed the merits of an adult's appeal of his conviction despite that he had been pardoned.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the pardon allowed him not to serve his sentence, the appeal was not moot because the underlying conviction remained on his record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323688\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/348/258/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   emphasized that an individual should have the opportunity \"to remove the discredit and stigma flowing from the judgment of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323688\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/348/258/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, if convicted of another crime in the future,\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   recognized the defendant would be subject to greater penalties due to his prior conviction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323688\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/348/258/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, this Court concluded the case was not moot because there was \"still a substantial element of controversy existing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323688\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/348/258/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , D.C.M. should be given the opportunity to remove the discredit and stigma associated with his record of adjudication. Even though D.C.M. has been released from supervision, his conduct would have constituted a felony had he been an adult at the time he committed the act. If D.C.M. is tried in the future for a criminal offense, evidence of this prior juvenile adjudication could be introduced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.B.A.\n   </em>\n   , 530 S.W.3d at 620. For these reasons, this case is not moot, as addressing this appeal would have a practical effect on an existing controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardner\n   </em>\n   , 561 S.W.3d at 394. Accordingly, this Court will review the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.C.M. argues that he had a due process right to the effective assistance of counsel in his juvenile proceeding and that Counsel violated this right when he failed to investigate and call Jonathan to testify, as well as when Counsel elicited and failed to object to certain testimony. The State recognizes juveniles have a due process right to effective assistance of counsel under Missouri law but argues D.C.M. cannot raise these claims on direct appeal and, even if he could raise these claims, Counsel did not provide ineffective assistance. The issue of what procedure should be followed when reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims in juvenile cases is a question of law that receives\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grado v.

D.C.M. encourages this Court to address the claims on direct appeal. The State, on the other hand, argues direct appeal is a \"suboptimal path\" for juveniles to raise ineffective assistance claims, suggesting the legislature should adopt a statutory procedure or this Court should adopt a rule setting forth a procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When deciding whether claims for ineffective assistance of counsel can be addressed on direct appeal, the pertinent question is whether the record is sufficient to address the claim. Considering the sufficiency of the record when determining whether ineffective assistance of counsel claims can be addressed on direct appeal is consistent with the approach taken by this Court in termination of parental rights and sexually violent predator cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of C.M.B.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321504\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/332/793/\">\n    332 S.W.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 820 n.22 (Mo. banc 2011) (clarifying that ineffective assistance of counsel claims could be addressed on direct appeal when such claims could be sufficiently evaluated on the record),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.S.S. v.

In each of these scenarios, the record is likely to be incomplete with respect to the claim of ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   D.C.M. alleges Counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and call Jonathan to testify. The record is clear Jonathan was sitting next to and talking with D.C.M. when D.C.M. allegedly made the threatening statement. Despite having access to the police report detailing Jonathan's interview with the police, Counsel called no witnesses other than D.C.M. and was unaware that Jonathan was a potential witness until the day of the hearing, indicating Counsel failed to consider the police report. When asking for a continuance to subpoena Jonathan as well as two other students sitting at the table with D.C.M., Joshua and Marcus, Counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Your Honor, [D.C.M.] has provided names of a Joshua [ ], a Jonathan [ ] and a Marcus somebody that was at his table, and I wasn't provided that information and wasn't provided any opportunity, if I could, to subpoena these people to testify. I would like to have some opportunity to have them present, Your Honor, since he's denied the fact that [Zachary] was - was not at his table, but he does testify that a Joshua [ ], a Jonathan [ ], and a Marcus or Demetrius or whoever - whatever his name was, was also at the table.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The record is silent, however, regarding what Jonathan's testimony would have been or whether Jonathan was able to be located by D.C.M.'s attorney. While the police report provides some indication as to what Jonathan's testimony might have been, Jonathan's statements were not under oath, and the report is not a substitute for sworn testimony in court. Had Jonathan been located, his testimony could have unequivocally supported D.C.M.'s defense, as the police report indicated that Jonathan did not hear D.C.M. make a threatening statement. But it is also possible Jonathan's testimony could have cast doubt on D.C.M.'s defense, as the police report further reflects Jonathan stated he \"wouldn't doubt\" D.C.M. made threatening statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Jonathan also told police he was aware D.C.M. had made racial comments toward other students. This statement directly conflicts with D.C.M.'s testimony that he never made racial comments and would not be beneficial to D.C.M. \"If a potential witness's testimony would not unqualifiedly support a defendant, the failure to call such a witness does not constitute ineffective assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Worthington v.

During the adjudication proceedings, seven witnesses, including four students, testified against D.C.M. Each of the students testified they heard D.C.M. threatening to blow up the school or overheard him make alarming threats of violence. Many of the students testified D.C.M. frequently made derogatory racial statements, and the evidence suggested the racial makeup of the school was the reason D.C.M. sought to commit violence at the school. D.C.M. testified and denied making any threatening statements or inappropriate racial comments. Another student, Jonathan, was not called to testify although he was alleged to be present when D.C.M. made the threat to blow up the school. According to a police report, Jonathan stated he did not specifically remember D.C.M. making a threatening statement but \"he didn't doubt it\" based on his previous interactions with D.C.M. Jonathan also stated D.C.M. made racially derogatory comments toward other students.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    After hearing all the evidence, the circuit court found credible the seven witnesses who testified against D.C.M. but D.C.M.'s testimony completely lacking in credibility. Despite these credibility determinations, D.C.M. alleges on appeal that his adjudication delinquency was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. D.C.M. alleges his counsel was ineffective for two reason. First, he claims his counsel failed to investigate and call Jonathan to testify. Second, D.C.M. alleges his counsel elicited and then failed to object to certain irrelevant testimony.

He was new to the high school because he had been suspended at his old high school for the remaining days of the previous school year for threatening a teacher and student.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    On the fifth day of school at his new high school, D.C.M. got on the school bus and started discussing a recent school shooting in Florida before he said, \"I wonder how it feels to shoot somebody.\" At lunch that day, D.C.M. said, \"I feel like blowing the school up\" and also discussed shooting up the school. He told a student sitting at his table it was because there were too many black people at the school. Students at the table next to D.C.M.'s overheard his threat and reported them to the high school principal. The principal called the police and made sure staff kept D.C.M. in a classroom until police officers arrived. The officers then removed him from the school and took him to the juvenile office.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In his interview with police officers, D.C.M. denied making any threatening statements in the cafeteria. Police officers also interviewed Jonathan, a student sitting at D.C.M.'s table that day, who said he did not specifically remember D.C.M. making the threatening statement but \"he didn't doubt it\" based on his interactions with D.C.M.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The juvenile office filed a delinquency petition and a hearing was held in circuit court\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    12 days later. The juvenile office called seven witnesses: four students, a police officer, and two school principals. Two of the students testified they heard D.C.M. make the threatening statements in the cafeteria from the table next to D.C.M.'s and they did not think it was said in a joking manner. D.C.M. testified that every witness for the juvenile office was lying. Counsel moved for a continuance to subpoena Jonathan and two other students also sitting at D.C.M.'s table, saying he was unaware of these witnesses prior to the proceeding. The circuit court overruled the motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The circuit court expressly found the seven witnesses for the juvenile office to be more credible than D.C.M. and, accordingly, found beyond a reasonable doubt that D.C.M. made the threatening statement in the cafeteria. The circuit court ordered D.C.M. be committed to the division of youth services' custody for an indefinite period. Before his case was argued and submitted to this Court, D.C.M. turned 18 and was released from supervision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     Analysis\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The principal opinion holds this case is not moot because \"D.C.M. should be given the opportunity to remove the discredit and stigma associated with his record of adjudication.\" Op. at 781. \"A case is moot when the question presented for decision seeks a judgment upon some matter which, if the judgment was rendered, would not have any practical effect upon any then existing controversy.\"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Hawley v.

The principal opinion correctly reaffirms there are only \"two narrow exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) when a case becomes moot after submission and argument; and (2) when the issue raised is one of general public interest and importance,\n    recurring in nature, and will otherwise evade appellate review.\"\n    <em>\n     Peters-Baker\n    </em>\n    , 561 S.W.3d at 384-85 (internal citations omitted).\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In my view, D.C.M.'s release from juvenile supervision mooted his case, and neither of the mootness exceptions applies. His release occurred one month\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    submission and argument; therefore, the first exception does not apply. The second exception does not apply either. D.C.M. has an individual interest in not having a future public record of his juvenile delinquency proceedings, but such interest is not of any general public interest and importance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    I concur with the principal opinion that\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n    \"D.C.M. is tried in the future for a criminal offense, evidence of this prior juvenile adjudication\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    be introduced.\" Op. at 781 (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, these hypothetical future collateral consequences are too speculative to support the requirement that there is \"still a substantial element of controversy existing\" to avoid the determination this case is moot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In my view, when D.C.M. turned 18 and was released from the division of youth services' supervision, this case became moot. Additionally, the principal opinion's conclusion opens D.C.M. to the possibility of much graver consequences than a public record of juvenile delinquency. Therefore, the case should be dismissed as moot.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-101\">\n     I concur with the principal opinion in sections I, III, and IV. I also concur with the principal opinion's conclusion in section II that this Court need not determine, in this case, the standard of review for ineffective assistance claims in juvenile delinquency matters and that the review of such claims should be on direct appeal.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-102\">\n     It is vital to point out that D.C.M.'s counsel had only 12 days to prepare for the adjudication hearing due to the Rule 127.08 requirement that adjudication hearings be held \"at the earliest possible date.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-103\">\n     All statutory references are to RSMo 2016, unless otherwise noted.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-104\">\n     Due to D.C.M.'s age at the time of the offense, the circuit court found D.C.M. came \"within the provisions of the Juvenile Code\" and exercised jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 211.031.1(3).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-105\">\n     The principal opinion correctly rejects the notion of prior court of appeals opinions that created an additional exception to the mootness doctrine based on potential collateral consequences of a juvenile adjudication.

Additionally, one of the three potential uncalled witnesses already told police he \"didn't doubt\" that D.C.M. made the threatening statement due to his knowledge of D.C.M.'s character. As the principal opinion highlights, \"[i]f a potential witness's testimony would\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n     unqualifiedly support a defendant, the failure to call such a witness does\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n     constitute ineffective assistance.\"\n     <em>\n      Worthington v. State\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939643\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/166/566/#p577\">\n      166 S.W.3d 566\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 577 (Mo. banc 2005) (emphasis added). In light of the overwhelming evidence against D.C.M., it is unlikely there will be a determination on remand that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-108\">\n     Assuming,\n     <em>\n      arguendo\n     </em>\n     , D.C.M. is determined to have received ineffective assistance of counsel on remand and the judgment is set aside by the circuit court, there is nothing prohibiting the circuit court from certifying D.C.M.-an 18-year old adult-as an adult under \u00a7 211.071.1, which reads in relevant part:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n     If a petition alleges that a child between the ages of twelve and seventeen has committed an offense which would be considered a felony if committed by an adult, the court may, upon its own motion or upon motion by the juvenile officer, the child or the child's custodian, order a hearing and may, in its discretion, dismiss the petition and such child may be transferred to the court of general jurisdiction and prosecuted under the general law[.]\n    </blockquote>\n    <p id=\"p-110\">\n     If D.C.M. is certified as an adult, there is a significant possibility he could receive a felony conviction. The remote possibility that D.C.M.'s juvenile delinquency judgment could be set aside based on ineffective assistance of counsel is not worth the risk that D.C.M. could be certified and tried as an adult. That D.C.M. was not originally certified as an adult and merely received a record of juvenile delinquency would most often be considered a win. In my view, this Court should not take into consideration hypothetical collateral consequences to conclude this case is not moot and turn that win into a loss.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
