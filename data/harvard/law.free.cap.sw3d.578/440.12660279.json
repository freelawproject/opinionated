Michael Swiney, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After ten years of marriage, Karen Gaye Thompson Bounds (\"Wife\") sued Kenneth Newton Bounds (\"Husband\") for divorce. After a trial, the Circuit Court for Bradley County (\"the Trial Court\"),\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , awarded the parties a divorce, divided the marital property and debts, held that the marital residence was Husband's separate property, awarded Wife alimony\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   , and awarded Wife attorney's fees. Husband appeals raising issues regarding the award of alimony and the award of attorney's fees. We find and hold that the Trial Court did not abuse its discretion with regard to the award of alimony or the award of attorney's fees. We, therefore, affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wife and Husband dated for almost two years before they were married in December of 2006. When the parties met, Wife was working as a secretary for a real estate company. By the time of the marriage, Wife was working as a receptionist and legal assistant at a law firm. Approximately six months into the marriage, Wife was laid off from her job through no fault of her own. Wife spent approximately two years searching for a new job, but was unable to obtain one. She then stopped looking for employment. Husband was disabled at the time of the marriage and throughout the marriage and not employed. No children were born of the marriage. In February of 2017 Wife filed for divorce. The case proceeded to trial in October of 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wife testified at trial that she was 67 years old and in good health. She was not working and had not worked since she was laid off early in the marriage. Wife attended graduate school during the 1980s studying English, creative writing, and French literature. Wife agreed that Husband neither dissuaded her from trying to work during the marriage, nor insisted that she needed to work. Wife testified that when she was laid off she received a benefit that became an annuity. She receives $ 286 per month from that annuity and has about 17 years left on the annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wife testified that Husband was not employed when they married. He previously had worked for Norfolk Southern Railroad. Wife testified that Husband has psoriatic arthritis, a bad back, and is hard of hearing. During the marriage Husband had some major back surgery and developed some neuropathy in his extremities. Wife was asked if Husband was in pain\n   during that time period, and she stated: \"Very much so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time of the marriage, Husband owned a house on Mouse Creek that was paid for. Husband sold this house and used the proceeds to purchase a house on Lower Woods Trail, which the parties used as the marital home. The purchase price of the marital home in 2007 was $ 333,000. Wife testified that the house is paid for. Wife's name was put on the deed of the marital residence when it was purchased in May of 2007, and the parties have lived there since the purchase. Wife testified that since moving in to the marital residence, the parties have installed hardwood floors and quartz counter tops and a backsplash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wife agreed that the marital home was paid for with Husband's premarital funds. Wife also agreed that Husband paid for the improvements made to the house during the marriage using his disability income as Wife was not working. Wife testified that they lived on Husband's disability income during the marriage. Wife purchased some decorations for the home, but agreed that she did not really make contributions to the improvements to the house because she did not have much money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wife testified that Husband was very controlling during the marriage. She stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   He fussed about even where I would put stuff on the shelves, the dishes. Where I would shop, where I bought gas. He didn't like the way I folded his towels or the way I made his bed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   He did not like it when I played my piano. I tried to play in the morning because he didn't get up until the afternoon and he would complain that it woke him up. So if I played in the evening he would complain that it was too loud because he was always watching TV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wife received an inheritance of $ 15,000 in February of 2017. Wife has not spent that inheritance as she plans to use it in the future when she needs a new car. Husband also received an inheritance during the marriage, but Wife did not know how much he had received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wife testified that her main source of income is a railroad spousal annuity. Wife started receiving the railroad spousal annuity in 2012. At the time of trial, the railroad spousal annuity paid $ 922 per month, but Wife explained that it will be reduced to $ 645 after the divorce. Wife used the money she received from the railroad spousal annuity to pay off her car. Wife then took the remainder and saved it in her checking account. Wife had saved about $ 27,000 at the time of her deposition, which was taken several months prior to trial. These savings along with the inheritance she received added up to about $ 40,000 in assets that Wife had at the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wife moved into an apartment in March of 2017. She testified that she pays $ 984 per month in rent plus renter's insurance, water, sewage, and taxes. Wife testified that the parties have no credit card debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Husband testified that he was 72 years old at the time of trial. Husband explained that he became disabled in May of 1996 and had been receiving disability income for approximately ten years prior to the marriage. Husband receives railroad retirement disability and a pension. He also has some mutual funds. Husband's monthly income is approximately $ 3,900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Husband testified that he has ulcerative colitis, diabetic neuropathy, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, and significant back problems. He also has eye pain that did not respond to cataract surgery, and he wears hearing aids. Husband underwent a \"spinal fusion front and back.\" He uses a walker or two canes to get around. Husband\n   testified that he is unable to do significant housework and has to pay people to assist him with household chores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Husband testified that he made the decision to purchase the marital home several months after the marriage because the parties \"were kind of tight with her furniture and what I had left,\" despite getting rid of some furniture. Husband testified that he paid a substantial down payment and listed his current home for sale. Because a bridge loan was necessary, Wife's name was put on the deed to the marital house. Husband's former house sold a little less than three months after the purchase of the marital home, and Husband used the proceeds to pay off the bridge loan. Husband used some of the excess funds from the sale to purchase a piano for Wife, pay off Wife's car loan, and pay some other expenses. Husband testified that the marital home was paid for completely with his separate resources. Wife put no money into the marital home. During the year after the purchase of the marital home, the house depreciated in value approximately $ 80,000 due to the housing market and has not appreciated since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Husband testified that at the time of the marriage he owned a house on Saddle Creek Drive, had a 401(k) account, and had some mutual funds. Husband testified that he sold some stock to buy the marital home and pay some expenses. Husband stated that he used $ 150,000 of his separate funds during the marriage \"to get by.\" Husband admitted that during the marriage he probably called Wife a \"stealing gold digger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After trial, the Trial Court entered its Final Decree on November 20, 2017,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   granting the parties a divorce, dividing the marital property and debts, awarding Wife the $ 27,000 in railroad spousal annuity benefits that she had saved, holding that the marital residence was Husband's separate property, and awarding Wife alimony\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   in the amount of $ 100,000. Husband appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although not stated exactly as such, Husband raises two issues on appeal: 1) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding Wife alimony\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   in the amount of $ 100,000; and, 2) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding Wife her attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We first consider whether the Trial Court erred in awarding Wife alimony\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   in the amount of $ 100,000. Our Supreme Court has provided instruction with regard to the standard of review of an award of alimony stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   For well over a century, Tennessee law has recognized that trial courts should be accorded wide discretion in determining matters of spousal support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Carefully adhering to the statutory framework for awarding spousal support, both in terms of awarding the correct type of support and for an appropriate amount and time, fulfills not only the statutory directives but also alimony's fundamental purpose of eliminating spousal dependency where possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Gonsewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317361\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/350/99/#p105\">\n    350 S.W.3d at 107-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In his brief on appeal, Husband argues that the Trial Court failed to \"fully consider\" the two most important factors in making its determination about alimony,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , need and ability to pay. Husband argues that he \"cannot pay the $ 100,000 alimony award without substantially jeopardizing his ability to continue to meet his future daily needs.\" He further asserts that the Trial Court failed to make a finding about Wife's contribution to the marriage. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We begin, as we must as to this discretionary decision made by the Trial Court, by presuming that the Trial Court's decision to award Wife alimony\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   in the amount of $ 100,000 is correct and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the decision. The Trial Court found that Husband was leaving the marriage with approximately $ 952,028 in assets. Wife was leaving the marriage with\n   approximately $ 42,000 in assets. The evidence in the record on appeal shows that Wife has a monthly deficit of approximately $ 1,221 and that Husband has a monthly excess of over $ 800. A careful and thorough review of the record on appeal shows that the Trial Court considered all of the relevant statutory factors when making its decision about alimony. The evidence in the record on appeal, as discussed more fully above, does not preponderate against the Trial Court's findings. As we find no abuse of discretion by the Trial Court, we will not second guess the Trial Court or substitute our judgment for that of the Trial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in awarding Wife her attorney's fees. Our Supreme Court has instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   It is well-settled that an award of attorney's fees in a divorce case constitutes alimony in solido.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-5-121\">\n    Tenn.

App. 1995). As with any alimony award, in deciding whether to award attorney's fees as alimony in solido, the trial court should consider the factors enumerated in Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-121(i). A spouse with adequate property and income is not entitled to an award of alimony to pay attorney's fees and expenses.\n   <em>\n    Umstot v. Umstot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833080\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/968/819/#p824\">\n    968 S.W.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (Tenn. Ct.
