Claimant's mother, Joan Knutter (\"Employee\"), worked for American National Insurance (\"Employer\"). She broke her ankle when she slipped and fell on ice outside of her workplace on March 25, 2013. On May 9, 2013, Employee died following a saddle pulmonary embolism, which related to the immobility that resulted from her workplace injury. Employee's husband, Karl Knutter (\"Husband\"), asserted a claim for dependent benefits. On July 17, 2015, Husband died. After Husband's death, Employee and Husband's son, Michael Knutter (\"Claimant\"), was substituted as the personal representative of Husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Employer raises four points on appeal. Points 1-3 challenge the award as not based on sufficient competent evidence. Point 4 challenges the basis of Claimant's substitution for Husband. Because there was sufficient competent evidence to support the Commission's award, and because Employer's specific challenge to the basis for Claimant's substitution was not raised below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On appeal, this Court reviews the Commission's decision to determine if it is 'supported by competent and substantial evidence upon the whole record.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johme v.

Initially, Employee was given a protective splint and crutches to assist with her non-weight bearing instructions. On April 1, 2013, Employee saw an orthopedic physician, Dr. Robert Bennett (\"Dr. Bennett\"). Dr. Bennett's\n   notes indicated that Employee had \"slipped and put some pressure on [her ankle] since the time of injury\" so he elected to treat her with a short-leg, non-walking cast and a wheelchair was also prescribed. On May 3, 2013, Employee again saw Dr. Bennett. He noted that Employee's previous cast was \"quite loose as her swelling ha[d] decreased\" and her fracture was healing well. Employee received a new short-leg cast, and Dr. Bennett scheduled a follow-up appointment for two weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 9, 2013, Employee experienced shortness of breath while she was sitting on the toilet, and was transported to the Emergency Department by ambulance. She suffered a saddle pulmonary embolism and died the same day. Husband timely asserted a claim for dependent benefits as a relative by marriage of a deceased employee. However, while the underlying claim was still pending, Husband died on July 17, 2015. On July 31, 2015, Claimant filed a \"Motion for Substitution of Party and Suggestion of Death.\" After oral argument before the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), Claimant's motion was granted and Claimant was substituted as Husband's \"only surviving son and personal representative to his estate[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the subsequent hearing on the claim, the ALJ reviewed reports from four different expert doctors as to whether Employee's ankle fracture led to the pulmonary embolism that caused her death. Claimant's experts, Dr. Mitch Mullins (\"Dr. M. Mullins\") and Dr. Thomas Wright (\"Dr. Wright\"), opined that Employee's ankle injury and resulting immobility led to her death by pulmonary embolism. By contrast, Employer's experts, Dr. Randall Cross (\"Dr. Cross\") and Dr. John Randolph Mullins (\"Dr. J. Mullins\"), opined that the exact cause of Employee's pulmonary embolism was unknown and her death could not be directly connected to her ankle fracture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ALJ found in favor of Employer. The Commission, however, reversed the ALJ's decision. In its findings of fact, the Commission stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   We do not dismiss the ALJ's observation that because there was no autopsy, no medical records document the specific location of [Employee's] blood clot or deep vein thrombosis. However, we disagree with the ALJ's conclusion that it is purely speculative to link [Employee's] work-related right ankle injury and her fatal saddle pulmonary. Neither Dr. Cross' identification of a multitude of other risk factors based [on Employee's] medical history and hospital records, nor Dr. J. Mullins' inability to find examples in medical literature of individuals who had ankle fractures and experienced onset of pulmonary embolus while sitting on the toilet, convince us that [Employee's] fatal pulmonary embolism following forty-five days of virtually total immobility due to confinement to a wheelchair immobilization was purely coincidental.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     We find, based on the credible expert medical opinions of Dr. Wright and [Dr. M. Mullins], that the prevailing cause of [Employee's] death was her March 25, 2013, traumatic ankle injury and subsequent immobilization, resulting in venous stasis and ultimately causing her fatal saddle pulmonary embolism.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (emphasis added). The Commission awarded Claimant death benefits due and owed at the time of Husband's death in the amount of $ 43,160.00. The Commission also upheld the substitution of Claimant in place of Husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Employer's points 1-3 contend that the Commission's decision lacks sufficient competent evidence pursuant to \u00a7 287.495.1(4). Specifically, Employer's point 1 contends there is insufficient evidence that Employee was \"virtually totally immobilized\" for 45 days prior to her death, including the time between her May 3 appointment with Dr. Bennett and her death on May 9. Employer's point 2 alleges there is a lack of evidence that Employee's pulmonary embolism originated in her lower extremities that were purportedly immobilized. Employer's point 3 contends there was no expert testimony that Employee's injury was the \"prevailing factor\" in causing her death, or in the alternative, that the expert testimony the Commission relied on was \"inadequate and not based on sufficient facts and data.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By claiming that the Commission's award is not supported by competent and substantial evidence according to \u00a7 287.495.1(4), Employer triggers a specific analytical process, whereby Employer must:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1.

The Commission found these experts to be credible and relied on their opinions when it found that Employee's ankle injury and subsequent immobilization was the \"prevailing factor causing her venous stasis, which led to a saddle pulmonary embolism and death[.]\" As in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Malam\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , we do not require an expert to use \"overly technical\" words to meet the \"prevailing factor\" standard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787423\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/492/926/#p928\">\n    492 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   929 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Treasurer of the State of Mo. v.

App. W.D. 2016) (rejecting claim that \" 'magic words' like 'certify' and 'permanent and total disability' \" were necessary rather than the \"clear and plain import\" of expert's testimony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Furthermore, as to Employer's argument that the opinions of Drs. Wright and M. Mullins were \"not based on sufficient facts or data[,]\" we give deference to the Commission when it resolves conflicts among the medical testimony from different expert witnesses.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cole\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385186\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/308/#p310\">\n    521 S.W.3d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once a doctor's opinion is admitted without objection, as here for the opinions of both Dr. Wright and Dr. M. Mullins, it is \"up to the Commission to assess the credibility of the doctor's testimony and determine what weight to give that evidence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lacy v. Fed.

App. S.D. 2009). In this case the Commission found these doctors to be credible and relied on their opinions. The Commission's award, therefore, was supported by sufficient competent evidence. Employer's point 3 is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to point 4, Employer now argues that the Commission erred under \u00a7 287.495.1(1) and (4) in that it improperly allowed Claimant to be substituted for Husband when there was no evidence that Claimant had opened an estate on behalf of Husband and had been properly named Husband's \"personal representative\" for purposes of \u00a7 287.230. Based on the record provided, this was not the theory that Employer asserted below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After Husband's death in July 2015, Claimant filed a \"Motion for Substitution of Party and Suggestion of Death.\" Employer filed written objections, stating that Employer objected to this substitution because it did not \"believe that Section 287.230 RSMo., provides for such substitution\n   when the alleged dependent dies rather than the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     employee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" Further, Employer stated that \"there is no provision for the substitution of alleged dependents in the workers' compensation law such that [Claimant] can take over the benefits alleged by [Husband] as dependent of [Employee.]\" The ALJ entered an Order with findings and substituted Claimant as Husband's \"only surviving son and personal representative to his estate[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In its appeal to the Commission, Employer asked for the Commission's review on \"[w]hether there was an appropriate substitution of [Claimant] for [Husband].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission considered the ALJ's Order regarding the substitution of Claimant for Husband and upheld the substitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Employer has now objected to Claimant's substitution by stating essentially that there should have been a probate estate established and a personal representative appointed through the probate court. Employer's appellate brief states that proper procedures for determining Claimant's appointment were not followed in that Claimant failed to produce issuance of letters of administration or \"evidence that he administratively opened an estate for [Husband] or that he was properly appointed his personal representative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nothing in the record shows that Employer's argument regarding the proof necessary for substitution of Claimant as Husband's personal representative under \u00a7 287.230 was raised below. \"It has been a longstanding rule that issues that could have been, but were not, raised previously before the Commission cannot be litigated on appeal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Spradling v.
