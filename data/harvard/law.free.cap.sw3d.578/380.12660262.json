The Eoffs allege the circuit court committed reversible error when it refused to allow their counsel additional voir dire time so he could ask the \"insurance question\" after counsel forgot to ask it during his initial voir dire. This Court affirms. The parties do not challenge the\n   holding in\n   <em>\n    Ivy v.

But, in so holding,\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   did not divest the circuit court of its discretion to control the proper timing and form of voir dire questioning, including discretion as to whether counsel's proposed procedure would unduly highlight the question. Here, once the Eoffs' counsel forgot to ask the insurance question during multiple hours of voir dire, the circuit court acted within its discretion in finding it would unduly highlight the question to allow counsel to recommence his questioning to ask it as one of a small number of extra questions after voir dire otherwise had concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Abraham and Crystal Eoff brought a medical negligence claim in St. Louis County against Jennifer K. McDonald, D.O., and Seasons Healthcare for Women P.C. for the wrongful death of their daughter during delivery. Before trial, the Eoffs learned that Missouri Doctors Mutual Insurance Company (MDMIC) provided medical malpractice liability insurance to Dr. McDonald and Seasons Healthcare. MDMIC is a small insurance company with approximately 20 employees, located 50 miles north of Kansas City in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   this Court held that, when one party has insurance, it is reversible error not to permit the other's counsel to ask the venire members whether they work for or have a financial interest in the insurer, so long as counsel asks a proper question in a manner that does not unduly highlight what is generally referred to as \"the insurance question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006874\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/878/442/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 445\n   </em>\n   . In setting out an acceptable method for asking the insurance question,\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   required the plaintiff's counsel first to submit and obtain the circuit court's approval of the form of the proposed question outside of the venire panel's hearing and then to avoid unduly highlighting the question by not asking it first or last in a series of questions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006874\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/878/442/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   before jury selection began, the Eoffs' counsel requested permission to ask the following question: \"Is anyone here employed by or have a financial interest in Missouri Doctors Mutual Insurance Company?\" Opposing counsel had no objection to the question's form, and the circuit court ruled the Eoffs' counsel could ask it during the plaintiffs' voir dire. Thereafter, however, the procedure utilized diverged from that envisioned in\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Eoffs' counsel's voir dire questioning was lengthy, covering 173 pages of the transcript. Of those, 138 pages covered the period from mid-morning through the noon lunch break and up to an afternoon break, when the circuit court told the Eoffs' counsel he needed to \"wrap it up\" so the defendants would have time to complete their voir dire that day and the jury could be seated the next morning. The Eoffs' counsel, nonetheless, took another 35 pages of transcript to complete his voir dire questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defense counsel completed his voir dire after approximately an hour. The circuit court then turned to the Eoffs' counsel and said, \"Plaintiff's side, you're done as well?\" Counsel for both sides approached the bench, and the Eoffs' counsel said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Your Honor, I in my haste to move in [sic], and looking at my buried and entrenched question, I forgot to ask the insurance question. So now I'm in the problem of I can't ask it by itself in -- standing alone, I have three questions I can ask at this juncture. But I apologize, it's partly my negligence. My effort was\n   try [sic] to resolve getting my end sped up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defense counsel objected, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Yeah, well, no, the one thing I'd say is obviously even if he has three question[s] now the insurance question becomes highlighted. I mean, the one thing we've said many times in all these cases is, there's not a single person in this room who's related to Missouri Doctors Mutual Insurance Company because the insurance company's out of St. Joe, all the employees are in St. Joe. And the only insurers are doctors, and there's no doctors on this jury. So there's nobody that has any rational, reasonable basis to answer that question yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the statement by Eoffs' counsel suggested his failure to ask the insurance question was due to \"haste\" in complying with the circuit court's request to move along, the record shows the circuit court did not otherwise curtail the Eoffs' voir dire period after asking counsel to move along. Rather, the Eoffs' counsel engaged in extensive questioning following the circuit court's request until he turned voir dire over to defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After considering both sides' arguments, the circuit court rejected the Eoffs' counsel's request. In doing so, she noted were she to allow him to continue with his voir dire, \"the prejudice is more to the other side by unduly highlighting\" the defendants' insurance, particularly when the circuit court noted there was almost no likelihood of an affirmative answer given that MDMIC was a small, specialized insurance company from across the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following morning, the circuit court swore in a jury. After six days of trial the jury found in favor of Dr. McDonald and Seasons Healthcare. The circuit court overruled the Eoffs' motion for new trial. Following an opinion by the court of appeals, this Court granted transfer.\n   <em>\n    Rule 83.04.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

The court having done its part, it then was up to the Eoffs' counsel to do his by asking the question, but he failed to do so during his lengthy voir dire. It was only after the Eoffs' counsel had asked all of his other questions, and defense counsel had finished his voir dire, that the Eoffs' counsel recalled he had failed to ask the insurance question - and only the insurance question - and asked for permission to do so. Counsel's contention that\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   still controlled the circuit court's discretion at that point, and required the circuit court allow his question, is simply incorrect.\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   did not address this situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court refused to allow counsel to ask any insurance question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006874\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/878/442/\">\n     Id. at 444\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   held this was wrong and provided guidance as to how a proper question could be asked.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006874\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/878/442/\">\n     Id. at 445\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </em>\n   It did not otherwise divest the circuit court of its discretion to control the sequence and timing of voir dire. \"While a necessary component of a guarantee for an impartial jury is an adequate\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   that identifies unqualified jurors ... the trial judge is vested with the discretion to judge the appropriateness of specific questions, and is generally vested with wide discretion in the conduct of voir dire.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
