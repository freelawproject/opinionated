In two issues, Reyes argues that the trial court erred in granting BGC's motion for summary judgment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 20, 2015, between 4:15 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., Reyes entered a grocery store owned by BGC to shop with her family. While in the store, she began searching for a bottle of vitamin water to purchase. As she walked through the store between the checkout area and the store aisles, Reyes passed in front of an aisle end cap refrigerated display case. In front of the display case stood a three-and-one-half foot tall, four-sided, yellow sign, which read \"CAUTION CUIDADO | WET FLOOR PISO MOJADO.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Almost immediately after she passed the sign, Reyes entered the aisle adjacent to the left side of the display case, slipped, fell, and sustained an injury, which required the attendance of emergency medical personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Reyes filed the instant suit, in which she alleged that BGC was liable to her under theories including negligence and premises liability. BGC filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, to which Reyes responded. Ultimately, the trial court granted BGC's motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In two issues, Reyes argues that the trial court erred in granting BGC's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In reviewing a traditional motion for summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   we must apply the standards established in\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Nixon v.

BGC Assistant Manager Chris Jolee stated that a BGC employee tightened the\n   drain plug on the display case and another employee used paper towels to mop up the spill. In the video, BGC employees can be seen mopping up a spill with paper towels in the area where Reyes ultimately fell and placing the warning sign approximately thirty minutes before the Reyes incident. No further BGC employee activity occurred in that area within that thirty-minute time span. Thus, there is no evidence that any alleged negligent activity itself caused Reyes's injuries or that her fall was contemporaneous with BGC employees' attempted drain plug tightening or floor clean-up efforts. Rather, the evidence indicates that Reyes slipped on a small puddle-a condition caused by some noncontemporaneous activity.

The evidence is undisputed that the sign was placed within three to five feet of the area where Reyes fell and that Reyes walked immediately in front of the sign before she fell after taking only a few steps more. Much like the evidence in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Golden Corral\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the evidence here reflects that had Reyes seen the sign, she would have understood the message it conveyed. And while the record demonstrates that another customer fell in the same area as Reyes, the video evidence conclusively establishes that, almost immediately after that incident, BGC employees cleaned the area with paper towels and placed the warning sign in the location where it stood when Reyes walked past it. During the approximately thirty-minute timeframe between BGC employees' placing the warning sign and Reyes's fall, the video evidence shows approximately forty other instances in which BGC patrons walk through the same area without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence conclusively establishes that BGC discharged its duty to Reyes because it adequately warned of the wet floor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908895\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/443/515/#p518\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908895\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/443/515/#p518\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908895\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/443/515/#p518\">\n    at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
