PALAFOX, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this restricted appeal, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) appeals the trial court's order granting an expunction of all records relating to J.R.'s arrest, in 2010, for driving while intoxicated. Because the DPS complains of the absence of a reporter's record of the expunction proceedings, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a new hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 15, 2017, J.R. filed a petition for expunction of records relating to his 2010 arrest for driving while intoxicated. J.R. listed and served the DPS among various other agencies and entities he believed had records concerning his arrest. The DPS responded by filing an answer and general denial. Although not a party to this appeal, the El Paso County Attorney's Office of El Paso County, on behalf of several agencies and entities, filed an answer in which the County Attorney asserted that \"[a] review of the records and applicable law leads the [individual agencies and entities represented by the El Paso County Attorney] to conclude that [J.R.] is entitled to the expunction relating to Cause No. 20100C07620 as alleged in the Petition.\" Thereafter, J.R. filed an amended petition for expunction to include his verification among other minor changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A hearing on J.R.'s expunction was set for April 4, 2018, and on that same day, the trial court entered an order granting J.R.'s expunction after having \"considered the Petition for Expunction of [J.R.].\" The order commanded that the DPS, among other agencies, destroy any records relating to J.R.'s 2010 arrest for DWI. According to a letter from the court reporter made a part of our record, no reporter's record was taken of the expunction hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 5, 2018, the DPS filed its\n   notice of restricted appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Among four issues presented by this appeal, the DPS argues that a lack of a court reporter's transcription of the hearing on the merits of J.R.'s petition for expunction caused reversible error. Based on our resolution of this issue, we do not reach the remaining issues asserted by the DPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling on a petition for expunction under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We therefore address whether error is apparent on the face of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to the letter received from the court reporter, no reporter's record was made of the hearing on J.R.'s petition for expunction. The trial court's order finds that J.R. is entitled to expunction of his 2010 arrest as provided by Article 55.01(a)(2), Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Where, as here, the judgment is rendered after presentation of evidence to the court in the absence of the appellant, the failure to have the court reporter present to make a record constitutes reversible error.\n   <em>\n    Matter of O.T.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658515\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/564/456/#p460\">\n    564 S.W.3d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460 (Tex.
