It pays franchise taxes and included its delivery and pick-up fees in its Cost-of-Goods-Sold (\"COGS\") deduction under section 171.1012 of the tax code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Appellant Glenn Hegar, Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, conducted an audit and determined that the delivery and pick-up fees should not have been included in the COGS deduction, requiring Sunstate to pay almost $130,000 in taxes and almost\n   $11,000 in penalties and interest. Sunstate paid those taxes under protest and filed suit seeking a refund of those sums.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 112.051-.060 (taxpayer's suit after protest payment).

Its contracts were generally short-term, from one day to multiple months, and its customers were usually subcontractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Sunstate operated in the Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Austin, and San Antonio areas, and most of its customers could not pick up and return the equipment. Sunstate typically delivered its rental equipment to the construction site and picked it up at the end of the rental term (in about eighty percent of its contracts). Sunstate included separate delivery and pick-up charges in the rental fees it charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Sunstate bought and maintained a fleet of delivery vehicles, hired employees to do the pick-ups and deliveries, and maintained facilities to store the delivery vehicles, incurring labor expenses for the delivery employees, vehicle depreciation, property taxes and insurance costs on the vehicles and related property, and fuel and maintenance expenses for the fleet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 If Sunstate had not delivered and picked up the equipment, it would not have made any rental revenues, and \"the delivery and pick-up component of Sunstate's business activity was an integral part of its business operations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 In computing its franchise tax liability, Sunstate deducted its COGS from its total revenue. Sunstate was audited for franchise tax compliance in 2008 and 2009, and the Comptroller disallowed the delivery and pick-up costs as part of the COGS deduction, recategorizing some of the asserted COGS as indirect or administrative costs. The Comptroller then assessed deficiencies of $54,776.48 for 2008 and $74,886.05 for 2009, plus penalties and interest. Sunstate exhausted its administrative remedies and paid the alleged deficiencies, penalties, and interest under protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Comptroller asserts that (1) Sunstate's delivery and pick-up fees may not be included in its COGS deduction under subsections 171.1012(c), (d), (e), (f), or (k-1); (2) those fees did not constitute labor furnished to a project so as to qualify them as a COGS deduction under subsection 171.1012(i); and (3) the trial court \"otherwise err[ed]\" in granting summary judgment for Sunstate and denying the Comptroller's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Subsection 171.1012(k-1)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under section 171.1012(k-1), \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this section,\" Sunstate may deduct \"the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to tangible personal property that [Sunstate] rents or leases in the ordinary course of business.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%204282\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 171.1012(k-1). Sunstate argues that we should read the statute to allow it to include \"\n   <em>\n    all costs it incurred in relation to\n   </em>\n   the renting of its heavy construction equipment, notwithstanding any other provisions of [section] 171.1012.\" (Emphasis added.) We do not believe that Sunstate's interpretation comports with the statute's plain language or the legislative\n   intent that can be gleaned from that language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sunstate argues that our focus in interpreting section 171.1012 should be on Sunstate's revenue, while the Comptroller contends that our focus must be on the goods. We agree with the Comptroller that Sunstate is attempting to invert the legislature's chosen phrasing and rewrite the statute to allow a heavy equipment rental company to subtract costs \"in relation to the rental or leasing of tangible personal property,\" rather than allowing such an entity to subtract costs \"in relation to tangible personal property that the entity rents or leases.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Tax Code \u00a7 171.1012(k-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Sunstate argued that the phrase \"renting or leasing the heavy equipment\" should be substituted in for \"goods\" throughout section 171.1012. Thus, subsection (k-1) would allow it to deduct \" 'all direct costs of [renting or leasing] the [heavy equipment],' including the direct costs enumerated in\" subsection 171.1012(c); \"additional costs 'in relation to' the rented or leased equipment\" as enumerated in subsection 171.1012(d), including \"post-leasing direct costs including storage and handling costs, the costs of insurance on facilities or equipment, and utilities expenses\"; and \"up to 4% of all 'indirect or overhead costs ... allocable to the [renting or leasing of the equipment]' \" under subsection 171.1012(f). Sunstate asserted that subsection 171.1012(c)'s list of \"direct\" costs is not exclusive and that it was \"entitled to include 'all' direct costs whether or not such costs are specifically enumerated\" in subsection (c). It further claimed that its delivery and pick-up costs could be either direct or additional costs because its customers generally could not pick up or return the equipment themselves and thus would not have rented the equipment if Sunstate had not provided those \"necessary costs of [its] business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Sunstate asserts that it should be allowed these asserted COGS deductions because without providing delivery and pick-up services, it could not operate its business and, therefore, those costs \"are direct costs incurred as an integral part\" of its business. This, however, overlooks the legislature's clear distinction between costs a business incurs to obtain the goods it will sell, whether through production or acquisition, and costs it incurs in selling or distributing the goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%204282\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 171.1012(c) - (f). Sunstate provides no persuasive reasons for allowing a rental company to disregard that distinction. Instead, its arguments boil down to an assertion that it should simply be allowed to deduct any costs it incurs in relation to its rental business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The supreme court recently said that in considering a tax statute, we \"should not disregard the economic realities underlying the transactions in issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Combs v. Roark Amusement &amp; Vending, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7328049\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/422/632/#p637\">\n    422 S.W.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 637 (Tex. 2013). However, the court has explained that in making that observation, it had not suggested \"that, in the guise of considering the economic realities or essence of the transaction, courts were authorized to impose an entirely new requirement\" that is not found in the language of the tax statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Combs v.

Tax Code \u00a7 171.1012(c), (d), (k-1). This reading of the statute is logical and consistent with the apparent purpose of subsection (k-1)-to extend to renters of heavy equipment the same COGS deductions available to a company that sells identical equipment. It makes little sense to allow a rental company a broader COGS deduction than is available to sellers of the same equipment, who are limited to deducting their costs of obtaining the equipment. Nowhere in the language of this statute or the circumstances surrounding its enactment do we find an indication that the legislature intended to grant a heavy equipment rental company a COGS deduction for every cost associated with the company's chosen business model.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Health Care Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093485\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/401/623/\">\n    401 S.W.3d at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (look to plain meaning of statutory language).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We hold that by providing that companies such as Sunstate \"may subtract as a cost of goods sold the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to tangible personal property that the entity rents or leases in the ordinary course of business,\" the legislature intended to extend the COGS deduction to allow such companies to deduct their costs of obtaining the equipment they then rent out. The question\n   that remains is whether Sunstate's delivery and pick-up costs fall into an allowable category of expenses set out in section 171.1012(c), (d), or (f). We hold that they do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As we noted earlier, the costs allowed by section 171.1012 generally relate to the acquisition, production, or storage of goods, and whether a cost is eligible largely depends on when the cost was incurred: costs related to producing, obtaining, manufacturing, or storing goods are eligible, while costs incurred in selling or in the post-sale handling of the goods are not.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Section 171.1012 does not, of course, address delivery and pick-up fees in the rental context, but it does specifically disallow a deduction for \"distribution costs, including outbound transportation costs,\" and \"rehandling costs\" in the context of the sale of goods. Tex. Tax Code \u00a7 171.1012(e)(3), (6). The costs in question here are much more akin to those excluded costs than to any of the allowable costs included in the statute. Allowing Sunstate to take a COGS deduction for the costs of delivering and picking up its equipment while disallowing a seller of the same equipment from deducting its delivery and rehandling costs would again favor Sunstate over the seller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the unambiguous language used by the legislature in subsection (k-1), Sunstate and similar heavy construction equipment rental companies can include in their COGS deductions many of the costs they incur in obtaining and maintaining the heavy equipment that they rent out-inbound transportation, storage and inbound handling costs, depreciation, repairs, insurance, and the like. They may not include costs that a retailer or producer of heavy equipment would be explicitly barred from including in its COGS deduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We sustain the Comptroller's arguments related to subsection 171.1012(k-1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Subsection 171.1012(i)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Sunstate argued alternatively that its delivery and pick-up costs \"constituted labor\" on a construction project or other improvements to real property and could be deducted under subsection 171.1012(i).

Tax Code \u00a7 171.1012(i).

Sunstate delivers equipment that will presumably be used on the projects by Sunstate's customers, it itself does not provide labor that can be considered a direct component of the improvement projects, nor does the record reflect that Sunstate's services could be considered an essential component of the projects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (\"determining whether a particular 'labor cost' is includable as a cost of goods sold under subsection 171.1012(i), therefore, requires determining whether the particular activity is an essential and direct component of the 'project for the construction ... of real property' \");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newpark Res.\n   </em>\n   , 422 S.W.3d at 57 (\"it is difficult to view NES's disposal of waste material as though it were not an essential and direct component of the drilling process\"). To allow Sunstate to characterize its delivery and pick up of its rental equipment as labor \"furnish[ed]\" as an essential and direct component of the improvement projects would stretch subsection (i) too far. Thus, even if we were to overlook the fact that subsection (k-1) is tailored specifically for companies such as Sunstate, thus obviating any need to look elsewhere in section 171.1012 for the ability to take a COGS deduction, Sunstate has not shown that it can deduct its delivery and pick-up costs under subsection (i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Remaining Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sunstate also contends that subsection 171.1012(e) only limits Sunstate's \"additional costs\" under subsection (d), not its \"direct\" costs under subsection (c). It asserts that subsection (e) applies only to limit the indirect costs listed in subsection (d), that it cannot limit a taxable entity's \"unequivocal ability to include all direct costs as provided by \u00a7 171.1012(c),\" and that the Comptroller has conducted an \"inverted analysis of subsection (e) and (c).\" We disagree. Subsection (c) does allow the deduction of direct costs, providing a non-exclusive list of possible eligible costs. Tex. Tax Code \u00a7 171.1012(c). Then, it allows for the deduction of certain other specific costs, incurred after the goods are produced or acquired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 171.1012(d). Subsection (e) does not \"limit\" or disallow a direct cost under subsection (c).

Nothing in the Comptroller's analysis is inverted, nor does determining that Sunstate's delivery and pick-up costs are more like rehandling or distribution costs than like handling and inbound delivery costs somehow offend the structure of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Sunstate argues that if it is subject to the same COGS deductions as a retailer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   it should also be subject to the same tax rate. First, \"[t]he issues to be determined in the suit are limited to those arising from the reasons expressed in the written protest as originally filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 112.053(b). Sunstate's protest nowhere references its tax rate-this argument was raised for the first time in its motion for summary judgment. Further, the legislature did not provide any mechanism that might extend the lower retail or wholesale-trade rate to rental companies like Sunstate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 171.002(a), (b). Instead, the\n   legislature allowed such companies to take COGS deductions that would otherwise be unavailable to them, as long as those costs are \"otherwise allowed\" by section 171.1012, limiting its special dispensation to the COGS calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 171.1012(k-1).
