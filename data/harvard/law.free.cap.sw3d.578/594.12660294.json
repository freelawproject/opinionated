She experienced post-operative complications. Smith sued UTHSC for medical negligence, alleging waiver of immunity for injuries caused by use and/or misuse of tangible personal property, an electrocautery instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   UTHSC filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting that Smith's petition fails to establish a waiver of UTHSC's sovereign immunity as required by the Texas Tort Claims Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and moved for a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a hearing, the trial court denied the plea. UTHSC appealed the interlocutory order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its sole issue, UTHSC asserts that Smith's petition does not establish that UTHSC waived its sovereign immunity. It argues that Smith alleged that her post-operative complications were proximately caused by Dr. Cox's use/misuse of an electrocautery instrument but does not establish that he used or misused any surgical instrument in a negligent manner or that he damaged her biliary system. It further argues that Smith's allegation that Dr. Cox failed to repair the injury is an allegation of non-use of property which is not actionable under the statute. Additionally, UTHSC asserts that Smith's allegation that Dr. Cox negligently performed a surgery that was not medically indicated is an allegation of an error in medical judgment which is not actionable under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case.\n   <em>\n    Tex.

Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   , 104 S.W.3d at 628.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In her first amended petition, Smith alleged that Dr. Cox damaged her biliary system through the use and/or misuse of an electrocautery instrument. She more specifically alleged that he was negligent in damaging the biliary system, performing a surgery that was not medically indicated, and failing to repair the damage to the biliary system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Smith's expert, Dr. Lawrence Boyle, testified by deposition that he reviewed Smith's records. Because the pathology report did not state that there were signs of acute or chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall, he believed it was a normal gallbladder. He also stated that Smith's medical history was not diagnostic for gallbladder disease, and the preoperative workup was inadequate and insufficient to subject her to the surgery. He explained that the ultrasound revealed there were no inflammatory changes, it was a normal thickness, there was no fluid, and there was possibly a two-millimeter polyp on the wall of the gallbladder. Many of her symptoms were not specific to the gallbladder. He stated that Dr. Cox had only subjective circumstantial evidence, no objective evidence. He testified that the gallbladder surgery was unnecessary. When asked if he found \"any operative issues with the surgery itself\" he responded that the only issue he had was that the surgery was unnecessary. He also testified that he had no issues with the postoperative care and management of the bile leak. He explained there are \"mainly three etiologies of a bile leak,\" two of which can occur in the absence of injury. He never made a determination as to the source of the leak. His subsequent affidavit reiterated his conclusion that there was no medical indication to operate on Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Cox testified that Smith had classic symptoms of cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, so he performed surgery to remove the gallbladder. Smith developed a post-surgical leak of bile. To the best of his knowledge, the leak came from the gallbladder fossa, the area where the gallbladder had been attached to the liver. He testified that there was no leak from any other structure and no evidence of any form of injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We first address Smith's allegations that Dr. Cox was negligent in damaging the biliary system and failing to repair that damage. Dr. Boyle did not determine the source of the bile leak. He had no complaint about how the surgery was performed. Further, two of the three most common causes of post-surgical bile leaks are not caused by injury. Dr. Cox explained that the gallbladder is dissected from the liver creating a raw surface which, in a small number of patients, \"will leak in the natural course of things in gallbladder surgery.\" He testified that there was no evidence of any surgical injury and that the leak was not caused by an injury. While he addressed the post-surgery leak with drainage, he stated that \"the body just heals,\" and nothing required repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For waiver to occur, the alleged injury must be caused by the manner in which property was used.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498619\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/51/583/#p587\">\n    51 S.W.3d at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no evidence that Dr. Cox negligently used the electrocautery instrument in the surgery. The fact that tangible personal property was used during the procedure does not establish that its use was the proximate cause of Smith's alleged injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kamel v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. at Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321371\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/333/676/#p686\">\n    333 S.W.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The only evidence on the source of the leak indicates that use of the electrocautery instrument to remove the gallbladder did nothing more than furnish the condition that made the bile leak possible. For purposes of determining if a waiver of immunity has occurred, property does not cause injury if it does no more than furnish the condition that makes injury possible.\n   <em>\n    Bossley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11827190\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/968/339/#p342\">\n    968 S.W.2d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, an allegation of the failure to repair damage is an allegation of the non-use of property which does not satisfy the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498619\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/51/583/#p587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498619\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/51/583/#p587\">\n    at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, Smith pleaded that Dr. Cox performed a surgery to remove her gallbladder, using tangible personal property, \"which was not medically indicated.\" This allegation focused on the determination to perform surgery. In their respective depositions, Dr. Cox and Dr. Boyle considered Smith's medical history and symptoms and the pre-operative testing. Based on their expertise as trained physicians, in the exercise of medical judgment, the two doctors reached opposing conclusions regarding the necessity of the surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Whether surgery is indicated is determined by medical judgment, and that determination did not involve the use of an electrocautery instrument.
