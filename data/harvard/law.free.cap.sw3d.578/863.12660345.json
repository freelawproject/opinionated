Rice raises a single claim on appeal; he argues that the motion court erred in rejecting his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to use testimony from the State's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Fisher, during closing argument to challenge the credibility of the State's key witness. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
