Appellant alleged that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained in that he was denied competent counsel; that there was a systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury which returned the indictment and the petit jury which convicted him; that his confession was coerced, and that he was unable to receive a fair trial because of the racial customs of Louisiana. No hearing was had below. The court refused relief because no denial of constitutional rights appeared on the face of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Inasmuch as a showing of denial of constitutional rights here depends on the averments of the petition, no denial thereof being made by appellees, Scott must be given a hearing so that the truth of what the petition avers may be tested. Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770, decided after the order appealed from was entered. See also McNutt v. Texas, 5 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Appellant\u2019s failure to seek review of the State court proceedings by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court is, under the latest Supreme Court cases, no longer a bar to collateral relief.
