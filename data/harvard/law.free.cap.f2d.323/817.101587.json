Appellant asserts that the district court erred in failing to take the case from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-26\">Appellee was injured on appellant\u2019s ship when she fell during the course of a fire drill. She testified that the cause of her fall was her inability to see, over the bulge of the life jacket she was wearing, the steps she was then ascending. Appellant asserts that there is no evidence whatsoever that the ship\u2019s officers or any other agent knew or should have known of the fact that she was unable to see over the bulge of her life jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-27\">Appellee was physically impaired. She was suffering from an extreme arthritic condition of her hands and feet. She was recovering from a fractured hip. These disabilities affected her use of her hands, her ability to walk, to go up and down stairs, to open dresser drawers and to dress. Prior to the voyage, appellee\u2019s son advised the ship\u2019s purser, assistant purser and chief steward of these facts, and they assured him that appellee would be taken care of. Appellee also told the ship\u2019s nurse that she had difficulty in going up and down stairs. In the days prior to the accident she had been furnished assistance in dressing, opening dresser drawers and arising from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>chair after meals. It is true that she had descended and ascended stairs to and from the ship\u2019s dining room without assistance; but the circumstances of the ascent for the fire drill differed considerably. On that occasion she had to wear a life jacket, other passengers were rushing by her, some thirty people were milling about at the top of the stairway,s and, as she testified, these conditions as well as a clanging bell made her nervous and impelled her to hurry. Although a ship\u2019s newspaper had announced that all passengers were required to attend the drills, ship\u2019s employees neither told her she could be excused nor gave her assistance in the ascent which led to her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">A passenger carrier has a duty \u201c\u2018to exercise extraordinary vigilance and the highest skill to secure the safe conveyance of the passengers\u201d, Allen v. Matson Navigation Co. (9 Cir., 1958), 255 F.2d 273, 277, and if it knows that a passenger has physical disabilities it must exercise such higher degree of care \u2014including giving special assistance \u2014 as is reasonably necessary to insure that passenger\u2019s safety in view of his disabilities. See McBride v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. (1955), 44 Cal.2d 113, 279 P.2d 966; Groom v. Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. Ry. (1893), 52 Minn. 296, 53 N.W. 1128, 18 L.R.A. 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">These principles, applied to the facts of this ease, would require affirmance unless we accept appellant\u2019s contention that, since appellee testified precisely as to the cause of her injury \u2014 inability to see over the bulge of the life jacket \u2014 the notice to the ship\u2019s officers of her disabling circumstances and the failure of those officers to excuse her or provide assistance are wholly immaterial to the question of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In our judgment appellant views the nature of the asserted negligence too narrowly. It can hardly be denied that a life jacket obscures vision to some extent. Moreover, merely because appellee testified that inability to see over the life jacket was the immediate cause of her fall, it does not follow that her known disabilities and the pressing conditions of the drill did not also contribute to the accident. Appellant\u2019s care should be judged in view of its duty to anticipate obscured vision not in the abstract but in the light of these other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The question presented is simply whether there is evidence from which it could be found that appellant should have anticipated that appellee, disabled as she was, would be likely to experience unusual difficulties in climbing steps under these fire drill conditions Avhen hampered by a life jacket, and, if so, should have taken steps to guard against injury as a consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">The record clearly demonstrates the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
