The order has been complied with to the satisfaction of the Board in all respects except with reference to respondent recognizing the union as his employees\u2019 bargaining agent and bargaining collectively with it. Counsel for respondent advised us at the argument of this matter that the employer does recognize the union and has bargained with it, that no agreement was reached and that the filing of the present petition stopped, or at least suspended, the talks.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">Under all of the facts, the Board is entitled to the enforcement of its order calling for respondent to formally recognize the union as bargaining agent for his employees and to bargain collectively upon request with said union i. e. United Retail and Wholesale Employees Union, Local 115, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Independent, as exclusive representative of said employees, with respect to rates of pay, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment, and, if an understanding is reached, embody such understanding in a written and signed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-19\">A form of order may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
