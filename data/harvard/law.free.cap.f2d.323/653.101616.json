The precise issues before\u2019 us were decided adversely to appellant\u2019s contentions by that Court when it denied his application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. There being no issue of due process under the Federal Constitution, we must not challenge the State Court\u2019s construction of its own statutes and Constitution, nor should we inquire into the reasons for such construction. Hebert v. Louisiana (1926), 272 U.S. 312, 47 S.Ct. 103, 71 L.Ed. 270; Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
