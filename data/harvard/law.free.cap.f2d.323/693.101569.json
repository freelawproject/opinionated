Appellants urge, as grounds for reversal:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">(1) That the last sentence of \u00a7 174 requiring defendant, once having been proved to have possession of narcotics to explain that possession, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">(2) That the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">We have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 174, as it applies to heroin and other opium derivatives, and to certain marijuana, at least. The Supreme Court of the United States has instructed us to do so. White v. United States, 9 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 113; Cellino v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 941, 943-946; Yee Hem v. United States, 1925, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904. But see Erwing v. United States, 9 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-18\">We have previously refused, and continue to refuse, to reverse our position where the factual situation is as it here exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-19\">As to the sufficiency of the evidence, we are required, of course, to examine the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom most favorable to the government on this appeal. Glasser v. United States, 1941, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680; Sandez v. United States, 9 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-20\">Was there a reasonable inference at the time of appellants\u2019 arrest that appellants <em>had </em>had possession of the heroin? We are not limited in our factual analysis to the precise moment of arrest, or the moment that the officers announced themselves to the appellants. That Agobian\u2019s hands were seen to drop the heroin at the moment of panic and flight does not preclude a joint constructive possession of the narcotics by <em>both </em>parties in the one automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-21\">We quote from the factual recital in the government\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-22\">\u201cSeveral officers testified that Mr. Ronald Rojas was a special employee of the government. The officers further testified that past experience had proven Mr. Rojas was reliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-23\">\u201cThe testimony concerning the handling of heroin on the evening of March 27, 1962, clearly proved that the appellants intended to possess and continue dealing in the illicit traffic .of narcotics. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u201cMr. Rojas testified that on March 28, 1962, the appellants were going to deliver heroin. At the appointed date and location the appellants arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201cDuring the attempt by the appellants to escape, an object was thrown from the appellants\u2019 moving vehicle and the sound of glass breaking was heard. At this precise location, heroin was scraped from the asphalt pavement. Broken glass and a metal jar lid containing heroin were also recovered. That this heroin was in fact thrown from the appellants\u2019 vehicle is substantiated by the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Velasquez that no other broken glass was found .along the route of the appellants\u2019 attempted escape. Nor were there any broken windows in the appellants\u2019 vehicle. The only rational conclusion that can be drawn from these facts is that the heroin recovered on March 28, 1962 is the same heroin which was \u2018cut\u2019 by the appellants and stored in a glass jar with a metal lid on the evening of March 27, 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">When at the approach of the officers the jar containing heroin was \u2022thrown out of the window of appellant\u2019s residence it was shown that .a moment earlier someone in the house had had possession of narcotics. In the absence of explanation showing the possession to be lawful it was presumed unlawful under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174. Thus, the corpus delicti of the offense charged was fully established * * *\u2022\u201d Cutchlow v. United States, 301 F.2d 295, 297 (9 Cir., 1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The dominion and control exercised by the appellants jointly over the narcotics, if the government witnesses \u25a0were to be believed (as they were, by the jury) is a far cry from the unknowl\u2022edgeable \u201cmomentary grasp\u201d mentioned by the reversing court in United States v. Santore, 2 Cir., 1960, 290 F.2d 51. The doctrine enunciated in that case is not ;here applicable, and we cannot follow it. Nor are we convinced by arguments of <em>amici curiae </em>that the court\u2019s instruction, in the exact language contained in the statute (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, paragraph 2) was contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3481.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">The Supreme Court has ruled on the constitutionality of \u00a7 174, paragraph 2. Yee Hem v. United States, supra. We have long followed that rule. Mullaney v. United States, 9 Cir., 1936, 82 F.2d 638; Caudillo v. United States, 9 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 513. We cannot agree that it is unrealistic to argue that appellants could have offered evidence other than their own testimony, since there is nothing to indicate that evidence other than their testimony was available. Neither is there any evidence other testimony was <em>not </em>available. If the appellants had a defense which could explain their possession, such as lawful purchase, medical prescription or research, etc., etc., they could presumably have produced testimony of third parties to establish such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Nor can we see the applicability of Johnson v. United States, 1943, 318 U.S. 189, 63 S.Ct. 549, 87 L.Ed. 704. How were appellants deprived of an intelligent choice of whether they should or should not explain their possession, if we assume they had an explanation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">If the court had not instructed on the second paragraph of \u00a7 174, it would not have completely or properly instructed the jury. If the Supreme Court desires to reverse the present rule on the lawfulness of the presumption it has heretofore approved, it may do so, but we may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">We may, but need not, notice on our motion errors to which no exception was taken in the trial court, and to which the trial judge\u2019s attention was not called, except under extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. We fail to find such exceptional circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
