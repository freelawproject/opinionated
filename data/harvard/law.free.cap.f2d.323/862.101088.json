Klingstein v. United States, 217 F.2d 711 (4th Cir., 1954); Olson v. United States, 234 F.2d 956 (4th Cir., 1956); Call v. United States, 265 F.2d 167 (4th Cir., 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>The motion from which the appeal is taken was not timely made. Koneski w\u00e1s convicted and sentenced on March 19, 1962, and the motion was filed almost ten months later on January 16, 1963. Rule 35 Fed.R.Crim.P. provides that a court may reduce a sentence within sixty days after the sentence is imposed. Rule 45(b) Fed.R.Crim.P. provides that the court may not enlarge the period for taking any action under Rule 35. We perceive no error in the denial of appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
