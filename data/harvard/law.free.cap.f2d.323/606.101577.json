He had been returned to Lor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ton in 1962 after a parole revocation to serve the remainder of a previously imposed sentence. In April 1963 he filed a petition contending that, with proper allowance for good conduct, his discharge date was August 15, 1963, rather than October 1, 1963 as indicated by the Warden\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The District Court denied the requested relief, but the prisoner was unconditionally released on September 6, 1963.
