O\u2019Brient, brought this action against the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, under Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 53 Stat. 1368, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), to obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary denying his application to establish a period of disability and for disability insurance benefits under Sections 216(i), 64 Stat. 492 and 223, 70 Stat. 815 of the Act. 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423. O\u2019Brient\u2019s impairment is a paralyzed right diaphragm of unknown origin. The district court s\u2019et aside the Secretary\u2019s decision on the ground that there was no substantial evidence to support the hearing examiner\u2019s findings. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\"> The Social Security Act, 42 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g) provides that \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive * * This finality attaches to inferences supported by substantial evidence. Brunenkant v. Cele-brezze, 7 Cir. 1962, 310 F.2d 355. The presence of a disease or a medically determinable impairment does not satisfy the requirements of the Act unless the disease or the impairment causes \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416 (i), 423(c). Judge Rives of this Court, sitting by designation, concluded that \u201cany substantial gainful work\u201d must have reference to a claimant\u2019s education, training, experience, and physical and mental capacities, in addition to the <em>effect </em>of the impairment on former work activities. Aaron v. Fleming, M.D.Ala.1958, 168 F.Supp. 291, 295. This test has become standard. \u201cThus, even though severe physical limitations be established, it is still necessary in applying the legal standard to relate this limitation to the claimant\u2019s work history and educational background.\u201d Underwood v. Ribicoff, 4 Cir. 1962, 298 F.2d 850, 852. In that case the court found for the claimant. Underwood was sixty-five and by training and experience was equipped only for work demanding a considerable amount of physical exertion; he was \u201cdependent for his living upon the ability of his body to function at near capacity\u201d. Using the same test in Hicks v. Fleming, 5 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 470, we found for the Secretary. But Hicks had vocational retraining, found a new job, worked in an automobile electrical shop, had been a dealer in a professional poker game, and for two years had earned about $1300 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">In his application, O\u2019Brient stated that he was unable to work on January 15, 1960. The claimant was in the University Hospital in January 1960 for removal of a knot behind his right knee when he complained of chest pains. Dr. Rhymes diagnosed the chest condition as eventration of the right diaphragm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> X-rays showed a paralyzed right hemi-diaphragm and no abnormalities in the sub-diaphragmatic area. The stay in the hospital was uncomplicated. He was discharged after ten days, because \u201cthe patient had reached maximum hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>benefit.\u201d Later medical reports filed in late 1961 showed mild emphysema but improvement in the claimant\u2019s diaphragmatic condition and in his breathing. Dr. Johnston of Jackson, Mississippi, reported negative results from a clinical examination of heart and lungs, that \u201cmost of the patient\u2019s complaints (numbness in the right arm and burning sensations in his legs, in addition to the paralyzed diaphragm) are without organic foundation\u201d, and that there was no evidence of disability. Dr. Rhymes\u2019s second report described the diaphragmatic condition as \u201cgradually progressive\u201d, noted shortness of breath, and recommended sedentary activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">O\u2019Brient was forty-six years old in 1960. He has a high school education. He has been trained, and has worked, chiefly in form carpentry; has served as a foreman and kept time and distribution records; done cabinet work on the side; knows how to build a house and \u201ccontracted one or two\u201d in the past; knows how to read construction plans; has been able to fix his own television set. The examiner described O\u2019Brient as \u201cwell-developed and well-nourished, suntanned and in good spirits\u201d. The examiner found no. perceptible shortness of breath, no limp, and no discernible abnormalities or physical defects. O\u2019-Brient testified that the pain in his chest and difficulty in breathing, after exertion, and a pain in his legs when climbing or lifting prevented his returning to construction work. His breathing had improved somewhat because of breathing exercises. At the time of the hearing, he walked about a mile a day, drove a car, gardened, and had done some light carpentry. The examiner found him \u201cmentally alert\u201d, with an \u201cexceptionally good\u201d language facility, \u201cknowledgeable\u201d, \u201ccooperative\u201d, \u201cin good spirits\u201d, \u201cwilling to work\u201d. In the hearing the claimant stated: \u201cI want to do something. I\u2019m not going to lay around * * * I would like to take a course in something that would benefit me. They tell me now if I don\u2019t change my trade I\u2019m not going to get any better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">O\u2019Brient himself said that he had \u201cgotten quite a bit better.\u201d He felt, however, that he was entitled to some assistance for the period during which he had been \u201ccompletely knocked out\u201d and had \u201cgone in debt\u201d. Six months after he filed this action, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation of the State of Mississippi determined that O\u2019Brient was not disabled by his impairment; that he could continue to work as a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">Mr. O\u2019Brient\u2019s purpose in filing a claim for disability centered in a desire to obtain financial relief, pending reemployment. He stated, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxVx\">\u201cI\u2019m going to make some money. I\u2019m going to do it somehow. But I\u2019m going to have to need some help to do it. I think I\u2019m entitled to assistance, I believe, through social security, through rehabilitation, or whatever you have. * * * I think for the time I\u2019ve been disabled, for that period, I\u2019m entitled to that much time if I was fully physically able to work right now, but I don\u2019t want to take nothing and sit down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">On these and other facts, and on the basis of the medical and vocational reports, the hearing examiner found that O\u2019Brient\u2019s health was improving and that the impairment was not sufficient te prevent him from performing sedentary shop work or supervisory work. He found that thanks to O\u2019Brient\u2019s high school education, manual skills, and previous experience, O\u2019Brient was capable of being retrained with little difficulty and, without any special or prolonged course of training, was capable of earning a substantial living in radio and television repairs, in supervising construction work, and in sedentary or semi-sedentary jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">The district court\u2019s decision appears to have been based, at least in part, on the claimant\u2019s assertion that in the general area where he lived no light work was available as a parking lot attendant, night watchman, or janitor. The district court stated that \u201cconjectural possibilities\u201d are not evidence that O\u2019Brient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>\u201cwas capable of gainful employment available to him\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">Congress might well have defined disability in broad terms under the Social Security Act and related it to unemployment by qualifying \u201cany substantial gainful activity\u201d with the words \u201cavailable in the claimant\u2019s immediate working area\u201d or similar words. That is not the statutory test; the Act is not an unemployment compensation law. Here, as in Hicks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-5\">\u201cThe hardship here seems to lie more in Hicks\u2019s inability to find employment than in his incapacity to work. Despite our natural sympathy for Hicks\u2019s plight, we cannot order unemployment compensation under the guise of disability insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">The explicit congressional command is that the impairment must cause \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d. See Gotshaw v. Ribicoff, 4 Cir. 1962, 307 F.2d 840, 844; Pearman v. Ribicoff, 4 Cir. 1962, 307 F.2d 573, 574; and Adams v. Flemming, 2 Cir. 1960, 276 F.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">In this case, as in all of these disability cases under the Act, the plaintiff asks the inevitable rhetorical question: What jobs are there ? For the Secretary, \u201cWhat jobs are there\u201d means, within the context of the Act, what kinds of work can the claimant perform, not what jobs are there available for him in Kosciusko, Mississippi. See Kerner v. Fleming, 2 Cir. 1962, 283 F.2d 916; Graham v. Ribicoff, 9 Cir. 1962, 295 F.2d 391; Ri-naldi v. Ribicoff, 2 Cir. 1963, 305 F.2d 548. In the light of this correct understanding of the law, the Secretary\u2019s showing of O\u2019Brient\u2019s ability to perform light work of a various nature is all the answer he is required to make to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">When a claimant\u2019s former employment is the only type of work he is capable of performing, then \u201cformer work\u201d means \u201cany work\u201d and the requirements of the Act are met. This was the situation in Ferran v. Flemming, 5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 568; Butler v. Flemming, 5 Cir. 1961, 288 F.2d 591; Flemming v. Booker, 5 Cir. 1960, 283 F. 2d 321; Ribicoff v. Hughes, 8 Cir. 1961, 295 F.2d 833; Kohrs v. Flemming, 8 Cir. 1959, 272 F.2d 731; Kerner v. Flemming, 2 Cir. 1960, 283 F.2d 916. But impairment to carry on one\u2019s <em>former work </em>is not enough in itself to satisfy the statutory definition of \u201cany substantial gainful activity.\u201d Thus in Hicks this Court pointed out that the word \u201cany\u201d includes former work and work of a different nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-10\">\u201cTo establish a disability under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416 (i) a claimant must do more than show that he is unable to do his former work; he must be unable to perform any substantial, gainful work, including work of a physically or emotionally lighter type.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">See also Gotshaw v. Ribicoff, 4 Cir. 1962, 307 F.2d 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">Taking the record as a whole, we find that there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">. The Diaphragm is defined in Blakiston\u2019s New Gould Medical Dictionary (2d ed. 1956) as a \u201cmusculo-tendinous partition, especially that partition muscular at the circumference and tendinous at the center, which separates the thorax and abdomen and is the chief muscle of respiration and expulsion. * * * Eventration of the diaphragm is defined as \u201ca condition where there is defective muscular action of the diaphragm * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
