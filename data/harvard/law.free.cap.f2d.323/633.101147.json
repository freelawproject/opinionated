Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), United States v. Nichols, 322 F.2d 681 (7th Cir., 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Defendant argues that an essential element of proof is lacking because defendant was merely a passenger in the automobile on August 14, and that there was no evidence that he was responsible for the transportation for prostitution. The uncontradicted evidence establishes that the defendant set his wife up in prostitution in Missouri in July, and accompanied her on the trip from Illinois to-Missouri on August 14. The purpose of the trip of August 14 reasonably may be inferred from that evidence to have been for the resumption of prostitution, Lindsey v. United States, 227 F.2d 113, 117 (5th Cir., 1955), and was enough for the-jury\u2019s inference that he assisted in the-arrangement for the return trip from Illinois. Wright v. United States, 175 F.2d 384 (8th Cir., 1949). Defendant should not escape the consequences by taking a back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">Defendant also argues that this was an \u201cinnocent round trip\u201d so as to fall within the rule of Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 369, 64 S.Ct. 1037, 88 L.Ed. 1331 (1944). There were no defense witnesses and no testimony to establish the \u201cinnocent\u201d purpose of the trip in question. The Government proved the elements of its case by its proof of the establishment of the house of prostitution in Missouri and the transportation of defendant\u2019s wife from Illinois to the house of prostitution in Missouri on August 14,1961. A babysitter gave testimony from which it could be inferred that defendant and his wife were in Illinois to visit their children living there. But there was no testimony that that was the purpose of the trip in question. There is no evidence to establish that the trip was innocent when it began, or that the trip of August 14 was an integral part of an innocent round trip. This lack of \u25a0 proof distinguishes Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 369, 64 S.Ct. 1037, 88 L.Ed. 1331 (1944), Oriolo v. United States, 324 U.S. 824, 65 S.Ct. 683, 89 L.Ed. 1393 (1945), reversing 146 F.2d 152, 153 (3d Cir., 1944), and United States v. Ross, 257 F.2d 292 (2d Cir., 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 provides so far as is material here:</p>\n<p id=\"Aba\">\u201cWhoever knowingly transports in interstate or foreign commerce * * * any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution * * * Shall be fined not more than $5,000 nor imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
