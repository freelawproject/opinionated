Saunders v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 316 F.2d 346 (1963). In that opinion, our principal concern was with some notes taken by a Government attorney during a pre-trial interview with a Government witness. At the hearing on remand, these notes were produced, and the defense conceded they were riot required to be produced at trial. Also forthcoming at the hearing were certain police reports, some of which are characterized by the defense as \u201ca reasonably accurate reproduction\u201d of notes taken by the investigating officer which had been destroyed by him after trial. The District Court heard lengthy testimony with respect to the formulation of these documents, including the notes, and concluded that none was within the scope of the Jencks Act. We find no reason in the record for disturbing this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-25\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, 71 Stat. 595 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
