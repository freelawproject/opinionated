The complaint alleged violation of the anti-trust laws and sought treble damages and an injunction. Its institution followed the dismissal with prejudice of a suit arising out of the same controversy which the plaintiff had brought against some of the individual defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. After lengthy interlocutory proceedings (see e. g. By-ram Concretanks, Inc. v. Meaney, 3 Cir. 1961, 286 F.2d 170) the case came on for trial in the district court. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court dismissed the complaint upon motion of the defendants. The plaintiff thereupon took the appeal now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">Our study of the record satisfies us that the district court did not err in its conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove its case. We have also considered the plaintiff\u2019s contentions that there were trial errors but find them so lacking in merit as to require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
