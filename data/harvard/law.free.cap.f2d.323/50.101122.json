F. Popell Co., Inc., a Florida corporation, has moved for a stay pending determination of its appeal from an order of the District Court for the Southern District of New York which, pursuant to \u00a7 32(b) of the Bankruptcy Act, transferred a proceeding under Chapter XI of that Act, begun by the debtor in that district, to the Southern District of Florida where, as the court found, the debtor has its principal place of business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The creditors who sought the transfer have cross-moved to dismiss the appeal as frivolous; a creditors\u2019 committee has joined the debtor in objecting to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>If the appeal had probable merit, the ease would be one where a stay ought be granted. But we are convinced it has none, for the reasons stated in Judge Feinberg\u2019s opinion in the District Court. The Southern District of New York was not a district where the debtor had its principal place of business, resided or had its domicile, as provided in \u00a7 2 a(l); assuming that the provisions of \u00a7 32 are sufficient to have allowed retention, the judge in no way abused his discretion in finding that the interests of the parties would not be \u201cbest served\u201d thereby. Accordingly we affirm the order of transfer and thereby render both motions moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Affirmed. The mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-12\">. In contrast to transfer orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1404(a) and 1406(a), the order here Is appealable since \u00a7 24(a) of the Bankruptcy Act includes interlocutory orders in \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d In re Flexton Corp., 208 F.2d 869 (2 Cir. 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
