Throughout the proceedings he was represented by counsel who apparently gave the case proper attention and served Abdalla well. We find no merit in any of the alleged errors, but on the contrary conclude from a review of the record that his various contentions and specifications of error are wholly without merit. See Warren v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 629; Alexander v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 252; and Burns v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 321 F.2d 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
