A. \u00a7\u00a7 351-367, with respect to days claimed by him as \u201cdays of unemployment\u201d from June 11 through June 18, 1962,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because he was not \u201cavailable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>work\u201d on such days as required by Section 1 (k) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Petitioner has worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for 38 years and was employed in June, 1962, as a locomotive engineer. He was \"pulled out of service\u201d by the road foreman of engines on June 9, 1962, for failure to submit to a periodic physical examination by the railroad doctor on June 8, 1962. On June 18, 1962, petitioner submitted to such physical examination and was returned to work on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Our review of this matter, after hearing oral argument by the parties, leads us to conclude that the decision of respondent Board was not arbitrary or capricious, that it had a reasonable basis in law and was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Stephens v. Railroad Retirement Board, 7 Cir., 301 F.2d 899 (1962); McKissick v. Railroad Retirement Board, 7 Cir., 295 F.2d 287 (1961); Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 7 Cir., 250 F.2d 832 (1958), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 967, 78 S.Ct. 1005, 2 L.Ed.2d 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Under applicable law, we are, therefore, required to affirm the order under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-27\">. Under Section 2(a) of the Act benefits are payable only for days of unemployment in excess of four during any regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>tration period. The maximum daily benefit under the Act is $10.20. Petitioner would be entitled to recover $40.80 if all the days he claims were \u201cdays of unemployment\u201d as defined in the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
