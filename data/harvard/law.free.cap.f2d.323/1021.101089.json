Use of the mark by ap-pellee on the designated goods since August 1959 is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>Appellant, United Co-Operatives, Inc., is the registrant of UNICO for spray materials, arsenates and spraying dusts <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for \u201cinsecticides, fungicides, mil-cides, herbicides, rodenticides, pesticides, bactericides, seed inoculants, and roost paint.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Mr. Edmund A. Georgi, manager of the Farm Chemical Division of United Co-Operatives, Inc. testified that appellant has used its mark UNICO for a rodentieide in pelleted form since January 1952, for an insecticide since the spring of 1954, and for snail and slug bait pellets since March 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Appellee took no testimony but filed notice of reliance under Trademark Rule 2.123(c) on numerous third party registrations and publications to show the widespread use for chemical products of trademarks comprising the prefix UNI. Appellant moved to strike the notice .and matter submitted therewith on the ground that the matter submitted was not \u201ccompetent evidence and pertinent to the issue\u201d as required by the rule. The board denied the motion and refused \"to consider the question of admissibility \u25a0prior to final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The issue facing this court is whether UNIPEL so resembles the trademark UNICO as to be likely, when applied to .appellee\u2019s fertilizer, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">Although the board considered that ap-pellee\u2019s fertilizer and appellant\u2019s seed inoculants, herbicides or insecticides are .such that they would normally be attributed to a single producer or seller if sold under the same or similar mark, the '.board dismissed the opposition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayb-dedup-0\">\u201cThe term \u2018UNI\u2019 * * * is a dictionary term and is used in innumerable words as a combining form meaning one, single, as in uniform (See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, 1947). As used in applicant\u2019s mark, \u2018UNI\u2019 would suggest \u2018uniformity\u2019 and the mark as a whole is suggestive of uniform pellets. Opposer\u2019s mark, if it has any suggestion to purchasers, would suggest its name \u2018United CoOperatives, Inc.\u2019 and the marks are otherwise distinguishable in both sound and appearance. It is concluded that purchasers upon encountering \u2018UNIPEL\u2019 fertilizer in the market place are not likely to assume because of the use of \u2018UNI\u2019 as part of the mark that \u2018UNIPEL\u2019 fertilizer originates with, is sponsored by or is in some way connected with the producer of \u2018UNICO\u2019 agricultural chemicals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">The board, furthermore, did not sustain appellant\u2019s objection to appellee\u2019s notice of evidence under Trademark Rule 2.123(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">Appellant contends that there is no evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion that UNI in UNIPEL would suggest \u201cuniformity\u201d and disagrees with the board\u2019s further conclusion that UNICO, if it suggests anything, suggests appellant\u2019s name \u201cUnited Co-Operatives, Inc.\u201d Appellant urges that the letters UNI, being part of a single term or expression have no significance, as such, in the unitary, arbitrary, coined trademark UNICO. On the other hand, appellant contends that the suffix PEL in UNIPEL is clearly intended by appellee to be suggestive or descriptive of pellets, i. e. the form in which appellee\u2019s fertilizer is sold under UNIPEL and that PEL is equally suggestive or descriptive of the form in which several of appellant\u2019s products are sold under UNICO. Appellant urges that it is not because UNIPEL has the prefix UNI that appellant \u201ccontends confusion is likely; it is because the entire mark \u2018UNIPEL\u2019 for pelleted fertilizer <em>resembles </em>the entire mark \u2018UNICO\u2019 for pelleted agricultural chemicals in more respects than it differs therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-13\">Appellee on the other hand, urges that the evidence fully supports the board\u2019s decision. It contends that appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>witness, Mr. Georgi, has admitted that UNIPEL identifies appellee\u2019s fertilizer and that this testimony supports the board\u2019s finding that UNI would suggest uniformity and that UNICO if it has any suggestion to purchasers, would suggest \u201cUnited Co-Operatives, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">We agree with the board. We do not feel that confusion is likely in the concurrent use by applicant of the trademark UNIPEL for its fertilizer and UNICO by appellant as a trademark for its goods. In considering the marks as a whole we find that the marks are sufficiently different in sound and appearance as to preclude a likelihood of confusion. We also agree with the board that if UNICO has any suggestive significance, it would be to suggest the name of the organization which uses it \u2014 United CoOperatives, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">In view of the above, the decision of the board is affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">. Reg. No. 384,494, issued Jan. 21, 194L</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1072-14\">. Reg. No. 673,712, issued Feb. 10, 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">. In its brief, appellant \u201cprays that the Court direct that that part of the Board\u2019s opinion which holds that objections to admissibility of evidence presented under Rule 2.123(c) be postponed to final hearing be vacated and that the Board be ordered to rule on such motions, in future cases, in time for appropriate action to be taken by the parties before final hearing.\u201d Since the matter is purely one of procedure before the Patent Oifice and since we find no error in the board\u2019s ultimate treatment of the evidence questioned, we will not consider appellant\u2019s-request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
