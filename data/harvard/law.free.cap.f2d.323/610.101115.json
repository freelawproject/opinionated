Applications of other of Ben Bolt\u2019s suppliers had previously been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-23\">The Examiner noted that the principal issue concerned prices and cost of service data to support the prices. He found that Ben Bolt had constructed and was operating under the temporary authorization approximately 26 miles of pipe line from certain gas fields to a gasoline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>plant where the gas was delivered to Natural Gas Pipe Line Company of America (hereafter Natural), an interstate pipe-line company, and was operating about 23 miles of existing natural gas facilities to move the gas from other fields for delivery to Natural. Ben Bolt\u2019s contract with Natural provided for a delivered price of 20 cents per Mcf. The Examiner concluded that Ben Bolt had justified the proposed 20-eent price, and, subject to review by the Commission, ordered certificates of public convenience and necessity to be issued to Ben Bolt and its two suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The Examiner found that the applicants, including Ben Bolt, are \u201cindependent producers\u201d under the definition contained in Section 154.91 of the Commission\u2019s regulations, but that Ben Bolt should also be classified as a Class. C pipe-line company for the purpose of filing accounting reports with the Commission. Ben Bolt filed exceptions to the Examiner\u2019s decision. The Commission modified the Examiner\u2019s decision by reversing his finding that Ben Bolt is an Independent producer, and to the contrary found that Ben Bolt should be classified as a Class C pipe-line company. The regulations governing pipe-line companies are more complex and exacting than those governing independent producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Ben Bolt applied for a rehearing, which the Commission denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On this petition for review under Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r(b), Ben Bolt insists that its classification as a pipe-line company is erroneous and that it is an \u201cindependent producer\u201d engaged in the \u201cgathering\u201d of natural gas. Ben Bolt further insists that its classification as a pipe-line company is illegal as a matter of procedure, that the Commission determined its status without according it notice or an opportunity to be heard and without adducing the necessary evidence or making the necessary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">At the time the Commission classified Ben Bolt, Section 154.91(a) of its Natural Gas Regulations defined \u201cIndependent Producer\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Definition. </em>An \u2018independent producer\u2019 as that term is used in this part means any person as defined in the Natural Gas Act who is engaged in the production or gathering of natural gas and who transports natural gas in interstate commerce for resale, but who is not primarily engaged in the operation of an interstate pipeline.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The first requirement to be an \u201cindependent producer\u201d is that the person \u201cis engaged in the production or gathering of natural gas.\u201d Ben Bolt has never claimed to be engaged in the production, but its claim is that it is engaged in the gathering of natural gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The Commission found that Ben Bolt was not engaged in \u201cgathering\u201d upon application of its definition of \u201cgathering\u201d in Barnes Transportation Company, 18 F.P.C. 369:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">\u201c * * * in the ordinary concept of the word \u2018gathering\u2019 as used in the natural-gas .industry it means (sic) the collecting of gas from various wells and bringing it by separate and individual lines to a central point where it is delivered into a single line. Following this concept, \u2018gathering\u2019 is considered to have ended when the gas reached the \u2018central point\u2019 for delivery into a single line.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">The Commission found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">\u201cUnder the facts of this case, Ben Bolt cannot validly claim that it functions as a \u2018gatherer\u2019; it clearly is primarily engaged in the purchase of \u2018gathered\u2019 gas delivered into a \u2018single line\u2019 for transportation from the area of production to the point of sale to a major pipeline company, Natural, for further transportation in interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u201cBen Bolt is not as large a pipeline company as is Natural, the buyer of its gas, which operates a pipeline extending from Texas to Chicago. However, Ben Bolt\u2019s function, the transportation of gas in interstate commerce, is the same. It is true that Ben Bolt and other companies similarly situated have been referred to as \u2018gatherers.\u2019 But their primary function is that of transporting gas for sale to pipeline companies. Their facilities are, in substance, extensions of the major pipeline systems. Their operations, in our opinion, constitute transportation rather than gathering and should be so treated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In its decision denying Ben Bolt\u2019s application for rehearing, the Commission further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cIn classifying a particular company as an independent producer or an interstate pipeline we must look to the nature of the operations. The facts in this case clearly indicate that Ben Bolt is but an extension of the interstate pipeline system of Natural. If Natural had constructed an extension of its pipeline system to take gas from Engeo and East White Point it would have been required to obtain a pipeline certificate to construct and operate such facilities. Such an extension, if constructed by Natural, would be treated as an addition to transmission facilities, not as a gathering operation. We find no reasonable basis for reaching a different conclusion by reason of the fact the facilities were constructed and are being operated by Ben Bolt. The function performed is the same, i. e., the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, after the gathering function has been completed by Engeo and East White Point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aor-dedup-0\">The record is sufficient to afford substantial evidence in support of the Commission\u2019s findings, and its findings are conclusive on the Court in its consideration of this petition for review. Section 19(b) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Ben Bolt\u2019s application for rehearing before the Commission made no complaint that there was anything unfair or improper about deciding the question of its status, or that the Commission had violated any procedural safeguard. Section 19(b) of the Act provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\">\u201c * * * No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Each of Ben Bolt\u2019s specifications of error has received consideration, and we find no merit in any of them. The order of the Commission is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-14\">. This section requires a \u201cnatural-gas company.\u201d to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity for construction or extension of its facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-24\">. Those regulations appear under the caption, \u201cFilings By Producers and Gatherers of Natural Gas Which Are Also Natural Gas Companies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-14\">.
