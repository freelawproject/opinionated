Two other district judges have concluded, as Judge Bartels did here, that she cannot. Bergamaschi v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 1959 A.M.C. 1862 (S.D.N.Y.); Pruitt v. M. S. Rigoletto, 211 F.Supp. 295 (E.D.Mich.1962). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-25\">Peter and Theresa Igneri, husband and wife, brought this action in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Cie. de Transports Ocean-iques. Their complaint invoked federal jurisdiction on the basis of diverse citizenship, the Igneris being alleged to be citizens of New York and defendant a foreign corporation. In a \u201cFirst Cause of Action,\u201d Peter Igneri claimed damages for injuries sustained when he was struck by a bale of rubber while working as a longshoreman, in the employ of a steve-doring contractor, aboard defendant\u2019s vessel in Brooklyn harbor. The injuries are claimed to be permanent and to include a fracture of the spine with complete paralysis of the lower extremities and bladder; liability was asserted on the bases of negligence by the shipowner and of unseaworthiness of the vessel. In a \u201cSecond Cause of Action,\u201d Theresa Igneri sought further damages on the ground that \u201cheretofore and for many years prior to this occurrence [she and Peter Igneri] * * * were and still are husband and wife, living together as such and in a happy connubial state * * * \u201d and that as a result of the oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>currence she \u201chas been deprived of the services of her husband, Peter Igneri, his companionship, support, love, affection and consortium, as well as all facilities and domiciliary happiness normally enjoyed in normal marriage.\u201d Judge Bar-tels granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the second cause of action as failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, 207 F.Supp. 236. Subsequently he amended his order to include the statement specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (b); we granted a timely application by Mrs. Igneri for leave to appeal, since the appeal presented a question of novel impression which ought be determined at this time so that, in the event of our disagreeing with the district judge, the two claims could be tried together.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">(1) We begin by noting our approval of Judge Bartels\u2019 overruling an argument by defendant, which indeed has not been seriously pressed in this Court, that Mrs. Igneri\u2019s claim must be dismissed because, the action having been brought on the \u201claw side\u201d, New York law controls and New York does not recognize a wife\u2019s claim for loss of consortium. Kronenbitter v. Washburn Wire Co., 4 N.Y.2d 524, 176 N.Y.S.2d 354, 151 N.E.2d 898 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Mrs. Igneri\u2019s claim is governed not by the law of New York but by the general maritime law. Although she was not aboard ship, it was the impact on her husband, which occurred on navigable waters, that caused the injury to her. Jordan v. States Marine Corp., 257 F.2d 232 (9 Cir., 1958); Pruitt v. M. S. Rigoletto, supra. The same considerations as to the desirability of uniformity that are relevant to the relations between a ship and those who work upon her apply with like force to claims by a worker\u2019s wife resulting from an injury to him. Suits by a husband, father, or wife for injury allegedly resulting from a shipboard accident to a family member have uniformly been held to involve maritime torts. New York &amp; Long Branch Steamboat Co. v. Johnson, 195 F. 740 (3 Cir., 1912); Plummer v. Webb, 19 F.Cas. 891, 892-893 (No. 11,233) (C. C. Maine 1827); Pruitt v. M. S. Rigoletto, supra; Wester-berg v. Tide Water Associated Oil Co., 304 N.Y. 545, 110 N.E.2d 395 (1953). The wrong to Mrs. Igneri, if any, being maritime, it is unnecessary to do more than cite Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., 317 U.S. 239, 244-245, 63 S.Ct. 246, 87 L.Ed. 239 (1942); Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 409-410, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953); and Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U.S. 625, 628, 79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959), for the proposition that if the maritime law recognizes a claim such as that here asserted, this could not be defeated by a contrary New York rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">(2) Although New York\u2019s denial of a claim by a wife for loss of consortium is thus in no way decisive, it does not follow that reference to the common law generally is without relevance. Maritime law draws on many sources; when there are no clear precedents in the law of the sea, admiralty judges often look to the law prevailing on the land. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Gilmore and Black, Admiralty (1957), \u00a7 1-16. At least this much is true. If the common law recognized a wife\u2019s claim for loss of consortium, uniformly or nearly so, a United States admiralty court would approach the problem here by asking itself why it should not likewise do so; if the common law denied such a claim, uniformly or nearly so, the inquiry would be whether there was sufficient reason for an admiralty court\u2019s nevertheless recognizing one. Compare The Harrisburg, 119 U.S. 199, 213-214, 7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358 (1886). So we turn to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"> It was early held, and still is in the great majority of American states, that one who causes personal injury to a married woman, intentionally or negligently, is subject to liability to her husband for loss of consortium<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as for any reasonable expenses incurred by him in providing medical treatment. American Law Institute, Restatement of Torts (1938), \u00a7 693; see Prosser, Torts (2d ed. 1955), at 701; Note, Judicial Treatment of Negligent Invasion of Consortium, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1341, 1348-49 (1961). But until 1950 no decision (save for two that were rather promptly disapproved <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) allowed a recovery by a wife for loss of consortium resulting from a negligent injury to her husband. Restatement of Torts, supra, \u00a7 695; 1 Harper &amp; James* Torts (1956), at 641; Holbrook, The Change in the Meaning of Consortium, 22 Mich.L.Rev. 1, 2-4 (1923). In that year the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., 87 U.S.App. D.C. 57, 183 F.2d 811, rejected the monolithic authority to the contrary and held, under the domestic law of the District,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a wife could obtain such a recovery. Since 1950' eight state courts have followed the Hitaffer decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> federal courts have interpreted the law of two other states to the same effect,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in one state the same result has been achieved by statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As against the 12 American jurisdictions <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which may thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>be said \u00edo have espoused the Hitaffer result, 19 such jurisdictions, which have considered the question since Hitaffer, have continued to deny recovery to a wife.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> So also has the House of Lords, Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co., [1952] A.C. 716, without a dissenting voice. However, in a number of these cases the opinions have made it plain, and others have implied, that the court agreed with Hitaffer in principle but felt constrained to leave any \u201cchange in the common law\u201d to the legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The commentator vote has been considerably more favorable to the Hitaffer result than the judicial. We have found only two voices,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but these notable ones, against the wife\u2019s recovery.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The prime argument for the Hita\u00edfer result is equality between the sexes. Since the husband\u2019s cause of action for negligent invasion of consortium is generally recognized, it is said to fly in the face of the modern policy favoring the \u201cemancipation\u201d of married women to deny a corresponding action to the wife, whose \u201cinterest in the undisturbed relation with her consort is no less worthy of protection than that of her husband.\u201d Prosser, supra, at 704; see Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., supra, 183 F.2d at 819; cf. Bennett v. Bennett, 116 N.Y. 584, 590-91, 23 N.E. 17, 18-19, 6 L.R.A. 553 (1889). The wife\u2019s interest in the marital relation having long been accorded legal protection by claims for alienation of affections and similar torts, see Bennett v. Bennett, supra, it is argued that \u201c[r]elief is extended to the wife in [these] * * * cases for one basic reason, the interest of society in the protection of the family * * *. If this is the interest to be protected, * * * the law\u2019s protection should extend as well to the negligent as to the intentional injury.\u201d Montgomery v. Stephan, supra note 5, 101 N.W.2d at 234; see Lippman, supra, 30 Colum.L.Rev. at 668. The \u201cintentional\u201d nature of such torts as alienation of affections, is said not to afford a valid reason to \u201cinvoke the principle which gives a right of action for an act done malevolently when no right of action would exist if the act were done without malice,\u201d since in such torts \u201cthere is never that active malevolence toward the plaintiff which is made the gist of the right of action.\u201d Holbrook, supra, 22 Mich.L.Rev. at 8.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, it is urged that the harm done to the wife through serious injury to the husband is undeniably real, if only because \u201ca sick, lame, nervous spouse is less desirable as a companion than a spouse in normal physical condition,\u201d Holbrook, supra, 22 Mich.L.Rev. at 8, but more especially when the injury permanently forecloses the wife\u2019s opportunity of having sexual relations and bearing children. Hence, it is said, the law should grant the wife such compensation as it can for the harm that she has suffered, and will continue to suffer, through the fault of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The opposing arguments begin with the long history of common law authority against the wife\u2019s action, see Deshotel v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry., supra, 328 P.2d at 451,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but in no way stop there. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>contended that when the husband sues for his wife\u2019s injury, the real basis of his recovery is loss of her services, with the \u201csentimental\u201d aspects of the recovery being in the nature of \u201cparasitic\u201d damages; since the wife in contrast has no right to her husband\u2019s services, but rather is entitled to his reciprocal obligation of support, and since she effectively recovers for this by sharing his own recovery for lost earnings due to his injury, the alleged \u201cdiscrimination\u201d between the spouses is said to be actually a rational distinction, See Kronenbitter v. Washburn Wire Co., supra, 176 N.Y.S.2d at 355; Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co., supra, [1952] A. C. at 735-36 (Lord Reid).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With loss of services eliminated, the wife\u2019s recovery would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>involve only such elements as the diminution of the value of her husband\u2019s society and affection and the deprivation of sexual relations and the attendant loss of child-bearing opportunity \u2014 elements which, it is argued, are too personal, intangible, and conjectural to be measured in pecuniary terms by a jury. See Deshotel v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry., supra, 328 P.2d at 451; Pound, supra, 14 Mich. L.Rev. at 194, 196. It is feared, moreover, that recognition of a cause of action on behalf of the wife would lead to a \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d The husband in suing for his own injuries may recover not only for lost earnings (part of which recovery presumably goes to support his wife) but also for the impairment of function evidenced by his lost or diminished ability to engage in sexual intercourse, see Jaffe, supra, 18 Law &amp; Contemp.Prob. at 229; cf. Dagnello v. Long Island R. R., 289 F.2d 797, 808 (2 Cir., 1961); Helmstetler v. Duke Power Co., 224 N.C. 821, 824, 32 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1945), and still further, probably, for the value of his wife\u2019s nursing services. See McCormick, Damages (1935), \u00a7 90. The fear is that in the wife\u2019s suit the jury will award duplicative damages to her for some of the same elements of injury. See Jaffe, supra, at 229; Dini v. Naiditch, supra, 170 N.E.2d at 894-896 (Schaefer, C. J., dissenting). It is true that, as Chief Justice Schaefer apparently concedes, see id., 170 N.E.2d at 895, this danger would be minimized where, as in the present case, the husband and wife have joined their claims so that these may be tried to a single jury. But once the wife\u2019s cause of action was recognized, the courts would have no power to require such a joinder \u2014 see 3 Moore, Federal Practice (1948), at 1808, and 1 Harper &amp; James, supra, at 640 \u2014 and it is doubted that the trial court\u2019s instructions and its own power, combined with that of the appellate Court, Dagnello v. Long Island R. R., supra, to review verdicts for ex-cessiveness would suffice to remove the danger of double recovery. Other less persuasive arguments are that the harm to the wife through her husband\u2019s injury is too \u201cindirect\u201d to warrant recovery, since it was suffered without physical impact or apprehension thereof, Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co., supra, [1952] A. C. at 731 (Lord Goddard), and that allowing recovery by the wife would open the door to claims by children of the injured man and others whose \u201crelational interests\u201d were even more attenuated. Neuberg v. Bobowicz, supra note 9, 162 A.2d at 666-67; Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co., supra, at 734 (Lord Morton of Henryton). Compare Prosser, supra, at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Finally, in answer to the \u201cequality\u201d argument, it is argued that the husband\u2019s recovery for loss of consortium should itself be abrogated. That right is said to be \u201ca fossil from an earlier era,\u201d Jaffe, supra, at 229 \u2014 an anachronistic remnant of the wife\u2019s common law inability to sue and recover damages for her own injuries. Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co., supra, at 728, 733, 735 (Lords Porter, Goddard, and Morton of Henryton); Neuberg v. Bobowicz, supra, 162 A.2d at 667. Adopting this view, some states, either by statute or decision, have eliminated the husband's action,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> while others have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>stricted it to recovery for loss of services.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although several commentators approving Hitaifer have indicated that producing \u201cequality\u201d between the sexes in this way would suit them just as well,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> such a solution would be unacceptable to most adherents of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">(3) With the common law authorities so conflicting<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the opposing arguments so nearly in balance, we turn to an inquiry whether the historic common law position or the Hitaifer result comports better with other relevant elements of maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Defendant contends that the former answer can be rather quickly reached on the basis that the maritime law does not recognize even a husband\u2019s right to sue for loss of consortium, so that the \u201cequality\u201d argument is unavailable to the wife. In a District Court opinion in Savage v. New York, N. &amp; H. S. S. Co., adopted by this Court, 185 F. 778, 781 (1911), Judge Hough stated in dictum that \u201cNo instance of what is in substance an action per quod consortium amisit has been shown in admiralty.\u201d But in the following year in New York &amp; Long Branch Steamboat Co. v. Johnson, supra, 195 F. 740 (3 Cir., 1912), a court created precisely such an \u201cinstance * * * in admiralty\u201d by holding that a husband could sue \u201cfor the injury sustained by him through said injury to his wife\u201d while a passenger on a steamship; the husband was awarded $1,147, of which $447 was for medical expenses and $700 \u201cfor the loss of the aid, comfort and society of his wife * * * including therein probable future deprivation and expenses.\u201d (Record on Appeal, p. 237) The decision relied on two authorities, neither entirely relevant. One was the decision by Mr. Justice Story on circuit in Plummer v. Webb, supra, 19 F.Cas. 891, that a father, having a right to the services of his minor children, might sue in admiralty for damages from the tortious abduction of his son while on an ocean voyage. The other, even more dubious, was The Sea Gull, 21 F.Cas. 909 (No. 12,578) (C.C.Md.1865), allowing a husband to recover for his wife\u2019s death \u2014 a situation in which damages have traditionally been limited to the \u201cpecuniary\u201d loss without the sentimental aspects of consortium, see Michigan Central R. R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U.S. 59, 70-74, 33 S.Ct. 192, 57 L.Ed. 417 (1913), Gerardo v. United States, 101 F.Supp. 383, 385 (N.D.Cal.1951), and a decision which was overruled by The Harrisburg, supra, 119 U.S. 199, 7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358. On the other hand, the dismissal of a husband\u2019s action for both medical expenses and loss of society as the result of an alleged assault on his wife during a steamship voyage was affirmed, although without any explanation, in Klein v. Munson S.S. Line, 1934 A.M. C. 1310, 242 App.Div. 179, 272 N.Y.S. 704 (1st Dept.1934).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>no maritime cases relating to claims by wives for loss of consortium other than the district court decisions denying such claims by wives of longshoremen which we cited at the outset, and certain decisions denying such claims by wives of seamen which we will discuss below. Our investigation of maritime law generally being thus inconclusive, we turn to the particular bases for recovery here asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">(4) We deal first with the claim based on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">If Peter Igneri had been a seaman, it would be altogether clear that his spouse\u2019s claim based on negligent injury to him would fail. Prior to the Jones Act, this result would have been readily reached on the basis, severely criticized, see 1 Harper &amp; James, supra, at 640, but nevertheless uniformly followed, that where the person directly injured has no claim, as the seaman did not, The Osceola, supra, 189 U.S. at 175, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760, the spouse also has none. See Savage v. New York, N. &amp; H. S. S. Co., supra, 185 F. at 781; Gustafson v. Swedish American Line, 1940 A.M.C. 86 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Kings County, 1940); Smither &amp; Co. v. Coles, supra; 1 Harper &amp; James, supra, at 640. When Congress, by the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, gave a seaman the right to recover for personal injury caused- by the employer\u2019s negligence, it did not authorize recovery by the seaman\u2019s wife for loss of consortium. As to non-fatal injuries this is plain from the language of the statute, which authorizes only the seaman himself (not his wife) to \u201cmaintain an action for damages at law.\u201d Westerberg v. Tide Water Associated Oil Co., supra, 304 N.Y. \u2019 545, 110 N.E.2d 395; Jordan v. States Marine Corp., supra, 257 F.2d at 233 (by concession). And it is established also that the damages recoverable by a seaman\u2019s widow suing for wrongful death under the Jones Act do not include recovery for loss of consortium. Tate v. C. G. Willis, Inc., 154 F.Supp. 402, 403 (E.D.Va.1957); Gerardo v. United States, supra, 101 F.Supp. at 385, and authorities cited; see Michigan Central R. R. v. Vreeland, supra, 227 U.S. at 71.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">It is true that, as a longshoreman, Peter Igneri, unlike a seaman, had a right to recover for personal injury for negligence of the vessel, based on non-statutory maritime law. Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, supra, 346 U.S. at 413, 74 S. Ct. at 207, 98 L.Ed. 143 and cases cited in note 4 (1953). But that does not mean that in considering the novel question whether the spouse of a longshoreman should be allowed to recover for loss of consortium, we should ignore the maritime law denying any such right to the spouse of a seaman. The failure of the Jones Act to confer such a right on the spouse of a seaman cannot be dismissed as an inadvertence. The policy of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, the r\u00e9gime which the Jones Act made applicable to seamen, was that the new remedy for the employee was to be exclusive and that claims of relatives recognized by state law were to be abrogated; the FELA had been thus authoritatively construed before the Jones Act was passed, New York Central &amp; H. R. R. Co. v. Tonsellito, 244 U.S. 360, 37 S.Ct. 620, 61 L.Ed. 1194 (1917); see Louisville &amp; N. R. R. Co. v. Lunsford, 216 Ga. 289, 116 S. E.2d 232 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>If there were evidence that maritime law generally recognized a claim for negligent injury to such an intangible right, or if the common law clearly authorized a wife\u2019s recovery, the gravitational pull of such concepts with respect to the wife of a longshoreman might be stronger than that of the analogy to the statute denying such recovery to a seaman\u2019s wife. But, with neither of these conditions realized, our duty to avoid capricious differences in treatment between similarly situated persons forbids our fashioning a rule that would place the spouse of a harbor-worker in a different, and better, position than the spouse of a seaman. Perceiving the anomaly in the rule which forbade a seaman, but not a harbor-worker, to recover for negligence against the ship, Congress largely ended the discrimination against seamen by passing the Jones Act; we should not create a new anomaly by giving the harbor-worker\u2019s wife a claim denied to the seaman\u2019s. Here Congress has utilized its constitutional power \u201cto alter, qualify, or supplement\u201d the maritime law \u201cas experience or changing conditions might require,\u201d Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U.S. 375, 386, 44 S.Ct. 391, 393-394, 68 L.Ed. 748 (1924). Its action in doing so \u201cmust not be read in a spirit of mutilating narrowness\u201d; the courts must give \u201c \u2018hospitable scope\u2019 to Congressional purpose even when meticulous words are lacking.\u201d United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 235, 61 S.Ct. 463, 467-468, 85 L.Ed. 788 (1941). We can think of no reason why Congress, having ruled out a maritime claim against the ship for loss of consortium by the spouse of a negligently injured seaman, would wish the courts to construct one for the spouse of a negligently injured stevedore.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">(5) We come finally to the wife's claim based upon a warranty of seaworthiness. That doctrine, as stated in Mr. Justice Brown\u2019s much quoted second proposition in The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 175, 23 S.Ct. 483, 487, 47 L.Ed. 760 (1903), is \u201cThat the vessel and her owner are, both by English and American law, liable to an indemnity for injuries received by seamen in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or a failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.\u201d Nothing was said as to the doctrine\u2019s going beyond the seaman so as to include his wife or children. Nor do we find any basis for such an extension in later Supreme Court decisions, of which Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946), would be most helpful to the appellant. True, the opinion in that case declared \u201cthat contract alone is neither the sole source of the liability [for unseaworthiness] nor its ultimate boundary\u201d, and that the warranty of seaworthiness extended beyond seamen to others \u201cwho do the work of the sea without benefit of contract with the owner,\" 328 U.S. at 91, 66 S.Ct. at 876, 90 L.Ed. 1099. But the augmentation thus effected was still limited to persons doing the ship\u2019s work \u2014 the owner may not nullify his liability for unseaworthiness \u201cby the device of having all who man the ship hired by others willing to furnish men for such service at sea or ashore\u201d, 328 U.S. at 91-92, 66 S.Ct. at 876, 90 L.Ed. 1099; the liability extends to cases \u201cwhere the ship\u2019s work is done by others not in such an immediate relation of employment to the owner\u201d, 328 U.S. at 93, 66 S.Ct. at 876-877, 90 L.Ed. 1099 \u201cto those who render [the ship\u2019s service] with his consent or by his arrangement,\u201d 328 U.S. at 95, 66 S.Ct. at 877-878, 90 L.Ed. 1099, to \u201cmen intermediately employed to do this work,\u201d 328 U.S. at 96, 66 S.Ct. at 878, 90 L.Ed. 1099. Nothing in this would suggest that the warranty of seaworthiness extends to relatives of the maritime worker, of whose very existence the shipowner may be unaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We would not be understood as suggesting that the issue of extending the warranty of seaworthiness beyond marine workers was before the Supreme Court in these cases so that the Court\u2019s declarations that the warranty existed as to the workers would necessarily preclude its running to their spouses. The point is rather that when the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>has created \u201ca species of liability without fault, analogous to other well known instances in our law,\u201d Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, supra, 328 U.S. at 94, 66 S.Ct. at 877, 90 L.Ed. 1099 it should not be lightly assumed that this strict liability runs to other persons not stated to be within its reach. When our law imposes strict liability, it often accompanies this with limitations, not existing in the case of liability based on fault, as to amount, as to persons benefited, or as to both. The considerations justifying absolute liability of shipowners for injury to the person or maritime workers do not necessarily prevail as to the interests of others in their relations with them \u2014 interests which, however real, rank lower in their claim for economic protection. Social policy may well require absolute liability for physical injury without imposing similar strict liability on actors and, indirectly, on the community, for damages less susceptible of monetary compensation. Recovery for personal injuries due to unseaworthiness was said by Judge Learned Hand to be \u201ca kind of \u2018Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u2019 \u201d, Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919, 923 (2 Cir., 1956); workmen\u2019s compensation acts characteristically exclude suits by spouses or other relatives, see, e. g., the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905; 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 66.20; Smither &amp; Co. v. Coles, supra, overruling the Hitaffer case on this point, and cases cited at pp. 225-26, and Thibo-deaux v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., 276 F.2d 42, 47 (5 Cir., 1960). As Professor Jaffe has noted, the elimination of fault as the basis of liability deprives the damages award of any punitive or deterrent purpose, and requires consideration whether \u201cthe pooled social fund of savings should be charged with sums of indeterminate amount when compensation performs no specific economic function.\u201d 18 Law &amp; Contemp.Prob. at 225. Appellant has cited no instance in which our law has allowed recovery for intangible injuries in the absence of fault; indeed, it has been rather slow to extent recovery for such injuries beyond intentional wrongs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Beyond all this our conclusion on the unseaworthiness claim is controlled by the negative result we have reached with respect to negligence. It would be anomalous in the last degree to hold that strict liability should have a broader reach than a related liability based upon fault. We can see no sensible basis for saying that although Congress ruled out a claim by the wife of a seaman against a palpably negligent shipowner, the wife of a longshoreman can recover against a shipowner who has been wholly without fault. Our conclusion, it should be emphasized, does not rest on the discrimination between the sexes criticized by Hitaffer and its supporters; we would reach the same result in the rare case of the husband of a seawoman as in the common ones of the wife of a seaman or of the stevedore doing seaman\u2019s work. We hold that the scheme of remedies, statutory and judicial, for injury to such maritime workers limits recovery to the person directly injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. It is true that in actions brought to recover for the death of longshoremen injured while working aboard ship in state territorial waters, state law is held to govern the existence and also the attributes of a cause of action for wrongful death. Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U.S. 233, 42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210 (1921) ; The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U.S. 588, 79 S.Ct. 503, 3 L.Ed.2d 524 (1959). But this is a special situation wherein state law is utilized to fill a gap in the maritime law, created by the holding, in The Harrisburg, 119 U.S. 199, 7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358 (1886), that there is no liability for wrongful death under the general maritime law \u2014 a holding which a penetrating commentator has suggested the Supreme Court would have done better to overrule.

Indeed, it has been contended that the harm to the wife by negligently inflicted loss of consortium will often be greater than that done by an \u201cintentional\u201d invasion, since \u201cdesertion is usually, and adultery always grounds for divorce, thus affording the injured spouse a chance to remarry, but physical disability of a spouse never leads to a legal opportunity to start anew and build a healthy family. Instead, in serious cases, the uninjured spouse is charged with the lifelong duty of nursing an invalid, and frequently must forego the privilege of having legitimate children.\u201d Note, supra, 61 Colum.L.Rev. at 1354. On the other hand, Professor Jaffe argues, supra, 18 Daw &amp; Oontemp.Prob. at 229: \u201cBut the law, of course, often distinguishes between willful and negligent interference as in the cases of emotional distress. An interest is protected only in so far as it serves a social purpose to protect it. When the act is willful the law may award damages for penal purposes. But more basically the law quite properly recognizes that a willful assault on the personality inflicts a far more serious blow. It is almost unthinkable that a court should reduce consortium to the bare element of the opportunity for sexual intercourse and pretend to see no basic difference of offense to the wife\u2019s interest between the incidental loss of that opportunity and the deliberate destruction of the whole marital relationship.\u201d Proponents of the wife\u2019s claim would, of course, deny that it relates solely \u201cto the bare element of the opportunity for sexual intercourse * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\">. In Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co., supra, [1952] A.C. at 730, Lord Goddard makes a point \u2014 also noted in Brett, supra, 29 Austral.L.J. at 395 \u2014 which would render the absence of authority more significant than it has seemed to some courts and commentators. Proponents of the wife\u2019s action have sometimes sought to explain the lack of common law precedent as flowing from the wife\u2019s procedural inability, before passage of the Married Women\u2019s Acts, to bring any action without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>joining her husband as plaintiff; she had the right here contended for, it is said, but no remedy. Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., supra, 183 F.2d at 816. Lord Goddard concedes that the procedural bar might account for the absence of authority, prior to the Married Women's Acts, for a wife\u2019s action for alienation of affections or similar torts, since in such cases the husband \u201cwould hardly be willing to sue his own mistress,\u201d Brett, supra, 29 Austral.L.J. at 393, and if he did, would be profiting by his own wrong. See Pros-ser, supra, at 690-91; Bennett v. Bennett, supra, 116 N.Y. at 594, 23 N.E. at 20. But there is no reason to suppose that if the wife truly had a right to recover damages for loss of consortium resulting from physical injuries to her husband, the husband would have refused to lend his name to her action so as to provide her with a remedy, \u201cespecially as in the old law the damages when recovered would belong to him.\u201d [1952] A.C. at 730. Compare Holbrook, supra, 22 Mich.L.Rev. at 2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"AbP\">It thus seems likely that the absence of pre-1950 authority for the wife\u2019s recovery bespoke not merely a procedural but a substantive disability. Blackstone was apparently of this view: \u201cnotice is only taken of the wrong done to the superior of the parties related, by the breach and dissolution of either the relation itself, or at least the advantages accruing therefrom; while the loss of the inferior by such injuries is totally unregarded.\u201d 3 Blackstone, Commentaries <em>* </em>143. See also Brett, supra, 29 Austral. L.J. at 322. An American court which conceded that \u201cthe fundamental reason the wife could not recover at common law * * * was on account of <em>her inferior </em>status\u201d has gone on to describe that concept as \u201ctotally repudiated\u201d by modern legislation and to rely squarely on this policy reversal as a ground for recognizing the wife\u2019s action today. Novak v. Kansas City Transit, Inc., supra, note 5, 365 S.W.2d at 543, 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. But see Brett, supra, 29 Austral.L.J. at 396: \u201c[I]n the middle of the twentieth eentury, there is no principle which justifies giving the action to a husband and denying it to a wife. This can only be justified by an appeal to history. But history does not support the extension, approved by the House [of Lords in Best v. Samuel Eox &amp; Co., supra], of the enticement [or alienation of affections] action to the wife.\u201d Moreover, the historical assumption that loss of services constitutes the heart of the husband\u2019s recovery has been strongly attacked. See, e. g., Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., supra, 183 F.2d at 813; Dini v. Naiditch, supra, 170 N.E.2d at 891. Prosser states that \u201cThe loss of \u2018services\u2019 is an outworn fiction,\u201d at 704, and Harper &amp; James that \u201cthe often hypothetical \u2018services\u2019 may [be] and frequently are the least valuable aspect of the incidents of the marital relation which presumably are as valuable to the wife as to the husband * * * \u201d Yol. 1, at 643. It is further pointed out that damages may be awarded for alienation of affections without pleading or proving any loss of services, see Bennett v. Bennett, supra, 116 N.Y. at 587, 23 N.E. at 17. The \u201cdismemberment\u201d of the concept of consortium so as to give a predominant role to the element of services is also said to lack valid precedent. See Lippman, supra, 30 Colum.L.Rev. at 666-67. It does appear, as argued in Note, supra, 61 Colum.L.Rev. at 1343 \u2014 44, that the earliest cases allowing recovery to the husband, although they often employed the master-servant analogy, were more concerned about the loss of society and comfort than the loss of services. See, e. g., Guy v. Lusy, 2 Rolle 51, 81 Eng.Rep. 653 (K.B. 1618) (\u201cmes cest action next founded pur as-cun toi't fait al feme, bes sur le prejudice que le baron ad sustaine, viz. le perder del\u2019 company, &amp; comfort que un feme port a sa baron * * *.\u201d); Hyde v. Scyssor, 3 Cro. 538, 79 Eng.Rep. 462 (K.B. 1619) (\u201cbut here the action is not brought for the battery of his wife, but for the loss and damage of the husband, for want of her company and aid * * * as where an action brought by the master for the battery of his servant * <em>* </em>*.\u201d) ; Young v.

It was said in 1916 that the civil law does not impose civil liability for negligent injury to the \u201csentimental\u201d aspects of the marital relation, see Pound, supra note 11, 14 Mich.L.Rev. at 189 \u2014 a point that would be of some importance in determining the content of maritime law. However, it appears doubtful that the statement correctly represents French law as that has recently evolved. See Marty et Reynaud, Droit Civil (1962), Nos. 382, 383, 384. The German Civil Code, Art. 845, recognizes a delictual liability for loss of services, but Art. 253 would seem literally to rule out a claim for the non-peeuniary elements of consortium; we bave not investigated the texts or the authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b315-15\">. The broad statement in 1 Benedict, Admiralty (6th ed. Knauth, 1940), at 366, that \u201cWhen a personal injury to a wife is maritime by locality, her husband may recover his damages for loss of her services, loss of consortium, etc., in admiralty,\u201d thus rests solely on N. Y. &amp; Long Branch Steamboat Co. v. Johnson, supra. The Sea Gull, supra, also cited, is inapposite, for reasons indicated in the text. Such cases as Gustafson v. Swedish American Line, 1940 A.M.C. 86 (N.Y. Sup.Ct. Kings County, 1940), La Frate v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, 1952 AM.C. 544 (S.D.N.Y.1952), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Born v. Norwegian America Line, Inc., 173 F.Supp. 33 (S.D.N.Y.1959), cited in the 1962 pocket supplement to Benedict as authority for the proposition in question, similarly fail to support it.' They do not hold that the husband can recover for loss of his wife\u2019s consortium or even for the services element thereof, but go off on the ground that any action brought by the husband on the basis of the wife\u2019s shipboard injury is subject to the same defenses, arising out of the contract of carriage, as her own action would be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b316-14\">. Under the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 761, a widow can recover damages only for the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d sustained by the death, and not for the loss of her husband\u2019s society and companionship. Middleton v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., 70 F.2d 326, 330 (2 Cir., 1934); First Nat\u2019l Bank in Greenwich v. National Airlines, Inc., 171 F.Supp. 528, 537 (S.D.N.Y.1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b318-4\">. Historically the husband\u2019s action for loss of consortium existed in the case of intentional or negligent acts by the defendant. Although the formulation in the Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 693a, that the defendant is liable to the husband whenever its conduct is tortious toward the wife bas a convenient symmetry, there seems to be almost no authority for \u2014 or against \u2014 the imposition of liability when the defendant has been without fault, and, as suggested in the text, this result is in no way inevitable as a matter of policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
