The question presented is whether the suit is barred by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1025. The district court concluded that the insurer was an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 211 F.Supp. 541 (E.D.Pa.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-20\">The complaint avers that, while in the employ of Cuneo Eastern Press, Inc., Mays was injured when a paper roll \u201csuddenly came loose from the \u2018mansaver device\u2019 being used to transport it in the warehouse of the plaintiff\u2019s employer, and from its own external protective wrapping, and the said paper roll did then and there strike the paper rolls on which the plaintiff was standing in order to do his work, forcing the plaintiff to fall to the floor and subsequently, the above said paper roll did fall on the plaintiff.\u201d Extensive injuries are alleged. The theory of the case was that pursuant to its policy of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Insurance, defendant had a duty to inspect the work places, machinery, and equipment of the employer, and to advise and make recommendations concerning the existence of any \u201cunsafe, hazardous, dangerous, and negligent conditions.\u201d The complaint further alleged that breach of that duty caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-21\">While rejecting this interpretation of the contract of insurance, the district court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-22\">\u201c * * * Liberty admitted in answers to interrogatories put to it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Mays in Civil Action No. 31005 that it did undertake some safety inspections of the Cuneo plant. Thus, while there was no contractual obligation, the voluntary undertaking of such a program by Liberty possibly may have created a duty. However, as the facts are not yet sufficiently developed, an ultimate finding on the existence of a duty cannot be made prior, to a hearing on the merits. At this point it cannot be said that as a matter of law Liberty had no duty to Mays.\u201d 211 F.Supp. at 542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Since there is a genuine issue of material fact on the question of an enforceable duty,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as the district court\u2019s decision was premised solely on its construction of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the correctness of that construction is the only question we decide on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The appellate courts of Pennsylvania have not passed upon the question. The problem, though novel, is wholly one of statutory construction. More particularly, as we have previously stated, it is refined to the question of whether the insurance carrier is an \u201cemployer\u201d as that term is defined in the statute. Accordingly, we start with that definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201c\u00a7 21. \u2018Employer\u2019 defined</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018employer,\u2019 as used in this act, <em>is declared to be synonymous with master,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and to include natural persons, partnerships, joint-stock companies, corporations for profit, corporations not for profit, municipal corporations, the Commonwealth, and all governmental agencies created by it.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-19\">It is not contended that Liberty is in any sense the master of Mays, and, thus, as the district court observed, \u201cThe specific language of this section would apparently exclude from the definition of \u2018employer\u2019 anything not therein included.\u201d However, the court was impressed with the expanded definition of the term found in Article IV, \u00a7 401 of the Act, and with the subrogation rights of insurance carriers. The relevant portion of \u00a7 401 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-20\">\u201cThe term \u2018Employer,\u2019 <em>when used in this article, </em>shall mean the employer as defined in article one of this act, or his duly authorized agent, or his insurer if such insurer has assumed the employer\u2019s liability, or the fund if the employer be insured therein.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">The district court reasoned that, \u201c[u]n-der the Act, the carrier cannot assume any portion of the employer\u2019s recognized duty without assuming the corresponding liability. Having assumed a portion of the employer\u2019s liability, the carrier stands in the shoes of the employer under the Pennsylvania Act.\u201d 211 F.Supp. at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-22\"> But the legislature has defined the term \u201cemployer\u201d in words which are clear and free from all ambiguity. The mandate of the Pennsylvania Statutory Construction Act requires adherence to that definition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****8Nor is this legislative command made inapplicable by the definition contained in Article IV, \u00a7 401 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Article IV relates solely to procedure, and \u00a7 401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>specifically states that the definition therein contained applies only \u201cwhen used in this article.\u201d Since the Act contemplates a system of compensation insurance, it is perfectly reasonable that the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, which pays the injured employee, be given the same procedural rights as the insured employer. Of course, the reference in \u00a7 401 to an insurer who \u201chas assumed the employer\u2019s liability\u201d means the liability to pay compensation to the injured employee, for under the Act that is the extent of the employer\u2019s liability. From this it is clear that, rather than expanding the principal definition of \u201cemployer\u201d, \u00a7 401 serves only this limited purpose. In this respect the definition in that section supports the position of Mays, for when the legislature intended to equate the insurer with the employer, it did so specifically in unequivocal terms. Its failure to do so in the clear, unambiguous definition found in \u00a7 103, 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 21, is an indication that it did not intend to blend their jural personalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"> It is beyond dispute that the Act affects only the legal relations between employer and employee and does not purport to alter the employee\u2019s rights against third parties. On the contrary, the statute acknowledges the viability of those rights. 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 671. Thus, insofar as the employment relationship is concerned, the statute must be liberally construed in order to effectuate its remedial purpose, but its scope cannot be extended in a manner which would destroy either the employee\u2019s common-law rights against third persons, or the common-law conception of third persons. Zimmer v. Casey, 296 Pa. 529, 146 A. 130 (1929). The essence, indeed the very legislative definition, of the employer-employee status is the master-servant relationship. As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in Zimmer, 146 A. at 131, \u201cThe act does not affect the existing common-law right to sue the wrongdoer, unless that wrongdoer is the master.\u201d The master-servant relationship is totally lacking in the matter sub judice. Hence, to hold that Liberty is the employer of Mays within the meaning of the Act would not only be to abrogate by judicial legislation the employee\u2019s common-law rights, but would directly contravene the intent of the legislature as-manifested in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We conclude therefore that this suit is not barred by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. That conclusion is in accord with the decisions of the few appellate courts which have considered the problem under similar statutes^ Fabricius v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 121 N.W.2d 361 (Iowa, 1963); Smith v. American Employers\u2019 Insurance Co., 102 N.H. 530, 163 A.2d 564 (1960). Although the holding in the latter case was-followed by an amendment of the New Hampshire legislature equating the insurance carrier with the employer, this is certainly no indication that the two' were intended to be merged under the prior statute. Fabricius v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 121 N.W.2d at 365. Although it does not decide the precise issue posed by the case at bar, our holding in Waldron v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 141 F.2d 230 (C.A.3, 1944), supports our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Liberty cites Nelson v. Union Wire Rope Corp., 39 Ill.App.2d 73, 187 N.E.2d 425 (1963). But that decision was premised on the legal conclusion that the insurer owed no enforceable duty to the injured employees, 187 N.E.2d at 453, a question expressly left open by the district court in the instant case pending a hearing on the merits. The subsequent language of the court in Nelson, 187 N.E.2d at 453, equating the insurer with the employer, is dicta, and insofar as it may be considered decisional, we reject it. The same observations apply to the unreported decision of the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court in Roney v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (C.P. No. 1, July 20, 196-2). Liberty\u2019s reliance on the two Raines cases of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Raines v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mutual Casualty Insurance Co., 385 Pa. 464, 123 A.2d 420 (1956), and 391 Pa. 175, 137 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>257 (1958), is likewise misplaced. Those decisions also turned upon the absence of an enforceable duty; indeed, the court assumed, arguendo, that the insurer\u2019s identity was not merged with that of the employer. 123 A.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">- [5] Liberty argues that permitting this suit will result in the insurance carrier being subrogated to a right of action against itself. The answer is that the insurer would have a setoff to the extent of the compensation paid. Fabricius v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 121 N.W.2d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The insurer\u2019s final argument is based on what it terms \u201cpressing considerations of public policy.\u201d It is urged that our determination will cause insurance companies to refrain from making safety inspections, and that the \u201cultimate losers will be workmen and their families\u201d because of an increase in the incidence and severity of industrial accidents. There can be no doubt of the value of a safety program. This, however, is not to say that insurance carriers are motivated solely by altruism or derive no financial benefit from a safety inspection policy. It is obvious that the cost of workmen\u2019s compensation becomes less and less expensive as more and better safety methods are devised and put into operation. We point this out not to suggest that the insurer has a duty to inspect, but simply to show that a policy of inspection has practical advantages for the insurer, as well as for the employer and his workmen. We think the following excerpt from Fabricius, 121 N.W.2d at 366, is particularly apposite to the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201cDefendant strongly urges what it calls practical effects and sound public policy. It suggests curtailment of inspections by insurers and discontinuing by insurers of writing workmen\u2019s compensation insurance in Iowa. Plaintiff\u2019s answer is, no inspection is better than a negligent one. We are inclined to agree. We rather doubt that all insurers will leave the field. Defendant further invites us into the field of legislative intent and sound public policy on the broad basis of the entire act and what to it are unusual and inequitable situations. In this regard it is the policy of this court not to interpret a statute as depriving one of a common law right unless the statute clearly so states [citing cases]. The power to deprive one of a common law action is vested in the legislature under its police power upon declared public policy of the state when circumstances and conditions warrant such action. In this regard the rejection feature of the compensation act should be noted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAY\">The logic of this explication is unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. Because of this factual issue, we cannot accept Liberty\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, it owed no enforceable duty to Mays.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-12\">. Conversely, the statute defines \u201cemployee\u201d as being synonymous with servant. 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-15\">. \u201c\u00a7 551.
