Prior to his trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence consisting of narcotics obtained in the search subsequent to his arrest, on the grounds that he was arrested without probable cause and that the subsequent search was illegal. This motion was carefully considered and denied by Judge Cashin prior to the trial. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 204 F.Supp. 641. Defendant now renews his contention and argues that the forcible entry of the agents was illegal because they did not state their purpose as required by Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 482, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed. 2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">In this case, unlike Wong Sun, the agents immediately identified themselves without attempt at deception. As in United States v. Nicholas, 2 Cir., 319 F.2d 697, the conduct of defendant and his aunt on learning the agents\u2019 identity made the announcement of their purpose a \u201cuseless gesture.\u201d This conduct, combined with the easily disposable nature of the evidence sought, justified their subsequent actions. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 483-484, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441; cf. Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Our thanks are due Mrs. Oberman and the New York Legal Aid Society for effective representation of the defendant on assignment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
