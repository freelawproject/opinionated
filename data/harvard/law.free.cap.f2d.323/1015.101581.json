Mitchum opposes on its prior use of \u201cEsot\u00e9rica\u201d on skin creams with which it employs the word \u201cfade.\u201d Mit-chum argues that \u201cFAYD\u201d is the phonetic equivalent of \u201cfade\u201d and, therefore, descriptive of skin creams; that registration of \u201cFAYD\u201d \u201cwould be likely to cause confusion and mistake and to deceive purchasers into believing that applicant has the sole and exclusive right to the generic and descriptive word \u2018fade\u2019 and minor variations or misspellings thereof\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-26\">In sustaining the opposition the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board stated:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-27\">\u201cThe word \u2018fade\u2019 is both an adjective and a verb but as an adjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>it has no meaning as applied to a bleaching skin cream. There can be no real question but that the verb \u2018fade\u2019 describes the action of a bleaching skin cream. As the record shows, opposer, applicant and other sellers of bleaching skin cream have used the terms \u2018fade\u2019 or \u2018fades\u2019 descriptively. It is true that applicant does not use \u2018FADE\u2019 as a mark and that the mark that it does use, viz., \u2018FAYD\u2019 is not a dictionary term and is not used by opposer. Applicant\u2019s mark \u2018FAYD,\u2019 however, is but the phonetic equivalent of \u2018fade\u2019 and notwithstanding the misspelling, does not lose that identity, that is to say, the purchasing public of bleaching skin creams would recognize \u2018FAYD\u2019 as being the equivalent of \u2018fade\u2019 and meaning \u2018fade\u2019, cf. Weiss Noodle Company v. Golden Cracknel and Specialty Company [290 F.2d 845, 48 CCPA 1004], 129 USPQ 411 (CCPA, 1961).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">\u201cSince opposer has used the term \u2018fade\u2019 for a long period of time in conjunction with the sale and advertising of its bleaching skin cream, it is entitled to be free from any possible restraint in the use of that term. The presumptions arising from a registration of \u2018FAYD\u2019 for skin cream would be inconsistent with op-poser\u2019s rights to continue using \u2018fade\u2019 in its proper sense in connection with the sale of bleaching skin creams. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">We are unable to agree with that reasoning or conclusion. \u201cFade\u201d merely suggests a desired result of the instant skin creams, but can hardly be held descriptive of the creams themselves. Granted that \u201cFAYD\u201d is the phonetic equivalent of \u201cfade,\u201d under the facts here we see no reason why that circumstance should preclude its registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">We agree with the board that opposer should be free to continue its use of \u201cfade\u201d in a descriptive sense. We are aware of no statute or other authority, and none is cited, by which registration of \u201cFAYD\u201d could in anywise prevent opposer or others from continuing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-16\">.
