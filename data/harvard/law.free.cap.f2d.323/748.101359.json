Later, under agreement with the trustee, the personal injury claim was settled, and, after paying bankrupt\u2019s expenses and fees, approximately $500.00 remained. This is the sum sought by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-21\">Under \u00a7 70 of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all property, including rights of action, \u201cwhich prior to the filing of the petition he [bankrupt] could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process * * * or sequestered\u201d vests in the trustee. A proviso, however, excludes personal injury rights of action \u201cunless by the law of the State such rights * * * are subject to attachment, execution, garnishment, sequestration or other judicial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-22\">Trustee concedes that rights of action for personal injury are not subject to attachment, execution or garnishment under Wisconsin law. The vital legal question, therefore, is whether, under Wisconsin law, Buda\u2019s right of action for personal injury is subject to \u201csequestration or other judicial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-23\">The statutory basis for sequestration is given in \u00a7 128.19 of the Wisconsin Creditor\u2019s Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-24\">\u201c(1) The receiver or assignee * * * shall be vested * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>with the title of the debtor * * * hereunder, except so far as it is property which is exempt, including * * * *\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">\u201c(b) Property which prior to the filing of the petition * * * he could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">\u201c(c) Rights of action arising * * * from the unlawful taking or detention of or injury to his property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">\u2022Bankrupt concedes that his right of action was not \u201cexempt\u201d under the Wisconsin Executions Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and concedes further that his right of action at the time he filed the bankruptcy petition could have been \u201ctransferred\u201d by assignment. Lehmann v. Farwell, 95 Wis. 185, 70 N.W. 170, 37 L.R.A. 333 (1897), McGarvey v. Independent Oil &amp; Grease Co., 156 Wis. 580, 146 N.W. 895 (1914), D\u2019Angelo v. Cornell Paperboard Products Co., 19 Wis. 2d 390, 120 N.W.2d 70 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">It is our opinion that if the Wisconsin legislature intended that \u201cproperty\u201d subject to \u201csequestration\u201d should include a right of action for injuries to one\u2019s person it would not obscure that intention by the general language of paragraph (1) (b) of \u00a7 128.19 but would have placed the words \u201chis person or\u201d following the word \u201cto\u201d in paragraph (1) (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude on this point that because the right of action was transferable by assignment it was not ipso facto property which vested under \u00a7 128.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">To sustain his contention that rights of action are subject to \u201cother judicial process,\u201d trustee relies upon the Remedies Supplementary to Execution Act of Wisconsin<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides that \u201cany property\u201d of a judgment debtor not exempt is subject to be applied to satisfaction of a judgment. Trustee contends therefore that the bankrupt\u2019s right of action was a \u201cthing\u201d in action or a \u201cdebt\u201d under the statutory definition of personal property which \u201cincludes * * * things in action, evidences of debt * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We see no merit in this contention, for in Gibson v. Gibson, 43 Wis. 23 (1877), the court stated that a right of action was neither a debt nor a thing in action. 43 Wis. at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">Before the proviso with regard to personal injuries was included, \u00a7 70 sub. a(5) of the Federal Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was silent about rights of action for personal injuries, but under these prior acts it was \u201cwell settled\u201d that such rights of action were not property which vested in the trustee. Saper v. Delgado, 146 F.2d 714, 156 A.L.R. 1428 (2d Cir. 1945). Accordingly we view \u00a7 70 sub. a(5) as continuing the policy that the bankrupt\u2019s action for personal injuries belongs to him, except where applicable state law subjects such rights of action to actions by creditors. With this limited exception \u00a7 70 sub. a(5) continues to recognize that \u201c[i],t is not * * * the policy of the law\u201d to take from a wrongfully injured person the compensation for his injury to satisfy his creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Sibley v. Nason, 196 Mass. 125, 81 N.E. 887, 889, 12 L.R.A.,N.S., 1173 (1907). Without Wisconsin \u201claw\u201d to the contrary, we cannot therefore hold that Buda\u2019s right of action vested in the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">We hold that the District Court did not err in deciding that bankrupt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>right of action did not vest in the trustee, and did not err in confirming the Referee\u2019s denial of the turnover order.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-14\">. 52 Stat. 879 (1938), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110 sub. a (5) (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-26\">.

Section 128.19, enacted by the 1937 Wisconsin legislature, is fashioned after \u00a7 70 of the 1898 Bankruptcy Act, 30 Stat. 565. The same conclusion as we reached here was reached in Ruebush v. Funk, 63 F.2d 170, 172 (4th Cir. 1933). The court there read together subsections 5 and 6 of the 1898 Bankruptcy Act [paragraphs (1) (b) and (1) (c) of \u00a7 128.19] and decided that by the latter\u2019s enumeration of other specific rights of action which pass to the trustee, rights of action for personal injury were excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-25\">.
