The action was removed to the United States District Court, Western District of Missouri. Concededly, the letter was addressed to a third person, was written by appellee on April 16, 1958, and was not discovered or seen by appellant until November, 1959. The district court granted appellee\u2019s motion for a summary judgment and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint with prejudice on the ground that appellant\u2019s cause of action was barred by Missouri\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. V.A.M.S. \u00a7 516.140.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-21\">Appellant contends that a genuine issue of fact exists as to when the alleged libelous letter was published, and argues that the pleadings, admissions, depositions, and other documents do not conclusively establish that, under Missouri law, the letter was published, as found by the trial judge, on April 17, 1958 \u2014 more than two years before the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-22\">The facts are accurately set forth below at 212 F.Supp. 832 (D.C., 1963) and need no further elaboration here. Having carefully examined the record, the contentions of the parties, and the applicable Missouri law, we are satisfied that the trial court reached a permissible conclusion in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and thereby holding that the cause of action was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
