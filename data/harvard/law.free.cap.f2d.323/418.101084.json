The petition was far from clear, and apparently the Judge did not consider that there was an additional contention of the appellant in respect to his mental capacity to stand trial. The petition cited certain alleged facts in support of this contention, which seem to require at least the court\u2019s consideration as to whether a hearing is due on this issue. We remand the case for this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-28\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
