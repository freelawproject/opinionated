Appellant alleged that he had been deprived of his constitutional rights in that his State conviction was obtained with the knowing use of perjured testimony, and that the trial was held without his being afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel in order to prepare an adequate defense. This appeal is from his fourth denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts. Each petition was denied without having a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">The denial of the instant petition is dated August 28, 1962, and states as reasons for such denial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-22\">\u201cUnless it is considered otherwise in the interest of justice, a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus which presents grounds that have been previously presented or which could have been presented on a previous Petition before a federal habeas corpus court need not be later considered after being previously rejected. Title 28 U.S.C.A., Sec. 2244; McCoy v. Tucker, 4 Cir., 259 F.2d 714; Broadus-Bey v. Diamond, 6 Cir., 264 F.2d 242. No new grounds are here presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-23\">\u201cIn light of the decision by Honorable Ben C. Connally, United States District Judge, on a similar Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u25a0dated April 27,1961, from which decision an appeal would lie, Title 18, U.S.C.A. Sec. 1915, the instant Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is denied. Title 28, U.S.C.A. Sec. 2244.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The denial of relief and reasons given were undeniably correct at the time the above order was entered. Since that time, however, the Supreme Court in a \"\u201cguideline\u201d decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has held that \"\u201cwhere the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.\u201d No such hearing having been afforded appellant in the state or federal courts to date, it is plain that appellant must now be given a plenary hearing. We express no opinion on the merits of the case. The judgment of the court below is reversed and remanded for a hearing as is now required by the Supreme \u25a0Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">. Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770. Cf. Sanders v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148, relating to similar relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.

Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed. 2d 770, and Sanders v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148. I feel very strongly that this Court should not lend itself to the current, almost hysterical, movement on the part of some members of the Bar to cast \u25a0discredit upon opinions and decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. I, therefore, concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
