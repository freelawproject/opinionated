Review is also sought of the denial by the Board of petitioners\u2019 application to intervene in the Board proceeding and for rehearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *We dismiss the petition for review as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">On July 30, 1959, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the certified bargaining agent for the pilot employees of Southern Airways, notified the airline that it desired certain changes in the existing collective bargaining agreement. After extended negotiations failed to bring agreement, ALPA called a strike on June 5, 1960. The airline, while continuing negotiations, commenced hiring replacement pilots and gradually resumed full operations. On July 12, 1960, the airline made two demands at the bargaining conference with ALPA: (1) the right to discipline returning strikers for misconduct during the strike without recourse to statutory grievance procedures, and (2) super-seniority for the replacement pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">Based on these demands, ALPA filed what was in essence an unfair labor practice charge against the airline with the Board, relying upon Section 401 (k) (4) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Federal Aviation Act. Overruling the airline\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction, the Board found that both airline demands constituted refusals to bargain in good faith, and directed the airline to commence good faith bargaining within 30 days. The Board also laid down certain \u201cguidelines\u201d for bargaining, stating that \u201cthe seniority and other rights and privileges of the strikers should continue unimpaired.\u201d Later, in response to a request for clarification, it stated \u201call strikers reinstated by [the airline] upon settlement of the strike * * * are entitled to their respective places on the seniority list, ahead of all the replacement pilots retained by [the airline].\u201d Both ALPA and the airline filed timely petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then resumed negotiations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 21, 1962, they arrived at an agreement which, <em>inter alia, </em>gave the striking pilots seniority over all the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>placements. As part of the agreement, the petitions for review were withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Upon execution of the contract, the replacement pilots, petitioners here, realizing that they had been left out in the cold, hurriedly formed their own association and commenced a barrage of challenges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On October 26, 1962, they filed a petition for review of the Board order in this court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and on October 29 they petitioned the Board to reopen the proceedings, permitting them to intervene. On January 3, 1963, the petition to intervene and for a rehearing was denied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"> Petitioners allege that the Board order stands in the way of their attempt, in other courts, to enjoin operation of the bargaining agreement on the ground that the union, with the concurrence of the airline, discriminated against the replacement pilots. But the proceeding now before us is solely for review of the Board\u2019s order and a decision by this court on the validity of that order would have no <em>effect </em>because the rights and duties of the parties are now controlled by the bargaining agreement subsequently entered into. The Board, as it pointed out in its opinion denying petitioners\u2019 application for rehearing and intervention, has no jurisdiction to pass upon designations of bargaining agents or charges of discrimination in the representation function.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioners do not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">.
