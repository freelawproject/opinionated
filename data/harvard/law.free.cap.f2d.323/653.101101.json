The District Court dismissed appellant\u2019s application upon the ground that he had not exhausted all of his State remedies, particularly under the Louisiana Habeas Corpus Statute, LSA-R.S. 15:113-15:141.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">Appellant\u2019s contention as here made was presented, passed upon, and found adversely to him, both by the State trial court and the State Supreme Court. State v. Rogers, 241 La. 841, 132 So.2d 819 at 843-845. An application for <em>certiorari </em>to the United States Supreme Court was denied. 370 U.S. 963, 82 S.Ct. 1589, 8 L.Ed.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\"> It is now firmly settled that, before bringing a federal <em>habeas corpus </em>action, a convicted state prisoner need not repetitiously seek relief from the State where the same federal constitutional issues already have been decided against his contentions by the State Courts. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) ; Whitus v. Balkcom, 299 F.2d 844 (C.A. 5, 1962), reversed, <em>per curiam </em>370 U.S. 728, 82 S.Ct. 1575, 8 L.Ed.2d 803 (1962); Daugharty v. Gladden, 257 F.2d 750, 754 (C.A. 9, 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the matter is remanded for a hearing on the merits of the petition for <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
