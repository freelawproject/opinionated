The court below, after hearing on cross-motions under Rule 56 Fed.R.Civ.P. supported by affidavits, entered a judgment granting the defendants\u2019 motions and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint with costs. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Class or racial discrimination is not here involved. Stripped of <em>irrelevancies, </em>conclusory allegations and opprobrious epithets the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and his affidavit in support of his motion for summary judgment boil down to the charge that the defendants acting in concert falsely arrested the plaintiff in his home and wrongfully committed him under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 123 \u00a7 79 for ten days to the state institution for the mentally ill of which one of the defendants was the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">These basic facts emerge from the record: The defendant sergeant of police, with other subordinate officers, acting on orders of a police lieutenant based on independent telephone complaints made by the plaintiff\u2019s wife and by a neighbor of a disturbance in the plaintiff\u2019s home, went to the plaintiff\u2019s house, were admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s wife and found the plaintiff on the floor struggling with his 17-year-old son. These not being the first complaints of similar disturbances in the plaintiff\u2019s home, and the officers, being of the opinion from their observation of the plaintiff that he was not behaving rationally, carried the plaintiff- \u2014 \u25a0 he refused to walk \u2014 to a police vehicle and took him to the police station where, after he was searched and his outer clothing removed, he was put in a cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife followed the police to the station and asked the officer in charge to call the defendant doctor, who had treated various members of the plaintiff\u2019s family for years. The doctor promptly responded by coming to the police station where he spoke to the defendant and then committed him under the Massachusetts statute mentioned above to the institution of which one of the defendants was superintendent. The plaintiff was kept in the institution for nine or ten days and then released.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">Section 1985(3), supra, by its terms, does not give a cause of action for conspiracy to deny federally guaranteed rights generally, including the right to due process of law. See Dunn v. Gazzola, 216 F.2d 709, 711 (C.A. 1, 1954). It clearly \u201c * * * does not attempt to reach a conspiracy to deprive one of rights, unless it is a deprivation of equality, of \u2018equal protection of the law,\u2019 or of \u2018equal privileges and immunities under the law.\u2019 \u201d Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651, 661, 71 S.Ct. 937, 941, 95 L.Ed. 1253 (1951). That is to say, to recover under the section a plaintiff must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>invidious discrimination. \u201cBut a discriminatory purpose is not presumed, Tarrance v. Florida, 188 U.S. 519, 520, [23 S.Ct. 402, 47 L.Ed. 572]; there must be a showing of \u2018clear and intentional discrimination,\u2019 Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U.S. 183, 186 [20 S.Ct. 633, 44 L.Ed. 725]..\u201d Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 8, 64 S.Ct. 397, 401, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944). In this the plaintiff has utterly failed. Not only has he made no adequate allegation in his complaint or showing in his affidavit in support of his motion for summary judgment of a conspiracy by the defendants, but he has also wholly failed to show that he was treated any differently than anyone else would have been treated under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Section 1983, supra, gives a broader right of action than \u00a7 1985(3) albeit against a restricted class. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atl-dedup-2\">\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Since it indisputably appears from the record that the defendant doctor acted as a private practitioner in committing the plaintiff to the mental institution under the Massachusetts statute, the constitutional validity of which is not challenged, it follows that his action was that of a private citizen. Spampinato v. M. Breger &amp; Co., 270 F.2d 46, 49 (C.A. 2, 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 944, 80 S.Ct. 409, 4 L.Ed.2d 363 (1960), rehearing denied, 361 U.S. 973, 80 S.Ct. 597, 4 L.Ed.2d 553 (1960). He is not a member of the class exposed to liability under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">The defendant superintendent is not charged with brutality. For all that appears he acted in good faith on the committal signed by the defendant doctor which was in all respects fair and regular on its face. All that he did was strictly in line with his official duty. To hold him liable in damages under \u00a7 1983 would be as much a \u201cpreposterous result\u201d as this court in Francis v. Lyman, 1 Cir., 216 F.2d 583, 588 (1954), thought it would be to hold the superintendents of penal institutions acting on apparently valid warrants of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">The defendant mayor, for all that the plaintiff has made to appear in other than wholly conelusory allegations, had nothing whatever to do with the events of which the plaintiff complains..</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">The defendant police officers were certainly acting \u201cunder color\u201d of law when they took the plaintiff into custody. Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 107, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 et seq. (1945). But, disregarding conelusory allegations of the pleader, the plaintiff, and accepting as true the uncontradicted assertions of fact in the defendants\u2019 affidavits, the plaintiff has failed to make out a case of deprivation of any federally secured right, privilege or immunity. For all that appears the police responded to a call for help from the plaintiff\u2019s wife and when she admitted them to the plaintiff\u2019s house, observing the plaintiff\u2019s conduct to be irrational, even violent, took him into custody using no more force than circumstances warranted. It does not appear that the police made any mistake. But if they did, not every police error of law or fact arises to the dignity of a deprivation of a federally secured right, privilege or immunity. Agnew v. City of Compton, 239 F.2d 226, 230, 231 (C.A. 9, 1957), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 959, 77 S.Ct. 868, 1 L.Ed.2d 910 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
