E. L. A. death action against the Pennsylvania Railroad. It is claimed that a verdict should have been directed in plaintiff\u2019s favor and that it was prejudicial error to receive in evidence a record card of the railroad containing matter relating to the conduct of a \u201ckey\u201d witness for plaintiff and to his discharge or resignation from the employ of the railroad. There is ample evidence to support the verdict. Indeed, plaintiff barely made out a <em>prima facie </em>case. It would have been plain error had plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict been granted. As the proof objected to tended to establish the hostility of the witness to the railroad it was independ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ently admissible for consideration by the jury on the issue of the credibility of the witness. Such evidence, unlike that of proof of prior inconsistent statements, requires no foundation by questions on the cross-examination of the witness. United States v. Beekman, 2 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 580; People v. McDowell, 1961, 9 N.Y.2d 12, 210 N.Y.S.2d 514, 172 N.E.2d 279. The trial judge instructed the jury that this proof was to be considered solely on the issue of the credibility of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
