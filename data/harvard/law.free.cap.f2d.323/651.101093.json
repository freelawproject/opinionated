United States, 366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961), to support his argument that Bittner, and not the taxpayer, should be taxed upon the embezzled funds. The James case is authority for taxpayer\u2019s argument that the embezzled money was taxable to Bittner, but not authority for the conclusion that therefore the Tax Court\u2019s judgment against taxpayer must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">Taxpayer also relies upon Alsop v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 290 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1960). In Alsop the embezzled funds were never credited to the taxpayer\u2019s account, nor used for taxpayer\u2019s benefit. Here the bartender received the money, deposited it in taxpayer\u2019s cash register, and used it in taxpayer\u2019s business before the embezzlement. Taxpayer was given a definite economic benefit from the receipt of the money prior to its embezzlement. Also, the taxpayer in Alsop reported the em-bezzlements as losses for the years in which they were discovered, but had never reported as income the amounts embezzled. Here the issue is simply whether the moneys embezzled were income to the taxpayer in the year of receipt. These considerations distinguish Alsop.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">We hold that the Tax Court did not err in deciding that the moneys embezzled by Bittner in 1954 were income to the taxpayer in that year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">The Tax Court found that the amount of additional and unreported gross income from the tavern business was \u201cat least\u201d $8,392.23, the deficiency assessed by the Commissioner. This finding is unchallenged. The finding was made by comparing that amount calculated by the Commissioner under the mark-up method with the sum of $7,800.00, admittedly embezzled, plus other amounts \u201cunlawfully charged\u201d by Bittner to the taxpayer. We think this rough approximation of the extent of Bittner\u2019s defalcation is sufficient to establish the additional income for 1954. Tehan v. Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>missioner of Internal Revenue, 295 F.2d 895 (7th Cir. 1961). In this court the respondent conceded that the fund embezzled should be reduced by the $750.00 received by taxpayer from Bittner in 1958. The deficiency is therefore reduced by that amount and the Tax Court\u2019s decision as modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Tax Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed as reduced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\">. \u201cTaxpayer,\u201d as used in this opinion, refers to James J.
