There was no response from the group nor from an individual employee who was questioned. The construction superintendent then reprimanded the employees who had signed union cards for not having the courage of their convictions, and said that if he had signed a card he would have held up his hand even \u201cif it cost him his job.\u201d There is evidence in the record to the effect that the superintendent said: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a man in the crowd with any guts,\u201d that he was \u201cashamed of the employees\u201d and they were \u201ccowards for not backing up their convictions.\u201d The Board found that the polling of employees was not undertaken solely for the purpose of seeking information with respect to whether or not respondent should deal with the Union and held this action to be violative of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act. These findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence, and, in the light of all the circumstances, it must be concluded that this interrogation constituted intimidation in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1). N. L. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>B. v. Firedoor Corp. of America, 291 F.2d 328 (C.A. 2), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 921, 82 S.Ct. 242, 7 L.Ed.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"> Also supported by substantial evidence is the Board\u2019s finding that just before the election respondent announced a plan to give a three per cent retroactive wage increase, and that after the election, in which the union was defeated, this pay increase was granted. The record supports the inference that the timing of this increase was more than a mere coincidence, and constituted a promise of economic benefits violating \u00a7 8(a) (1). N. L. R. B. v. Philamon Laboratories, Inc., 298 F.2d 176 (C.A. 2), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 1555, 8 L.Ed.2d 498; N. L. R. B. v. Bailey Co., 180 F.2d 278 (C.A. 6). This Court said in the latter case: \u201c[Inferences as to whether or not proposals to confer economic benefits on employees have for their purpose the discouraging of such employees\u2019 interest and activity in the union, are for the Board and not for the court.\u201d 180 F.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The Board also found that respondent\u2019s president was instrumental in the formation and launching of an Employees Committee, a labor organization within the meaning of \u00a7 2(5); that respondent dominated or interfered with the formation or administration of the committee and contributed support to it; that respondent\u2019s president recommended and encouraged formation of the committee and attended most of its meetings; and that respondent\u2019s foreman solicited and instructed employees to attend meetings of department groups to elect representatives to the committee. There is evidence in the record that a foreman told employees that he wanted the men \u201cto go along with the committee or else.\u201d Most of the meetings of the committee were held on company time at a conference room in respondent\u2019s central office. Minutes were kept by the secretary to respondent\u2019s vice-president. The bylaws of the committee gave powers to the company president which are not consistent with the free and independent bargaining envisioned by the National Labor Relations Act. The Board\u2019s findings support the conclusion that respondent dominated and interfered with the committee in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (2). N. L. R. B. v. Chardon Telephone Co., 323 F.2d 563 (C.A. 6); N. L. R. B. v. Sharpies Chemicals, Inc., 209 F.2d 645 (C.A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The Board ordered respondent to cease and desist from the above unfair labor practices and directed that the Employees Committee be disestablished. We are of the opinion that the order of the Board should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">This does not mean that the employees on their own initiative cannot form their own committee, so long as it is completely independent of the employer. N. L. R. B. v. Chardon Telephone Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
