The same day, during a thirty-minute period of surveillance, police observed seven persons make short visits to the site. On the basis of this information, the police the next day obtained a search warrant authorizing them to search the residence and \"Doug,\u201d the man who had sold the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The police knocked on the door and announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>themselves. They heard someone running away and forced the door open. Inside they found seven persons, who were subjected to a <em>Terry </em>weapons patdown. Search of the site disclosed a locked toolbox. The police forced the box open and discovered inside a quantity of controlled substances. The police then searched the occupants for the key to the box, finding it in Arterberry\u2019s possession. Arterberry was arrested, and the other six occupants were apparently released.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Arterberry was charged with possession with intent to deliver various controlled substances. At Arterberry\u2019s preliminary examination, the district judge granted his motion to dismiss the charges on the basis that the search of his person for the key exceeded the scope of the warrant. The Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The police acted within the scope of the warrant when they opened the toolbox containing the controlled substances. Upon discovering the controlled substances, the police had probable cause to arrest all seven occupants for loitering in a place of illegal occupation or business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police could reasonably have believed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3***that the seven occupants of this private residence knew that the residence was being operated as a site for the distribution of controlled substances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>To be sure, the officers did not assert and may not have had in mind the offense of loitering in a place of illegal occupation or business when they searched Arterberry and the other occupants. The United States Supreme Court has said, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">[T]he fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the officer\u2019s action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action. <em>[Scott v United </em>States, 436 US 128, 138; 98 S Ct 1717; 56 L Ed 2d 168 (1978).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Since the officers had probable cause to arrest Arterberry and the other occupants, the search was proper: had the occupants been arrested, they could have then been searched incident to the arrest.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The validity of the search is not negated by the failure of the officers to arrest the occupants. Where officers have probable cause to arrest a group of persons and, instead of arresting them all, search them and then arrest only some of the group, they act properly. Those searched could have been arrested and then searched incident to the arrest. As explained in <em>Peters v New York, </em>392 US 40, 77; 88 S Ct 1889; 20 L Ed 2d 917 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">If the prosecution shows probable cause to arrest prior to a search of a man\u2019s person, it has met its total burden. There is <em>no </em>case in which a defendant may validly say, \"Although the officer had a right to arrest me at the moment when he seized me and searched my person, the search is invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>because he did not in fact arrest me until after-wards.\u201d [Emphasis in the original.][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The police acted properly in searching the seven occupants for the key.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Recorder\u2019s Court and the Court of Appeals relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ybarra v Illinois, </em>444 US 85; 100 S Ct 338; 62 L Ed 2d 238 (1979), in affirming the district judge\u2019s dismissal of the charges. In <em>Ybarra, </em>on the basis of the information that a bartender at a public bar possessed heroin, the police obtained a warrant permitting them to search the bartender, identified as \"Greg,\u201d and the premises of the bar. The police searched \"Greg\u201d and the bar and conducted a <em>Terry </em>weapons patdown of everyone else in the bar. The search of the bar and of \"Greg\u201d did not disclose any illegal substances. The officers then searched one of the patrons, Ybarra, again, this time finding heroin in a cigarette packet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>There was no basis for this search<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> other than Ybarra\u2019s presence in the bar. There was \"no reason to believe that [Ybarra] had committed, was committing, or was about to commit any offense under state or federal law.\u201d <em>Ybarra, </em>444 US 91. The Court held the search invalid for lack of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In contrast to the instant case, the police in <em>Ybarra </em>did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant before engaging in the challenged search. In <em>Ybarra, </em>the police did not, while searching pursuant to the warrant, discover controlled substances. In <em>Ybarra, </em>the police had no information that the bar itself was a dope house. In <em>Ybarra, </em>the site of the search was a public bar open to everyone, not a restricted-entry private residence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Ybarra, </em>no one ran away when the police announced themselves. In <em>Ybarra, </em>there was no reason to believe that the patrons of the bar were involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In the instant case, because the police had probable cause to arrest all the occupants, who could then have been searched incident to arrest, they acted properly in searching Arterberry for the key.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Reversed and remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-8\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\"> MCL 750.167(j); MSA 28.364\u00ae.

In fact, if the person searched is innocent and the search convinces the officer that his reasonable belief to the contrary is erroneous, it is to the advantage of the person searched not to be arrested. On the other hand, if he is not innocent or the search does not establish his innocence, the security of his persons, house, papers, or effects suffers no more from a search preceding his arrest than it would from the same search following it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">See also <em>People v Cook, </em>153 Mich App 89, 92; 395 NW2d 16 (1986); see, generally, 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d ed), \u00a7\u00a7 5.4(a)-(b), pp 515-527.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\"> Nor, because there was no reasonable belief that the patrons were armed and presently dangerous, was there a basis for the <em>Terry </em>weapons patdown. <em>Ybarra, </em>444 US 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> Professor LaFave observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">Without suggesting that the probable cause required by <em>Ybarra </em>is inevitably present when the warrant <em>is </em>for private premises and the requisite notice is given prior to entry, it is fair to say that such a case does necessitate a somewhat different assessment than was permissible on the facts of <em>Ybarra. </em>[2 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d ed), \u00a7 4.9(c), p 296.
