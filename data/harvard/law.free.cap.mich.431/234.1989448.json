We adopt the federal standard and hold that retrial is barred where the prosecutor intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In this case, counsel for the people conceded at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>oral argument in this Court that the trial prosecutor intended to bring about a mistrial. But for such concession, we would remand to the trial court for a factual determination. We affirm the result arrived at by the Court of Appeals reversing Robert Dawson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Dawson was charged with assault with intent to commit sexual penetration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The crime was alleged to have occurred early in the morning of June 28, 1981,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in Kalamazoo. The prosecutor alleged that Dawson lured complainant Mark Nelson to Dawson\u2019s home and that, when Nelson became uneasy and left, Dawson forced him at knife point to a small park near Dawson\u2019s home, where Dawson attempted to force Nelson to submit to anal intercourse. According to the prosecution, Nelson managed to struggle free and escape to a nearby street, where he was first struck by a truck and then taken to a hospital by passers-by. The prosecution\u2019s only evidence that Dawson assaulted Nelson was Nelson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Dawson denied assaulting Nelson. He claimed that Nelson paid him to submit to sexual contact, and that Nelson suggested using the park. When Dawson was unable to complete the act, Nelson became hysterical and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The prosecutor first called Terry Sweeney, who had accompanied Dawson earlier in the evening in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>question. There was no substantive direct or cross-examination. The prosecutor then called Detective Robert Gay of the Kalamazoo police. Again there was no direct examination. On cross-examination, Detective Gay stated that he had found no signs of any struggle when searching the area where Nelson claimed he had struggled with Dawson. On redirect examination, Detective Gay stated, to the prosecutor\u2019s apparent surprise,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that he had not recovered any evidence at all from the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The prosecutor next called Nelson. Nelson was twenty-three years old at the time of the original trial, twenty-two at the time of the alleged assault. Nelson testified that on the evening in question he was sitting alone watching television in his girl friend\u2019s ground floor apartment. Two men came to the door. Nelson testified that one, Dawson, said that they had been walking by and had seen the gymnastic photos which Nelson\u2019s girl friend had on the walls of her apartment. Nelson said that he invited them inside. Nelson said that they remained for a total of fifteen minutes, that each of the three men drank one or two beers, and that they talked generally of their work and of sports. Nelson testified that he and Dawson then left together.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Nelson testified that he left with Dawson because he had run out of beer, and that Dawson had suggested that they go to the house of a friend of Dawson\u2019s, obtain some beer there, and return to Nelson\u2019s girl friend\u2019s apartment. Nelson agreed. With his right leg encased in a cast from ankle to hip,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nelson proceeded on crutches to what he thought was Dawson\u2019s friend\u2019s house, which was approximately a ten-minute walk from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Nelson said that Dawson unlocked the door and went inside, with Nelson following.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Dawson then went down into the basement for several minutes. When he returned he asked Nelson if he wanted to see the basement. Nelson said no and further told Dawson that he was going back to the apartment. Nelson testified that he then walked out of the door.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">According to Nelson, after he had taken just several steps (still using his crutches) Dawson \"grabbed [him] by the back of [his] collar and had [a] knife in [his] back and said 'Keep walking and shut up.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nelson said that he then dropped his crutches and hobbled along in front of Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The two proceeded alongside some railroad tracks. Along one side of the tracks was a creek. Nelson testified that he thought that if he could reach the creek, he could break his cast and run away from Dawson. Nelson said that he struggled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>with Dawson,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> who still had hold of his collar and had a knife stuck into his back, escaped and ran into the creek. Dawson was right behind. Nelson said that his cast did break at the ankle and knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Nelson said that he and Dawson struggled in the creek. Dawson choked Nelson<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and told him that if he made any noise, Dawson would kill him. Nelson said that while Dawson was choking him he was also cutting Nelson with the knife. Nelson testified that he was cut on his thumb, neck, and back. Nelson said that Dawson was also trying to get Nelson\u2019s pants off. Nelson repeatedly testified that Dawson did not say why he wanted to get Nelson\u2019s pants off.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Nelson testified that he then grabbed the knife (which had ended up in the weeds) and \"grabbed a hold [sic] of this tree and pushed away from [Dawson] and took off from [Dawson].\u201d Nelson ran across a little field toward a street. Dawson \"took a dive\u201d at Nelson, but Nelson rolled away and went into the street to try and wave someone down. Nelson said that he tried waving down a truck, but the truck did not stop. Nelson fell back against the curb, and the truck ran over his cast. A young man and young woman driving home from a late-night date saw Nelson, offered help, and took him to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Defense counsel then began his cross-examination. Nelson said that Dawson came to the door of the apartment at approximately 8:00 p.m. Nelson then said that, contrary to his earlier testimony, both Dawson and Dawson\u2019s friend (Terry Sweeney) stayed for some fifteen minutes in the apartment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Dawson and his friend were \"jumping around doing something,\u201d putting on some kind of a play fight. Dawson\u2019s friend then left, and just Nelson and Dawson drank beer. Nelson then reasserted that the only reason he agreed to go on crutches over to what he thought was Dawson\u2019s friend\u2019s house was to obtain some more beer. Nelson acknowledged that there was a store selling beer directly across the street from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Nelson said that approximately a half-hour to forty minutes elapsed between meeting Dawson and being taken to the hospital. After pressing by defense counsel, he expanded this estimate to an hour.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Nelson made a number of denials. He denied that he initiated contact with Dawson. He denied that Dawson and his friend left the apartment, bought some beer, and then returned. He first denied that Dawson returned after leaving with his friend,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but then said that Dawson did leave with his friend and then returned alone. He denied paying Dawson for sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Nelson stated for the first time that his girl friend had returned to the apartment while Dawson was still there. Nelson maintained his original version that he had been cut a number of times on the neck, even though the photograph taken at the hospital did not show such cuts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">On redirect examination, Nelson returned to his direct examination testimony that Dawson did not leave the apartment and then return, but rather that Dawson and his friend arrived, the friend left, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and then Nelson left with Dawson. Nelson for the first time said that when Dawson was trying to pull Nelson\u2019s pants down, Dawson told Nelson that the reason he wanted to do so was to force Nelson into having anal intercourse.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nelson was then excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">After calling Officer Cristopher Sorrentino of the Kalamazoo Police, who gave no substantive testimony, the prosecution called Toni Hramika, Nelson\u2019s girl friend and the tenant of the apartment where Nelson and Dawson met. Hramika worked at a restaurant near her apartment. The night of the alleged assault, she returned home between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. Nelson was there, sitting outside the front door drinking beer with Dawson. Hramika said, contrary to Nelson\u2019s testimony, that Nelson and Dawson went across the street, bought beer at the store there, and then returned to the apartment. Hramika overheard them discussing going over to Dawson\u2019s house.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Contrary to Nelson\u2019s testimony that the only reason he left with Dawson was to obtain some beer, Hramika testified that she heard Nelson and Dawson discussing going over to Dawson\u2019s house to obtain marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Nelson said that he would be back in fifteen minutes, but he was not. Hramika had made plans to spend the night at a girl friend\u2019s apartment. She waited for Nelson for half an hour and then left. She repeatedly called her apartment from her girl friend\u2019s, and Nelson finally answered between 11:15 and 11:45 p.m. Hramika said Nelson sounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\"very shaken up.\u201d She said that Nelson accused Dawson of trying to rape him.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On cross-examination, Hramika admitted that several days after the alleged assault she had told Detective Gay that on the evening in question she had arrived home between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, not between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. Hramika also testified that, contrary to Nelson\u2019s assertion that Dawson had stuck the knife into his back, she had seen no cuts on his back. She was not sure whether there were cuts on his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The prosecutor then called Angela Hosek. She and Scott Courtney were driving home from a date and had stopped at the intersection where Nelson testified he had tried to wave down a truck. Hosek said she saw Nelson fall off the side of a van.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Hosek said that Courtney then rolled down his window, asked Nelson if he needed help, and went out to help him. Hosek also went over to Nelson. Nelson told them that somebody had tried to rape him. They took him to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">On cross-examination, Hosek confirmed that she did not see Nelson standing in the street trying to wave someone down. Rather, she saw him fall off the side of a van. Furthermore, she said that this occurred at 1:00 a.m., four hours later than the time to which Nelson testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Courtney, the next witness, while generally corroborating Hosek\u2019s testimony, testified that Nelson related an account to him<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that was entirely different from Nelson\u2019s testimony in court. Nelson told Courtney that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">he was walking home or he was on crutches at that time because the leg was broken previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>and a man offered him a ride so he accepted it. He waundered [sic] back to his apartment and that\u2019s when he [sic] tried to sexually assault him and he broke away and then he went on to say that his arms and his hands hurt and that he used a knife that was about that [six to eight inches] big.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On cross-examination, Courtney confirmed Hosek\u2019s statement that 1:00 a.m. was the time they first saw Nelson. Courtney affirmed that Nelson told him that he had been walking home, was offered a ride by someone, accepted it and ended up at this person\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Courtney said that Nelson told him that Nelson knew where his assailant lived and was going to \"get\u201d him. Nelson did not complain of being stabbed in the back or cut on the neck. When Courtney first saw Nelson in the street, Nelson had no shirt and his pants were down about his knees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor questioned Courtney\u2019s report. Courtney again confirmed that Nelson told him he accepted an offer of a ride from someone who took him to an apartment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The judge, finding that the subject had been adequately covered, then repeatedly sustained objections to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. The prosecutor then rested.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The defense first called Terry Sweeney, who had accompanied Dawson during the early portion of the evening in question. Sweeney and Dawson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>were acquaintances. That evening they met at a mutual friend\u2019s home and then went to Dawson\u2019s sister\u2019s home, leaving there at 7:15 p.m. On the way to Dawson\u2019s house, they passed by the apartment where Nelson was staying. Sweeney had never seen Nelson before. Nelson was standing in the doorway, and he and Dawson began talking. Sweeney said that he and Dawson, after staying for several minutes, went to the convenience store<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> across the street and then returned to the apartment. Sweeney said that they remained there with Nelson for approximately one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Sweeney and Dawson then left Nelson and went to Dawson\u2019s house, arriving there around 8:00 p.m. Sweeney stayed for five minutes and then returned to his house to change clothes in preparation for going out with Dawson, Dawson\u2019s girl friend, and Dawson\u2019s sister later that night. Sweeney returned to Dawson\u2019s home between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. Sweeney said that Dawson was talking with Nelson in the kitchen. Sweeney testified that he went into another room, and that after about fifteen minutes Dawson and Nelson left. Dawson said he would return. Sweeney then went outside and saw Dawson\u2019s girl friend coming up the driveway. Sweeney called to Dawson, who was then walking with Nelson along the railroad tracks, to tell him, but apparently Dawson did not hear. Sweeney did not see Nelson walking in front of Dawson. Rather, Sweeney said that Nelson had his arm around Dawson\u2019s shoulder. Sweeney waited at Dawson\u2019s house for approximately forty-five minutes and then left, leaving a note for Dawson. Sweeney did not see Dawson again that night.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Dawson testified next. Dawson agreed with Sweeney\u2019s testimony as to how the evening began. When walking from Dawson\u2019s sister\u2019s house to Dawson\u2019s house, Dawson and Sweeney passed the apartment where Nelson was staying. Nelson was standing in the doorway, began talking to them, and invited them in. Dawson and Sweeney had some beer, and then went across the street to buy some more beer, which they brought back to the apartment. They stayed for approximately one hour, and then Dawson and Sweeney left for Dawson\u2019s house. Dawson said that Nelson invited him to return later.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Dawson testified that approximately half an hour after leaving, he returned to the apartment where Nelson was staying. Dawson said that Nelson propositioned him, offering him drinks, marijuana, and money to let Nelson perform oral sex upon Dawson. Dawson agreed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Toni Hramika then returned to the apartment. Dawson said that he and Nelson then went to the convenience store across the street, bought some beer, and at Nelson\u2019s suggestion left it at Toni\u2019s apartment, so that she would think that he was coming right back.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Dawson said that he and Nelson then walked over to Dawson\u2019s house. Sweeney came back and walked into the living room, while Dawson and Nelson stayed in the kitchen. Dawson\u2019s housemate was downstairs in the basement with his girl friend. With his housemate and Sweeney present, Dawson testified that he did not see how he and Nelson could complete their deal at Dawson\u2019s house. Nelson, however, said that he wanted to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\"something\u201d that night. Dawson testified that he did not want to return the $37~$40 which Nelson had given him, and agreed to walk Nelson home.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Dawson testified that he and Nelson walked down the railroad tracks to a small park. Nelson suggested that they complete their deal in the park. Dawson assented, and Nelson unzipped Dawson\u2019s pants. Dawson said that he was unable to become sexually aroused. Dawson testified that when he told Nelson that they may as well forget the agreement, Nelson stood up and took off running toward his house. Dawson then returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Dawson denied using a knife or making any attempt to force sexual contact. When asked whether he had \"ever assaulted anybody in [his] life,\u201d Dawson answered no.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor suggested that Dawson had made a number of sexual approaches to other males. Dawson denied attempting to have such \"homosexual encounters.\u201d One of Dawson\u2019s prior jobs had been as a counselor in a juvenile home, and the prosecutor began naming teen-aged boys who had resided at the juvenile home while Dawson was a counselor and asking Dawson if he had not attempted to solicit sexual contact with them.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Dawson admitted that he knew the young men but denied soliciting sexual contact. After defense counsel objected to this line of questioning, the prosecutor stated that he would prove that Dawson had made such solicitations.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>After a brief redirect examination, Dawson was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The last defense witness was Detective Gay. He testified that had there been visible injuries to Nelson\u2019s back or neck, as Nelson had testified, the police department would have photographed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The prosecutor then began his rebuttal. The prosecutor sought to introduce evidence supporting his suggestions that Dawson had made a number of sexual approaches to other males. The first witness, Michael Cornell, was a former resident of the juvenile home who had known Dawson. Cornell testified that after he had been placed in a foster home, Dawson visited and took Cornell fishing. He also bought Cornell some rum. Cornell said that when he offered to pay Dawson for the rum, Dawson told him that \"you can pay me in another way.\u201d Cornell testified that he took this as \"faggoty.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Cornell did not testify to any further \"incidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The prosecutor next called Ray Brown, another former juvenile home resident. Brown testified that at one point when he and Dawson were fighting, Dawson \"asked me if we could get along better if he gave me a couple blows.\u201d When asked how he took Dawson\u2019s statement, Brown said \"Offensively.\u201d \"Before I started thinking about it, I was getting angry. It could have meant hit me, it could have meant anything else. I took it angrily and it was over.\u201d The prosecutor then attempted to impeach Brown, implying that Brown had earlier stated that Dawson explicitly referred to sexual contact. The judge sustained defense objections to a number of questions. In an ensuing sidebar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the judge stated that he would not allow impeachment on a collateral matter.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The prosecutor, noting that it was then 4:30 p.m., requested a recess until the following Tuesday.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The judge refused. The prosecutor, stating that he probably had \"another three or four hours of direct examination,\u201d then began asking Brown questions like \"can you tell us the very first day or time it was that you met Mr. Dawson or what that occasion was?\u201d and \"How many floors are there in the Juvenile Home please?\u201d Defense counsel objected on relevancy grounds and the judge sustained the objections. After repeated rounds of such questions and sustained objections, the prosecutor asked the following question: \"Can you tell us how many times Mr. Dawson offered you a blow job?\u201d Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The prosecutor, when asked if he had any response, replied \"Nope.\u201d The court granted the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Defense counsel subsequently moved to bar any retrial on the basis of double jeopardy. The prosecutor successfully argued that any such motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>must be filed and the prosecutor given four days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Defense counsel filed his motion and argued it the first day of Dawson\u2019s retrial.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> A different judge was presiding. Defense counsel had not requested a transcript of Dawson\u2019s original trial, and no such transcript was available.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The judge, relying on <em>People v </em>Benton, 402 Mich 47; 260 NW2d 77 (1977), denied the motion. The judge read <em>Benton </em>as holding that where the defendant \"retained] primary control over the course to be followed\u201d in the original trial, double jeopardy would not bar a retrial. The judge found that here the defendant had exercised \"primary control\u201d because it was defense counsel who moved for the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Dawson was convicted on retrial. The Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of the Double Jeopardy Clause. We affirm the Court of Appeals decision, but adopt a different double jeopardy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The Michigan<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and federal<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> constitutions provide that no person shall twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense. The purpose of the double jeopardy prohibition is to limit the state to having generally only one attempt at obtaining a conviction. Otherwise, the state could repeatedly prosecute persons for the same crime, transforming the trial process itself into a punishment and effectively punishing the accused without his having been adjudged guilty of an offense meriting punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ment.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Further, because the state can devote its resources to improving the presentation of its case, the probability of a conviction may increase with each retrial. As the United States Supreme Court said in <em>Green v United </em>States, 355 US 184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.[<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">An accused is placed in jeopardy as soon as the jury is selected and sworn.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Hence, double jeopardy protection attaches before the conclusion of the trial. Where the trial ends before a verdict\u2014 where a mistrial is declared \u2014 the Double Jeopardy Clause may bar a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar all retrials.

The Court of Appeals said that while the prosecutor\u2019s conduct at Dawson\u2019s original trial did not rise to the \"intended to provoke a mistrial\u201d standard of <em>Oregon v Kennedy, supra, </em>it did qualify under the <em>Pool </em>approach as conduct that the prosecutor \"knew [was] improper, and that he [engaged in] with indiiference, if not a specific intent, to create unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Dawson, supra, </em>p 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">At oral argument before this Court, counsel for the people conceded that the trial prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>conduct was improper under the <em>Oregon v Kennedy </em>standard.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The prosecutor urged this Court to follow the <em>Oregon v Kennedy </em>standard and to reject the <em>Pool </em>formulation adopted by the Court of Appeals.

The police had not recovered any evidence from the scene of the crime. The only evidence, implicating Dawson was the testimony of Nelson, the complaining witness, who had contradicted himself on at least one crucial matter \u2014 first stating that Dawson never said why he wanted Nelson to take off Nelson\u2019s pants, and then saying that Dawson said that he wanted to have anal intercourse with Nelson. Nelson\u2019s testimony was also confused con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>cerning the times and events leading up to the alleged assault. One of the state\u2019s corroborating witnesses then testified that Nelson had provided him with a completely different account \u2014 that he was attacked not near the railroad tracks, but rather in an apartment by a man who offered him a lift home. Nelson\u2019s girl friend apparently surprised the prosecutor, and discredited Nelson, by stating that Nelson went with Dawson not to obtain beer, as Nelson had testified, but rather to obtain marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The testimony of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal witness did not support the prosecutor\u2019s allegations of prior sexual solicitations. The prosecutor\u2019s last rebuttal witness left the building before testifying. The prosecutor appeared to be stalling for time, apparently hoping that the court would declare a recess and thereby enable the prosecutor to marshal his forces over the weekend. When a recess appeared unlikely, the prosecutor asked, \"Can you tell us how many times Mr. Dawson offered you a blow job?\u201d which he clearly knew was improper. Finally, the prosecutor neither appeared surprised by nor argued against the mistrial motion. When asked whether he had any response to defense counsel\u2019s request for a mistrial, the prosecutor responded, \"Nope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We affirm the result arrived at by the Court of Appeals, and hold that Dawson\u2019s retrial is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<judges id=\"b405-7\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> US Const, Am V.

The witness stated that he had. On redirect examination, when the prosecutor attempted to elicit the reasons why the witness had filed the complaint, the trial judge sustained a series of objections. The Court noted that the Oregon appellate court \"later explained that [defendant\u2019s] 'objections were not well taken, and the judge\u2019s rulings were probably wrong.\u201d <em>Oregon v Kennedy, supra, </em>456 US 669, n 1, quoting 49 Or App 415, 417; 619 P2d 948 (1980).

First, the federal test focused solely on prosecutorial conduct, \"[b]ut prosecutors are not the only officials whose conduct may cause a mistrial or a reversal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 275. Other court officials, such as the bailiff, may be equally guilty of misconduct requiring a mistrial.
