Accordingly, we would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Plaintiff White was employed for thirty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>years by defendant. On March 31, 1980, plaintiff retired under defendant\u2019s \"thirty and out\u201d nondisability, early retirement plan. On May 29, 1980, plaintiff filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Bureau, alleging that he was disabled as of the date of his early retirement by chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema, arising out of prolonged exposure to dust, smoke, paint, and other irritants. The hearing referee, finding that plaintiff had a work-incurred disability and had retired early because of his respiratory condition, awarded plaintiff weekly benefits effective from his retirement date, payable until further notice from the bureau. Defendant appealed to the wcab, arguing that plaintiff was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">While the case was pending before the wcab, the Michigan Legislature enacted 1980 PA 357, effective January 1, 1982. MCL 418.373; MSA 17.237(373), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">(1) <em>An employee who terminates active employment and is receiving nondisability pension </em>or retirement benefits under either a private or governmental pension or retirement program, including old-age benefits under the social security act, 42 USC 301 to 1397f, that was paid by or on behalf of an employer from whom weekly benefits under this act are sought <em>shall be presumed not to have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of a compensable injury or disease </em>under either this chapter or chapter 4. This presumption may be rebutted only by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee is unable, because of a work related disability, to perform work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications, including training or experience. <em>This standard of disability supersedes other applicable standards </em>used to determine disability under either this chapter or chapter 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">(2) This section shall not be construed as a bar to an employee receiving medical benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>section 315 upon the establishment of a causal relationship between the employee\u2019s work and the need for medical treatment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">On May 2, 1986, the wcab affirmed the referee\u2019s award and declined to apply the presumption set forth in \u00a7373, stating that defendant was not entitled to assert \u00a7373(1) because it concerned substantive rights and that the Legislature intended the amendment to apply prospectively to employees injured after its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Court of Appeals remanded the action to the wcab to be reconsidered in light of <em>Wojciechowski v General Motors Corp, </em>151 Mich App 399; 390 NW2d 727 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">This Court then granted leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether \u00a7 373 of 1980 PA 357 should be given retrospective application. 428 Mich 873 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">This Court has addressed the issue of retroactive versus prospective application of amendments of the wdca in several recent cases. First, in <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products, </em>419 Mich 1, 9; 345 NW2d 184 (1984), we stated that as a general rule, \"statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless the contrary intent is clearly manifested.\u201d A year later, in <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636; 375 NW2d 715 (1985), this Court recognized an exception to the general rule for statutes which are remedial or procedural in nature. Most recently, in <em>Hurd v Ford Motor Co, </em>423 Mich 531, 534; 377 NW2d 300 (1985), this Court considered another provision of the same public act, \u00a7 301(2), and concluded that it \"was enacted to invalidate this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Inc (After Remand), </em>403 Mich 1; 268 NW2d 1 (1978), thus effecting a substantial change in the law and that the provisions of this amendment have prospective application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">It is against this backdrop that this Court must examine \u00a7 373. Defendant characterizes \u00a7 373 as procedural.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, careful analysis of this section reveals that it is not procedural. Section 373(1) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">An employee who terminates active employment and is receiving nondisability pension or retirement benefits . . . shall be <em>presumed </em>not to have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of a compensable injury or disease under either this chapter or chapter 4. This <em>presumption </em>may be rebutted only by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee is unable, because of a work related disability, to perform work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications, including training or experience. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Relying upon the language highlighted above, defendant argues that \u00a7 373 creates a rebuttable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>presumption of law and is, therefore, procedural in nature. However, Michigan law specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">The function of a presumption is solely to place the burden of producing evidence on the opposing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\"It is a procedural device which allows a person relying on the presumption to avoid a directed verdict, and it permits that person a directed verdict if the opposing party fails to introduce evidence rebutting the presumption.\u201d <em>[McKinstry v Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, PC, </em>428 Mich 167, 180; 405 NW2d 88 (1987) (quoting <em>Widmayer v Leonard, </em>422 Mich 280, 289; 373 NW2d 538 [1985]).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Section 373 does not shift the claimant\u2019s burden of producing evidence. Therefore, it does not create a \"presumption.\u201d Rather, we conclude that the \"presumption\u201d language in \u00a7 373 merely classifies those persons entitled to benefits under \u00a7 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In reiterating the general rule that statutes which affect substantive rights should be applied prospectively, the <em>Hurd </em>Court noted that prior to enactment of \u00a7 301(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the eligibility of an employee with a mental disorder for workers\u2019 compensation was determined by the \"honest perception\u201d standards set forth in <em>Deziel, supra. </em>Section 301(2) changed the standard of disability;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus, the Court concluded that the change affected sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>stantive rights of the employee. Emphasizing the fact that the Legislature had not indicated whether \u00a7 301(2) should be applied retrospectively, the <em>Hurd </em>Court held that the amendment must be applied prospectively for injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1982. We find <em>Hurd </em>indistinguishable. As the <em>Hurd </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\"In accordance with the rule applicable to original acts, it is presumed that provisions added by the amendment affecting substantive rights are intended to operate prospectively. Provisions added by the amendment that affect substantive rights will not be construed to apply to transactions and events completed prior to its enactment unless the legislature has expressed its intent to that effect or such intent is clearly implied by the language of the amendment or by the circumstances surrounding its enactment.\u201d <em>[Hurd, supra </em>at 535.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Similarly, in the present case, prior to enactment of \u00a7 373, a claimant need only prove an impairment of wage-earning capacity within his field of employment. <em>Kaarto v Calumet &amp; Hecla, Inc, </em>367 Mich 128; 116 NW2d 225 (1962). Section 373 changed this standard.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, \u00a7 373 provides that \"[t]his standard of disability supersedes other applicable standards used to determine disability under either this chapter or chapter 4.\u201d The effect of \u00a7 373 on claimants is similar to the effect on claimants under \u00a7 301(2) in <em>Hurd. </em>Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 301(2) and 373(1) changed a standard of disability. Thus, in accordance with <em>Hurd, </em>\u00a7 373 should be applied prospectively for injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1982, the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Cases relied upon by defendant are distinguishable from <em>Hurd </em>and the present case. The statutory amendment in <em>Selk, supra, </em>affected the amount of interest an individual was entitled to receive after it was already determined that compensation was due. As we noted in <em>Franks, supra, </em>\"[i]n <em>Selk, </em>we found the interest rate on overdue compensation payments related to a remedy or mode of procedure and was 'but an incident and not the essence of a right or liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Franks, supra </em>at 672. Unlike the provision in <em>Selk, </em>\u00a7 373 involves the question whether a retired employee has a substantive right to compensation under \u00a7 373, thus directly affecting the essence of his right, and not merely calculating the amount of compensation which he may eventually receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Similarly, in <em>Karl v Bryant Air Conditioning, </em>416 Mich 558; 331 NW2d 456 (1982), this Court held that the newly enacted comparative negligence statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applied retroactively to a pending products liability action. However, actions under the wdca are, by their very nature, different than products liability actions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"Adp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Defendant argues that even if \u00a7 373 is substantive, it is remedial and, therefore, should be applied retroactively. While we agree that the wdca is remedial, in the broad sense, we believe that such a characterization of the act, as a whole, provides no further insight into whether this particular amendment should be applied retroactively or prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">It is well recognized that the wdca, as a whole, is remedial legislation. <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 457; 258 NW2d 414 (1977); Van <em>Dorpel v Haven-Busch Co, </em>350 Mich 135, 154; 85 NW2d 97 (1957); <em>DeKind v Gale Mfg Co, </em>125 Mich App 598, 609; 337 NW2d 252 (1983). Therefore, characterization of a wdca provision as remedial should not be dispositive. Otherwise, any statutory amendment of the wdca could be characterized as remedial and applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The problem with this broad meaning of \"remedial\u201d has been explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">Generally, remedial statutes are those which provide a remedy, or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries. They also include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>statutes intended for the correction of defects, mistakes and omissions in the civil institutions and the administration of the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">Every statute that makes any change in the existing body of law, excluding only those enactments which merely restate or codify prior law, can be said to \"remedy\u201d some flaw in the prior law or some social evil. The mere fact that a statute is characterized as \"remedial,\u201d therefore, is of little value in statutory construction unless the term \"remedial\u201d has for this purpose a more discriminate meaning. [3 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 60.02, p 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">At times, Michigan cases have used the broad meaning of \"remedial\u201d to apply arguably substantive amendments to the wdca retrospectively. See, e.g., <em>Lahti v </em>Fosterling, 357 Mich 578, 588; 99 NW2d 490 (1959) (retroactively applying 1955 PA 250, repealing a two-year maximum on medical and hospital expenses); <em>Spencer v Clark Twp, </em>142 Mich App 63; 368 NW2d 897 (1985) (retroactively applying the provisions of 1980 PA 357, \u00a7 1, allowing volunteer ambulance drivers to obtain benefits as if a county, city or village employee at the maximum rate). However, in this context, we prefer the narrower meaning, in which \"[t]he term 'remedial\u2019 is often employed to describe legislation which is procedural in nature, i.e., it does not affect substantive rights.\u201d 3 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 60.02, p 60. See, e.g., <em>Rookledge v Garwood, </em>340 Mich 444; 65 NW2d 785 (1954) (applying retroactively the 1952 PA 155 provision allowing an injured worker to proceed in tort against a defendant tortfeasor) and <em>Selk, supra </em>(applying retroactively the 1981 PA 194 provision increasing the amount of interest on a workers\u2019 compensation award from five to twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>percent).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have previously noted, \u00a7 373 is substantive in nature. We, therefore, conclude that, in this context, it is not remedial and the statute should be applied prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We also find it significant that the Legislature omitted any reference to the retroactivity of \u00a7 373. For example, in <em>Selk, </em>the Court noted that the Legislature made no reference to the retroactivity of 1981 PA 194 and, in fact, provided a specific future date for its application. In resolving the retroactivity issue, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">When one carefully examines how the Legislature utilizes effective dates, however, it is clear that we have accorded that respect which is properly due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">Effective dates are inserted by the Legislature in all kinds of statutes. When it wishes to address the question of retroactivity, the Legislature has specifically done so <em>in addition to </em>providing for an effective date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">For example, when the Legislature passed the new rule for a claim and delivery action, in 1976 PA 79, it provided in enactment \u00a72 that \"[t]his amendatory act shall apply to all actions pending or commenced on or after the effective date of this act.\u201d Enactment \u00a7 3 of the same statute provided: \"This amendatory act shall take effect July 1, 1975.\u201d Because the Legislature in connection with other statutes in enactment sections has specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>cally addressed retroactivity in addition to providing an effective date, we are unable to agree that the mere insertion of an effective date, standing alone, is dispositive of the prospective/retroactive effect of 1981 PA 194. <em>[Selk, supra </em>at 35, n 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Therefore, we are persuaded that providing a specific, future effective date and omitting any reference to retroactivity supports our holding that \u00a7 373 is prospective in application.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We would hold that <em>Hurd </em>controls in the present case. Section 373 should apply prospectively only for injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1982, the effective date of the statute. Thus, we would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the wcab.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-8\">Cavanagh and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\"> The Legislature enacted 1980 PA 357, including \u00a7 373, as an amendment of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act of 1969. See MCL 418.101 et <em>seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> The dissent relies upon a quote from an article written by Justice Moody. Although the dissent properly asserts that the procedural-substantive dichotomy is often difficult to distinguish, the passage addresses retroactivity in a criminal case. In fact, later in the article, Justice Moody specifically discusses the differences between retroactivity in criminal and civil cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">In the civil area, the cases reflect both greater consistency in result and more severe limitations upon retrospective reach. In a sense, this can be explained by the fact that in civil cases, the range of alternatives is narrower than in the criminal arena; concepts such as res judicata and statutes of limitation operate to cut off the backward effect of law-changing decisions. Thus, the full retroactivity occasionally accorded in criminal cases is essentially unknown in civil litigation .... [Moody, <em>Retroactive application of law-changing decisions in Michigan, </em>28 Wayne L R 439, 483-484 (1982).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\"> MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301X2) was also enacted as part of 1980 PA 357.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-11\"> Section 301(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">Mental disabilities and conditions of the aging process, including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions, shall be compensable if contributed to or aggravated or acceler<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ated by the employment in a significant manner.

In <em>Karl, </em>the jury returned a special verdict in favor of plaintiff for $52,000, finding that the manufacturer had breached its implied warranty. The factfinder also determined that the plaintiff was ninety-five percent negligent. While <em>Karl </em>was pending in the trial court, the Legislature enacted the comparative negligence statute which provided for its immediate effect. On appeal, the <em>Karl </em>Court held that the statute should be applied retroactively, stating that \"[wjhile the total damages which plaintiff could have received were significantly reduced by [the statute], plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was not legally barred or taken away.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Karl, supra </em>at 577. Like the statute in <em>Selk, </em>the amendment in <em>Karl </em>was \"not a matter of substance going to the individual\u2019s right to compensation.\u201d <em>Franks, supra </em>at 672. Thus, the <em>Karl </em>holding might be explained by the distinction drawn between the \"amount\u201d of benefits and the \"entitlement\u201d to benefits. <em>Karl, supra </em>at 577. This Court has recognized the distinction drawn between \"amount\u201d of benefits and \"entitlement\u201d to benefits in workers\u2019 compensation cases involving a claimant\u2019s earning capacity. See <em>Leskinen v MESC, </em>398 Mich 501, 508-509; 247 NW2d 808 (1976). See also <em>Medacco v Campbell, Wyant &amp; Cannon Foundry Co, </em>48 Mich App 217, 226; 210 NW2d 360 (1973). Similarly, we also recognize that <em>Karl </em>might be explained because it has both remedial and procedural aspects.

However, in reliance upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hurd v Ford Motor Co, </em>423 Mich 531; 377 NW2d 300 (1985), the board further commented that the defendant was not entitled to assert \u00a7373(l)\u2019s rebuttable presumption as it concerned substantive rights and was intended by the Legislature to apply prospectively to employees injured after its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Defendant filed a motion for peremptory reversal in the Court of Appeals arguing that \u00a7 373(1) governed two claimant classes: (1) the prospective class identified by the wcab, and (2) a retroactive class of those injured prior to January 1, 1982, yet who were entitled to benefits after that date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 10, 1986, the Court of Appeals vacated plaintiffs award and remanded the action to the wcab to be reconsidered in light of its decision in <em>Wojciechowski v General Motors Corp, </em>151 Mich App 399; 390 NW2d 727 (1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Plaintiff filed for leave to appeal to this Court.

However, this oft-cited exception favoring retroactive application, frequently belies the difficulty inherent in balancing an uncertain legislative intent against ambiguous statutory provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">In dealing with the problem of retroactivity, it is extremely difficult to establish definite criteria upon which court decisions can be foretold. A statute must not act unreasonably upon the rights of those to whom it applies. What is reasonable and what is unreasonable is difficult to state in advance of actual decisions. \". . . [T]he method to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>be pursued is not the unerring pursuit of a fixed legal principle to an inevitable conclusion. Rather it is the method of intelligently balancing and discriminating between reasons for and against.\u201d [2 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 41.05, p 364.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Section 373(l)\u2019s legislative history is silent upon the Legislature\u2019s intent regarding the applicability of this rebuttable presumption. Therefore, I find the provision presents three probable constructions: (1) \u00a7373(1) extends prospectively to claimants injured after its effective date, (2) the presumption extends to all benefits received after its effective date regardless of the retiree\u2019s injury date, and (3) the provision governs all benefits received both prior to and after its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Our task is to thus balance these criteria against our own precedent in order to discern the construction which strikes the intended balance between the policies underlying \u00a7 373(1) and the wdca itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">CASE LAW ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The question of the prospective versus retrospective application of several recent amendments of the wdca has been a recurrent one before the Court. Initially, in <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products (On Resubmission), </em>419 Mich 32; 348 NW2d 652 (1984), the Court deemed the Legislature\u2019s increase in interest per annum upon unpaid workers\u2019 compensation benefits effective January 1, 1982,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was a remedial act applicable retroactively, limited to any claimant regardless of their date of injury, who was either awarded or entitled to receive compensation after the provision\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">One year later, in <em>Franks v White Pine Copper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Div, </em>422 Mich 636; 375 NW2d 715 (1985), the Court concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 354 and 358, which provided for the coordination of wdca payments with other employer-funded benefits, applied prospectively to claimants injured after the amendments\u2019 effective dates <em>and </em>to those receiving benefits after the effective date regardless of their date of injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, most recently in <em>Hurd v Ford Motor Co, supra, </em>this Court determined that 1980 PA 357, which amended the wdca\u2019s causation standard for mental-disability claims, applied prospectively solely to those injured after the provision took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">From our prior decisions, I discern the following pattern: (1) Each amendment contained a specific effective date. (2) In the instances concerning the amount of benefits to which a claimant was entitled <em>(Selk, </em>Franks), the Court disregarded the date of injury, finding a date of benefits received or awarded determinative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By contrast, in <em>Hurd, </em>the sole decision to address an amendment redefining a standard of benefit eligibility, the Court focused instead upon the date of injury as controlling in our construction of the provision\u2019s effective date. In <em>no </em>instance has the Court disregarded both the date of injury <em>and </em>date of benefits received or awarded in order to impose total retroactivity upon a claimant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>SUBSTANTIVE v PROCEDURAL ASPECTS</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Section 373(1) contains procedural elements which arguably favor retroactive application of the instant statute. The procedural nature of a rebut-table presumption is unquestioned. However, upon examination of the standards of disability applicable prior to the passage of \u00a7 373(1), I find that the provision has effected key substantive changes under the wdca:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">1. The amendment designates retirees who terminate active employment under early retirement programs similar to defendant\u2019s \"30 and out\u201d plan, as a class of claimants distinct from others seeking wdca benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">2. Section 373 presumes this class of claimants has not incurred a loss of wage-earning capacity due to a work-related injury. Prior to the amendment\u2019s passage, retirees, as any other claimant, bore the burden of proving a loss of wage earning capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">3. A retiree-claimant may rebut the presumption <em>only </em>by a preponderance of evidence that the retiree is incapable due to a work-related injury of performing work within the retiree\u2019s qualifications, training, or experience. Previously, the act focused upon the narrower issue of a claimant\u2019s earning capacity within the claimant\u2019s <em>f\u00edeld </em>of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">4. Section 373 explicitly supersedes any standard of disability previously used to determine a claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits under chapters 3 and 4 of the wdca.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In my examination of the state of the law prior to \u00a7 373(l)\u2019s enactment, it is readily apparent that the Legislature has chosen to impose a more stringent standard of disability upon the plaintiffs class of claimants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the definition of disability is couched within a procedural context, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>light of its redefinition of a retiree\u2019s disability standard, I conclude that \u00a7 373(l)\u2019s substantive elements merit paramount consideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">[i]n accordance with the rule applicable to original acts, it is presumed that provisions added by the amendment affecting substantive rights are intended to operate prospectively. Provisions added by the amendment that affect substantive rights will not be construed to apply to transactions and events completed prior to its enactment unless the legislature has expressed its intent to that effect or such intent is clearly implied by the language of the amendment or by the circumstances surrounding its enactment. [1A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 22.36, pp 300-301.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Because \u00a7 373(1) defines the substantive rule of disability and is therefore determinative of plaintiff\u2019s eligibility, I find that the plaintiff\u2019s rights in this instance, as with all others present under the wdca, accrued at the time of injury and that this factor militates in favor of prospective application.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">REMEDIAL COMPONENT OF \u00a7 373(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">However, even in the instance of a purely or predominantly substantive rule, retroactive application may be employed where the provision is further deemed to be remedial in nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">An exception to the general rule is recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>where a statute is remedial or procedural in nature. . . . <em>Thus, statutes which operate in furtherance of a remedy or mode of procedure and which neither create new rights nor destroy, enlarge, or diminish existing rights are generally held to operate retrospectively </em>unless a contrary legislative intention is manifested. <em>[Franks, supra </em>at 672. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The defendant argues and I agree that the instant provision is \"remedial\u201d in that it was designed to counter decades of alleged abuse under the workers\u2019 compensation system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">For many years the most hotly discussed topic concerning the Michigan workers\u2019 compensation system was the so-called \"retiree problem.\u201d It was almost unique to this State. Its legal underpinning was the notion developed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, with some support from the judiciary . . ., that a retired worker, even one who had voluntarily retired and gone on a company-funded pension, could still be suffering from a loss of wage earning capacity. If the retiree could demonstrate that he or she had incurred a disability caused by pre-retirement job activity or working environment (a bad back from 30 years on the assembly line or a dust disease from 30 years in a foundry), the retiree was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation. It should be emphasized that in many of these cases the disability was undoubtedly genuine, at least in the physical impairment sense, and such an employee would unquestionably be eligible for medical benefits. The fighting issue was whether he was also entitled to recover for wage loss. . . . [F]or a \"Big Three\u201d automobile manufacturer (the most common target of this practice), it was plainly provoking, not to mention costly, to see workers take early retirement and walk out of a plant one day and then proceed to file workers\u2019 compensation claims the next week. [St. Antoine, Report on <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation in Michigan: Costs, Bene\u00f1ts, and Fairness </em>(1984), p 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>However, in <em>Franks, </em>this Court cautioned that this exception is inapplicable where \" '[retroactive application would] also significantly and detrimentally affect the substantive right of certain injured employees to <em>receipt </em>of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Franks, supra </em>at 673. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The defendant argues that the instant provision does not impair plaintiff\u2019s substantive right to benefits. I disagree. Defendant is correct that a claimant\u2019s benefit levels are not vested so as to shield them from review at a future date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">The right to workmen\u2019s compensation disability benefits depends on whether, at a given point in time, the claimant is within the statutory intendment. The scope of that intendment is subject to change. A determination that a claimant is not today entitled to disability benefits does not preclude reexamination of his entitlement should the facts or the law, by legislative amendment or court decision, change tomorrow. Entitlement to continuing disability benefits is an open question. <em>[Hlady v Wolverine Bolt Co, </em>393 Mich 368, 391; 224 NW2d 856 (1975) (Levin, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">However, unlike the provisions addressed in <em>Franks </em>and <em>Selk, supra, </em>\u00a7373(1) embodies the substantive determination whether a retiree is entitled to <em>any </em>benefits. Although defendant asserts the provision does not truly concern benefit entitlement, in that it excludes medical benefits, I find the compensation excluded from \u00a7 373(1) is secondary to the basic entitlement to compensation benefits which sustain an injured employee\u2019s livelihood.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Although defendant argues that \u00a7 373(1) should be applied only to benefits received after its effective date, I conclude that defendant\u2019s construction would subject plaintiff to a substantive rule of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>not in existence at the time his rights accrued under the wdca. This Court should be reticent to impose a stricter standard of review which could conceivably eliminate a claimant\u2019s entitlement to compensation benefits where they were injured prior to January 1, 1982.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Section 373(1) cannot be divorced from the wdca overall policy to balance economic fairness to employers against the protection of injured workers. Thus, in light of our prior decisions, the absence of clear legislative intent, and the statute\u2019s predominant substantive effect upon a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits, I would hold that \u00a7 373(1) is applicable solely to employees injured after its effective date. I would affirm the May 2, 1986, decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board and vacate the peremptory reversal of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> An employee who terminates active employment and is receiving nondisability pension or retirement benefits under either a private or governmental pension or retirement program, including old-age benefits under the social security act, 42 USC 301 to 1397f, that was paid by or on behalf of an employer from whom weekly benefits under this act are sought shall be presumed not to have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of a compensable injury or disease under either this chapter or chapter 4. This presumption may be rebutted only by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee is unable, because of a work related disability, to perform work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications, including training or experience.

Although court opinions often designate statutes as either prospective or retrospective, the statutes in fact are often not susceptible to such clear characterization. Many statutes are both prospective and retrospective. Characterization thus may do nothing more than reflect a judgment concerning validity or interpretation, arrived at on other grounds. For example, it has been held that a statute is not rendered retroactive merely because the facts upon which its subsequent action depends are drawn from a time antecedent to its effective date.

In that case, the Court examined \u00a7 301(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> another provision of the same public act, 1980 PA 357, and found that it \"was enacted to invalidate this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc (After Remand), </em>403 Mich 1; 268 NW2d 1 (1978), thus effecting a substantive change in the law and that the provisions of this amendment have prospective application,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Prior to enactment of \u00a7 301(2), at issue in <em>Hurd, </em>the eligibility of an employee with a mental disorder for workers\u2019 compensation was determined by the \"honest perception\u201d standard set forth in <em>Deziel, supra. </em>In <em>Hurd, </em>however, we concluded that by enacting \u00a7 301(2), as part of 1980 PA 357, the Legislature changed the standard of mental disability and that such a change was substantive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Justice Moody was quite right when he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">Whether a ruling is procedural or substantive is sometimes difficult to decide; a legal rule may have both procedural and substantive aspects that are difficult to separate.

The provision might be regarded as purely procedural if it contained only the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">(1) An employee who terminates active employment and is receiving nondisability pension or retirement benefits under either a private or governmental pension or retirement program, including old-age benefits under the social security act, 42 USC 301 to 1397f, that was paid by or on behalf of an employer from whom weekly benefits under this act are sought shall be <em>presumed </em>not to have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of a compensable injury or disease under either this chapter or chapter 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">However, the provision also includes these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">This presumption may be rebutted only by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee is unable, because of a work related disability, to perform work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications, including training or experience. <em>This standard of disability supersedes other applicable standards used to determine disability under either this chapter or chapter 4. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Obviously, \u00a7 373(1) refers both to a \"presumption\u201d and to a \"standard of disability.\u201d The language of \u00a7 373 itself makes clear that the standard set forth is different than that which would other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>wise apply. Such an interpretation is indicated by the addition of \u00a7 373(2) which mandates that eligibility for medical benefits shall not be barred by the new standard. Furthermore, the Legislature\u2019s intent to establish a new and different disability standard is emphasized by the inclusion of this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\"><em>This standard </em>of disability <em>supersedes </em>other applicable standards used to determine disability under either this chapter or chapter 4. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">While recognizing its procedural characteristics, I believe that \u00a7 373, when viewed as a whole, reflects a purpose on the part of the Legislature to change the disability standard applicable to an \"employee who terminates active employment and is receiving . . . benefits under either a private or governmental pension or retirement program . . . .\u201d Furthermore, I agree with the plaintiff that the standard set forth in \u00a7 373(1) is more stringent than the one which otherwise would have obtained. See <em>Kaarto, supra; Adair v Metropolitan Building Co, </em>38 Mich App 393; 196 NW2d 335 (1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consistent with the holding in <em>Hurd, supra, </em>I conclude that \u00a7 373 is substantive as well as procedural in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Defendant argues that even if \u00a7 373 is substantive, it should be applied retrospectively because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>is a remedial statute, citing <em>Rookledge v Garwood, </em>340 Mich 444, 453; 65 NW2d 785 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In <em>Rookledge </em>this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">It is generally understood that if a statute or amendment is \"designed to correct an existing law, redress an existing grievance, or introduce regulations conducive to the public good,\u201d it will be regarded as remedial in nature. <em>In re School District No 6, Paris and Wyoming Townships, Kent County, </em>284 Mich 132, 144 [278 NW 792 (1938)]. The same connotation is given to those statutes or amendments which apply to procedural matters rather than to. substantive rights. The definitive rule in this respect, found in 50 Am Jur, pp 33, 34, Statutes, \u00a7 15, is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\"Legislation which has been regarded as remedial in its nature includes statutes which abridge superfluities of former laws, remedying defects therein, or mischiefs thereof implying an intention to reform or extend existing rights, and having for their purpose the promotion of justice and the advancement of public welfare and of important and beneficial public objects, such as the protection of the health, morals, and safety of society, or of the public generally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">There can be no question but that \u00a7 373 was enacted by the Legislature for the purpose of remedying a perceived abuse of the workers\u2019 compensation system. Professor Theodore St. Antoine, who served two governors as an adviser on workers\u2019 compensation reform, described the problem in a report to Governor Blanchard in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">For many years the most hotly discussed topic concerning the Michigan workers\u2019 compensation system was the so-called \"retiree problem.\u201d It was almost unique to this State. Its legal underpinning was the notion developed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, with some support from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>judiciary, . . . that a retired worker, even one who had voluntarily retired and gone on a company-funded pension, could still be suffering from a loss of wage earning capacity. If the retiree could demonstrate that he or she had incurred a disability caused by pre-retirement job activity or working environment (a bad back from 30 years on the assembly line or a dust disease from 30 years in a foundry), the retiree was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation. It should be emphasized that in many of these cases the disability was undoubtedly genuine, at least in the physical impairment sense, and such an employee would unquestionably be eligible for medical benefits. The fighting issue was whether he was also entitled to recover for wage loss. . . . [F]or a \"Big Three\u201d automobile manufacturer (the most common target of this practice), it was plainly provoking, not to mention costly, to see workers take early retirement and walk out of a plant one day and then proceed to file their workers\u2019 compensation claims the next week. [St. Antoine, Report on <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation in Michigan: Costs, Bene\u00f1ts, and Fairness </em>(1984), p 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">As early as 1975, Professor St. Antoine, as chairman of the Governor\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Advisory Commission, had delivered a report to Governor Milliken which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">The question of the retirees is one of the most important, and perhaps the single most intractable, of all the issues currently arising under the Michigan workmen\u2019s compensation system. In 1973, the \"Big Three,\u201d General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler paid out over 24 million dollars to retirees. With the additional costs of administering these claims and, where necessary or appropriate, retaining counsel, the total costs to the companies exceeded $30 million. According to the Michigan Department of Commerce Data Base, other self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>insurers and the insurance carriers paid almost as much, over 20 million dollars. Hence the total cost of claims by retirees exceeded 60 million dollars in 1973, the most recent year for which reasonably firm statistics are available. With increased benefit levels since 1973 and an increased volume of claims, reasonable estimates for the total retiree cost in Michigan for 1975 range from 80 to 90 million dollars. <em>[Report of Governor's Workmen's Compensation Advisory Commission </em>(1975), p 17.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Although the 1975 advisory commission was unable to reach agreement upon recommendations for improvement of the system in Michigan, the report further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">As a solution, some employer spokesmen offer a two-step approach. Any worker who retired because of old age or under a pension plan would be rebuttably presumed to have removed himself from the labor market and therefore not capable of suffering a loss of earning capacity. The presumption could be overcome by evidence showing that the worker had been unable to obtain substantial employment because of a disability rather than because of age or economic conditions. Then, after rebutting the presumption, any retiree-claimant who was also eligible for pension benefits would have his workmen\u2019s compensation reduced to the extent of his employer funded pension benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">This solution addresses what many employers consider to be the central problem: Is the retiree prevented from working by a disability which occurred in and arose out of the course of employment or has the retiree withdrawn from the labor market and is merely seeking a little something extra? <em>[Id., </em>p 21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In 1977 an attempt to enact legislation dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>with the \"retiree problem\u201d fell short.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One commentator, in summarizing this effort, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">Some of the notorious abuses of workers\u2019 compensation in Michigan were also attacked by S. 1285 .... More importantly for curbing the \"retiree problem,\u201d S. 1285 would have created a rebuttable presumption that retirees have not suffered a loss of earnings or earning capacity as a result of a compensable injury or disease. [Hunt, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation in Michigan: Problems and Prospects </em>(Kalamazoo: W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, 1979), pp 22-23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On April 11, 1979, Governor Milliken delivered a special message to the Legislature on workers\u2019 compensation which further underscored the remedial nature of the legislation embodied in \u00a7 373. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">A frequent criticism is that Michigan, almost alone among the states, pays a large portion of its workers\u2019 compensation benefits to persons who have left the labor market for reasons other than disability._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>I recommend that we eliminate or minimize compensation payments to those persons no longer in the labor market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">Previous reform negotiations have produced general agreement that a presumption should be established that recipients of pensions and social security retirement benefits have not suffered a loss of earning capacity, unless rebutted by a preponderance of evidence. This presumption should be established in the statute. [1979 Journal of the Senate 608.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Finally, on December 30, 1980, while this case was pending before the hearing referee, \u00a7 373 was enacted by the Michigan Legislature as part of 1980 PA 357,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the first step in a series of reforms of the Michigan workers\u2019 compensation system. In light of the legislative history and other circumstances surrounding its enactment, I would conclude that \u00a7 373 is remedial<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> within the meaning of the rule laid down in <em>Rookledge, supra. </em>See also <em>Lahti v Fosterling, </em>357 Mich 578; 99 NW2d 490 (1959); <em>Karl v Bryant Air Conditioning Co, </em>416 Mich 558; 331 NW2d 456 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">As this Court said in <em>Karl, supra </em>at 575, a remedial statute may operate retrospectively if it does not \"take away vested rights.\u201d See also <em>Ballog v Knight Newspapers, Inc, </em>381 Mich 527; 164 NW2d 19 (1969); <em>Hansen-Snyder, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In assessing whether a \"vested\u201d right would be taken away, it is important to have in mind that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the nature of the right to workers\u2019 compensation is quite different from the right to recover damages in tort or other civil actions. As the Court said in <em>Franks, supra </em>at 654:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are social-welfare income-maintenance benefits. Workers\u2019 compensation is the first or progenitor safety net providing a means of income maintenance for persons who have met misfortune or whose regular income source has been cut off. All the social welfare programs \u2014 workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, social security old age, disability, and survivors benefits, no-fault automobile benefits, aid to families with dependent children, and general assistance \u2014 are directed to the same objective, income maintenance. All these programs are funded by impositions on employers and others of mandatory payments (to the government, insurers or, in the case of the self-insured, to the beneficiary), with statutorily prescribed benefits. <em>In providing for such bene\u00f1ts, the Legislature did not covenant not to amend the legislation. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In a concurring opinion, Justice Levin in <em>Franks, supra </em>at 683, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are payable weekly, and are geared to weekly wage loss. The nature of workers\u2019 compensation is that events after an award of benefits may change the extent of an entitlement to benefits. A disabled worker may cease to be disabled or obtain gainful employment. The number of the worker\u2019s dependents may change. The right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits thus generally depends on one\u2019s status, week by week, and is subject to change during any week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">A workers\u2019 compensation award, thus, differs from a judgment in a tort action where, when the plaintiff prevails, a lump-sum award is fixed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>payable without regard to whether predictions concerning the severity or longevity of the claimed damages are borne out by subsequent experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Taking into consideration the nature of the right to workers\u2019 compensation, I conclude that \u00a7 373 does not abolish or take away vested rights. See also <em>Rookledge, supra; Harsha v Detroit, </em>261 Mich 586; 246 NW 849 (1933); <em>Bejger v Zawadzki, </em>252 Mich 14; 232 NW 746 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Even though a statute is remedial and does not abolish or take away vested rights, it will not be applied retrospectively if a contrary legislative intent has been manifested. <em>Karl, supra </em>at 571; <em>Selk, supra </em>at 10, citing <em>Rookledge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In other words, the question whether a statute is to apply prospectively or retrospectively is always governed, in the final analysis, by legislative intent if it can be determined. As the Court has said, \"the <em>Rookledge </em>principle is also simply one of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Selk, supra </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Wojciechowski v General Motors Corp, </em>151 Mich App 399, 408-409; 390 NW2d 727 (1986), the Legislature did not indicate \"its retrospective or prospective intention [with respect to \u00a7 373] in clear and express language.\u201d Furthermore, a careful examination of the statute and the circumstances surrounding its enactment reveal no manifest intent that its provisions should not apply to one whose injury preceded the effective date. On the contrary, legislative history subsequent to its enactment tends to confirm an intent that \u00a7 373 should apply to all \"employee[s] who terminate active employment and [are] receiving nondisability pension or retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ment benefits\u201d regardless of when they were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Notice should be taken of the fact that on May 14, 1987, the Legislature enacted and gave immediate effect to 1987 PA 28, which amended various provisions of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act. Included was an amendment of \u00a7 354(17) (providing for coordination of social security and certain employer-financed benefits). The amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">The decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Division, </em>422 Mich 636 (1985) is declared to have been erroneously rendered insofar as it interprets this section [\u00a7 354], it having been and being the legislative intention not to coordinate payments under this section resulting from liability pursuant to section 351, 361, or 835 for personal injuries occurring before March 31, 1982. It is the purpose of this amendatory act to so affirm. This remedial and curative amendment shall be liberally construed to effectuate this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Without venturing comment concerning the constitutionality of such a pronouncement, an issue not before us, I believe the amendment sheds some light on the intent of the Legislature, at least as of May 14, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">It is significant that the Legislature, through its limited and carefully worded amendment, sought to \"overrule\u201d only that part of our decision in <em>Franks </em>which interpreted \u00a7 354. Of course, in <em>Franks </em>we also considered whether \u00a7 358 (providing for the offset of unemployment compensation benefits) should apply to a workers\u2019 compensation claimant whose injury preceded the provision\u2019s effective date. We held that \"the setoff provision of \u00a7 358 may be applied to reduce workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tion liability to workers injured prior to its effective date.\u201d <em>Franks, supra </em>at 668-669.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">It is also noteworthy that on May 14, 1987, when the Legislature enacted 1987 PA 28, which amended \u00a7 354 and several other sections of the act, it chose not to amend \u00a7373, despite the fact that more than a year earlier, on May 5, 1986, the Court of Appeals in <em>Wojciechowski, supra </em>at 408, had ruled that \u00a7 373 \"which creates a presumption of no loss of wage earning . . . should be retroactively applied\u201d in a case where the injury occurred prior to the provision\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Of course, courts should not read too much into silence on the part of the Legislature. On one occasion Justice Voelker caustically questioned that members of the Legislature are \"clamoring and elbowing each other in their zeal to get at the pearls of wisdom embalmed in the latest decisions and advance sheets . . . .\u201d <em>Van Dorpel v Haven-Busch Co, </em>350 Mich 135, 146; 85 NW2d 97 (1957).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">However, where, as in the case of workers\u2019 compensation reform legislation, the final product of intense bargaining represents a compromise to accommodate strong, divergent interests, it would be unrealistic to believe that the contending forces in and beyond the Legislature were not fully aware of what was left out of the package, as well as what was included. Particularly in such situations, silence and inaction on the part of the Legislature, can be very meaningful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Guidance may also be drawn from the fact that, while it enacted 1980 PA 357 on December 30, 1980, the Legislature specifically directed that \u00a7373 should not take effect until a year later, on January 1, 1982. Comments made by Justice Levin in <em>Franks, </em>although related to other provisions of the 1980 and 1981 reform acts, are equally applicable to \u00a7 373:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">The legislative purpose in providing a specific future effective date was to indicate when the provisions of the amendatory acts . . . would take effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">[T]here is no basis in the language of the . . . reform legislation or in its history that would justify the conclusion that the Legislature, which expressly stated that these amendments were all to become effective on January 1, 1982, did not intend that they would be effective as to all weekly payments of workers\u2019 compensation becoming due on or after that effective date even though the worker was injured before that date. <em>[Id. </em>at 681, 683-684 (Levin, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Moreover, when the effectiveness of a statute has been postponed to a specific future date (for one year in the case of \u00a7 373) it seems reasonable to believe, in the absence of some contrary indication, that a purpose of the Legislature was to provide advance notice to those who would be affected by its provisions. Obviously, if, as plaintiff contends, the Legislature had intended that \u00a7 373 should apply only to those who would be injured in work-related accidents occurring after the effective date, the purpose of notice could not be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In the absence of contrary intent expressed by the Legislature (e.g., such as that provided with respect to \u00a7 354), I believe a reasonable construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tion requires that a statute which contains a specific future effective date should be applied from and after that date to all who are expressly covered by its terms. The Legislature has often demonstrated that when it wishes to \"grandfather\u201d or except from coverage a particular group, it can find the language to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Accordingly, I would hold that the provisions of \u00a7 373 of 1980 PA 357 are applicable with respect to workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable after January 1, 1982, in determining the amount, if any, of weekly benefits due and payable to any employee described in \u00a7373(1) without regard to when the employee may have been injured or disabled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> MCL 418.373; MSA 17.237(373).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301X2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\"> Justice Moody\u2019s commentary focused upon judicial changes in the law; however, I believe his statement is equally applicable to statutory changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"> See, generally, St. Antoine, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation in Michigan: Costs, Bene\u00f1ts, and Fairness </em>(1984); 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 57.22; Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan: Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7 8.01 <em>et seq.; </em>Leslie, <em>The tortured course of the de\u00f1nition of disability in Michigan workers\u2019 compensation law, past, present and future, </em>5 Cooley L R 65 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> See 1977 Journal of the Senate 2350-2351, and proposed SB 1285, \u00a7 371(1) which would have provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">An employee who retires or who otherwise terminates active employment and is eligible for or receiving pension or retirement benefits under a private or governmental program or is eligible for or receiving social security retirement benefits, shall be presumed not to have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of a compensable injury or disease.
