In our view, there is nothing in the statute which suggests a legislative purpose to preclude this derivative cause of action, and, indeed, to conclude otherwise would undermine the legislative purpose underlying the act. Thus, we believe, contrary to the partial dissent of Justice Griffin, that a derivative claim for loss of consortium should be recognized under the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Second, we must consider whether exemplary damages, apart from actual damages, may be awarded for violations of the Civil Rights Act. In this respect, we are in agreement with Justice Griffin and conclude that exemplary damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>may not be awarded apart from actual damages. However, we would emphasize that, under longstanding Michigan law, the award of exemplary damages was duplicative of certain aspects of actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Michigan has long recognized a cause of action for loss of consortium in favor of spouses, <em>Montgomery v Stephan, </em>359 Mich 33, 38; 101 NW2d 227 (1960). But see <em>Sizemore v Smock, </em>430 Mich 283, 299; 422 NW2d 666 (1988) (concurring opinion of Justice Griffin suggesting that <em>Berger v Weber, </em>411 Mich 1; 303 NW2d 424 [1981], is no longer to be regarded as precedent). A claim for loss of consortium is simply one for loss of society and companionship. As Justice Griffin explains, a claim for loss of consortium is usually considered to be derivative, but only in the sense that it does not arise at all unless the other, impaired spouse has sustained some legally cognizable harm or injury. Thus, courts have consistently treated loss of consortium not as an item of damages, but as a separate cause of action. <em>Montgomery, supra. </em>See also Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 125, pp 931-934. This fact is often obscured by the use of the term \"derivative\u201d and also by the common procedural requirement that the claim be joined with that of the impaired spouse. As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">So far as damages are based on intangible losses of society and affection, there is some risk that a jury hearing the husband\u2019s claim will consciously or not, include something in the verdict for the wife\u2019s loss as well, and vice versa. To minimize this risk, some courts have required that the main claim and the consortium claim be tried together, at least in the ordinary situation. [Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>p 933. See also <em>Rusinek v Schultz, Snyder &amp; Steele Lumber Co, </em>411 Mich 502, 508; 309 NW2d 163 (1981).] .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>In our view, the partial dissent of Justice Griffin obscures the fact that loss of consortium is a separate cause of action and thus misstates the issue presented in this case. The question is not whether a cause of action is available under the Civil Rights Act, but whether there is anything in the act which would preclude this independent cause of action. We believe that this question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In <em>Boscaglia v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>420 Mich 308; 362 NW2d 642 (1984), we considered a distinctly different question \u2014 whether Michigan\u2019s Fair Employment Practices Act, 1955 PA 251, authorized a claim for loss of consortium. In doing so, we principally relied upon the remedial language of the fepa and its focus on equitable relief. <em>Boscaglia, supra </em>at 322. That language specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">If, upon the preponderance of the evidence on the record considered as a whole, the [fair employment practices] commission shall determine that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair employment practice, the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unfair employment practice and to take such further affirmative or other action as will effectuate the purposes of this act, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees with or without back pay, or admission or restoration to union membership, including a requirement for reports of the manner of compliance. [1955 PA 251, \u00a7 7(h).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In addition, the <em>Boscaglia </em>Court noted that title vn of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-5(g), was similarly limited to equitable remedies and had been construed to preclude a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>action for loss of consortium. <em>Boscaglia, supra </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The Civil Rights Act, 1976 PA 453, which supplanted the fepa, is not limited to remedying discrimination in employment, but extends to public accommodations, services, and educational institutions. In language befitting this comprehensive scheme, art 8 of the Civil Rights Act includes its own civil action enforcement provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">A person alleging a violation of this act may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, or both. [MCL 37.2801(1); MSA 3.548(801)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Nothing in the language of this provision suggests a legislative intent to preclude a cause of action for loss of consortium. Indeed, elsewhere in art 8 of the act it is emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">This act shall not be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state. [MCL 37.2803; MSA 3.548(803X1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The interpretive provision of \u00a7 803 of the Civil Rights Act mirrors the interpretive provision of Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to diminish the right of any party to direct and immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>It is therefore apparent that the legislative purpose underlying the civil enforcement provision of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide all rights embraced in Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>over, it is apparent that Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29 itself cannot be construed to limit the legal and equitable remedies of the Michigan citizen. A right of action for loss of consortium is not only an existing legal remedy, but one which was in existence long before the adoption of Const 1963. <em>Montgomery, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Nothing in the language of the statute itself warrants such a restrictive interpretation. The partial dissent has fixed upon the opening clause of \u00a7801(1), which provides: \"A person alleging a violation of this act . . . .\u201d The partial dissent asserts that a spouse in an action for loss of consortium is not such a person. This is obviously incorrect. However, it is undisputed that loss of consortium is a <em>derivative </em>cause of action and the complaining spouse must allege a violation of the act to substantiate the claim. Thus, the clear language of the statute would support recognition of a cause of action for loss of consortium. <em>Hiltz v Phil\u2019s Quality Market, </em>417 Mich 335, 343; 337 NW2d 237 (1983). Moreover, the fact that the act itself does not confer civil rights upon the spouse is entirely irrelevant to whether an independent cause of action exists for loss of consortium.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Properly perceived, Craig Eide\u2019s claim for loss of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>sortium is not a claim under the Civil Rights Act, but a claim at common law. Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Assuming that any construction of \u00a7801(1) of the act is necessary, it must first be compared with the correlative language of its statutory predecessor, the fepa. The opening clause of the fepa, \u00a7 7(b) was: \"Any individual claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful employment practice . . . .\u201d As we emphasized in <em>Boscaglia, </em>the complainant in a derivative cause of action, such as loss of consortium, does not claim to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful employment practice, but by the subsequent injury to the impaired spouse. <em>Boscaglia, supra </em>at 322. In contrast, the opening clause of the civil enforcement provision of the Civil Rights Act is: \"A person alleging a violation of this act . . . .\u201d It is presumed that a change of language in a statute is intended to change the result of the statute. 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 45.12, pp 54-55. We would, therefore, construe this broadening of the statutory language to imply a broadening of the remedy to which it is addressed. Such a construction is also consistent with the well-established rule that remedial statutes are to be liberally construed to suppress the evil and advance the remedy. 3 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 60.01, p 55. Therefore, in our view, neither the clear language of the act nor conventional rules of statutory construction support the partial dissent\u2019s view that \u00a7 801(1) precludes a claim for loss of consortium.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We have addressed the intrinsic analysis of the partial dissent because we believe that it is ultimately flawed. However, we cannot embrace the partial dissent\u2019s implicit assumption that resolution of this question may be found in the letter of the statute. As this Court has previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">The Civil Rights Act did not merely codify preexisting statutes and procedural remedies. It worked an extensive expansion of the preexisting substantive provisions of civil rights legislation. <em>[Matras v Amoco Oil Co, </em>424 Mich 675, 696-697; 385 NW2d 586 (1986).][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In our view, the comprehensive nature of the Civil Rights Act makes it qualitatively different from any predecessor statute, such as the fepa, and far greater than the sum of these \"parts.\u201d The fepa remedies provision was modeled after the federal Fair Employment Practices Act, <em>Boscaglia, supra </em>at 323, which was in turn modeled after the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 USC 160. <em>Albemarle Paper Co v Moody, </em>422 US 405, 417-419; 95 S Ct 2362; 45 L Ed 2d 280 (1975). All are essentially administrative schemes that focus upon the <em>employment </em>relationship, and the equitable remedies provided therein were designed to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>problems in that relationship. See 1955 PA 251, \u00a7 7(h). The Civil Rights Act is much broader in scope.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To focus upon any particular language of the statute, much less a flawed reading of that language, is to ignore the manifest breadth and comprehensive nature of this remedial statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">This Court was acutely aware of the limitations of the fepa when it fashioned a judicially created, private remedy for racial discrimination in employment. <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537; 189 NW2d 243 (1971). Our restraint in further extending this judicially created remedy under <em>Boscaglia </em>was heavily influenced, if not solely dependent upon, the limitations of the fepa remedy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No such limitation is presented under the Civil Rights Act. Indeed, the Court of Appeals and federal courts have consistently extended the remedies provided under the Civil Rights Act to damages for humiliation, embarrassment, and outrage. See, e.g., <em>Schafke v Chrysler Corp, </em>147 Mich App 751, 754; 383 NW2d 141 (1985), lv den 424 Mich 892 (1986); <em>Slayton v Michigan Host, Inc, </em>122 Mich App 411, 416-417; 332 NW2d 498 (1983); <em>Freeman v Kelvinator, Inc, </em>469 F Supp 999, 1004 (ED Mich, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Finally, we believe that the partial dissent is flawed in its continuing reliance upon federal precedent under title vn of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-5(g). While we have previously noted the refusal of federal courts to recognize claims for loss of consortium under title vii, <em>Boscaglia, supra, </em>we have not based our interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>of Michigan law upon them. Again, it must be emphasized that a claim for loss of consortium is an <em>independent </em>cause of action and not merely an item of damages. That claims for loss of consortium are not properly brought under title vii is apparent from the language of its remedies provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. [42 USC 2000e-5(g).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The title vii remedies provision does not merely omit loss of consortium, but actually limits the claimant to equitable relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In contrast, loss of consortium is a legal remedy and therefore unavailable under title vii. <em>Hooten v Pennsylvania College of Optometry, </em>601 F Supp 1151, 1155, n 2 (ED Pa, 1984); <em>Pryor v United States Gypsum, </em>585 F Supp 311, 317 (WD Mo, 1984). Furthermore, although title vii does not preclude an independent action under state law or other federal statutes, <em>Johnson v Railway Express Agency, </em>421 US 454, 459; 95 S Ct 1716; 44 L Ed 2d 295 (1975), the extremely limited scope of federal common law following <em>Erie R Co v Tomkins, </em>304 US 64, 78; 58 S Ct 817; 82 L Ed 1188 (1937), does not extend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>title vii. <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc v Transport Workers Union, AFL-CIO, </em>451 US 77; 101 S Ct 1571; 67 L Ed 2d 750 (1981).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, generally, 19 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a74514 <em>et seq., </em>pp 217 if. Indeed, it is doubtful that even a pendent state claim for loss of consortium could be maintained in a title vii action because of stringent jurisdictional limitations over pendent parties. <em>Fritts v Niehouse, </em>604 F Supp 823 (WD Mo, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Michigan law is not bound by these statutory and jurisdictional restraints. The Michigan Civil Rights Act now contains its own civil enforcement provision, allowing both legal and equitable remedies without qualification. Michigan common law is not limited by the <em>Erie </em>doctrine and has in fact long recognized the right of each spouse to an independent action for loss of consortium. <em>Boscaglia </em>simply provides no authority in this case. As explained by Justice Smith in <em>Montgomery, supra </em>at 38, \"Our oath is to do justice, not to perpetuate error.\u201d Finding no other principled basis either within or without the opinion of the partial dissent for this restriction of the civil rights of Michigan citizens, we conclude that Craig Eide has properly stated a claim for loss of consortium under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">As we have previously noted, we agree with the conclusion of the partial dissent that the award of exemplary damage to Mrs. Eide was in error. The judgment of the circuit court is, therefore, affirmed in part and reversed in part. This matter is remanded to the circuit court for entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion._</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Brickley, Cavanagh, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-11\"> Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29 provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">There is hereby established a civil rights commission which shall consist of eight persons, not more than four of whom shall be members of the same political party, who shall be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, for four-year terms not more than two of which shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>expire in the same year. It shall be the duty of the commission in a manner which may be prescribed by law to investigate alleged discrimination against any person because of religion, race, color or national origin in the enjoyment of the civil rights guaranteed by law and by this constitution, and to secure the equal protection of such civil rights without such discrimination. The legislature shall provide an annual appropriation for the effective operation of the commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">The commission shall have power, in accordance with the provisions of this constitution and of general laws governing administrative agencies, to promulgate rules and regulations for its own procedures, to hold hearings, administer oaths, through court authorization to require the attendance of witnesses and the submission of records, to take testimony, and to issue appropriate orders. The commission shall have other powers provided by law to carry out its purposes. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to diminish the right of any party to direct and immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">Appeals from final orders of the commission, including cease and desist orders and refusals to issue complaints, shall be tried de novo before the circuit court having jurisdiction provided by law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\"> Further indication that the interpretive language of Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29 was intended to preclude this article from restricting any known legal or equitable remedies can be gleaned from the debate on the Garvin Amendment which would have given the Civil Rights Commission exclusive jurisdiction during the processing of complaints before the commission. The Garvin Amendment ultimately failed, but in support of it, Delegate William Ford remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">What is happening here, when we look at it in the first instance, is that we are creating an administrative body which we hope will have the general characteristics of an administrative body and that when the legislature defines its powers, the legislature is going to be directed to do certain things, but is not going to be restricted any more than necessary. It is possible to construe this language to be a restriction on the legislature never to ever give to this administrative body original jurisdiction over any matter involving civil rights in the first instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\"><em>There isn\u2019t anyone, I am sure, including Mr. Garvin, who would advocate an administrative remedy to the exclusion of your rights in the court, </em>but the whole principle of administrative law is that you have a specialized tribunal that deals with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>special subject matter and has people especially trained to deal with that subject matter, and because they are dealing only with a certain limited area, have day to day actual knowledge of the conditions that exist. [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 2192.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> Contrary to the assertion of the partial dissent, the Civil Rights Act does not confer civil rights only upon employees and applicants for employment. The act also creates a cause of action for discrimination in public accommodations, MCL 37.2301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(301) <em>et seq., </em>education, MCL 37.2401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(401) <em>et seq., </em>and in housing, MCL 37.2501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(501) <em>et seq. </em>Furthermore, it is misleading to suggest that civil rights of employees and job applicants are \"created\u201d by the Civil Rights Act since, in my view, these rights are created in the United States or Michigan Constitutions, and the act merely creates certain remedies for their violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\"> Although the partial dissent quotes the House Legislative Analysis, Second Analysis, HB 4055, December 30,1976 (as enrolled), it does so selectively. The full text of the analysis of the civil action provision explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The bill would allow a person alleging a violation of this Act to bring a civil action in the circuit court for injunctive relief, damages, or both. <em>The Act could not be construed to diminish the right of a person to legal or equitable remedies in Michigan courts. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b181-10\"> We are not persuaded by the partial dissent\u2019s suggestion, contrary to <em>Matras, </em>that the Civil Rights Act merely codified existing rights. Read in its full context, Department of Labor Analysis, HB 4055, April 5, 1976, provides scant support for the general statement that the purpose of the bill was merely to codify remedies. In any case, the Department of Labor\u2019s unique vantage suggests a rather limited analysis of the act, consistent with the scope of that department\u2019s interests.

In that case, an employee complained of employment discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment Practices Act (fepa),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and his wife joined in the action seeking damages for loss of consortium. This Court determined that although the fepa made available, for the first time, a remedy to an employee claiming employment discrimination, \"[t]he statute did not . . . provide a remedy to the employee\u2019s spouse for loss of consortium or injury to the marital relationship.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Undergirding the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Boscaglia </em>was recognition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\"prior to the passing of [the fepa] in 1955, there was in Michigan no recognized legal remedy for acts of discrimination ... in private employment.\u201d <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>[385 Mich 537, 552; 189 NW2d 243 (1971)]. The common law did not provide a remedy either to an employee who claimed to be a victim of employment discrimination or to an employee\u2019s spouse who claimed to have suffered injury to the marital relationship as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>a result of the discrimination against the employee. <em>[Boscaglia, supra, </em>p 321.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">This Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\"the question whether a statute creates a private right of action is ultimately 'one of [legislative] intent, not one of whether this Court thinks that it can improve upon the statutory scheme that [the Legislature] enacted into law ....\u2019\u201d <em>[Universities Research Ass\u2019n, Inc v Coutu, </em>450 US 754, 770; 101 S Ct 1451; 67 L Ed 2d 662 (1981) (quoting <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co v Redington, </em>442 US 560, 578; 99 S Ct 2479; 61 L Ed 2d 82 [1979]). <em>Boscaglia, supra, </em>pp 317-318.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">After examining the language and history of the fepa, the unanimous <em>Boscaglia </em>Court concluded that the fepa did not provide a derivative cause of action for an employee\u2019s spouse.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The question once again is one of legislative intent. Absent a legislative intent to provide such a derivative cause of action, the spouse of a person subjected to discrimination does not have a right of recovery. <em>[Id., </em>p 324.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Boscaglia </em>was limited to the provisions of the fepa, and we expressly reserved judgment as to whether an employee\u2019s spouse might maintain an action for loss of consortium under the Civil Rights Act. <em>Id., </em>p 324, n 23. Accordingly, we look now to the language and history of the Civil Rights Act to see how it differs from the fepa.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Enacted by the Michigan Legislature in 1976, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, national origin, religion, height, weight, or marital status in employment, housing, use of public accommodations, public service, and educational facilities. Broader in scope, it repealed and replaced the fepa, which was limited in its application to discrimination in private employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In reaching the conclusion that an employee\u2019s spouse could not maintain an action under the fepa for loss of consortium, the <em>Boscaglia </em>Court focused on the remedies section of the fepa which in relevant part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\"><em>Any individual claiming to be aggrieved </em>by an alleged unlawful employment practice may . . . make, sign and file with the board ... a verified complaint in writing .... [MCL 423.307(b); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>MSA 17.458(7)Gt&gt;). Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">This Court held that an employee\u2019s spouse was not a person \"aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Boscaglia, supra, </em>p 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Corresponding language in the remedies section of the Civil Rights Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\"><em>A person alleging a violation of this act </em>may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, or both. [MCL 37.2801(1); MSA 3.548(801)(1). Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">As this Court has said, \"[statutory analysis necessarily begins with the wording of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Carr v General Motors Corp, </em>425 Mich 313, 317; 389 NW2d 686 (1986). The phrase \"a violation of this act\u201d plainly refers to a violation of an individual\u2019s civil rights as defined in the Civil Rights Act. Insofar as employment discrimination is concerned, the act makes clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">[t]he opportunity to obtain employment . . . without discrimination because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, <em>sex, </em>height, weight, or marital status as prohibited by this act, is recognized and <em>declared to be a civil </em>right.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] [MCL 37.2102(1); MSA 3.548(102)(1). Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">As we read the act, this civil right is conferred upon two groups of individuals: (1) employees, and (2) applicants for employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">(1) An employer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">(a) Fail or refuse to hire, or recruit, or discharge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>or otherwise discriminate against <em>an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, </em>because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">(b) Limit, segregate, or classify <em>an employee or applicant for employment </em>in a way which deprives or tends to deprive <em>employee or applicant </em>of an employment opportunity, or otherwise adversely affects the status of an <em>employee or applicant </em>because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">(c) Segregate, classify, or otherwise discriminate against a <em>person </em>on the basis of sex <em>with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment, including a bene\u00f1t plan or system. </em>[MCL 37.2202; MSA 3.548(202). Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Significantly, the only conduct addressed by this controlling portion of the act is conduct \"with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment,\u201d which directly affects employees or applicants for employment. This Court has stated that \"[w]here a statute creates and regulates, . . . and names the parties granted [the] right to invoke its provisions . . ., such parties only may act.\u201d <em>Taylor v Public Utilities Comm, </em>217 Mich 400, 403; 186 NW 485 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Further, our review of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act indicates that there were two principal purposes behind its enactment, neither of which lends support to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Legislature intended to create a new derivative cause of action for the spouse of an employee who complains of employment discrimination. First, the history makes plain that it was the Legislature\u2019s purpose to <em>\"codify </em>protection against discrimination in the areas of employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>housing, education and public accommodations.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) Prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Act, there were four separate statutes which dealt with civil rights protection in the several areas mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The codification purpose was served by a change in the wording of the remedies section from the phrase \"[a]ny individual claiming to be aggrieved <em>by an alleged unlawful employment practice\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) in the fepa to \"[a] person alleging a violation of this act\u201d in the Civil Rights Act. Thus, the remedies section of the act was not limited to employment discrimination actions. We do not read this change as creating a new cause of action for Mr. Eide. The act requires that the person filing a complaint must be the \"person alleging a violation of this act.\u201d MCL 37.2801(1); MSA 3.548(801)(1). There is no indication in the act that a person alleging a violation of the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>might be anyone other than a person whose rights have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Mr. Eide does not claim that he is the victim of discrimination. His civil rights were not violated, and, since he makes no such claim, we conclude that he is not \"a person alleging a violation\u201d within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">A second purpose behind the Civil Rights Act, as revealed by its legislative history, was to provide by statute for an alternate, equal forum in the circuit courts for individuals otherwise entitled to file a complaint with the Civil Rights Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrary to the position urged by plaintiffs, the legislative history reflects no intention on the part of the Legislature to expand the class of protected persons. An analysis provided by the House Legislative Analysis Section explained the purpose of the \"direct access\u201d provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">The bill would also outline more specifically the legal action a person could take <em>if that person feels that he or she has been unfairly discriminated against, </em>and would provide stricter penalties for violation of the Act. [House Legislative Analysis, First Analysis, HB 4055, April 9, 1976, p 1; House Legislative Analysis, Second Analysis, HB 4055 (as enrolled), December 30, 1976, p 1. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Obviously, the focus of the act plainly rests on persons who bring discrimination actions in their own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">It is argued on behalf of plaintiffs that a statutory basis is not required to bring a derivative action for loss of consortium because this claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>existed at common law and continues to be available unless abrogated by the constitution or statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">However, plaintiffs rely on cases where the action for loss of consortium was derivative to recognized common-law claims. As discussed in <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, supra, </em>385 Mich 552, prior to the enactment of the pepa, employment discrimination was not a recognized common-law tort in Michigan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The common law did not provide a remedy either to an employee who claimed to be a victim of discrimination or to an employee\u2019s spouse for loss of consortium as a result of the discrimination. <em>Boscaglia v Michigan Bell, supra, </em>420 Mich 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We therefore find inapposite plaintiffs\u2019 citation of <em>Rusinek v Schultz, Snyder &amp; Steele Lumber Co, </em>411 Mich 502, 507; 309 NW2d 163 (1981), for the proposition that \"statutes which abolish the common law should be construed narrowly.\u201d <em>Rusinek </em>involved the recovery of damages for personal injuries and loss of consortium as a result of an automobile accident. Such actions were recognized under Michigan tort law prior to the enactment of the no-fault statute. Cf. <em>Cotton v Minter, </em>469 F Supp 199 (ED Mich, 1979); <em>Warner v Brigham, </em>90 Mich App 640; 282 NW2d 428 (1979) (involving claims under the no-fault statute). Here, by recognizing only those actions allowed under the Civil Rights Act, this Court would not abolish any loss of consortium claim as it existed at common law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>While it is true that a derivative<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> claim for loss of consortium has been recognized in connection with various other common-law causes of action, <em>Montgomery v Stephan, </em>359 Mich 33, 49; 101 NW2d 227 (1960), we do not regard that to be a basis for judicial expansion of the terms of the Civil Rights Act, which is wholly a creature of the Legislature. Such expansion would ignore the reasoning of <em>Boscaglia </em>and its holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">[ajbsent a legislative intent to provide such a derivative cause of action, the spouse of a person subjected to discrimination does not have a right of recovery. <em>[Boscaglia, supra, </em>p 324.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Having declined in <em>Boscaglia </em>to go beyond the terms of the fepa, we would take the same approach with respect to the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Civil Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Act does not provide a remedy on the basis of loss of consortium for the spouse of an individual who claims to be the subject of discrimination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Next, we turn to the question whether exemplary damages were properly awarded to Mrs. Eide. As already noted, in addition to $240,000 in compensatory damages, the jury\u2019s verdict included an award to Mrs. Eide of $32,000 in exemplary damages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In the early Michigan decisions, there was authority for assessing exemplary or punitive damages in a civil proceeding for the purpose of punishing a defendant for egregious conduct. However, in 1884 Justice Cooley wrote two opinions which sharply altered the course of Michigan jurisprudence in this area.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since then, Michigan has been among a minority of jurisdictions which adhere to the rule that exemplary damages may not be awarded to punish. They are available, if at all, only as an element of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In <em>Stilson v Gibbs, </em>53 Mich 280, 284; 18 NW 815 (1884), Justice Cooley wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">[I]t is manifestly proper that the jury should estimate the damages with the aggravating circumstances in mind, and that they should endeavor fairly to compensate the plaintiff for the wrong he has suffered. But in all cases it is to be distinctly borne in mind that <em>compensation to the plaintiff is the purpose in view, </em>and any instruction which is calculated to lead them to suppose that besides compensating the plaintiff they may punish the defendant is erroneous. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The continuing viability of this principle was recognized in <em>Kewin v Massachusetts Mutual Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 401, 419; 295 NW2d 50 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">In Michigan, exemplary damages are recoverable as <em>compensation </em>to the plaintiff, <em>not as punishment </em>of the defendant. [Citations omitted.] Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>review of the precedent indicates that those cases which permit recovery of exemplary damages as an element of damages involve tortious conduct on the part of the defendant. [Citations omitted.] An award of exemplary damages is considered proper if it compensates a plaintiff for the \"humiliation, sense of outrage, and indignity\u201d resulting from injuries \"maliciously, wilfully and wantonly\u201d inflicted by the defendant. <em>McFadden </em>[v <em>Tate, </em>350 Mich 84, 89; 85 NW2d 181 (1957)]. The theory of these cases is that the reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct both intensifies the injury and justifies the award of exemplary damages as compensation for the harm done the plaintiff\u2019s feelings. [Emphasis supplied.][<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">However, in 1982, this Court ruled that exemplary damages for mental distress are not separately recoverable as \"exemplary\u201d damages where a plaintiff is fully compensated for mental distress through the award of actual or \"compensatory\u201d damages. In <em>Veselenak v Smith, </em>414 Mich 567, 573-574; 327 NW2d 261 (1982), this Court concluded that an earlier justification for separately awarding exemplary damages for mental distress no longer exists;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">A close reading of the early exemplary damages cases also suggests that these unusual damages may have been used to supply a remedy for mental injury not otherwise recognized. Actual damages compensated for economic loss, but not for non-economic loss. In addition, the award of actual damages seemed to preclude the award of additional compensation for non-economic loss. <em>Warren </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>v Cole, </em>15 Mich 265 (1867); <em>Hyatt v Adams, </em>16 Mich 180 (1867). Assuming actual damages were not provable but mental injury certain, exemplary damages became available to compensate the injured party. <em>Fay v Swan, </em>44 Mich 544; 7 NW 215 (1880).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">As proof of actual damages is no longer a bar to the award of exemplary damages, so too <em>actual damages, where properly pled, now include compensation for shame, morti\u00f1cation, mental pain and anxiety, Beath v Rapid R Co, </em>119 Mich 512; 78 NW 537 (1899), and for annoyance, discomfiture, and humiliation, <em>Grenawalt v Nyhuis, </em>335 Mich 76; 55 NW2d 736 (1952). In short, <em>actual damages now include compensation for mental distress and anguish. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In <em>Veselenak, supra, </em>p 576, we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Amicus curiae . . . contends that ordinary damages and exemplary damages are not redundant. It maintains that a distinction may be drawn between \"mental distress intrinsic to the injury itself (no matter how it occurred) and mental distress emanating from the manner in which the injury occurred.\u201d In addition, it claims that ordinary damages for shame and mortification and exemplary damages for humiliation and indignity are compensating \"distinct wrongs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">These distinctions are, at least, legally unsound. Semantic niceties aside, juries are not asked to differentiate between mental states, such as shame, mortification, humiliation and indignity. Juries are asked to compensate mental distress and anguish, which flows naturally from the alleged misconduct and may be described in such terms as shame, mortification, humiliation and indignity. In addition, <em>if the plaintiff is being compensated for all mental distress and anguish, it matters not whether the source of the mental distress and anguish is the injury itself or the way </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>in which the injury occurred. </em>[Emphasis supplied.][<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Following <em>Veselenak, </em>this Court has further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">When compensatory damages can make the injured party whole, this Court has denied exemplary damages. <em>[Hayes-Albion Corp v Kuberski, </em>421 Mich 170, 187; 364 NW2d 609 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Notwithstanding the reasoning in <em>Veselenak, </em>we have recognized a distinction where the cause of action is statutorily based and where the statute expressly provides for exemplary damages. In <em>Peisner v Detroit Free Press, </em>421 Mich 125, 135, n 10; 364 NW2d 600 (1984), a libel case, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\"><em>In the absence of a legislative prescription for exemplary damages, </em>we held in <em>Veselenak </em>that compensatory-type exemplary damages are merely a component of actual damages attributable to defendant\u2019s conduct and hence should not be separately awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\"><em>In the libel context, by contrast, the Legislature has provided separately for actual damages for injury to feelings and \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages. </em>In keeping with the reasoning applied in <em>Veselenak, </em>we define exemplary and punitive damages in this context to be a component of compensatory damages awardable only where defendant\u2019s conduct amounts to common-law malice. [Emphasis supplied.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Unlike \u00a7 2911(2) of the libel statute, MCL 600.2911(2); MSA 27A.2911(2), the Civil Rights Act includes no express \"legislative prescription\u201d for exemplary damages. The remedies section of the Civil Rights Act in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">A person alleging a violation of this act may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">As used in subsection (1), \"damages\u201d means damages for injury or loss caused by each violation of this act, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. [MCL 37.2801; MSA 3.548(801).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Clearly, there is no express provision in the Civil Rights Act for exemplary damages. Further, our review of its legislative history reveals no basis for inferring a legislative intent to provide such an unusual remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">It is noteworthy that the Legislature in fashioning other statutes has not hesitated, where it intended such a result, to include words expressly providing for exemplary damages. For example, exemplary damages are expressly made available in the following statutes: MCL 295.127; MSA 12.1377 (Weather Modification Control Act); MCL 408.488; MSA 17.277(18) (wage violation); MCL 600.2911; MSA 27A.2911 (libel or slander); MCL 750.539h; MSA 28.807(8) (eavesdropping, allowing for punitive damages).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">A comparison of the language used in the Civil Rights Act with the language employed in the remedies section for the Weather Modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Control Act, MCL 295.127; MSA 12.1377, is revealing. The latter statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">(1) A person alleging a violation of this act or a rule promulgated pursuant to this act, may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, <em>and may bring an action for exemplary damages of not more than $500.00.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">(3) As used in subsection (1), \"damages\u201d means damages for injury or loss caused by each violation of this act, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The specific provision for exemplary damages in the language of the Weather Modification Control Act stands in sharp contrast with \u00a7 801 of the Civil Rights Act, particularly in light of the fact that the definition of \"damages\u201d is identical in both statutes. Obviously if the Legislature had determined that exemplary damages should be available in civil rights actions, it could easily have found the words to say so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Having found no basis in the statute for a separate award of exemplary damages,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we would follow this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Veselenak, supra, </em>and would hold that the jury was erroneously instructed in the instant case to award Mrs. Eide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>damages on the basis of mental distress as <em>both </em>actual and exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">We are not unmindful that good reasons can be summoned to justify recovery of exemplary damages by victims of sexual discrimination or harassment. Judge Feikens made a valid point in <em>Freeman v Kelvinator, Inc, </em>469 F Supp 999, 1004 (ED Mich, 1979), when he wrote that \"[a]s anyone who has been the victim of discrimination can attest, the wounds run deeper than the pocketbook.\u201d Nevertheless, we are mindful also that the Legislature may have good reasons for omitting from the statute any specific reference to exemplary damages. In the final analysis, whether exemplary damages should be allowed is essentially a policy question, and particularly where, as in this case, the underlying cause of action is a legislative product, we deem it appropriate to leave such a policy determination to the Legislature. See <em>Davidson v Secretary of State, </em>351 Mich 4, 8; 87 NW2d 131 (1957); <em>French v Ingham Co, </em>342 Mich 690, 700; 71 NW2d 244 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed with respect to the award to Mr. Eide of damages for loss of consortium and with respect to the award to Mrs. Eide of exemplary damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b203-7\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> 1976 PA 453, as amended by 1977 PA 162, 1979 PA 91, and 1982 PA 45, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\"> This Court\u2019s order granting leave to appeal specifically limited our review to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">(1) whether the Civil Rights Act provides a remedy based on loss of consortium, and (2) whether the Civil Rights Act allows recovery of exemplary damages.
