The judge of compensation found that petitioner was dependent on his father within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-13 but denied compensation benefits because the statute provides that in computing compensation for dependents, \u201cexcept husband, wife, parents and stepparents, only those under 18 or over 40 years of age shall be included____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-13 i. On this appeal petitioner argues that the statute \u201cviolates the equal protection clause, is arbitrary and capricious, is unconstitutional and serves no legitimate governmental function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In pursuing his argument, petitioner points to certain New Jersey cases extending the parental obligation to support through the child\u2019s college years, reasoning that had decedent lived he would have supported petitioner when he returned to college, thereby making him a dependent in fact. He urges that dependency should be determined on a case-by-case basis and not on the basis of \u201can arbitrary age limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Petitioner brings to our attention the fact that the workers\u2019 compensation statutes of other states recognize that dependency continues during years of higher education. However, the unfairness of terminating dependency before college must be cured by statute, and not by judicial construction. <em>See 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 63.23(d) at 11-139 to 11-140 (1986). Thus, in New Jersey dependency for workers\u2019 compensation purposes is determined not by actual dependency but by qualification under the strict terms of the statute. <em>Stellmah v. Hunterdon Coop. G.L.F. Serv., Inc., </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>163, 170 (1966). Despite the general policy favoring a liberal inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>pretation of the Act, a court has no discretion to enlarge the class of eligible dependents beyond the limits fixed by statute. <em>Miles v. Theobald Industries, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 537 (App.Div.1976), certif. den., 73 <em>N.J. </em>51 (1977). Any resulting unfairness must be cured by the Legislature, not the courts. <em>See Bush v. Johns-Manville Products Corporation, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 192 (App.Div.1977), certif. den., 75 <em>N.J. </em>605 (1978) (\u201c[W]e cannot, in the guise of a liberal interpretation, rewrite the compensation act. That is the sole province of the Legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Of course, the Legislature may not classify dependents capriciously. In order to withstand equal protection and due process objections, the scheme must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. <em>Carr v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 385 (App.Div.1973). As the classification here challenged is based on age, the strict scrutiny standard of equal protection does not apply, age not being a suspect criterion. <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>307, 312-313, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2562, 2566-2567, 49 L.Ed.2d 520, 524 (1976); <em>Taxpayers Assn. of Weymouth Tp. v. Weymouth Tp., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>6, 38-40 (1976), app. dism. and <em>cert. </em>den., 430 <em>U.S. </em>977, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1672, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>373 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It was petitioner\u2019s burden to demonstrate a lack of rational basis for the choice of age 18 as marking the end of dependency. The fact that the classification is in some respect imperfect or results in some inequities in practice does not warrant its invalidation. <em>Weymouth Tp., supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 40. Any statutory cutoff age is necessarily arbitrary, inevitably excluding \u201csome persons who might plausibly be admitted\u201d and including \u201cothers who might plausibly have been excluded.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But the chosen cutoff \u201cis a legislative judgment which ought not be disturbed by the judiciary unless it exceeds the bounds of reasonable choice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, in <em>Weymouth Tp., supra, </em>the court upheld a trailer park ordinance which required the heads of households or their spouses to be at least 52 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>old. The court found an adequate basis in the facts that the median age of first-time grandparents was 54 to 57, and that increasing numbers of Americans were retiring in their fifties, thereby experiencing a decline in net income. <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Our attention has not been directed to any case in which a court invalidated a workers\u2019 compensation statute terminating dependency at a fixed age. In two cases the court expressly upheld such a statute against an equal protection attack. In <em>Turner v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>125 <em>Ga.App. </em>371, 187 S.E.2d 905 (1972), the court validated a Georgia workers\u2019 compensation statute which ended a child\u2019s dependency at age 18, except for children mentally or physically disabled. That a child might remain dependent in fact beyond that age, observed the court, did not warrant departure from the strict terms of the act, since workers\u2019 compensation \u201cis a creature of statute\u201d and not of common law. 187 S.E.2d at 907. The court concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">It follows that, although it may seem inequitable to a child to cut off compensation when the age limit is reached although that child is still not as a matter of fact self sustaining, this is a question which addresses itself to the legislature and not to the courts. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><em>Accord Basham v. R.H. Lowe, Inc., </em>176 <em>Va. </em>485, <em>11 </em>S.E.2d 638, 641-642 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In <em>Leech v. Georgia-Pacific Corporation, </em>259 <em>Or. </em>161, 485 <em>P.</em>2d 1195 (1971), decedent\u2019s 28 year old daughter was mentally retarded and had been totally dependent on decedent. At the time of decedent\u2019s death, the Oregon Workers\u2019 Compensation Law terminated dependency at age 18 with no exception for claimant\u2019s incapacity. She attacked the law on equal protection grounds, arguing that \u201cthe line drawn by the legislature between dependent children under the age of 18 and those over 18\u201d had no rational basis. 485 <em>P.</em>2d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">The court proceeded from the premise that the Legislature was not constitutionally required to solve perfectly every aspect of the problem it addressed; it need only have avoided distinctions which were \u201cpalpably arbitrary.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>dependency benefits the Legislature made no attempt to compensate everyone who might suffer financial loss from a worker\u2019s death. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cInstead, primary provision was made for those who, as a class, are most likely to suffer financially from a workman\u2019s death\u2014his surviving spouse and young children.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In choosing to benefit the \u201cmost likely\u201d dependents, the court reasoned, the Legislature excluded others, such as adult children, who might be dependent in fact but who lacked the statutory qualifications. <em>Id. </em>at 1199. Whether such a choice was wise lay beyond judicial review; it was enough, concluded the court, that it had some rational basis. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In our view the apparent assumption by our Legislature that adult children under the age of 40 are more likely than minor children and those over the age of 40 to be self-supporting is at least a rational reason for rejecting an equal protection attack. We observe further that, unlike the statute before the court in <em>Leech, </em>New Jersey\u2019s statute contains an exception allowing dependency benefits for disabled adult children, thereby reducing some instances of hardship. While New Jersey has not followed the lead of some states in extending dependency through a later age to allow for college education, this is a reform which may be achieved only by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Petitioner alternatively argues that in the event his constitutional arguments are rejected his claim \u201cbe relisted for hearing in the Superior Court to pursue a common law remedy against the employer under the common law negligence theory.\u201d He reasons that if he is denied dependency status under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, he would be left without a remedy and thus should be allowed recourse to a judicial forum. We observe, of course, that if petitioner\u2019s claim were presented in the Law Division it would be met by a statute which provides that in return for the guaranty of benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation system a worker surrenders his right to sue his employer in negligence; this surrender is binding, in cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>death, on the worker\u2019s \u201cpersonal representatives, surviving spouse and next of kin____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">If an injury or death is compensable under this article, a person shall not be liable <em>to anyone </em>at common law or otherwise on account of such injury or death for any act or omission occurring while such person was in the same employ as the person injured or killed, except for intentional wrong. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8; emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Moreover, we have been shown no mechanism or authority for the transfer of this proceeding from a state administrative agency to a trial division of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
