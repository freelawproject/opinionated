The pivotal issue posed by this appeal is whether, in an action on a fire insurance policy, the defenses of arson and fraud and false swearing must be established by clear and convincing evidence or by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Plaintiff and its shareholders, Gary P. Fish (Fish) and Judy Fish, instituted this action to recover for a fire loss under a special multi-peril policy of insurance issued by defendant. The fire in question occurred at plaintiff\u2019s restaurant located at 411 Broadway, Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey. Defendant denied liability as to all plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asserted several defenses, including that (1) the fire was willfully, deliberately and intentionally set by plaintiff\u2019s principal managing agent Fish and (2) plaintiff was guilty of fraud and false swearing concerning the cause and origin of the fire. Pursuant to the terms of the standard mortgagee clause in the policy, defendant paid the mortgagee, Rudy Jaeger, the $141,188.21 still owing on the mortgage on plaintiff's restaurant. As subrogee of Jaeger\u2019s right title and interest in the real property, defendant filed a counterclaim against all plaintiffs and a third-party complaint against Fish seeking to recover this money.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>At the conclusion of a lengthy trial, the jury found, in answer to special interrogatories submitted by the trial court, that the fire was deliberately set by Fish and that he was in control of plaintiff corporation. Based upon these findings, the trial court molded the verdict, entering judgment in favor of defendant on plaintiffs complaint and awarding defendant damages in the sum of $141,138.21, together with accumulated interest of $44,-591.93 on the counterclaim and third-party complaint. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, a new trial was denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Plaintiff contends that the judgment should be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial because the trial court charged the jury incorrectly that defendant\u2019s burden of proving arson was by a preponderance of the evidence. Plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he defense of arson (insurance fraud) must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Maintaining that defendant is, in effect, charging it with committing a crime and an act of fraud, plaintiff claims that the higher standard of proof is required to overcome the presumption of innocence of criminal conduct and lack of fraudulent intent. Plaintiff also argues that, in denying coverage on the ground that the fire was intentionally set, defendant is asserting equitable fraud as a basis for rescinding the insurance contract, and, thus, the appropriate standard of proof is by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> An action for reformation or recision based upon equitable fraud is clearly distinguishable from the claims asserted by defendant herein. Proof of equitable fraud renders the insurance policy void from its inception because, at the time that it was issued, the insured made certain misrepresentations or had the intent to commit a fraudulent act to collect the proceeds under the policy. <em>See Johnson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>423, 440 (1969) (\u201ca party who wants to avoid performance of his contract because of fraud in the making of the contract must rescind it.\u201d). Defendant does not assert that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>upon procuring the policy plaintiff intended to commit arson. Rather, defendant is claiming that plaintiff, through its principal managing agent Fish, deliberately and willfully set the fire. This case is not one of equitable fraud. It involves the affirmative defenses of arson and fraud and false swearing which, if proven, establish a violation of the standard provisions of the fire insurance policy, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>17:36-5.20, and relieve defendant from any responsibility for plaintiff\u2019s fire loss. Where, as here, the plaintiff-insured has intentionally set fire to the property covered by the policy of insurance, sound principles of public policy preclude recovery. <em>See Ruvolo v. American Cas. Co., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>490, 496 (1963); <em>Lyons v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 244 (App.Div.1973), certif. den., 64 <em>N.J. </em>322 (1974); <em>Miller &amp; Dobrin Furniture Co., Inc. v. Camden Fire Ins. Co. Ass\u2019n, </em>55 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 213 (Law Div.1959). <em>Cf. Ambassador Ins. Co. v. Montes, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>477, 482-483 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Defendant\u2019s evidence that plaintiff set or caused the fire to be set need not be clear and convincing, exclude any reasonable doubt or be the only reasonable explanation for the cause of the fire. The affirmative defense of arson and that of fraud and false swearing may be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In this State, the preponderance of the evidence standard is the customary burden of proof in civil cases and is thus the appropriate standard by which affirmative defenses must be proven. <em>See, e.g., In re Bridgewater Tp., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>235, 244 (1984); <em>So. Burlington Cty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Tp., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>158, 222 (1983); <em>State v. Cale, </em>19 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 399 (App.Div.1952); <em>Miller, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213. There is no justification for raising the standard to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt or even proof by clear and convincing evidence in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Here, the only questions submitted to the jury were: (1) \u201cWas the fire deliberately set by Gary Fish on January 14, 1982?\u201d and, if so, (2) \u201cWas Gary Fish in control of the corporation?\u201d Affirmative responses to both questions would establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the defenses raised by defendant. The trial court specifically instructed the jury that defendant bore the burden of proof (persuasion) with respect to the affirmative defenses by a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court\u2019s instructions in this regard conformed to the standard applied by the overwhelming majority of American courts. <em>See, e.g., Dempsey v. Auto Owners Ins. Co., </em>717 <em>F.2d </em>556, 559 (11th Cir.1983) (under Alabama law, it \u201cis not necessary for the insurer to prove the defense of arson beyond all reasonable doubt; a preponderance of the evidence is sufficient.\u201d); <em>Vicksburg Furniture Mfg., Ltd. v.

Co., </em>625 <em>F.2d </em>1167, 1170 (5th Cir.1980) (trial court did not err in concluding, under Mississippi law, that \u201cthe burden of proof that must be satisfied to establish the defense of arson is ... a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d); <em>Miele v. Boston Ins. Co., </em>288 F.2d 178, 180 (8th Cir.1961) (\u201cIt is firmly settled law in Missouri that in a civil action on an insurance policy, the defense of arson by the insured need be established only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d); <em>Hanover Fire Ins.
