The condominium unit overlooks woods and a brook and has an addition in back added on by defendants. On appeal defendants contend that plaintiff was not entitled to specific performance in the absence of proof of the uniqueness of the condominium unit. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Under the Condominium Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-4, each condominium unit \u201cshall constitute a separate parcel of real property.\u201d \u201cCondominium\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-3 as \u201cthe form of ownership of real property under a master deed providing for ownership by one or more owners of units of improvements together with an undivided interest in common elements appurtenant to each such unit.\u201d Under long established equity principles, a contract for the sale of real property is specifically enforceable by the purchaser. Presumptively, real property is unique and damages at law are an inadequate remedy for breach of a contract to sell it. A factual resolution of uniqueness of the real property is immaterial. 11 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>(3 ed. Jaeger 1968) \u00a7 1418A; <em>Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5 ed. 1941) \u00a7 221(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Defendants\u2019 single argument is that summary judgment should have been denied because of a fact issue as to the uniqueness of the condominium unit under contract of sale, one of approximately 250 in the condominium complex. Defendant relies upon three reported decisions, all clearly distinguishable in our view. <em>Fleischer v. James Drug Stores, </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>138 (1948) involved a suit for specific performance of a business contract. In <em>Blake v. Flatley, </em>44 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>228 (E. &amp; A. 1888), specific performance was denied to the purchaser of real property under the unusual circumstance that the purchase price was so low that the seller \u201cwill lose the whole purchase-price of his land in costs.\u201d Plaintiff there was relegated to his remedy at law \u201cwhere the costs are much less than in ... equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In the more recent case of <em>Centex Homes Corp. v. Boag, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385 (Ch.Div.1974), the seller of a condominium unit was denied specific performance in view of the adequacy of readily measurable damages as a remedy and the absence of any showing of a \u201cunique quality\u201d of \u201cone of hundreds of virtually identical units being offered by [the seller] for sale to the public.\u201d The court referred to the trend towards disappearance of the doctrine of mutuality of remedy, which entitled the seller as well as the purchaser of real property to specific performance. <em>See also Kalman Floor Co., Inc. v. Jos. L. Muscarelle, Inc., </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 28 (App.Div.1984), aff\u2019d o.b. 98 <em>N.J. </em>266 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201cIt has sometimes been said that there is a requirement of mutuality of remedy. However, the law does not require that the parties have similar remedies in case of breach, ...\u201d <em>Restatement, Contracts </em>2d, \u00a7 363 comment (c) at 183 (1981). Professor Farnsworth, the reporter for the <em>Restatement </em>2nd, speaks of the \u201cnow discredited mutuality of remedy rule,\u201d <em>Farnsworth, Contracts </em>\u00a7 12.4 at 822 n. 18 (1982), and directs us to 5A <em>Corbin, Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1178-1204 (1964), for \u201can extensive criticism of the rule.\u201d <em>Williston </em>says: \u201cWhile this \u2018rule\u2019 had some significance some few decades ago, it has been quite generally repudiated, especially as the exceptions gradually swallowed it.\u201d 11 <em>Williston, Contracts </em>(3rd ed. Jaeger), \u00a7 1433 at 884.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">An out-of-state authority awarding specific performance in favor of the purchaser of a condominium unit irrespective of any special showing of uniqueness is <em>Giannini v. First Nat. Bank of Des Plaines, </em>136 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>971, 91 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>438, 483 N.E.2d 924 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">On the appeal before us, we note some indicia of uniqueness of the condominium unit under contract of sale, its view and the addition in its back. Our holding rests, notwithstanding such <em>prima facie </em>showing of uniqueness, upon a broader ground: that a contract of sale of a designated condominium unit like any real property is specifically enforceable by the purchaser irrespective of any special proof of its uniqueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
