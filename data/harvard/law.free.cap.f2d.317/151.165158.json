The plaintiff has appealed, contending that he presented sufficient evidence to take his case to the jury and that the District Court erroneously directed a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence, consisting of testimony by himself and a Pennslyvania State Police Officer, who witnessed the accident from a distance of some 800 feet, may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">On July 4, 1960, the plaintiff and the defendant were returning to Washington, D. C., in the plaintiff\u2019s automobile from Butler, Pennsylvania, where they had spent the holiday weekend with cousins of the defendant. They commenced the return trip at about 3 or 3:,15 p. m. on the 4th. The plaintiff, a man 28 years of age, drove for about an hour and, feeling sleepy, turned over the driving to defendant, a young woman in her twenties. Approximately five minutes after she had taken the wheel, he fell asleep. They were at that time on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a dual highway with four 12-foot lanes, separated in the middle by a 10-foot medial strip, and bordered on each side by a 10-foot shoulder or \u201cberm.\u201d The weather was fair, the road was dry, and visibility was good. The holiday traffic was quite heavy, according to the State Police Officer. The plaintiff considered the defendant, with whose driving he was familiar, a competent and good driver in whom he had every confidence. He had no apprehension about her driving on that day. Neither he nor she had drunk any intoxicating beverage on that day. Before the plaintiff went to sleep, the defendant had stated to him that she did not feel the \u201cleast bit sleepy\u201d, and he had observed nothing to indicate that she was sleepy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>At about 4:15 p. m. the ear left the Turnpike, raising a \u201ccloud of dust\u201d on the berm, there about 12 feet wide, and, as shown by its tracks in the dust, ran straight toward a 12-foot embankment, abutting the berm, at a \u201cgraduated slant\u201d of 45 degrees. There were no marks to indicate skidding. The ear hit the embankment, went into the air, made one complete turn in the air and then landed on the Turnpike upright on its wheels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff was thrown out through the closed sun roof of the car onto the Turnpike and was seriously injured. The defendant also suffered some injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">After he fell asleep, the next thing recalled by the plaintiff was that he woke up very suddenly and \u201cfelt a violent swerve in the car\u201d and \u201ca terrific sense of centrifugal force\u201d in his stomach. He testified on direct examination that he \u201creacted instinctively to the situation,\u201d \u201creached over for the wheel,\u201d made \u201ccontact with it,\u201d and just then felt himself \u201cbeing flung from the car\u201d and next he was \u201churtling through the air.\u201d He stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have control of the car in any way\u201d in the fraction of a second before being thrown out. On cross-examination the plaintiff indicated that he had upon awakening \u201cgrabbed\u201d or '\u201ctouched\u201d the steering wheel with both hands \u201cin a normal driving fashion,\u201d that he \u201cwas making an effort\u201d to steer and \u201cget the car back in control.\u201d He admitted that the car could then have been on the highway, and that \u201cI assume it was,\u201d but stated that he didn\u2019t actually know where it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Following the accident, the tires were described as in good condition and inflated, although the left front tire was leaking slightly and in the process of deflating, and the rim on which that tire was mounted was severely damaged, to the point where the tire would not hold air. Plaintiff stated on cross-examination that the tire in question might have been on the car for as much as 35,000 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">The defendant was not called as a witness. The plaintiff and the State Police Officer both testified that she had stated to them that she could not explain how the accident had occurred. She told the Officer that nothing had happened to the automobile, evidently meaning that the steering mechanism had not failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">At the close of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s case, the defense moved for a directed verdict. The motion was granted by the trial judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In cases like the present, as we pointed out in Boland v. Love, 95 U.S. App.D.C. 337, 341, 222 F.2d 27, 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>(1955), the law of the District of Columbia controls as to whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury, whereas the law of the place of injury \u2014 here, Pennsylvania \u2014 controls as to the standard of conduct required of the parties, including (to quote the Boland opinion) the question \u201cwhether the <em>particular conduct </em>involved here is or is not negligent.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See also Tobin v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 69 App.D.C. 262, 100 F.2d 435 (1938), cert. denied, 306 U.S. 640, 59 S.Ct. 488, 83 L.Ed. 1040 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Under the law of the District of Columbia, when a verdict is directed against the plaintiff at the close of his ease, we must view plaintiff\u2019s case in the light most favorable to him, and give him the full benefit of every legitimate inference warranted by his evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> So viewing the plaintiff\u2019s case, we must conclude that it was error to direct a verdict for the defendant in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Authority is overwhelming for the proposition that where an automobile leaves the highway and collides with a stationary object off the road, causing injury to a passenger, negligence on the part of the driver may be presumed or inferred (1) if the driver exclusively controlled the operation of the car, (2) if the accident would not ordinarily have happened unless the driver in control had failed to use due care, and (3) if the cause of the accident is not otherwise explained or shown. See Annotation: \u201cApplicability of res ipsa loquitur doctrine where motor vehicle leaves road,\u201d 79 A.L.R.2d 6 (1961), and particularly the cases referred to at 22-27, 29-44, 52-64, 73-114.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also Lane v. Dorney, 252 N.C. 90, 113 S.E.2d 33 (1960); Leebove v. Rovin, 363 Mich. 569, 111 N.W. 2d 104 (1961). This is the rule followed by the Pennsylvania courts, the locale of the accident. Knox v. Simmerman, 301 Pa. 1, 151 A. 678 (1930); Brewer v. Brodhead, 341 Pa. 384, 19 A.2d 117 (1941) ; Kotal v. Goldberg, 375 Pa. 397, 100 A.2d 630 (1953). See also Watford v. Simon, 163 F.Supp. 664 (E.D.Pa.1958). We think the same rule should apply in this jurisdiction, and that a case arising solely within the District of Columbia on facts like the present should be allowed to go to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that the plaintiff\u2019s car, driven by an experienced and competent driver with his consent, left a dry straight road when visibility and driving conditions were good, no defect or obstruction in the road and no defect in the car were shown to have existed, and no interference by or collision with another vehicle was indicated. The possibilities that a sudden skid or a blowout of a tire had occurred were eliminated by the evidence. All the tires were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>flated following the accident, but the rim of the left front tire was found damaged. Since the damage to the rim was such that the tire would not hold air, and since the left front tire was inflated (although leaking) immediately following the accident, it is a reasonable inference, and the one required for purposes of disposing of the motion for a \u2022directed verdict, that the rim became \u2022damaged in the accident and thus was riot the cause of, or one of the things which might have caused, the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In the absence of anything more, the accident being otherwise unexplained, it is obvious that the car would not ordinarily have left the road and collided with the embankment unless someone had been negligent, and the inference is certainly permissible that the accident resulted from the driver\u2019s negligence, assuming that the defendant driver had control over the driving. Since the plaintiff testified that he did not control the car in any way, and his other testimony on direct examination could be taken as tending to support this categorical conclusion, we are required, for purposes of the motion for a directed verdict, to treat this testimony favorably and assume that the defendant was in exclusive control. Clearly, then, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence made a case for the jury, and the jury, if it credited his statement that he was not in control, could find that the defendant driver controlled the driving, that she must have been and was negligent, and that this negligence caused the accident and the resulting injury to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> To be sure, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on cross-examination can be re-</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">garded as raising a question as to whether the defendant-driver did have exclusive control over the driving \u2014 that is, whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s actions in putting both hands on the wheel in driving position in an effort to gain control, wrested control away or so interfered with the driver\u2019s control over the driving as to deprive her of effective control or otherwise to be the proximate or intervening cause of the accident and resulting injury. This factual question could only be resolved by a jury after hearing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and that to be presented by the defendant, who may well be able to throw additional light on the question of control and the reason for the accident. But, as pointed out, on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence alone, and giving him the advantage of every inference his evidence supports, a jury could reasonably have found, under proper instructions, that the defendant controlled the operation of the car, that she was or must have been negligent, and that her negligence caused his injuries. It was thus error to take the case from the jury and direct a verdict. See Tobin v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, 69 App. D.C. at 265, 100 F.2d at 438.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">We have found no case in Pennsylvania or in this jurisdiction involving the situation where the steering wheel was seized or grabbed for by a passenger immediately prior to an accident. But cases from other jurisdictions presented with such a situation have treated the matter as something to be decided by the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Since we think that it could reasonably have been found from the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, construed most favorably to him, that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>his injuries, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. On the basis of the times of departure and the duration of his driving as given by plaintiff in his testimony, and the time the accident occurred, the defendant could have been driving for not more than fifteen minutes when the accident happened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. The judge said, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u201cThere is no evidence whatever of any negligence on the part of the defendant. She was driving the car. There is no evidence that she failed to do anything that she should have done, or that she did something that she should not have done. There is no evidence that she was driving at an excessive rate of speed, or in any way recklessly. To be sure, negligence can be proven by circumstantial evidence as well as by direct evidence, but there is no circumstantial evidence in this instance from which negligence could be inferred. There are three possibilities, on the basis of the evidence, as to what caused the accident. It may have been some inattention on tbe part of the defendant in permitting the ear to leave its path. It may have been the sudden action of the plaintiff in grabbing the wheel that caused the accident, or it may have been a defect in the rim or tire, because the officer, when he inspected the car after the accident, found that the left front tire was gradually deflating and that the rim on which it was mounted had been damaged. Now that damage c.ould have occurred in the accident. It could have existed previously. Consequently the jury would have to speculate as to which of the three causes was responsible for the accident. It is well settled in this jurisdiction, at least, that when the evidence is capable of proving either one of two or more possibilities, it does not prove any one. There is not even any basis upon which the jury could draw a probability, or infer a probability, that one or the other cause was responsible for the accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">.

See cases at 79 A.L.R.2d 68-70, 103-114. In Faulk v. Soberanes, 56 Cal.2d 466, 14 Cal.Rptr. 545, 363 P.2d 593 (1961), it was held that the driver\u2019s negligence was not to be inferred as a matter of law but that the inference of negligence might properly have been made by the jury under proper instructions, had it resolved the factual issues in a way to support the inference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">. This view appears to be quite consonant with our statement in Haw v. Liberty Mut. Ins.

MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A3G\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In my view, the trial judge correctly directed a verdict for the defendant for the reasons stated by him. The plaintiff failed to prove any negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant and the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not help him. My colleagues state in their opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">\u201c * * * On cross-examination the plaintiff indicated that he had upon awakening \u2018grabbed\u2019 or \u2018touched\u2019 the steering wheel with both hands \u2018in a normal driving fashion,\u2019 that he \u2018was making an effort\u2019 to steer and \u2018get the car back in control.\u2019 He admitted that the car could then have been on the highway, and that \u2018I assume it was,\u2019 but stated that he didn\u2019t actually know where it was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">A sleeping passenger in a car traveling at turnpike speed who awoke and grabbed the steering wheel cannot consistently say the accident which followed immediately would not have happened if the driver had not been negligent. Nor can he say the automobile was under the exclusive control of the driver. Hence, <em>res ipsa </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">It follows that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove any negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant and his own admissions on cross-examination made it clear that a verdict should have been, as it was, directed for the defendant. The majority say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">\u201cAuthority is overwhelming for the proposition that where an automobile leaves, the highway and collides with a stationary object off the road, causing injury to a passenger, negligence on the part of the driver may be presumed or inferred (1) if the driver exclusively controlled the operation of the car, (2) if the accident would not ordinarily have happened unless the driver in control had failed to use due care, and (3) if the cause of the accident is not otherwise explained or shown. See Annotation: \u2018Applicability of res ipsa loquitur doctrine where motor vehicle leaves road,\u2019 79 A.L.R. 2d 6 (1961) * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">The A.L.R. annotation cited in support, of this statement shows that the authority therefor is not overwhelming; indeed the annotation points out that there are different lines of authority. But even under the Pennsylvania rule as stated by the majority, there could be no inference here that appellee was negligent because (a) the driver did not have exclusive control of the operation of the car, and (b) the cause of the accident is \u201cotherwise explained or shown,\u201d. \u2014 that is, by appellant\u2019s admitted interference with appellee\u2019s driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">After describing what they say is the Pennsylvania rule of <em>res ipsa, </em>the majority add, \u201cWe think the same rule should' apply in this jurisdiction\u201d and so infer that the District of Columbia rule should be changed. In Washington Loan &amp;. Trust Co. v. Hickey,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Edgerton succinctly defined <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">\u201c * * * The principle in question is simply that when the cause of an accident is (1) known, (2) in the defendant\u2019s control, and (3) unlikely to do harm unless the person in control is negligent, the defendant\u2019s negligence may be inferred without additional evidence. * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">I think this definition is satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">In Brown v. Capital Transit Co.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-21\">\u201cWhere the res ipsa loquitur doctrine is applicable, it means no more than that the party claiming damages has produced proof of a fact, or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>series of related facts, which warrant the inference of negligence, not that they compel such an inference. The rule is so stated by the Supreme Court in Sweeney v. Erving, 228 U.S. 233, 33 S.Ct. 416, 57 L.Ed. 815. Where, as here, it is a matter of surmise that the damage was due to a cause for which the defendant is liable, the doctrine is inapplicable. If causes other than the negligence of the defendant might have produced the accident, the plaintiff is bound to exclude the operation of such causes by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Here the sum and substance of appellant\u2019s evidence is that an injury occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In this case also, the sum and substance of appellant\u2019s evidence is that an accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The majority admit that \u201cthe law of the District of Columbia controls as to whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury,\u201d as we said in the much cited case of Tobin v. Pennsylvania R. Co.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201cThe law applicable to the case, so far as it concerns the standard of conduct required of the parties, is the law of the place of injury, hence, the law of Pennsylvania; <em>but the application of the standard must be made according to the law of the forum </em>for that is a procedural matter. Consequently, the question whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury must be determined according to the law of the <em>District of Columbia.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">To be sure, the standard of conduct is that required by the law of the place of injury; but our rule has been heretofore that application of the standard, that is, whether the evidence shows the defendant violated it and so was negligent, is governed by the rule of the forum. So, a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in an action based on negligence must be granted if, on the evidence, no reasonable men could reach a verdict for the plaintiff. In this respect, we said in theTobin case:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201c * * * [A] mere scintilla of evidence is not sufficient; the question is not whether there is any evidence, but whether there is any upon which a jury can properly proceed to find a verdict for the party upon whom the <em>onus </em>of proof is imposed; the burden being upon the plaintiff to establish the negligence and injury alleged, if the evidence fails adequately to support either element, the motion [for a directed verdict] should be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">As proof was admittedly absent, the jury could only have speculated that defendant was negligent and so was liable. My understanding has always been that such speculation is not permitted.
