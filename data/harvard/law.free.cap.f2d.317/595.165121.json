(1958). The issues presented are similar in some respects to those raised in Thor-Westcliffe Development, Inc. v. Udall, 114 U.S. App.D.C. -, 314 F.2d 257 (1963), though the present case involves regulations ' antedating those there discussed. Plaintiff-appellant, contending that he was the first qualified applicant for a lease on certain premises, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to review the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, which was unfavorable to him. The facts and the applicable statutes and regulations are set forth in the opinion of District Judge Tamm, filed August 14, 1962. See D.C., 216 F.Supp. 314. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">The judgment of the District Court, granting the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment, will be</p>\n<p id=\"b667-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
