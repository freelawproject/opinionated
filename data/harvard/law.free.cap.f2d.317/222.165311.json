We think that in normal usage \u201caccident\u201d benefits include payment for damage to property quite as naturally as payment for injury to the person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, the statutory phrase \u201caccident or other benefits\u201d is sufficiently broad to include payments for injuries to property as well as to the person; it carriers no hint of a distinction between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">The meager legislative history of Section 501(c) (8) and its precursors indicates that the purpose of Congress was to grant a preferred status to non-profit, primarily fraternal organizations (operating under a lodge system), which incidentally extend insurance benefits to members. The payment of benefits was of course required, but the moving consideration was the character and purpose of the organization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Nowhere have we found any indication that Congress intended the exemption to depend upon the type of benefits paid. The legislative history reflects no purpose which might be served by having the exemption turn upon this consideration, and the government suggests none.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The government argues that (1) the subject matter of Section 501(c) (8) is insurance, (2) the phrase \u201clife, sick, accident, or other benefits\u201d should therefore be read as a list of types of insurance, and (3) \u201caccident insurance,\u201d as a technical term of the trade, includes coverage for losses due to personal injury but excludes coverage for property losses. Taken literally, the argument is strained: \u201csick insurance\u201d is not an accepted designation of a type of insurance. Taken as a general argument that in the insurance field the word \u201caccident\u201d has a meaning limited to impact upon persons, the contention is refuted by appellant\u2019s demonstration to the contrary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The government also argues that a congressional intent to exclude fraternal organizations paying benefits for property losses should be implied because, historically, fraternal organizations did not furnish such benefits. Appellant attacks the accuracy of the premise, citing the Grange itself which was organized in 1916, and which has paid benefits for property loss from fire from its inception. In any event, the burden of demonstration rested with the government, and the government has offered nothing to support its assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\">. 37 T.C. 582 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-13\">. The following partial description of the organization and operation of appellant association (petitioner in the Tax Court) appears in the findings of the Tax Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">\u201cPetitioner was organized on April 28, 1916, under the name \u2018The Grange Fraternal Fire Insurance Association of California\u2019 for the purpose of enabling members of the California State Grange to bind themselves to contribute to each other\u2019s loss by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">\u201cPetitioner is only authorized to act in California and only between Grange members. As soon as a Grange member becomes delinquent in dues, he immediately loses his policy and is dropped from membership in petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-26\">\u201cAny member of the Grange upon becoming insured by petitioner becomes a member of petitioner and only policyholders are members.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-27\">\u201cOnly members of petitioner have the right to elect its officers. All officers of petitioner must be Grange members in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-28\">\u201cPetitioner has no capital stock and is a nonprofit corporation. It operates on the assessment system in that if its payments should exceed its premiums and reserve, it is permitted to assess its Grange members to make up the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"ALn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cPetitioner adjusts the premiums paid by the members according to its losses and if the losses for the previous year are high, then the rates rise accordingly, and if the losses are low, the rates are adjusted downward. The Grange fire insurance is sold to members at actual costs on a nonprofit basis. * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u201cThere are over 300 lodges of local \u2022Granges in the State of California and the majority of these have a member of the local Grange who acts as an insurance agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u201cLocal members of the Grange act as insurance agents as a service to their Grange members. The agents are paid only a small commission which is considered to cover their actual expenses in estimating and investigating the property of their fellow Grange member to be insured. None of the insurance agents receives any salary and all agents must bo members in good standing of the Grange. *****</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u201cPetitioner has never employed the practice of mutual insurance companies of returning part of premiums paid; in fact, petitioner has never paid a cash dividend.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-11\">.
