No. 534,529, filed September 15, 1955, for \u201cCadmium-Bismuth Glasses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-23\">Appellant\u2019s specification shows that his glasses are composed of <em>three </em>primary constituents: a cadmium compound (e. g., cadmium oxide, CdO); a bismuth compound (e. g., bismuth oxide, B\u00cd2O3); and a network former (e. g., silica, S\u00cdO2). A modifier (e. g., tungsten oxide, WO3) may also be used if desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-24\">The significance of the cadmium compound, appellant\u2019s application says, is to provide \u201ccadmium ions\u201d which were known at the time of his invention to aid in the formation of a moisture-resistant, neutron-absorbing glass having a high refractive index and good light transmission qualities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-25\">The bismuth compound is primarily significant in appellant\u2019s glass to provide \u201cbismuth ions,\u201d which appellant says were known at the time of his invention to aid in the formation of a glass having a high dielectric constant, a low dissipation factor, good stability, and easy workability. The bismuth compound is important for the further reason, appellant\u2019s application states, that \u201cbismuth has the largest scattering cross-section for neutrons of any element and has a high gamma ray absorption coefficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvD\">Appellant\u2019s specification also states that at the time of his invention the art recognized certain glass-forming compounds as \u201cnetwork formers\u201d the melting of which in a glass batch</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa4\">\u201c * * * results in the formation of a skeleton or basic structure, which is a distorted or irregular network of cations such as silicon or boron ions bonded to one another by oxygen ions. Each silicon or boron ion is surrounded by four oxygen ions and since these ions form the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>network of the glass they are termed \u2018network formers\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">As to appellant\u2019s last constituent, the optional modifier, appellant\u2019s specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201cModifying glasses * * * is well-known to those skilled in this art. Thus tantalum ions are added to glasses to raise their softening point, while the addition of thorium, lanthanum or tungsten ions increase[s] the dielectric constant. The addition of calcium oxides improves the workability of a glass and decreases its tendency to devitrify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFAZ\">The percent by weight of one such modifier which appellant specifically discloses adding to his glass (tungsten oxide, WO3) is stated as ranging \u201cfrom a trace to 20%.\u201d Otherwise the modified batches of the two examples given consist of B\u00cd2O3, CdO, and SiO'2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">We find ourselves somewhat at a loss, in view of the foregoing statements in appellant\u2019s specification, to determine therefrom just what aspect of his glass batch compositions he considers to be patentably significant. The \u201cobjects\u201d stated in appellant\u2019s specification are not informative in this regard as they recite that it is desired that appellant\u2019s glasses possess such properties as a high refractive index, high dielectric constant, and others which the art would apparently expect them to possess from the use therein of cadmium and bismuth compounds, according to the recital in the specification of what the art already knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">The claims on appeal are the only indication we can find in the application of what the appellant regards as his invention. Claim 1 is the broadest and claim 11 the most specific claim. They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-r\">\u201c1. An optical glass resulting from fusion of a batch of glass forming compounds, said batch consisting essentially of a compound to provide cadmium ions, a compound to provide bismuth ions, and a compound to provide network former ions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-10\">\u201c11. An optical glass resulting from fusion of a batch of glass forming compounds having the following range of compositions by weight percent consisting essentially of:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">\u201cCadmium oxide (CdO) trace to 75%</p>\n<p id=\"ApX\">\u201cBismuth oxide (B\u00cd2O3) 20 to 95%</p>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">\u201cSilica (Si02) 0.5 to 20%</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">The issue as to the patentability of all the appealed claims has narrowed, on appeal to this court, to a single question: What is the significance of the words \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d which appear in the claims? Both appellant and the Patent Office appear to agree that the meaning in the patent law of these words was appropriately defined in the case of Ex parte Davis et al., 80 U.S.P.Q. 448 (Bd.), wherein reference was made to a \u201ccode\u201d of terms drawn up by a group of examiners, one item of which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyK\">\u201c(3) recital of \u2018essentially\u2019 along with \u2018consisting of\u2019 [is regarded] as rendering the claim open <em>only </em>for the inclusion of unspecified ingredients <em>which do not materially affect </em>the basic and novel characteristics of the composition.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">Speaking of the facts before it in the Davis et al. case, the board commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-17\">\u201cIn the present case where the claims recite three ingredients and the reference discloses four, the important question is whether the term \u2018consisting essentially of\u2019 excludes that fourth ingredient. We think that it does, since the \u2018modifier\u2019 <em>materially changes </em>the fundamental character of the three-ingredient composition * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>The sole reference relied on here by the Patent Office is</p>\n<p id=\"AUs\">Armistead 2,517,459 Aug. 1, 1950</p>\n<p id=\"A_F\">The instant case presents facts very similar to those in the Davis et al. case. A specific optical glass disclosed by Armistead includes silicon, cadmium, and bismuth oxides. But it also includes boric oxide (B2O3), berrylium oxide (BeO), and a mixture of calcium oxide \u25a0(CaO) and strontium oxide (SrO). The \u25a0examiner\u2019s rejection of the claims on appeal as restated by the board and its reasons for affirming it are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11 stand xejected as unpatentable over Armistead.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-6\">\u201cWe find no error in this rejection. The reference shows an optical glass in which silica and bismuth and cadmium oxides are present within the claimed proportions. The appellant states that other ingredients are present in the Armistead \u25a0composition so that the glass of Armistead is an entirely different glass than appellant\u2019s. <em>In what respects \u25a0its characteristics are different the \u25a0appellant has not set forth. </em>The appellant has cited Ex parte Davis et \u25a0ah, 80 U.S.P.Q. 448 but we do not see that the other ingredients of the Armistead glass <em>materially </em>effect the <em>basic </em>characteristics of appellant\u2019s glass. Since there is no showing of properties of the claimed optical glasses as patentably different from those of Armistead, this rejection of -claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11 will be sustained.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Upon careful consideration of the whole record and the arguments of the parties, it does not appear to us that there are any <em>basic </em>or <em>novel </em>characteristics in appellant\u2019s claimed glass compositions by which they can be distinguished from Armistead\u2019s or which will serve, under the principle enunciated in Davis et al., to show that ingredients included by Armistead in his glass compositions in addition to those enumerated in appellant\u2019s claims, should be <em>excluded </em>by the phrase \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d common to appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">Certainly no characteristics whatever are set forth in the claims, unless it be in the word \u201coptical,\u201d which modifies \u201cglass.\u201d Questioned as to the meaning or significance of this limitation at the argument, appellant\u2019s counsel said this was to signify that the composition is \u201cvitrified.\u201d It being the essential nature of glass, by definition, to be vitrified,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we interpret this in the light of the statement in the specification that some \u201cnetwork formers\u201d that were tried \u201cdid not form completely vitreous glasses, but did form partially devitrified glasses, i. e. glasses having crystals mixed therein.\u201d We suppose \u201coptical\u201d excludes glasses containing crystals, nothing more. We cannot regard this sole limitation, therefore, as significant in stating any basic or novel characteristic of appellant\u2019s glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Armistead discloses \u201coptical glasses\u201d and he teaches that they may contain up to 60% cadmium oxide (CdO), to obtain beneficial effect upon the refractive index, and up to 20% bismuth oxide (B\u00cd2O3) for the same purpose. These glasses contain silica, a source of \u201cnetwork former ions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">Appellant gives 21 examples of glasses containing ingredients named and within the ranges stated in his claim 11, demonstrating that their refractive indices, dielectric constants, and dissipation factors all vary over wide ranges. He does not prefer one over the other and he claims them all. In review he makes the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-13\">\u201cAlthough a large number of glasses may be made from compounds containing cadmium ions, bismuth ions, and a network former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>in varying quantities, and the properties of such glasses will vary over a wide range, it is unlikely that among the many glasses which can be formed there will be a single glass which has all the properties desired for a particular application. Accordingly, a particular composition which has most of the properties desired is selected and it is then modified by adding modifiers to change its properties to conform as closely as possible to what is desired. Modifying glasses in this manner is well-known to those skilled in this art. Thus tantalum ions are added to glasses to raise their softening point, while the addition of thorium, lanthanum or tungsten ions increase [s] the dielectric constant. The addition of calcium oxides improves the workability of a glass and decreases its tendency to devitrify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">He then gives two examples of the use of up to 20% of tungsten oxide as a modifier and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-5\">\u201cThus I have provided a group of glasses having new compositions made from compounds containing both cadmium ions and bismuth ions, the remainder of the glass composition being a compound to supply network former ions and some modifier ions if necessary. I have shown that these glasses have high dielectric constants, and desirable optical properties as well as chemical durability. In addition, because they contain both cadmium and bismuth ions they are useful as neutron shields. In particular, the cadmium-bismuth boron glasses herein disclosed are useful for high energy neutron shielding. I have also indicated how these glasses may be modified to improve particular characteristics by the addition of modifying compounds to the batch from which the glass is fused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">With this disclosure underlying his claims, it is our opinion that appellant is in no position to urge that they are so restricted by the phrase \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d that they define subject matter patentable over Armistead merely because the glasses of the reference contain some modifying ingredients-in addition to silica, cadmium oxide and bismuth oxide. So may appellant\u2019s glasses. The word \u201cessentially\u201d opens, the claims to the inclusion of ingredients, which would <em>not </em>materially affect the <em>basic </em>and <em>novel </em>characteristics of appellant\u2019s compositions as defined in the balance of the claim, according to the applicable law. But no basic or novel characteristic to be so affected can be deduced from the disclosure and none was shown in brief or argument. We therefore find that the board was correct in holding that there is no showing of properties patentably distinguishing appellant\u2019s claimed glasses from those of the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">.
