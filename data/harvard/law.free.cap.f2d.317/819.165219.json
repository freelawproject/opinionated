Plaintiff\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Plaintiff contends here, as she did in the District Court, that the transcript inaccurately presented the testimony at her hearing before the referee-hearing officer, whose decision became \u201cfinal\u201d when the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, denied plaintiff\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The transcript of the record has been certified by the Chairman of the Appeals Council to be a full and accurate transcription of the entire record relating to plaintiff\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The axiomatic presumption of regularity of official acts would support the District Judge\u2019s evident conclusion that the transcript herein was properly prepared. U. S. v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926). We have, nevertheless, carefully considered the oral and briefed arguments of plaintiff who appeared before us pro se, with reference to this as well as to other points urged by her. Some of her charges of inaccuracy in the transcript appear to be the result of misunderstanding. For example, plaintiff states in her brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-11\">\u201cI worked about twenty years as a beauty operator. Not eight years like it is written in the referee\u2019s decision. I can prove that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">The application to establish disability, photostat of which is before us, asks under item 12(a) thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-13\">\u201cStarting 3 years before the date shown in question 6, [May, 1948] give the following information about any work you have done up to the present time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU2\">to which plaintiff answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Name and Address Dates o\u00a3 Hours and Give the Title of of Employer Employment Earnings Your Job and Describe the Duties You Performed 1 Ben Smith Work Began Average Hours Beauty Operator\u2014 3245 Broadway Month Year Worked a Week 1940 36 Shampoo, Dyeing, Chicago, III.

Plaintiff had the burden of proving that she met the requirements for eligibility under \u00a7 416 (i): that she had a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which could be expected to result in death or be of long continued and indefinite duration, that she has an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity, which exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ed by reason of the impairment, on March 51, 1953, the last day she met the earnings requirements for coverage, and which continued through May 9, 1957, when she filed her application. Pollak v. Ribicoff, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 674, 677. The District Judge was not at liberty to make his own appraisal of the evidence; nor is this Court. We may review the record only to determine whether it contained substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision. Rosewall v. Folsom, 7 Cir., 1957, 239 F.2d 724, 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Even if we credited plaintiff\u2019s versions of the testimony and documentary evidence, we would still have to conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s findings and the inferences which he drew therefrom. The decision of the District Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
