The petition is made and jurisdiction established under \u00a7 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e).

National Garment Co., 8 Cir., 166 F.2d 233, 238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">As we have stated in Bachman Machine Co. v. N. L. R. B., 8 Cir., 266 F.2d 599, 605:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cWhere the views of the Board as applied are in conformity with the dual congressional objectives of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employers in primary labor disputes and of shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own, the views of the Board should, no doubt, be accepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Layne-Western, a Delaware corporation whose principal place of business is in Kansas City, Missouri, deals in well pump equipment and allied products, and it also does drilling and boring for various purposes. It maintains an office in Omaha, Nebraska, which is where Local 571 is located and where the present dispute arose. Layne-Western has employed members of Local 571, but that organization has never been certified to represent Layne-Western\u2019s employees, nor has it ever secured a written collective agreement from Layne-Western.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In October of 1960 Layne-Western was engaged as a subcontractor to perform drilling jobs on projects of Rocco-Ferrera and Paulson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rocco-Ferrera\u2019s project was the construction of a sewer for the City of Omaha, and Paulson\u2019s was the construction of a store-warehouse in Omaha. When Layne-Western undertook to perform the jobs, agents of the respondent Local 571 appeared and made certain statements to agents of LayneWestern, Paulson, and Rocco-Ferrera concerning Layne-Western and its employees. The Board\u2019s order is based upon those statements and the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">On October 21, Local 571 agents came into Paulson\u2019s store-warehouse jobsite and attempted or threatened to shut down Layne-Western\u2019s operations. A number of Layne-Western\u2019s employees testified that the reason given for wanting the drilling shut down was that Layne-Western was paying below union scale wages, and employing nonunion men. Dyas, Layne-Western\u2019s field superintendent, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">\u201cHe [respondent\u2019s business manager Goebel] said he was going to fine * * * [two of the employees] $500 a piece and pick up their union cards. At that time I suggested that would be a wonderful idea if he would do that, that we would probably be better off if none of the men were in the union, and that we had had nothing but trouble from him, and he said if we would sign a union contract we wouldn\u2019t have any trouble. He also said that we were not paying union scale on the job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Also on October 21, Paulson\u2019s general superintendent Mike Paulson talked with Local 571 agents. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">\u201cMr. Metzler [Local 571 business agent] said, \u2018Mike, if you don\u2019t have Layne-Western shut down I\u2019m going to have to shut you down.\u2019 And I said, \u2018We\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t have them shut down,\u2019 because I sure didn\u2019t want to get shut down, so I went to talk to Harvey the foreman for Layne-Western and asked him if he could shut down without damaging anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">After it was learned that an immediate shut-down of Layne-Western would risk damage to other phases of the project, Mike Paulson talked with Mr. Goebel (of Local 571):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-15\">\u201cI asked Mr. Goebel what I could do to alleviate the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-16\">\u201cQ. What did he say? A. And he said he wasn\u2019t going to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>me, but he said in the future not to hire Layne-Western or there would be trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">On October 24, before Layne-Western had even begun drilling for Rocco-Ferrera, Goebel appeared at that jobsite and spoke with Roeco-Ferrera\u2019s project manager Smith. According to Smith\u2019s testimony, Goebel pointed out that LayneWestern was a nonunion organization, that it had no union contract, and that it paid below union scale wages. Goebel said he didn\u2019t want Layne-Western on the sewer project and that Local 571 would strike the project if Layne-Western\u2019s men were brought in. Smith later informed Layne-Western\u2019s superintendent Dyas that he wished to cancel the contract with Layne-Western \u201cin view of the fact that the union was threatening a strike if we used his men and equipment.\u201d Consequently, Layne-Western never did work on the sewer project.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On October 26, Local 571 sent copies of a letter to contractors in the Omaha area, informing them of its dispute with Layne-Western. The body of the letter is quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We conclude that the evidence outlined above affords substantial support for the Board\u2019s findings (a) that Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera were neutral secondary employers, (b) that respondent Local 571 threatened, restrained, or coerced them, and (c) that the object of respondent\u2019s conduct was to force them to cease doing business with Layne-Western and to force Layne-Western to bargain with or recognize Local 571. Testimony given by union officials would support contrary findings, but we cannot say that the record as a whole fails to support the Board\u2019s position. Compare National Labor Relations Board v. Bendix Corp., 6 Cir., 299 F.2d 308, 310; National Labor Relations Board v. Jackson Tile Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 282 F.2d 90, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">Local 571 challenges the Board\u2019s additional finding that Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera, the secondary employers, were \u201cengaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce\u201d as required by the statute. The Trial Examiner initially recommended dismissal of the complaint upon this basis, but the Board disagreed. The Board followed its decision in Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, 131 N.L.R.B. 1196, 1198-1200, which reasons that the building and construction industry is \u201can industry affecting commerce\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">Similar reasoning has been followed in National Labor Relations Board v. Plumbers Union, 2 Cir., 299 F.2d 497, 500 (enforcing the order of 131 N.L.R.B. 1243), and in Herbert Burman, Inc. v. Local 3, IBEW, S.D.N.Y., 214 F.Supp. 353, 356-357. By analogical reference to the broad definition of \u201cindustry affecting commerce\u201d in 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 142 (1), these cases would support the Board\u2019s position here upon the grounds that <em>Layne-Western </em>is engaged in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>merce (a fact conceded by all parties).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, we need not go quite so far, for the record in our case shows that Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera were themselves engaged in the building and construction industry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We hold this to be sufficient under \u00a7 8(b) (4). We agree with the Board\u2019s reasoning on Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Local 571 urges that the Board should have applied the Ally Doctrine; it argues that Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera were \u201callied\u201d with Layne-Western and were therefore not \u201cneutral\u201d secondary employers. The purported alliance is based upon two facts: (1) both Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera offered to supply union men to operate Layne-Western\u2019s drilling equipment, and (2) both had agreements with Local 571 which contained subcontractor clauses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no substance in either basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The offers by Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera to supply men were efforts to avoid interruptions in the construction projects, not attempts to \u201cintervene\u201d in the dispute as allies of Layne-Western. The offers were made to Local 571 agents, not to Layne-Western. Similarly, we see nothing in the subcontractor clause which would transform otherwise neutral secondary employers into partisan allies. Contrary to respondent\u2019s argument, the clause does not establish any special \u201cprivity of contract\u201d between LayneWestern and the secondary employers, much less eliminate Layne-Western\u2019s separate status as an independent contractor. Compare National Labor Relations Board v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 689-690, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284; Bachman Machine Co. v. N. L. R. B., 8 Cir., 266 F.2d 599, 603-605; Kennedy v. Construction Laborers\u2019 Union, D.Ariz., 199 F.Supp. 775, 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">Finally, respondent contends that the Board\u2019s order is too broad in two respects: (1) it fails to acknowledge the union\u2019s right to engage in lawful primary activities, and (2) it prohibits the secondary activities directed against Paulson, Rocco-Ferrera, or \u201cany other person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce except LayneWestern.\u201d We can dismiss the first objection without extensive discussion. Local 571 asks only that the order be amended with a general proviso which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>would not alter the effect of the order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We settled this very question in National Labor Relations Board v. International Hod Carriers Union, 8 Cir., 285 F.2d 397, 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\">We also reject Local 571\u2019s second basis. We think, in this case, that the Board was justified in extending its order to include secondary employers other than Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera. The Board has \u201cample discretion\u201d in formulating its orders. National Labor Relations Board v. Cheney Calif. Lumber Co., 327 U.S. 385, 888, 613 S.Ct. 553, 90 L.Ed. 739; National Labor Relations Board v. Local 111, United Bhd. of Carpenters, 1 Cir., 278 F.2d 823, 825; National Labor Relations Board v. U. M. W., 3 Cir., 202 F.2d 177, 179. Once violations have been found in specific instances, the Board is justified in broadening its order to include similar unlawful practices if there is evidence in the record of some general scheme or design or proclivity for such unlawful practices. Communications Workers v. N. L. R. B., 362 U.S. 479, 481, 80 S.Ct. 838, 4 L.Ed.2d 896; International Brotherhood of Elec. Workers v. N. L. R. B., 341 U.S. 694, 705-706, 71 S.Ct. 954, 95 L.Ed. 1299; National Labor Relations Board v. Express Pub. Co., 312 U.S. 426, 436-437, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930; National Labor Relations Board v. U. M. W., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">We think the order is justified in view of the specific violations found by the Board and the letters (quoted in footnote 3, supra) Local 571 distributed to contractors in the Omaha area. These two facts were connected together by Paulson's testimony: after telling Paul-son \u201cthere would be trouble\u201d if he ever hired Layne-Western in the future, respondent\u2019s agent Goebel expressed his intention to send letters to other contractors asking them not to hire LayneWestern. While the letters themselves do not constitute unfair labor practices, they do show that respondent\u2019s dispute with Layne-Western potentially involves an indeterminate number of secondary employers. The union\u2019s \u201cproclivity\u201d for unlawfulness is evidenced by the violations against Paulson and Rocco-Ferrera, not by the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-12\"><em>. </em>The statute declares that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents \u201c(ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where * * * an object thereof is\u2014 * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AMI\">\u201c(B) forcing or requiring any person * * * to cease doing business with any other person, or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless such labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-17\">.

The eases note that the pre-1959 law covered secondary activities where the <em>primary </em>employer was engaged in commerce, whether or not the secondary employer was so engaged. See National Labor Relations Board v. Local 74, United Bhd. of Carpenters, 6 Cir., 181 F.2d 126, 130, aff\u2019d, 341 U.S. 707, 712, 71 S.Ct. 966, 95 L.Ed. 1309. The 1959 amendment, they observe, was intended to <em>strengthen </em>the prohibition of secondary activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">. Both secondary employers were engaged in the building and construction industry directly rather than tangentially or incidentally. The fact that such industry affects commerce can be judicially noticed \u2014 which is not to say the record is entirely barren of supporting evidence in that respect. For example: The Paulson Construction Company is located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Layne-Western brought equipment into Omaha from Kansas City for use on the Rocco-Ferrera project. The form letter quoted in footnote 3, supra, and the subcontractor clause quoted in footnote 6, infra, give some slight indication of how far throughout the industry Local 571 may have wanted to carry its disputes with recalcitrant employers like Layne-Western. See generally Shore v. Building &amp; Constr.
