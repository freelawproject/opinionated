By various orders the Board granted leave to intervene to thirty other companies, organizations, and the City of Dallas and the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, but by a three to two vote it denied petitioners leave to intervene as parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-19\">Before June 11, 1961, Houston received no single-plane transcontinental air service. Dallas was served on three-transcontinental routes providing single-plane service. In response to a Houston petition dated May 4, 1956, the Board instituted the Southern Transcontinental-Service case, Docket 7984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By a subsequent order <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board consolidated certain applications in the Dallas to the West Service case, Docket 7596, with Docket 7984, and expanded the scope of Docket 7984. The Board\u2019s final decision <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the Southern Transcontinental Service case completely revamped the southern transcontinental route pattern through Houston and Dallas. The interchanges through Dallas were terminated, and National Airlines was certificated on a Florida-California route via Houston. The Board\u2019s opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-20\">\u201c * * * It is difficult to examine the record in this proceeding without realizing the relatively limited air traffic volume between Miami and the West Coast. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-21\">\u201cIn these circumstances, and in view of the substantial amount of competitive service being author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ized over portions of the Florida-California transcontinental route, we agree with the Examiner that only one carrier should be authorized to provide direct single-carrier service between Florida and California.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The final order in Southern Transcontinental Service left Eastern Air Lines with through-plane service between Florida and Dallas,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and American Airlines with routes between Dallas and the West Coast. If both routes are transferred to the Eastern-American combine and no restriction is imposed on through operation via Dallas, Houston fears that National\u2019s Florida-California service via Houston would be seriously impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The measure of the right to intervene before the Civil Aeronautics Board is \u201csubstantial interest.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Denial of the right to intervene founded on a claim of substantial interest is immediately reviewable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We think it clear that Houston has demonstrated that it has a substantial interest in the American-Eastern Merger case and that the Board erred in denying its petition to intervene while leaving the issues in Docket 13355 unrestricted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Contrary to the Board\u2019s holding, the interest of Houston in this proceeding is not the same as that of the approximately one hundred and twenty-six other cities on the combined routes of Eastern and American. Houston\u2019s interest is that of a municipality, closely linked to another municipality with competing interests,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which has been granted the right of intervention without restriction in a proceeding which might affect or vitiate a prior Board decision in which Houston had a \u201csubstantial interest.\u201d In such a situation Houston has a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in presenting its side of the case in the proceeding. Essential fairness dictates this.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">The Board's reliance on Eastern Air Lines v. Civil Aeronautics Bd.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is misplaced. That case involved American Airline\u2019s application for a temporary exemption to allow over-flying Dallas-Houston on its New York-Mexico route. Houston .and Dallas, denied intervention below, sought leave to intervene on appeal under Rule 38(f). This court denied intervention \u201cfor lack of a showing that the order sought to be reviewed affects a legal right or a legal duty of the city * * Where a non-party seeks to intervene on appeal under Rule 38(f) the quantum of interest required is greater than \u201csubstantial interest.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">We therefore vacate Paragraph 3 of Order E-18442, which denies Houston leave to intervene, and remand this matter to the Board for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-12\">. 72 Stat. 795, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-13\">.
