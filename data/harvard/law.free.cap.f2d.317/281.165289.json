Vose, a domiciliary of the-Virgin Islands, died in a plane crash on July 10, 1957, leaving a gross estate of approximately five and one half million dollars. His estate had been accumulated over the years as a result of the diverse-business enterprises which he carried on in both corporate and non-corporate form. Primary and central to all such commercial activity, however, was his. operation of an insurance brokerage business as a sole proprietorship. This was. started in the 1920\u2019s and continued, with increasing success, throughout his life.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His involvement in other business ventures did not commence until the 1940\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">In October, 1955 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vose executed a will in which, after minor specific legacies, he directed his executors to incorporate his insurance business and transfer to it \u201call the assets of my said business,\u201d' with the stock in this corporation to be distributed in varying proportions to his insurance employees of at least five years standing. The remainder, and bulk, of his estate was left to his secretary, or alternatively, the immediate members of her family.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">The sole question at issue here is what the testator intended by the phrase \u201call the assets of my said [insurance] business\u201d: in particular, whether certain-disputed items are \u201cassets\u201d of the insurance business or, instead, are properly includible in the remainder of the estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The items in dispute are (1) insurance \u25a0proceeds from the destruction of an airplane, (2) sums carried on the insurance business books as \u201caccounts receivable\u201d from three other enterprises of the testator, and (3) bank account balances of \u25a0the insurance business. As to items \u201c1\u201d and <em>\u201c2\u201d </em>the district court held that they were \u201cnot such assets as C. R. Vose referred to in his will which were to be transferred to C. R. Vose, Inc.\u201d and that item \u201c3\u201d \u201cis such an asset minus $38,-:886.56.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We note, initially, that the dispute here is not with the legal principles \u25a0applicable, but rather with the district court\u2019s findings of fact within the general legal framework. As such, the findings of the district court must prevail unless they are clearly erroneous and the record leaves us with the \u201cdefinite and firm\u201d conviction that a mistake has been made. United States v. U. S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 1147 (1948); Robert H. Fox Co. v. Keystone Driller Co., 232 F.2d 831, 835 (3 Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\n<em>The Disputed Matters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AsE\">1. Airplane</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Item \u201c1\u201d involves the net insurance \u25a0proceeds from the destruction of the Lockheed Lodestar in which testator died in 1957 and which, the record shows, had been purchased by testator in the latter part of 1945. The district court found that \u201cthe proceeds listed * * * as [$191,353.59, were] from the sale [sic] of Vose\u2019s * * * \u2018Sky Gypsy\u2019 which [was] not purchased or used mainly or to any appreciable extent from or in the conduct of his insurance business.\u201d The court evidently reasoned from this that since the testator did not buy the plane for use in his insurance business and did not use it primarily in the conduct of this business he did not intend for it to be considered as an insurance business \u201casset\u201d that would devolve to the business upon his demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Appellant attacks this finding of fact on the grounds that (1) it is unsupported by the evidence and (2) is not decisive of the issue to be resolved. On the latter point, appellant contends that \u201cthe decisive test is the testator\u2019s understanding and intention.\u201d This conclusory language, however, is really \u201cdecisive\u201d of nothing, for it is precisely just this question \u2014 -testator\u2019s understanding and intention with respect to the word \u201casset\u201d \u25a0 \u2014 -that is at issue. Certainly such factors as the testator\u2019s reasons for purchasing the airplane and his subsequent use of it are primary indicia in resolving this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s finding is unsupported by the evidence fares no better, for we conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support its findings and we cannot say that it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">A brief summary of testator\u2019s business and personal activities points up the significance of the factors which bear on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">The uncontradicted record evidence reveals that testator started his insurance business in the 1920\u2019s and was increasingly successful in its operation over the years. His central office was always in Brooklyn and branch offices were established in the late 20\u2019s and the 30\u2019s in Detroit, Chicago and Philadelphia and, in the early 40\u2019s, Pittsburgh, with a further branch office opened in Newark in 1949 (later moved to Montclair, New Jersey in 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">Until his marriage in 1938 substantially all of testator\u2019s business interests were restricted to his insurance brokerage and his sphere of activity was centered around its headquarters and branch offices. However, in that year his wife, shortly after their marriage, purchased real estate in Osprey, Florida, which was later transferred to testator in 1940, the same year in which he acquired real estate in Casey Key, Florida. Around 1943 he acquired more acreage and a house in Florida which became their winter home. In 1943, testator also acquired a \u201cland operation\u201d in upstate New York. Testator\u2019s wife bought a ranch in Melville, Montana in 1945 (this was prior to the purchase of the airplane in that year), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>and there is evidence that previously testator, his wife and sister-in-law had leased a cabin at a ranch in Melville. It also appears that Mrs. Vose participated quite actively in the running of this ranch. Shortly thereafter testator himself acquired cattle interests in Montana. In 1945 testator also spread his interests to the Virgin Islands, for there is testimony that in May of that year he organized two Virgin Island investment trusts for the purpose of conducting investment operations in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In 1947, testator became the sole owner of the Key Nursery, a wholesale and retail nursery business in Osprey, Florida and three years later he acquired an interest in a Florida plant food operation. Testator\u2019s next substantial business investment (ca. |1,500,000) came in 1953 with the organization of Antilles Enterprises, Inc., a Virgin Islands corporation, of which he subsequently became controlling shareholder. Then in 1954 he acquired another Montana interest by organizing a livestock corporation. In the same year he organized Tropical Investors, Inc. a Virgin Islands corporation which administered the bulk of a securities portfolio which he had previously conducted in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">This brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 indicates that the diversification of testator\u2019s business and personal interests preceded, was concurrent with and followed the acquisition of his airplane in 1945. A permissible inference to be drawn from the timing of this diversification- \u2014 and the one the district court drew \u2014 is that testator\u2019s expanding interests were a prime motivating factor in his purchase of the Lodestar ; or cast in the negative terms of the district court, the Lodestar was not purchased primarily for use in his insurance business. Further, it is significant that there was no evidence to indicate that changed circumstances in the insurance business necessitated the purchase of an airplane in 1945. As indicated above, the headquarters and all but one of the branch offices had been well-established prior to 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Other evidence to support this finding-is seen in the testimony of testator\u2019s sister-in-law, Mrs. Donald. She testified that her sister (testator\u2019s wife) \u201cthought it would be nice to have a plane of her-own, because we were always getting' bumped for priority reasons during the war.\u201d This idea initially started as a. \u201cjoke\u201d because there was no chance of' acquiring an airplane during the war,, however, \u201cas time went on they [testator and his wife] talked more and more about, it.\u201d Her testimony also reveals that the-difficulties of getting back and forth between Florida and Montana because of the curtailment on transportation during the war figured largely in the conversations in which they explored the possibility of purchasing an airplane. The credibility of this witness, of course, was for the district court to determine. Mrs. Donald also testified that testator was-concerned about getting an airplane large enough to require a professional pilot so that Mrs. Vose \u2014 who had a private pilot\u2019s license and had crashed one plane before \u25a0 \u2014 would not be able to fly it. As appellees rightly point out, such a concern is more consistent with testator\u2019s treatment of the plane as one to be used for over-all business and personal purposes between Florida and Montana, etc., than-as a strict insurance business \u201casset\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">As to the use of the plane, the executors showed, by a compilation of the daily whereabouts of testator and the-airplane that, from 1954 until July, 1957,. the Lodestar was used principally in connection with testator\u2019s activities in- the-Virgin Islands, Florida and Montana and not in furtherance of his insurance business. Appellant concedes that this was-so. However, bottoming its argument on the position (contrary to the court\u2019s; finding) that \u201cthe plane was acquired' and maintained as an asset of the insurance business,\u201d it dismisses the court\u2019s; finding by saying that \u201cthe simple fact is that, after 1954, the testator continued to use the plane for insurance business-purposes but less frequently than in prior years.\u201d This is wide of the mark, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the very point of inquiry is whether or not the plane <em>should </em>be considered an \u201casset\u201d of the insurance business within the meaning of Paragraph Fourth of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellant\u2019s evidence as to the use of the plane indicated that testator made insurance trips to Alaska at times, but their frequency ranged, according to the witness, from only two trips since 1945 to two trips per year from 1945 to 1957. Appellant also places great emphasis on a letter sent from testator to Mr. Green-berg, his accountant, in 1948.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant stresses that portion which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cBy using the plane I can cover Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and New York in three days. I am entirely independent of railroad or commercial airline reservations and time tables, and I find it difficult to put into words how simple it is to be able to take off anywhere in the United States on two or three hours\u2019 notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201cI might add that I can conceive of no one in his right mind using a plane for pleasure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">It urges that this demonstrates testator\u2019s emphasis on the utility of the Lodestar for insurance business activities. Yet, read in its entirety, the letter does not reveal this peculiar intent to limit use to his insurance business. In response to the question of \u201cwhy I use a plane in my business\u201d testator responds \u201cLet me point out that I have offices all over the East, <em>and I also have considerable interests in a nursery in Florida </em>[Key Nursery, acquired in 1947] <em>and a ranch in Montana </em>[acquired in May, 1945].\u201d Coupled with this evidence is a summary of his and his wife\u2019s whereabouts that testator wrote to his attorney in 1954. In that summary, he described their activities from about 1949 to 1953 as falling into \u201ca definite pattern for years. Florida or V. I. in winter and ranch in June until after [the Christmas] holidays.\u201d His New York apartment was referred to as \u201ca spot to stop when in N. Y. I may be there a week or ten days every month or two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">This evidence as to his whereabouts and activities is also consistent with the testimony of Mr. Greenberg that in the latter 1940\u2019s and during the 1950\u2019s Mr. Vose devoted a great portion of his active time to the supervision of his other business interests and by that time his insurance business was able to run with his supervision and control but without the necessity of his physical presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">However, appellant\u2019s objection to the holding of the district court goes deeper than contradictory evidence as to the use of the airplane. Basically, appellant urges that (1) the manner in which the airplane was carried on testator\u2019s books; (2) the funds from which the airplane expenses were paid and (3) the income tax treatment of the airplane depreciation are the prime and controlling determinants of the question of whether the airplane is an asset of the insurance business within the meaning of Paragraph Fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">The evidence as to the book entries is conflicting and is not specifically resolved by the findings of the district court. The conflict arises from the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>bookkeeping scheme which testator employed. Separate books were kept for each of the insurance business branch offices, the Brooklyn headquarters, and each of his other separate business enterprises, such as the Key Nursery, Montana ranch, etc. In addition, there was another separate set of books for a \u201cNew England Office\u201d of the insurance business. This was merely a \u201cpaper office\u201d consisting of a set of books (relating to bank accounts in Boston and Montreal), kept by testator in Brooklyn for a twofold purpose: (1) to keep separate the insurance commissions attributable to policies written outside of New York City (and thus not subject to the state gross receipts tax) and (2) for disbursements for non-insurance transactions as well as insurance business. Lastly, all of the activities of testator, insurance and otherwise, were consolidated and summarized in a set of ledgers and journals referred to as \u201cprivate summary books.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Appellant\u2019s two-stage argument on this point is that \u201cfrom the date of its acquisition, the plane was carried as an asset of that business\u201d and since for bookkeeping purposes it is an \u201casset\u201d this should control the meaning of that term as it is used in testator\u2019s will. In support of the first step in this argument appellant refers to certain balance sheets for the over-all insurance business wherein the plane is listed as an asset at its then total value. On the other hand, the executors refer to still other books in support of their contention that only a small portion of the total airplane investment was ever carried on testator\u2019s insurance books and that the balance was carried on the \u201cprivate summary ledger\u201d as a fixed asset along with such other items as testator\u2019s former Connecticut home. We do not feel that the resolution of this apparent conflict is necessary. Even assuming the validity of appellant\u2019s argument, we cannot agree with its conclusion as to the overpowering significance of such treatment. The fact that testator, for business, tax or any other reasons, might have carried the airplane as an \u201casset\u201d on his insurance books is only one factor to be considered in determining the meaning of that word as it is used in his will. To say that testator carried the plane as an \u201casset\u201d for bookkeeping purposes is not to say that ipso facto it must be an \u201casset\u201d within the meaning of Paragraph Fourth. Appellant\u2019s position cannot be sustained for it oversimplifies the question and ignores the fact that a word may have many shades of meaning and, accordingly, must be viewed from a wider perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Appellant also urges that payment of the Lodestar\u2019s maintenance and operating expenses out of insurance funds should be controlling. Again there is no specific finding by the district court as to whether or not these expenses were charged to the insurance business. It is clear that most of these expenses were paid out of the \u201cNew England Office\u201d account. However, as we noted earlier, this \u201coffice\u201d account was used for both insurance and non-insurance purposes, so that proof of payments out of such an account does not indicate an unequivocal intent to give them a uniquely insurance business characterization. Further, the fact that the plane expenses might have been paid from insurance funds is not conclusive in itself, for the majority of testator\u2019s ordinary income throughout the years was derived from his brokerage business and, of necessity, many of his expenses\u2014 personal, insurance, and other businesses \u2014were paid out of the insurance business proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Finally, appellant points to testator\u2019s income tax returns for the years 1945-1956, and terms them \u201cdecisive in themselves as to the manner in which the testator regarded the plane * * * \u201d In each of these years, testator took depreciation on his airplane against insurance income at a value equal to its cur-' rent total cost. Appellant contends that this acknowledged tax treatment for depreciation \u2014 which must be presumed to have properly qualified under the applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions\u2014 is inconsistent and irreconcilable with the finding of the district court as to the purchase and use of the airplane. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>urges further that, \u201cimplicit in the holding of the court below * * * is the presumption that the testator, over a period of many years, consistently filed fraudulent tax returns.\u201d We cannot subscribe to this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Depreciation deductions under Section 23 (1) (1) and (2) (as amended by \u00a7 121(c) of the 1942 Act) of the 1939 Code were allowed for \u201cproperty used in the trade or business\u201d or for \u201cproperty held for the production of income.\u201d The record in these will construction suits is barren of evidence bearing on such factors as the preparation of the returns, the grounds on which testator justified his deductions, or the details of any formal agency examination or consideration of the returns. This is not an income tax case. We are faced with the naked fact that the depreciation deductions were taken by testator and apparently not objected to by the Internal Revenue Service; nothing more. On this state of the record, we are unable to find inherent conflict between such entries and the district court\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"> On balance, we cannot say that the court below was clearly erroneous in finding that the airplane was not an \u201casset\u201d of the insurance business. An examination of the evidence as a whole convinces us that there was sufficient evidence to support its finding of fact. 2. \u201cAccounts Receivable\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The district court found that as \u201ccreditor\u201d of all his various business enterprises testator \u201cfreely withdrew funds from his insurance business which withdrawals often times would be carried on one of the various sets of insurance business books as accounts receivable; and subsequently such books would be audited and adjustment entries made to characterize the withdrawals more accurately as a withdrawal of profits or capital.\u201d Consistent with this practice the court also found that in the operation of his businesses testator \u201cfreely transferred and co-mingled the funds and assets to discharge business or personal debts as required or as his whim might dictate.\u201d The crucial question for the district court in this instance as with the airplane, did not turn on narrow paths of inquiry as to whether testator could have a \u201cdebt\u201d enforceable against himself or the strict accounting application of such a term as \u201caccounts receivable\u201d. Instead, its primary focus was on whether testator treated his business affairs in a manner that would indicate that he considered certain items as \u201cassets\u201d of his insurance business rather than belonging to any of his other interests. Accordingly, the court found that the three accounts \u201cwere carried on the insurance business books as accounts receivable and yet had no relation to the operation of the insurance business and only represented withdrawals by Vose of funds for his other business interests.\u201d It concluded, therefore, that these items were not \u201cassets\u201d of the insurance business as that term was used by testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">One of those \u201caccounts receivable\u201d was carried on the New England books of the insurance business for Tropical Investors, Inc., the Virgin Islands corporation which testator formed in 1954 to run a securities investment business. He owned all but the directors\u2019 qualifying shares in Tropical. The exhibits in evidence and the undisputed testimony show that from 1955 to 1957 there were frequent transfers of funds between testator\u2019s insurance and securities investment, businesses. Specifically, in 1955 Tropical transferred funds totalling $99,500 to C. R. Vose which were deposited in the New England branch account. In July and August the C. R. Vose New England account in return disbursed $27,802.87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>to Tropical. This left a difference of $71,697.13 in favor of the Tropical account which, pursuant to the instructions of testator, Mr. Greenberg closed out to testator\u2019s personal account by a year end adjusting entry. In 1956 this pattern of transfer was again followed, but in that year there was a $12,000 difference in favor of the C. R. Vose account, which Mr. Greenberg, at the direction of testator, closed out in testator\u2019s personal account by an adjusting entry. In January and March, 1957, Tropical disbursed $20,-000 and $10,000, respectively, to C. R. Vose, New England branch and in March and June, checks totalling $135,000 were issued from the New England branch of C. R. Vose to Tropical.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The dispute is centered on the adjusting entry which Mr. Greenberg, subsequent to Testator\u2019s death in July, made in closing out this account to testator\u2019s personal account. Appellant contends that the difference of $105,000 which had been disbursed to Tropical was an enforceable debt which Tropical owed to the insurance business. Strenuous objection is made to the fact that Mr. Greenberg made a mid-year adjusting \u25a0entry in closing out this sum when in practice \u201ctestator never adjusted or balanced these accounts in the middle of the year. Adjustments were made at the \u2022end of the year when all inter-enterprise transactions were concluded.\u201d The simple answer is that these same \u201cinter-enterprise\u201d transactions were made by testator, himself, in his various business roles and accordingly came to an end with his death. Appellant has several other \u25a0objections on this score which we have fully considered. However, there is no need to itemize them, for we are satisfied that there was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the $105,000 represented a withdrawal of funds by testator for use in his .securities investment business.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The second \u201caccount receivable\u201d carried on the New England books of the insurance company was for testator\u2019s Key Nursery business in Florida. The insurance company was the broker for the insurance on the nursery, which testator had started in 1947. Although the nursery consistently had an operating loss each year, the premiums due on its insurance policies were paid by it until 1953. From 1953 to 1957, however, these premiums were paid for by the insurance business and each year the balance so paid was carried forward, until on the date of testator\u2019s death they amounted to $19,204.67. This sum was subsequently written off by Mr. Greenberg as a withdrawal of insurance business capital, similar to that for Tropical Investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Appellant argues that this was erroneous, for it contends that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the fact that this balance was not written off each year but was carried forward, is that testator intended these sums to be regarded as advances to which the insurance business was \u201cultimately entitled\u201d. This argument completely ignores the testimony of Mr. Greenberg as to why no year end adjusting entries were made in this instance. He said that testator had instructed him not to write off this account on the nursery books because he wanted to impress upon his Key Nursery manager the fact that this was one of the expenses of the business which the manager should consider in his operations. Appellant points to no other evidence to support its contention and, in light of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s testimony, the evidence is more consistent with the view that testator never intended his nursery business. \u2014 which at no time operated in the black \u2014 to be obligated at some future date for a continually enhanced sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The final \u201caccount receivable\u201d at issue concerns sums advanced to Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of Antilles Enterprises, Inc. of which testator was controlling stockholder. In March, 1957 testator instructed the manager of his insurance business to, \u201cif possible\u201d, send $20,000 or \u201cwhat you can spare\u201d to the account of Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, Inc. Testator also stated that \u201cAntilles can pay as much of that back <em>as and when you need it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Accordingly, $20,000 was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>vanced to Bluebeard\u2019s and recorded as an \u201caccounts receivable\u201d on the insurance books. On May 20, one-half of this amount was repaid. However, since no further payments were made before testator\u2019s death, the insurance books carried the remaining $10,000 as an accounts receivable item for Bluebeard\u2019s at that time. Following the procedure that he employed for the Key Nursery and Tropical Investors accounts, Mr. Greenberg subsequently wrote off the amount as a withdrawal of capital or profit and that practice was sustained by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We believe that the district court erred in this respect. There is no evidence, as there was with Key Nursery and Tropical, of any past practice with regard to the interchanging of funds between testator\u2019s insurance business and Bluebeard\u2019s : the evidence presents this transaction as an isolated instance. More importantly, the sole evidence we have of testator\u2019s intent in this regard is contrary to an attempted inference that this was a permanent withdrawal of capital from his insurance business. He expressly stated that the sum advanced was to be paid \u201cas and when\u201d the manager of his insurance business needed it and consistent with this view one-half of the amount was repaid before testator\u2019s death. In light of the facts, we must conclude that the $10,000 accounts receivable from Bluebeard\u2019s Castle is an asset of the insurance business within the meaning of Paragraph Fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">3. Bank Account Balances</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The final challenged item before this court is referred to by the district court as involving \u201cBank Account Balances \u2014 $148,279.24.\u201d The findings of fact in relation to these balances are that (1) they \u201crepresent accounts which Vose used for over-all business purposes and non-insurance purposes\u201d and (2) \u201con the basis of the accounting made by Mr. Greenberg the bank account balances contained $38,886.56 which would have been withdrawn by Vose as profits in accordance with his past practice.\u201d Accordingly, it is held that these bank account balances are assets of testator\u2019s insurance business \u201cminus $38,886.56.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The Greenberg accounting referred to by the court is \u201cExecutors Exhibit J.; Income from Insurance Offices for the Period January 1, 1957 to July 10, 1957\u201d in which the final figure is \u201cNet profit as yet undrawn at Testator\u2019s death \u2014 $38,-886.56.\u201d This exhibit was introduced at trial as representing \u201c.a fair statement of the net profit from the insurance business\u201d for the January-July period. We can find no express objection made by appellant at the trial to any of the figures or computations appearing in this exhibit. On the other hand, we also find no testimony in the record to the effect that \u201cin accordance with his past practice\u201d testator would have withdrawn such sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Simply stated, the findings of fact with respect to these balances leave the issues undefined.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">Although both the trial judge and appellant characterize the question \"as involving the entire \u201ccash on hand and in banks\u201d of $148,279.24, appellees inform us that they recommended at pre-trial (and the court accepted the recommendation) that this entire sum be treated as an insurance business asset, subject only to their claim for current profits. Viewed thus, the precise problem would then appear to turn on the determination of the figure for current undistributed net profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">In any event, the present state of the record and the findings of fact leave this court unsatisfied as to the delineation of these issues and the factors which should be considered as bearing on them. The findings of fact are so inadequate on this branch of the appeal that we are not properly apprised of the basis of the district court\u2019s judgment. Cf. I. C. C. v. Cardinale Trucking Corp., 308 F.2d 435, 437 (3 Cir. 1962). Nor can we reasonably say that the conflicting fact allegations which the parties raise on appeal as bearing on the point were fully considered by th,e court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be (1) affirmed with respect to disputed item \u201c1\u201d and the Tropical Investors and Key Nursery Accounts of item <em>\u201c2\u201d; </em>(2) reversed as to the Bluebeard\u2019s Castle account of item \u201c2\u201d; and (3) remanded to the district court for more adequate findings of fact with respect to item \u201c3\u201d.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">. Three \u201cactions for debt\u201d instituted by the appellant, Charles R. Yose, Inc., and a petition for construction of testator\u2019s will instituted by testator\u2019s executors. The cases were consolidated for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\">. Annual gross commissions in 1945 were $255,000 and in the four calendar years preceding his death they were in excess of $500,000. The principal source of Vose\u2019s business \u2014 comprising some 95% of the commissions \u2014 was the Atlantic and Pacific food store chain and its affiliates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">. His wife died in January, 1954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-14\">. Testator\u2019s secretary was also appointed, with two others, as an executor and trustee of his will. Since she died in the same plane crash, under the terms of the will her two brothers (who are also residuary legatees of the estate) were substituted in her stead. Any intimation in appellant\u2019s brief that there is some impropriety in the two brothers being both executor and residuary legatees of testator\u2019s estate is clearly unwarranted. The mere existence of a possible adverse interest, without more, is not sufficient grounds for complaint in the Virgin Islands. 15 V.I. C. \u00a7 240(b) (1957). In re Below (Bishop), 3 V.I. 300 (D. 1958). More importantly, no complaint of such a nature has ever been made and thus suggested inference to the contrary has no place in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">. \u201c5/6/48</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u201cDear Mr. Greenberg:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">\u201cYou asked me today to give you a resume of why I use a plane in my business. Let me point out that I have offices all over the East, and I also have considerable interests in a nursery in Florida and a ranch in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">\u201cI also have very large insurance interests in Alaska, and in 1946 I took some executives of the Nakat Packing Company, my client, from Seattle to Naknek Airport on Bristol Bay, as well as to Fairbanks to a meeting and return. By \u25a0using the plane I can cover Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and New York in three days. I am entirely independent of railroad or commercial airline reservations and time tables, and I find it difficult to put into words how simple it is to be able to take off anywhere in the United States on two or three hours\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">\u201cI might add that I can conceive of no one in his right mind using a plane for pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-20\">\u201cYours, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-21\">\u201cC. R. Vose\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">. It is also noteworthy that appellant\u2019s position, if sustained, would also make for the inclusion of the proceeds from the sale of testator\u2019s boat as an \u201casset\u201d of the insurance business, for it also was consistently treated as a depreciable asset of the insurance business. However, from an adverse ruling below, appellant does not now press this item on appeal, because it did not feel that there was \u201csufficient evidence\u201d introduced below to sustain its position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
