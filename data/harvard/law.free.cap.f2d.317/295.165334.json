The single issue here is whether a voluntary dismissal by <em>order </em>of court after an initial voluntary dismissal of the same suit by <em>notice </em>in a state court bars the filing of a third suit in federal court under the provisions of Rule 41(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">The short record shows that Robert A. McGhee, as plaintiff, filed a suit in the Circuit Court of Dade County, Florida, against Lederle Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and against American Cyanamid Company, charging that a poliomyelitis vaccine, manufactured, tested and distributed by them, was harmful to persons who consumed it and caused a partial paralysis of the plaintiff. Plaintiff took an order voluntarily dismissing this first suit without prejudice pursuant to Rule 1.35(a) (1), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure 30 F.S.A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Thereafter, plaintiff filed a suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against defendant, American Cyanamid Company, a Maine corporation, doing business as Lederle Laboratories, Inc., alleging that the vaccine caused or contributed to paralysis suffered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The suit in the United States District Court came on for trial on the amended complaint and answer. As the jury was about to be called to the box, the plaintiff announced to the court that he was unable to proceed due to the absence of an important witness, and moved for dismissal under Rule 41(a) (2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court dismissed the suit but reserved ruling whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice and reserved ruling on other conditions which might be fixed to the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After briefs were filed and considered, the terms and conditions of the dismissal were established by the court. It ordex-ed that the dismissal which was previously entered \u201c * * * be without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to refile another suit based upon the same claim. * * however, the plaintiff\u2019s right to refile was conditioned upon prior payment to the defendant for costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. It is from this order that the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">We are, therefore, directly concerned here with voluntary dismissal by order of court only entered under Rule 41(a) (2), but appellant says the language of Rule 41(a) (1) which limits voluntary dismissals by notice is applicable to voluntary dismissals granted by the court. This requires examination of both sections of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Voluntary dismissal of civil actions in federal courts is governed by Rule 41(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Within this Rule there are three separate and distinct methods of voluntarily dismissing a suit. The first and second methods are covered by Rule 41(a) (1) which provides for a dismissal by <em>notice, </em>and dismissal by stipulation of the parties. The third method is found in Rule 41 (a) (2) which provides for a dismissal by <em>order </em>of court upon such condition as the court considers just.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Rule 41(a) (1) is the shortest and surest route to abort a eomplaint when it is applicable. So long as plaintiff has not been served with his adversary\u2019s answer or motion for summary judgment he need do no more than file a <em>notice </em>of dismissal with the Clerk. That document itself closes the file. There is nothing the defendant can do to fan the ashes of that action into life and the court has no role to play. This is a matter of right running to the plaintiff and may not be extinguished or circumscribed by adversary or court. There is not even a perfunctory order of court closing the file. Its alpha and omega was the doing of the plaintiff alone. He suffers no impair-, ment beyond his fee for filing. But this quick and ready tool may be used once, and only once, if clear consequences are to be avoided. A second notice of dismissal not only closes the file, it also closes the case with prejudice to the bringing of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The reason for this arbitrary limitation, pointed out in numerous decisions, is to prevent unreasonable abuse and hai-assment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">Under the facts of this case, however, Rule 41(a) (1) was not available to plaintiff-appellee at all to accomplish a dismissal. Here the defendant had answered and the case had proceeded to actual trial stage. Plaintiff had no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to close the file by leaving with the clerk a paper dubbed \u201cnotice of dismissal.\u201d His only recourse was to move for an order of court under 41(a) (2). In doing so, he, as any such movant, had to take all the consequences of his action, including the possibility that the court would dismiss with prejudice to his bringing a third suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The thrust of appellant\u2019s attack here is that there was no power in the district court to dismiss under any conditions short of barring a third subsequent suit, since this was a second voluntary dismissal and, as such, \u201coperates as an adjudication upon the merits * * * \u201d under 41(a) (1). No precedent for this contention has been cited or discovered. A motion for an order of court under 41(a) (2), under this argument, is purely perfunctory, and the court\u2019s order is <em>pro forma </em>only.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In sustaining the district court in its determination that this case be dismissed without prejudice, we hold that Rule 41(a) (1) does not impose an arbitrary limitation on the court\u2019s action taken under Rule 41(a) (2). We can read no two dismissal rule into 41(a) (2). By its very language 41(a) (2) gives the court power to grant or deny a motion made under the rule and \u201cupon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.\u201d Here the court has an express judicial function to perform. All of the concepts and processes of judicial determination are brought into play. The merits of each motion must be considered and a ruling made by the court. There is no language under this section which pre-ordains the ultimate judicial decision on a motion made under its terms. This, to us, is not akin to the automatic consequences laid down for dismissals by notice under 41(a) (1). Rather than restricting the judicial function as is done under 41(a) (1), dismissals by the court on motion under 41(a) (2) plainly puts upon the court a definite duty to perform: to grant or deny the motion, and to establish \u201csuch terms and conditions as the court deems proper.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It does not follow that there is no limit at all on the number of such dismissals even by court order. While there is no precise digital answer, the mere repetition of such occurrence may, in and of itself, become so oppressively prejudicial as to require the sound conclusion that even once more is too much. This along with countless elements, traditionally called upon to underpin our concepts of reasonableness and fairness, goes into the process of sound discretion of the trial court, as 41(a) (2) says, \u201cas the court deems proper.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Here the trial judge deemed it proper that plaintiff bear the cost of the cancellation by paying his adversary\u2019s expenses plus a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, but he also deemed it proper that plaintiff be allowed to bring yet another suit upon making such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">We do not find these terms so harsh, arbitrary or unreasonable that they equate with plain error as a clear abuse of discretion. It is noted espe: dally that there is no claim here that the trial judge abused in his discretion. Indeed, there is no suggestion in the record that appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was compelled by anything except the unanticipated loss of an important witness. The action of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">.
