The Board, in its answer, requests that its order be enforced. Upon examination of the entire record, Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), we conclude that the Board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence and that the remedy sought is appropriate and authorized by law. We accordingly grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">The Board found that petitioner violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by interrogating an employee as to the extent of union activity in the plant; by restoring overtime work in order to induce the employees to abandon the union; and by threatening employee Vannoy with reprisals if he continued his activity in behalf of the union. The Board found further that petitioner violated Section 8(a) (3) of the Act by discharging Vannoy because of his union membership and activity. We shall consider these findings <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">Petitioner is a lumber and supply company with warehouses at Mine\u00f3la, Pine Aire, and Riverhead, Long Island. The events on which the Board\u2019s findings are based began in February 1961, when, in response to petitioner\u2019s reduction of overtime work, petitioner\u2019s warehousemen instructed their Independent Warehouse-men\u2019s Union to investigate the possibility of affiliation with a local of the Teamsters Union. On April 24, the Independent notified its members that a special meeting would be held on April 28 to consider affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-19\">The next morning, April 25, An-son Seaman, petitioner\u2019s general manager, called Fred Adams, president of the Independent, into Seaman\u2019s private office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>and told Adams that he, Seaman, had heard a rumor that the \u201cboys at Pine Aire have been talking to the union\u201d and asked Adams if that was true. Adams replied that the boys at Pine Aire had no more to do with it than anyone else, but that the rumor was true. Seaman thereupon told Adams that the Company had always done its best for the employees, and that it would be a \u201cmistake\u201d to dissolve the Independent. He urged Adams to vote against affiliation with the Teamsters. The Board found that this interview violated Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In determining whether or not an employer\u2019s interrogation of individual employees constitutes forbidden \u201ccoercion\u201d, in derogation of employees\u2019 freedom of choice as guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Board is required to consider not only the information sought, but also the manner and context in which the questioning was conducted. N. L. R. B. v. Syracuse Color Press, Inc., 209 F.2d 596 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 966, 74 S.Ct. 777, 98 L.Ed. 1108 (1954). In the present case, Seaman summoned Adams to his private office (as distinguished from the regular place of employee activities) at a critical time in the employees\u2019 movement toward the Teamsters. In effect, Seaman interrogated Adams whether the \u201cPine Aire boys\u201d had initiated the affiliation movement. This was information with which petitioner had no legitimate concern.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Seaman made clear to Adams the employer\u2019s opposition to the employees\u2019 plans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, and in light of the evidence of later events which we shall shortly develop, the Board was justified in concluding that the interview constituted the first in a series of steps by which petitioner applied increasingly coercive pressure against the free choice, by its employees, of their bargaining agent. See N. L. R. B. v. Midwestern Instruments, Inc., 264 F.2d 829 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 932, 79 S.Ct. 1451, 3 L.Ed.2d 1545 (1959). Compare N. L. R. B. v. Firedoor Corp., 291 F.2d 328, 331-332 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 921, 82 S.Ct. 242, 7 L.Ed.2d 136 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Several days after the Adams interview, petitioner\u2019s employees voted to dissolve the Independent and to affiliate with Teamsters Local 1205. The vote was 10-4, with only petitioner\u2019s Riverhead employees voting against affiliation. A majority of petitioner\u2019s employees signed check-off slips for Local 1205 and the Local began to press for recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">About two weeks later, Seaman visited Pine Aire, and asked the employees what could be done \u201cto alter the decision to affiliate with Local 1205.\u201d He was told that the situation would probably never have arisen if working hours had not been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>duced in February. Seaman responded that \u201cif it meant so much,\u201d he would have the overtime restored. His promise was promptly fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The Board found that the promise and its fulfillment were intended to induce the employees to abandon the union of their choice, and violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act. The evidence, and the authorities, amply support the Board\u2019s conclusions. Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 321 U.S. 678, 685-687, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944) ; N. L. R. B. v. Philamon Laboratories, Inc., 298 F.2d 176, 180, 181 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 1555, 8 L.Ed.2d 498 (1962); Joy Silk Mills, Inc., v. N. L. R. B., 87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732 (1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 914, 71 S. Ct. 734, 95 L.Ed. 1350 (1951); N. L. R. B. v. Bailey Co., 180 F.2d 278 (6th Cir., 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Approximately a month after these events, Local 1205, having been unsuccessful in its attempts to secure recognition from petitioners, filed a representation petition with the Board and established picket lines at all three Reserve Supply warehouses. Thereupon petitioner began to' reduce working hours at Mine\u00f3la and Pine Aire. About this time Vernon Berg, petitioner\u2019s manager at Pine Aire, warned Fred Vannoy, an employee who had been active in the affiliation drive and who had signed a checkoff card, that Vannoy would be \u201cone of the first ones to travel [to] Mine\u00f3la,\u201d a warehouse located some 25 miles from Vannoy\u2019s home in Pine Aire, because of his \u201cunion activities * * * talking to the delegates and so forth.\u201d Several weeks later Berg again warned Vannoy \u201cIf you don\u2019t change your ways of thinking about the union * * * and talking to the delegates,\u201d there would be unpleasant consequences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shortly after this incident Vannoy and two others, Scully and Maiorina, were permitted to take their vacations, and were instructed not to return to work until notified. When Local 1205 discontinued picketing petitioner\u2019s warehouses several weeks later, Scully and Maiorina were recalled, but Vannoy received a note from Manager Berg terminating his services, purportedly for lack of work, and because of Vannoy\u2019s low seniority rating at Pine Aire.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">The Board adduced further evidence that at the time of Vannoy\u2019s discharge, petitioner was seeking a new employee at its Riverhead warehouse, and that Vannoy was not offered the job despite his six years\u2019 experience with petitioner, although petitioner had on at least one past occasion transferred an employee between warehouses. The Board points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>that the Riverhead. warehousemen had voted unanimously against affiliation with Local 1205, and that the transfer of Vannoy to Riverhead would have cracked this solid front of opposition to the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The Board concluded, in disagreement with its trial examiner, that petitioner failed to recall Vannoy because of his union activity, thereby violating Sections 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act, and ordered his reinstatement with back pay plus interest from the date of his discharge. The Board's findings are amply supported by substantial evidence, Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., supra. Its order will accordingly be enforced. See N. L. R. B. v. Great Eastern Color Lithographic Corp., 309 F.2d 352 (2d Cir. 1962); Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co. v. N. L. R. B., 217 F.2d 575 (2d Cir., 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">In its back pay order, the Board departed from its earlier practice <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of tolling back pay for the period between the issuance of the Intermediate Report and the issuance of the Board\u2019s order where the Trial Examiner finds that the discharge was not discriminatory, but he is reversed by the Board. It also required the payment of 6 per cent interest as part of the back pay award. Petitioner contends that both provisions exceeded the Board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The validity of the back pay order is settled by our recent decision in N. L. R. B. v. A. P. W. Prods. Co., 316 F.2d 899 (2d Cir., 1963). We hold that the award of interest, like the award of back pay, is within the broad remedial authority of the Board. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160; see Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., 319 U.S. 533, 539-540, 543-544, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The National Labor Relations Act makes no express mention of interest. When the statutes are silent, the question of whether interest shall be awarded is to be determined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">\u201cin accordance with the historic judicial principle that one for whose financial advantage an obligation was assumed or imposed, and who has suffered actual money damages by another\u2019s breach of that obligation, should be fairly compensated for the loss thereby sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APV\">Rodgers v. United States, 332 U.S. 371, 373, 68 S.Ct. 5, 92 L.Ed. 3 (1947). See Billings v. United States, 232 U.S. 261, 284-288, 34 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed. 596 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In United States v. United Drill &amp; Tool Corp., 87 U.S.App.D.C. 236, 183 F.2d 998, 999 (1950), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-15\">\u201cStatutory obligations may bear interest even though the statute makes no provision for it. Interest on such obligations is or is not payable depending upon the purpose of the statutory enactment and upon principles of equity. If the obligation is in the nature of a debt it is deemed interest-bearing, because the statutory purpose was to create a debtor-creditor relationship and in 'equity interest is allowed as a means of compensating a creditor for loss of use of his money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">Applying these principles to the present case, it is clear that from the date of Vannoy\u2019s wrongful discharge petitioner and Vannoy stood in a debtor-creditor relationship. Cf. Nathanson v. N. L. R. B., 344 U.S. 25, 73 S.Ct. 80, 97 L.Ed. 23 (1952). As a result of petitioner\u2019s wrongful conduct, Vannoy lost the use of his salary during this period. It was entirely appropriate for the Board to award interest to compensate Vannoy for this loss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that the Board has not heretofore seen fit to exercise its authority in this manner is immaterial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>See N. L. R. B. v. A. P. W. Prods. Co., 316 F.2d 899 (2d Cir., 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The petition for review is dismissed, and the Board\u2019s request for enforcement of its order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-13\">. \u201cIt shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">\u201c(1) to interfere with, restrain, or co-. erce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">\u201c(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AD6\">29 U.S.O. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b859-11\">.

In the present case, the questioning took place prior to the Teamster\u2019s claim of majority status, and sought information useful only for discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b859-16\">. Although taken alone, these remarks might not violate the Act, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c), they are a part of \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the interrogation [which] must be considered in determining whether it had a coercive flavor.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Cousins Associates, Inc., 283 F.2d 242, 243 (2d Cir., 1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\">. These warnings, themselves obviously unfair labor practices (see e. g., Commercial Controls Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 258 F.2d 102 (2d Cir., 1958)), were established by the uncontradicted testimony of Vannoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Petitioner contends that Vannoy\u2019s testimony was the product of an \u201cimproper suggestion\u201d by counsel for Local 1205 during a recess in the hearings, and that the conversations occurred at times other than those set forth in the bill of particulars supplied by the General Counsel. It urges that this testimony was therefore improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">The record reveals that during the recess which followed the completion of Vannoy\u2019s direct testimony, counsel for Local 1205 showed Vannoy a letter written by Vannoy to the Board, which according to Vannoy\u2019s subsequent testimony, \u201cbrought [the conversations] back to mind.\u201d While we cannot condone counsel\u2019s <em>eat curia </em>conversation with a witness who was still under oath, we cannot say the the Trial Examiner was required to find that Vannoy\u2019s testimony was the product of counsel\u2019s suggestion rather than Vannoy\u2019s independent refreshed recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">Petitioner\u2019s argument based on the bill of particulars is without merit. It appears that the General Counsel was not aware of these conversations when the bill was drafted. The Hearing Examiner permitted the bill to be amended to conform to the proof, and afforded petitioner a continuance of six days in which to prepare a rebuttal, but petitioner did not avail itself of this opportunity, nor did it attempt to recall Vannoy for further cross-examination. It is therefore in no position to claim prejudice as a result of Vannoy\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\">. E. R.
