The Board found that Local 355 violated Sections 8 (b) (1) (A) and 8(b) (2) of the Act by virtue of its participation in the above activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">The evidentiary facts of the case, as fully set out in the Trial Examiner\u2019s report and in the decision and order of the Board, 137 NLRB No. 19, are not in dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the Company concedes that the Board's order must be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>forced if Anthony Bartholdi, an employee of respondent Fiore who solicited Local 355 designation cards from a majority of the Company\u2019s employees, was acting as an agent of the Company when he did so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The Board relied upon the following facts to establish Bartholdi\u2019s agency. On June 9, 1961, the Seafarers International Union (S.I.U.) filed a petition with the Board to be designated as the collective bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s employees. Bartholdi, a non-supervisory employee who was the son-in-law of the Company\u2019s president, Ferdinand Fiore, explained his refusal to sign an S.I.U. card on the ground that the union would tell Fiore \u201chow to run the business, after he had been running it 35 or 40 years by himself.\u201d When the S.I.U. subsequently withdrew its petition, Fiore stated that the withdrawal gave the Company the opportunity to \u201cbring in\u201d Local 355. Bartholdi thereafter solicited Local 355 authorization cards during his scheduled work time, and in the course of his solicitation told an employee that the \u201cCompany\u201d was \u201cgoing union.\u201d A supervisory employee of the respondent Company arranged a meeting between Bartholdi and another employee, apparently in order to afford Bartholdi the opportunity to solicit the employee for membership in Local 355. The employee benefits which Bartholdi promised from Local 355 membership were essentially the same benefits that were set forth in the contract subsequently entered into by that Union and the Company. The contract was executed by employer and union within some two days of the time that Bartholdi had signed up an apparent majority of the employees for union membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Upon these uncontested facts we cannot say that the Board\u2019s finding of an agency relationship between Bartholdi and respondent was not supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-18\">. Although the Company has questioned the jurisdiction of the Board below, our jurisdiction, and that of the Board, is clear. N. L. R. B. v.

The allegedly unfair labor prac\u00fcces occurred in New York City, where the Company is engaged in the business of selling, servicing and installing heating equipment and in distributing coal and oil supplies to individual homeowners and businesses. The Company annually purchases and causes to bo delivered to its Staten Island plant from states other than New York, coal, oil and other goods valued in excess of $50,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ani\">.
