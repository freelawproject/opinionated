Commercial Acceptance Co., 1929, 128 Me. 139, 145 A. 900, is the court\u2019s statement in that case that the agreement, there \u201crelated to the title to a very similar, but none the less a very different, automobile.\u201d Inspection of the record in-the Pinkham case however, discloses that-there was no finding below that there-was in fact an actual car bearing this-other number. We must take the court\u2019s statement as meaning that a creditor could well assume that there was such another car. The referee made the same finding in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-29\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.
