Thereafter, and without hearing, the Air Force issued an \u201cundesirable discharge.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant subsequently requested and received a hearing at which he was represented by counsel and in which the discharge was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">Appellant contends that due process required a hearing <em>prior </em>to discharge. In the context of this case, at least, we think not, since appellant makes no claim that he was prejudiced by the fact that his hearing was held subsequent to discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Appellant also challenges the validity of his guilty plea in the civilian court, upon which his undesirable dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>charge was predicated. He claims that it was not made \u201cunderstandingly,\u201d because he was not informed of all the consequences of the plea including the likelihood of an undesirable disehai'ge. But an Air Force discharge proceeding is not the proper place for such an attack. Moreover', we are aware of no authority holding that a plea of guilty is \u201cunderstandingly\u201d made only if the defendant is informed of all the possible non-criminal consequences which may flow from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Appellant\u2019s other claims of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\">. A.F.R. 39-22, Sept. 23, 1953, states that \u201cthe general policy will be to discharge an airman with an undesirable discharge under this Regulation where the airman has been convicted by a civil court of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-15\">. Appellant says that counsel and voluntary witnesses are obtainable at Government expense in pre-discharge hearings but not in post-discharge hearings. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this is so, we need not decide whether this would require a pre-discharge hearing since appellant was, in fact, represented by counsel at his post-discharge hearing, and he does not claim that he was prejudiced by any difficulty in obtaining witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
