The administrative proceeding resulted in the cease and desist order at bar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The sale to Kroger involved about 117,-000 pounds of Old Hickory \u201csmoked picnics,\u201d cured pork products, at 29\u00ab5 per pound to be delivered on order during Kroger\u2019s 75th Anniversary Sale April 23 through May 3, 1958. In addition, Kroger agreed to buy 250,000 pounds of other meat during that period, at prevailing prices. And during the same period Swift sold \u201cpicnics\u201d of the same brand to various competitors of Kroger in the Nashville area at a price of from 9%^ to <em>AAf </em>per pound higher than the price to Kroger. The Kroger stores sold' the \u201cpicnics\u201d at retail for the cost price, of 29f.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">The order rests upon the conclusion that the facts established a violation of \u00a7 202(a) in Swift\u2019s <em>\u201cunfair </em>and <em>unjustly </em>discriminatory practice or device;\u201d and a violation of \u00a7 202(b) in Swift\u2019s <em>\u201cundue-ox unreasonable </em>preference or advantage-to Kroger and an <em>undue </em>or <em>unreasonable-</em>prejudice or disadvantage to Kroger\u2019s competitors.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Judicial Officer concluded that there was no evidence that Swift\u2019s discrimination was good faith meeting of competition and that there was no economic justification for the discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">The question is whether the findings- and conclusions of the Judicial Officer-are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and whether the-order of the Officer is authorized by law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e), Berigan v. United States, 257 F.2d 852, 855 (8th Cir., 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The Judicial Officer decided that proof of injury to competition, as required by \u00a7 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a), was unnecessary to establish the violation charged. We need not decide whether that conclusion is correct. If there is substantial evidence of injury to competition,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the point is academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">There is substantial evidence of that injury, as shown by these facts and inferences : Kroger\u2019s independent competitors closely followed weekly ads of Kroger and other large grocery chains and tried to meet the advertised prices. An independent refused to buy \u201cpicnics\u201d from Swift at the higher prices because, had he done so, he would have been unable to compete with Kroger in the resale. The price to Kroger discouraged retail buying from the independents and \u201cwould\u201d reduce their sales. The purpose of the anniversary sale was to keep \u201ctraffic\u201d moving through the Kroger stores and to \u201cobtain business\u201d from other stores, and although the business of the independents was \u201cnormal\u201d during the anniversary sale of Kroger, as Swift admits in its brief in this court, the Kroger stores had a \u201ctremendous increase\u201d in business during the same period. The special sale by Kroger was on the first weekend of the month at pay day time and the independents\u2019 gross would and should have been above the normal weeks or weekends. But it was not. None of the independents could meet Kroger\u2019s price of 29^ per pound when their cost from Swift was to 14^ more than it was to Kroger. There was damage to the good will of the independents.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> The evidence of the independents cannot be rejected as non-expert opinion. Bratt v. Western Air Lines, 155 F.2d 850, 166 A.L.R. 1061 (10th Cir., 1946), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 735, 67 S.Ct. 100, 91 L.Ed. 635. The \u201copinion rule\u201d does not apply to the administrative process. \u00a7 7(c), Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006(c), Davis, Administrative Law Text, Evidence, \u00a7 14.13 (1959 ed.). The question was not \u201cwhether the witness was qualified to testify but, rather, what weight was to be given to his testimony. And with that we are not concerned.\u201d Keller v. Federal Trade Commission, 132 F.2d 59, 61 (7th Cir., 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Because of the Government\u2019s evidence, there is no merit in Swift\u2019s argument that the Judicial Officer inferred, from the price differential alone, that there was injury to competition. Furthermore, as the Court said in Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 46-47, 68 S.Ct. 822, 828-829, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (1948): \u201cHere the Commission found what would appear to be obvious, that the competitive opportunities of certain merchants were injured when they had to pay respondent substantially more for their goods than their competitors had to pay.\u201d There was substantial evidence to support the findings of the Judicial Officer, Berigan v. United States, 257 F.2d 852 (8th Cir., 1958), Hyatt v. United States, 276 F.2d 308, 312 (10th Cir., 1960), and his conclusion that there was a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 202 (a) and (b) of the Packers and Stockyards Act was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Swift contends its \u201csingle sale lasting only three days on a single item\u201d was not a violation under a reasonable interpretation of the Act. In support of its contention it cites Muller &amp; Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 142 F.2d 511, 519 (6th Cir., 1944). There an entire course of conduct was at issue and what the court said about specific acts has no relevancy here. In this case we are dealing with an Act of Congress making it a violation to \u201c(a) * * * <em>use any unfair, </em>unjustly discriminatory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>or deceptive * * * device * * *; or (b) Make or give * * * <em>my </em>undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person * * * in <em>any respect whatsoever.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We think the broad language \u201cany\u201d and \u201cin any respect whatsoever\u201d covers the single sale of 117,000 pounds of \u201cpicnics\u201d to Kroger during the period April 23 to May 3. Wilson <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Benson, 286 F.2d 891 (7th Cir., 1961). The fact that the independents here are small businessmen, Klor\u2019s v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 213, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959), has no bearing on the antitrust principle which inspires the Act in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We see no merit in the contention that the order should \u201cinclude expressly all of the defenses permitted by the Robinson-Patman Act.\u201d The cease and desist order is based on Swift\u2019s unlawful conduct with Kroger and is directed against any repetition of it. The Judicial Officer may not exclude expressly or by implication defenses to which Swift is entitled under the Act. An omission to include them does not exclude them. The Judicial Officer need not anticipate defenses that may be available to Swift in the event charges are made against it in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As to the geographical and product scope of the order, we, as this court in Wilson &amp; Co. v. Benson, 286 F.2d 891 (7th Cir., 1961), might be \u201cbetter pleased\u201d if the order were more narrowly drawn. Swift <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Benson, 308 F.2d 849 (7th Cir., 1962). But, as in that case, we are reluctant to interfere with the exercise of the Secretary\u2019s action since the order has \u201ca \u2018reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist\u2019.\u201d Federal Trade Commission v. National Lead Co., 352 U.S. 419, 429, 77 S.Ct. 502, 509, 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957). The order is directed at the unlawful conduct of which Swift has been found guilty, and is tailored \u201cto meet the legitimate needs of the case.\u201d Federal Trade Commission v. Henry Broch &amp; Co., 368 U.S. 360, 366, 82 S.Ct. 431, 435, 7 L.Ed.2d 353 (1962). We conclude that the order is authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">For the reasons given, the petition to set aside the order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-10\">. The Judicial Officer acted for the Secretary of Agriculture. The Department proceeded pursuant to \u00a7 203, Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 193.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\">. \u00a7 202, Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 192, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any packer * * * to: (a) Engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice or device in commerce; or (b) Make or give, in commerce, any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or locality in any respect whatsoever, or subject, in commerce, any particular person or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\">The prohibitory provisions of \u00a7 202 were amended in 1958 (72 Stat. 1749), but the transactions in this case took place prior to the 1958 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-18\">.
