Our review of the record indicates that there was sufficient evidence on each of the elements of the crimes charged to warrant a jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-31\">Appellant also challenges the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury and sentencing procedure. These points were not raised below, and the alleged errors do not warrant invocation of Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-32\">With respect to other matters raised by appellant, we find no errors affecting substantial rights.
