That this is sufficient to support the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 10(a) is now settled by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Reliance Fuel Oil Corp., 371 U.S. 224 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"> Petitioner makes three other arguments. The first is that, even though the jurisdictional question had already been determined in the representational proceeding, it should have been relitigated in the unfair labor practice proceeding because the jurisdictional facts had become \u201cstale.\u201d But petitioner offered no proof of changed circumstances affecting the amount of its annual purchases of petroleum products from outside the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Absent such an offer, we are aware of no authority requiring the Board to relitigate the issue. See National Carbon Company, 110 NLRB 2184 (1954); The Texas Pipe Line Company, 129 NLRB 705 (1960); cf. American Broadcasting Company, etc., 134 NLRB 1458 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Next, petitioner argues that its employees are agricultural laborers within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) of the Act and are therefore excluded from the Act\u2019s coverage. We think, however, that the record supports the Board\u2019s contrary determination. Farmers Reservoir &amp; Irrigation Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755 (1949); Lucas County Farm Coop. Ass\u2019n v. National Labor Relations Board, 289 F.2d 844 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 823 (1961); National Labor Relations Board v. Central Oklahoma Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, 285 F.2d 495 (10th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Finally, we find no merit in petitioner\u2019s claim that the Board abused its discretion in determining the appropriate bargaining unit. The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">. Section. 10(a) of the Act empowers the Board \u201cto prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice [listed in \u00a7 8] affecting commerce.\u201d \u201cCommerce\u201d is defined in \u00a7 2(6) as \u201ctrade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the * * * States</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">* * and \u00a7 2(7) states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cThe term \u2018affecting commerce\u2019 means in commerce, or burdening or obstructing commerce or'the free flow of commerce, or having led or tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-24\">. The \u201cnewly discovered\u201d fact that both petitioner and its supplier take delivery and make delivery within Ohio is irrelevant since the products nevertheless continue to come from without Ohio.
