The district court entered partial summary judgment dismissing under the statute of frauds so much of the complaint as was based on breach of contract, and invoked Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) to permit plaintiff an immediate appeal. With regard to that portion of the judgment dismissing, in part, appellant\u2019s claim against Alfred Duhrssen, we hold that Rule 54(b) is inapplicable, and that the appeal must be dismissed as premature. The judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s claim against Commercial Decal, Inc. is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The individual defendant, Alfred Duhrssen, is president and owner of a substantial portion of the stock of the \u25a0defendant corporation. The plaintiff alleged that in August 1958, its secretary-treasurer, Alfred H. Sachs, proposed to Duhrssen a plan for the reorganization of the corporate defendant for the mutual benefit of both parties. Memoranda containing proposals and counter-proposals were exchanged, but no agreement was</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">ever reduced to writing. Plaintiff claims, however, that on September 24, 1958, the parties entered into an oral agreement, which it characterizes as a \u201cjoint venture agreement\u201d. Briefly stated, the purpose of the agreement was to form a new corporation which would acquire, for about one-third of their value, certain assets (not including realty) from Commercial Decal and would continue its business, lease its buildings and improvements for five years, and employ Duhrssen as president and general manager for a period of approximately four years at a fixed salary plus a share of the profits. The stock of the new corporation was to be held exclusively by plaintiff. The agreement was to be reduced to writing within a month.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">When the arrangements failed to materialize, plaintiff filed this action. Having three theories of recovery, plaintiff drafted its complaint in terms of three \u201ccauses of action.\u201d The first alleges breach of the agreement by both defendants. The second alleges breach by Duhrssen only of his promise to procure the consent of Commercial Decal\u2019s stockholders and directors to the agreement. The third alleges that Duhrssen misrepresented the extent of his ownership and control of the stock of Commercial Decal, and thus his ability to obtain consent of Commercial\u2019s stockholders to the venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-18\">On motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed the first and second \u201ccauses of action\u201d under the statute of frauds, thereby disposing of plaintiff\u2019s entire claim against the corporate defendant, and two of its three theories of Duhrssen\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court determined that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay in the entry of final judgment on this order,\u201d and <em>entered </em>judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-19\"> Although the problem has not been raised by either party, we are faced at the outset with the jurisdictional question of whether Rule 54(b) was properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>invoked. If there had been no certification we would have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order granting partial summary judgment. United States for Use and Benefit of Charles R. Joyce &amp; Son, Inc. v. F. A. Baehner, Inc., 309 F.2d 154 (2d Cir. 1962); see Audi Vision Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., 136 F.2d 621, 147 A.L.R. 574 (2d Cir. 1943). Where the district court issues a certificate, we have no jurisdiction unless the district court had power to do so, Schwartz v. Eaton, 264 F.2d 195 (2d Cir. 1959), and the district court\u2019s determination that it had such power is not binding upon us. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Rule 54(b) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action * * or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">As multiple parties were here involved, and the judgment appealed from wholly terminated appellant\u2019s action against one of them (the corporate defendant), that much of the judgment is properly before us. See Notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules (1961), following 28 U.S.C.A. Rule 54 (Supp. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">But appellant\u2019s action as against Duhrssen is in a different posture. The judgment appealed from left part of this matter pending. As respects multiple claims against a single defendant, Rule 54(b) may be invoked only when there is more than one \u201cclaim for relief\u201d and at least one of those claims has been finally determined. In Original Ballet Russe, Ltd. v. Ballet Theatre, Inc., 133 F.2d 187, 189 (2d Cir. 1943), we defined the term \u201cclaim\u201d, as used in the Federal Rules, to denote \u201cthe aggregate of operative facts which give rise to a right enforceable in the courts.\u201d This definition has often been applied in eases reaching us under Rule 54(b). See, e. g. Cott Beverage Corp. v. Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., 243 F.2d 795 (2d Cir. 1957); Leonidakas v. International Telecom Corp., 208 F.2d 934 (2d Cir. 1953). In the present case the three \u201ccauses of action\u201d in the complaint presented merely three different theories of recovery against Duhrssen for his failure to carry out the alleged agreement of September 24, 1958. Our language in Schwartz v. Eaton, 264 F.2d 195, 196 (2d Cir. 1959), is fully applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">\u201c[A] 11 of the facts on which plaintiff relies constitute but a single transaction composed of a closely related series of occurrences. F.R. 54(b), which gives the district court the power to enter a final judgment covering only a part of the litigation before it, is applicable by its terms only to separate and distinct <em>claims. </em>It is * * * thoroughly settled that such a claim is a set of facts giving rise to one or more legal rights, and that F.R. 54(b) cannot be used to appeal a part of a single claim or, as here, to test a single legal theory of recovery * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">That plaintiff cast its pleadings in terms of three \u201ccauses of action\u201d is immaterial. Cott Beverage Corp. v. Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., supra. We conclude that Rule 54(b) was inapplicable and the order, in effect striking two of appellant\u2019s three theories of recovery against Duhrssen, was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d. Therefore this part of the appeal must be dismissed as premature. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; Charles R. Joyce &amp; Son, Inc. v. F. A. Baehner, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">Turning to the merits of appellant\u2019s action as against the corporate defendant, we agree with the district court that the alleged agreement is squarely within the statute of frauds, and therefore unenforceable. The agreement to sell the assets of Commercial Decal, Inc. comes within New York Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>sonal Property Law \u00a7 85.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The alleged promise to convey to the new corporation a five year lease to Commercial Decal\u2019s corporate realty comes within New York Real Property Law \u00a7 259.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The agreement that Duhrssen would be employed for over four years by the new corporation comes within New York Personal Property Law \u00a7 31(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">But appellant urges that the agreement alleged is a \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement, and cites such decisions as Dayvault v. Baruch Oil Corp., 211 F.2d <em>335 </em>(10th Cir. 1954), Weisner v. Benenson, 275 App.Div. 324, 89 N.Y.S.2d 331 (1st Dept. 1949), aff\u2019d, 300 N.Y. 669, 91 N.E.2d 325 (1950), and Cohen v. Bass, 138 App.Div. 504, 123 N.Y.S. 395 (2d Dept. 1910) for the proposition that the statute of frauds does not apply to such agreements. Passing the dubious question of whether the alleged agreement constituted a joint venture (see Weisner v. Benenson, supra), it is clear that the principle of the cases cited applies only to joint ventures to make purchases from or transact business with <em>third parties. </em>In such situations it is held that the fact that the agreement contemplates future purchases by the venturers from third parties does not bring it within the statute of frauds. Dayvault v. Baruch Oil Corp., supra, 211 F.2d at 339, and eases there cited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the label \u201cjoint venture\u201d will not remove the bar of the statute when, as here, the very essence of the asserted venture is a sale from one \u201cventurer\u201d to the other. See Murnane v. Maxson Electronics Corp., 221 N.Y.S.2d 1015, 1017 (Sup.Ct. Suffolk County 1961). Professor Corbin, in discussing application of the statute of frauds to joint ventures in realty, states-the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-15\">\u201cA contract between two persons to go into the business of buying and selling real estate as partners or as joint adventurers, sharing the profits and losses thereof, is not within section 4 <em>unless there is a provision for the transfer of specific land from-one party to the other. </em>* * * The fact that the contract is one for a land partnership or for a division of profits and losses does not take it out of the statute of frauds if there is a provision that requires a transfer of land from one of the contracting parties to another. The latter provision falls squarely within the statute and makes the entire oral contract unenforceable. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">2 Corbin, Contracts 418-19, 422-23 (1950) (emphasis supplied), (footnotes omitted), citing Levy v. Brush, 45 N.Y. 589 (1871). See also Rizika v. Kowalsky, 207 Misc. 254, 138 N.Y.S.2d 711 (Sup. Ct. Oneida County 1954), aff\u2019d, 285 App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Div. 1009, 139 N.Y.S.2d 299 (4th Dept. 1955). Any other rule would, of course, virtually emasculate the statute in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Alternately, appellant urges that the agreement it seeks to enforce is not that which we have described, but rather that its claim is for breach of defendant\u2019s alleged oral promise to reduce the alleged \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement to writing within 30 days. The law is well settled that an oral agreement to execute an agreement that is within the statute of frauds is itself within the statute, and unenforceable. Belmar Contracting Co. v. State, 233 N.Y. 189, 194, 135 N.E. 240, 241 (1922); Deutsch v. Textile Waste Merchandising Co., 212 App.Div. 681, 209 N.Y.S. 388 (1st Dept. 1925); McLachlin v. Village of Whitehall, 114 App.Div. 315, 99 N.Y.S. 721 (3d Dept. 1906).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Appellant\u2019s other points are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Affirmed in part, dismissed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\"><em>. </em>The terms <em>and </em>purposes of the alleged agreement are more fully set forth in the opinion of the district court. 208 F.Supp. 687 (S.D.N.Y.1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b412-20\">.
