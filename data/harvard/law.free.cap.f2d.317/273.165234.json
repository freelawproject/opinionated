We take jurisdiction as of a final judgment because the result of the ruling is to effectually preclude petitioner from court. Roberts v. United States Dist. Court, 339 U.S. 844, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950), United States ex rel. Morris v. Radio Station WENR, 209 F.2d 105 (7th Cir. 1953), Lipscomb v. United States, 301 F.2d 905 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-30\">Petitioner is a prisoner in the Indiana State Prison. He filed his complaint, to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>gether with his motion, supported by affidavit, asking leave to proceed in forma pauperis. His affidavit in support of the motion states he is without funds or resources with which to pay fees or costs, and that his complaint is not frivolous, and that he believes it to have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The complaint alleges that defendant, an Indiana Circuit Court Judge, deprived petitioner of due process by wrongfully inducing the warden of the penitentiary to prevent him from corresponding with the clerk of the Circuit Court of Clark County with respect to petitioner\u2019s previous conviction in that court; and by misusing and abusing his authority under Indiana law to deprive petitioner of a fair hearing in his coram nobis proceeding to set aside the previous conviction. He alleged that defendant, after disqualifying himself to act in the coram nobis proceeding, obtruded himself in that proceeding; interfered with the trial judge; filed a false affidavit against petitioner, knowing it to be false; and intimidated and discredited the Indiana Public Defender representing petitioner in the proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As exhibits to his complaint, petitioner attached a copy of defendant\u2019s letter to the warden stating that he and the clerk of the Clark County Court were \u201cagitated with\u201d and troubled by petitioner\u2019s requests and demands for copies of the charges against him. The letter expressed appreciation for anything the warden might do in order that \u201cthis situation may be straightened out.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s second exhibit is a copy of the warden\u2019s order stating that, in view of defendant\u2019s letter, \u201cI wish to advise that the above named inmate will not be permitted to correspond * * * \u201d either with the defendant or the clerk. Petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to sue in forma pauperis was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The question is whether the District Court erred in denying the motion to sue in forma pauperis on the ground the action was frivolous or malicious.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">The District Court gave two reasons for denying the motion: defendant\u2019s letter did not suggest or request that petitioner\u2019s \u201clegal pleadings\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> be suppressed ; and defendant, having disqualified himself as judge, could not have been acting under color of law in doing at the coram nobis trial what he is charged with doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">As to the first reason: The warden presumably read defendant\u2019s letter differently than the District Court did. We think a jury could read the letter to mean what the warden read it to mean and find that defendant had thereby denied petitioner access to the courts. These findings would support a verdict for petitioner. Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 290 F.2d 632 (9th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 862, 82 S.Ct. 105, 7 L.Ed.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">And as to the second reason: Defendant as a judge possessed power by virtue of state law which clothed him with authority of state law and made it possible for him to do what he is charged with doing. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1940), Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 111, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1944). He did not, by disqualifying himself,' become any less a judge and without the state authority he had, he could not have been as effective in interfering, as charged, with petitioner\u2019s right to an orderly and fair hearing. If the disqualification rendered him immune from overstepping his authority, \u201cthe words \u2018under color of any law\u2019 were hard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ly apt words to express the idea.\u201d Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 111, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1040 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We are of the opinion that petitioner has stated a cause of action under the Civil Rights Acts. Neither the cases cited nor the reasons asserted in defendant\u2019s brief support the contrary position. We think the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted is erroneous; and that the court abused its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to sue in forma pauperis on the ground that it was frivolous and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">For the reasons given, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-16\">. The action was brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and 42 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">. Petitioner states in his reply brief that defendant\u2019s letter to the warden and the latter\u2019s order prevented him from complying with an order of the court in the coram nobis proceeding that he substantiate his coram nobis petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) provides: \u201cThe court may * * * dismiss the case if * * \u2022 satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-17\">.
