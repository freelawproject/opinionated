The Board found that respondent had violated Section 8 (a) (1) and Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by means of various coercive and discriminatory conduct towards its employees, and further found that respondent violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to bargain in good faith with the Union, which represented a majority of respondent\u2019s employees. Initially, in its petition for enforcement,, the Board asked that its entire order\u2014 embracing all the foregoing asserted violations \u2014 be enforced. Respondent has. since complied with the portion of the order based on the Board\u2019s findings that, it violated Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) of the Act. Consequently, the Board now seeks enforcement of only the Section 8(a) (5) provision of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">The facts germane to this charge areas follows: In May 1960 the Union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> began a campaign to organize respondent\u2019s employees. With varying degrees of intensity, this campaign continued until February 20, 1961. On this date, oneMurdock, the Union\u2019s district representative, telephoned Francis J. Sweeney, respondent\u2019s president, stating that he was. formally notifying him that the Union represented a majority of respondent\u2019s, employees. Murdock offered to prove the. factual basis of this claimed majority, and requested recognition for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>pose of collective bargaining. Sweeney requested that Murdock send him a letter incorporating the substance of their conversation and on that same day, Murdock notified respondent by letter that the Union represented a majority of its employees within the appropriate bargaining unit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The letter again requested a meeting for the purpose of negotiating an agreement covering wages, hours, and other conditions of employment. In this letter, Murdock offered to submit to a mutually agreeable third party evidence \u25a0of the Union\u2019s majority designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">By letter dated February 24, 1961, \u2022signed by president Sweeney, respondent replied to the Union as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\"><em>\u201cIt </em>is the position of Greenfield Components Corporation that unless and until your union has been duly certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the bargaining representative of the employees at our plant, the Company will not meet with your representatives for the purpose of negotiating a contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Respondent has continued to adhere to this position since the sending of the .\u25a0above letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The Board found that on February 20, 1961, the date of the Union\u2019s initial request for recognition and bargaining, there were seventy-nine employees in the \u2022unit, and that on that date the Union had forty-one validly executed authorizations. Under these circumstances, the Board concluded that respondent violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act in refusing the Union\u2019s request to recognize .and bargain with it as the majority representative of its employees except upon -certification by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Although the Board cited no authority in reaching this result, its opinion as well as the Board\u2019s position in this court is apparently predicated on a line of cases of which N. L. R. B. v. Gorbea, Perez &amp; Morell, S. EN C., 300 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1962) and N. L. R. B. v. White-light Prod. Div. of White Metal Rolling &amp; Stamping Corp., 298 F.2d 12 (1st Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 887, 82 S.Ct. 1161, 8 L.Ed.2d 288 are illustrative in this circuit. The thrust of these cases is that a company\u2019s refusal to deal with a union \u2014 except upon an election \u2014 after it has been correctly informed that a majority of its employees had signed union authorization cards, prima facie warrants a violation of Section 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">It is to be noted that in each of the above eases, the record indicates that the Union had authorization cards from a clear cut or substantial majority of the relevant employees, whereas here the majority status of the Union \u2014 even on the Board\u2019s own count \u2014 is of the razor thin variety. As a matter of logic, the more tenuous the majority status of the union, the more reasonable is the inference that the company entertained a good faith doubt as to this status and, consequently, the more reasonable its refusal to meet with the Union except upon certification. However,- in the instant case, the respondent has pitched its defense on the attempt to show that the Union never possessed a <em>de facto </em>majority of its employees on the critical date quite apart from any question as to whether respondent entertained good faith doubts as to the majority status. In respondent\u2019s words, the issue is: \u201cwhether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Union had been validly authorized by a majority of Respondent\u2019s employees in the unit involved to represent them for purposes of collective bargaining.\u201d In short, the case has been argued on the basis that if the Union did possess a factual majority of the respondent\u2019s employees on the critical date, then the Board was correct in sustaining the charge of a refusal to bargain. Conversely, if this factual majority was absent, the Board was wrong in finding a violation of Section 8(a) (5) and (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">It is respondent\u2019s position that the Board in finding that there were seventy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>nine employees in the unit, excluded two individuals whom respondent contends should have been included, while in finding that the Union had been validly designated by forty-one employees, the Board erroneously counted certain authorization cards which \u2014 for various reasons to be cited hereafter \u2014 should not have been counted in determining the question of union majority. We turn to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">One Charlie Jones was excluded from the unit on the ground that he was a \u201csupervisor\u201d within the meaning of the Act and respondent challenges this determination. Jones is a member of respondent\u2019s sealing (furnace) department \u2014a department in which one of respondent\u2019s major production processes is performed. In addition to Jones, eight or nine women worked the evening shift in the sealing department \u2014 with hours from 3 p. m. to 11 p. m. This department is located on the lower floor of respondent\u2019s plant and the record indicates that the plant\u2019s night foreman \u2014 one Erwin Price \u25a0 \u2014 spent relatively little time there. Jones was required to report to work early to receive instructions from the day shift foreman \u2014 one Host \u2014 who normally left the plant at 5 p. m. Host\u2019s conversation with Jones included directions regarding the product to be produced and the employees who should do particular work. Jones, however, had some discretion in the assignment of work and he was responsible for the quantity and quality of production on the evening shift. Jones also transferred production data from the employees\u2019 time slips to Host\u2019s production records, and also was responsible for maintaining production sheets on his samples and re-runs. The record indicates that Jones had authority to transfer an employee from one type of work to another without securing permission from anyone. He disciplined employees who loafed or were quarrelsome, and had authority to permit an employee to leave the plant for cause. Finally, evidence from second shift employees who testified at the hearing was clear that they recognized Jones as their supervisor. And, indeed, there was testimony that respondent\u2019s vice president Sauter told the employees on the second shift who worked in the sealing department that Jones would be in charge nights and that the \u201cgirls would take the orders from him.\u201d Upon a consideration of the record as a whole, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Jones was a supervisor within the meaning of the Act and consequently should have been excluded in any determination of the appropriate bargaining unit. See, N. L. R. B. v. Southern Airways Company, 290 F.2d 519, 523-524 (5th Cir. 1961); cf., N. L. R. B. v. Quincy Steel Cast Co., 200 F.2d 293, 295-296 (1st Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The next employee whose status is questioned by respondent is one Robert Bostley. The Board found that Bostley was a part-time, specialized employee, with no community of interest with the production employees, and that, therefore, he was not a member of the appropriate unit. The record indicates that Bostley was a full-time employee of another company located in the same town as respondent\u2019s plant. Respondent paid him a salary of $15 a week to test the chemical solutions in its plating department after his regular working hours at his principal place of business. Bostley merely reported his findings to the plating room foreman; he performed no other duties for respondent. President Sweeney testified that the salary or fee that was paid Bostley was \u201can inducement for him to keep himself available at our convenience. * * * He is in frequent telephone contact with us and we will call him in and [he] comes by regularly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The record shows that in the twenty-one weeks from January 1 to May 20, 1961, Bostley worked for respondent less than three hours per week during seventeen weeks. In the other four weeks he worked a total of six hours during one week and an aggregate of four hours during the remaining three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>To be sure, the number of hours which a worker puts in on the job will not of itself be decisive of inclusion or \u2022exclusion from a given unit. Cf., N. L. R. B. v. Joclin Mfg. Co., 314 F.2d 627 (2nd Cir. 1963). It is but one factor\u2014 albeit a highly relevant factor \u2014 in the total assessment of whether the individual has that requisite community of interest with other employees in the pertinent unit to warrant his inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Here, Bostley\u2019s status obviously is unique and somewhat hybrid- \u2014 somewhere between a \u201ctechnical\u201d employee as that term is defined in the Act, see, Armour and Company, 119 N.L.R.B. 623 (1957), and that of an independent contractor performing his services as needed \u25a0on an irregular part-time basis, while engaged full time for another employer. Nonetheless, we believe that, in the final analysis, Bostley was cast more in the Tole of the <em>ad hoc </em>specialist than the employee whose continuing and on-going relationship to, and identity with, the mainstream of the appropriate unit warrants his inclusion therein. The Board\u2019s \u2022conclusion that Bostley was not part \u2022of the production unit was reasonable and fully consonant with prior Board \u25a0decisions. See, Armour and Company, supra; United States Gypsum Company, 119 N.L.R.B. 1415 (1958); American Broadcasting Co., 117 N.L.R.B. 13 (1957); Anderson\u2019s Super Service, Inc., 120 N.L.R.B. 583 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> Next, respondent contends that \u25a0eight of the Union\u2019s authorization cards were signed by employees in the early .stages of the Union\u2019s organizational drive \u2014 in May or June 1960 \u2014 and consequently were \u201cstale\u201d in February 1961, when the Union made its demand for \"bargaining. While there is indication that the intensity of the Union\u2019s organizational campaign diminished somewhat during the summer months of 1960, there was substantial evidence that there was no hiatus or lack of continuity in the organizational efforts and we have no hesitation in concluding that the cards .signed in May and June, 1960 were part .and parcel of the same organizational campaign which culminated in the demand for recognition on February 20, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Moreover, the record is barren of evi-. dence that any of the card signers of May and June, 1960 ever informed the Union that they desired to repudiate or revoke their designation of the Union as bargaining agent. As the trial examiner correctly pointed out, this fact distinguishes the present situation from the case of Grand Union Co., 122 N.L. R.B. 589 (1958), relied on by respondent. For, in the Grand Union case, contrary to respondent\u2019s position, it was not the mere passage of time or \u201cstaleness\u201d that was decisive, but the fact that the five employees whose cards were in dispute testified affirmatively at the hearing that they did not want the union to represent them at the time of the second organizational campaign there at issue. Here, none of the employees who had signed cards in the early stages of the organizational campaign repudiated their authorization even though at least two of them were called as witnesses for the General Counsel. In this type of situation, where an employer asserts that a card signed by a worker at an earlier date does not reflect his present intention, we believe that the burden to show this change of mind should properly rest on the employer. Suffice it to say that respondent has made no such showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Finally, respondent asserts that certain of the cards should have been excluded because of evidence that some of the employees did not understand what they were doing when they signed the union cards. However, the cards were entirely devoid of ambiguity and admitted of no misunderstanding. As we have stated previously: \u201cThe employees were not illiterate. There was no claim of affirmative misrepresentation by the union. The Board was justified in accepting the cards at their face value and rejecting the oral testimony that the employees had thought they meant something else.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Gorbea, Perez &amp; Morell, S. EN C., supra, 300 F.2d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we believe that the Board, was correct in determining that, at the time of the request to bargain, the union represented a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit and that respondent\u2019s action in conditioning bargaining on a Board certification was violative of Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board as to the Section 8 (a) (5) provision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-17\">.
