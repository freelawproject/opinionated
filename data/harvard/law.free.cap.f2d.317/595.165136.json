Two psychiatrists testified that appellant was without mental disease, three psychiatrists testified that appellant\u2019s acts were the product of mental disease, and one psychiatrist testified simply that appellant was mentally ill. Thus a jury issue was presented on the issue of criminal responsibility. McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">However, we find error which requires a new trial. Prior to trial appellant, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, was committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital for mental examination. Based on the hospital report of the examination which concluded: \u201cWe find no evidence of mental disease existing at the present time nor on or about December <em>15, 1961,\u201d </em>the court found appellant competent to stand trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, in addition to authorizing hospital commitment to determine mental competence, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-18\">\u201c * * * A fin(jing by the judge that the accused is mentally competent to stand trial shall in no way prejudice the accused in a plea of insanity as a defense to the crime charged; such finding shall not be introduced in evidence on that issue nor otherwise be brought to the notice of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-19\">During the trial, in the presence of the jury, the court, in answer to defense counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s line of cross-examination of a defense psychiatric witness, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUt\">\u201cIt is a fact that the hospital has certified and you have a copy of it, I know, Mr. Arens, that this man is competent to stand trial and there is no mental disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-22\">Immediate motion for mistrial was made and denied. The court, then and later in its charge, instructed the jury to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>regard its statement since \u201cthe standard for legal competency to stand trial and the test of sanity for criminal responsibility are two entirely different and unrelated matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">While it is true generally that a court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard irrelevant information is presumed obeyed, in the peculiar circumstances of this case we cannot with assurance say that the error here was thus made harmless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claim of narcotics addiction as a mental illness was appellant\u2019s principal defense. On this issue the testimony was in conflict and was, therefore, properly submitted to the jury. In this context the court\u2019s well intended and repeated efforts to overcome the effect of the inadvertent reference to competency to stand trial would tend to emphasize <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rather than eradicate what 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 commands the jury must not be told.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-23\">. 68A Stat. 550, as amended, 68 Stat. 1004, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a), and 35 Stat. 614, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\">.
