The Board\u2019s order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is based upon a finding that respondent violated section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by transferring and ultimately discharging three employees, in response to pressure by their fellow employees, because the three had worked behind a picket line.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">During the fall of 1960 and January and February, 1961, respondent was engaged in constructing a tunnel at a location some 65 miles east of Fresno, California. An organization known as the Tunnel and Rock Workers Union of America (TRWA) petitioned the National Labor Relations Board in the fall of 1960 to certify it as bargaining representative of certain employees of the members of Associated General Contractors. Respondent was a member of Associated General Contractors and the petition covered some of its employees. On January 9, 1961, the TRWA struck and picketed respondent\u2019s tunneling job. Local 294 of the International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers Union of America, which at the time represented employees of respondent under a collective bargaining agreement, considered the strike \u201cunauthorized\u201d and permitted its members to cross the picket line. During the strike approximately one-half of respondent\u2019s workers did cross the picket line and continued to work; among those members of Local 294 who worked on the job during the strike were Turner, Andrus and Fisher.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>On January 27, after the strike had ended, Turner, Andrus and Fisher returned to the midnight-to-8 a. m. shift (\u201cgraveyard shift\u201d) on which each had worked prior to the strike. There was no tunnel work on Saturday, January 28, or Sunday, January 29. On Monday, January 30, the work on the day and swing shifts proceeded without incident. Shortly before midnight on January 30, the graveyard shift reported for work. About thirty minutes before the commencement of work, Turner, in order to change into his work clothes went into the change house, where McKenney, Williams, Strope, Fisher and Andrus were getting ready to go to work. An argument then took place between Turner and McKenney. Although there was a conflict in the testimony, the Trial Examiner found that McKenney started the argument; McKenney called Turner a \u201cscab\u201d. Epithets were exchanged between them and after a particularly obscene epithet by Turner, McKenney, who was sitting down and, as found by the Trial Examiner, was very drunk, drew a knife. Turner testified that McKenney advanced toward him, holding the knife in one hand and holding up his pants with the other. Turner, who was closer to the door, turned and went over to the door where a broom was resting, picked it up, and thrust the brush end of the broom into McKenney\u2019s face. The broom broke and Turner retreated toward the door, picked up his lunch bucket, which was resting on the steps leading to the change room, threw the bucket at McKenney and then ran out of the change room.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Costner, respondent\u2019s general superintendent, and Hostetter, the general foreman, arrived on the scene. After being informed that McKenney had been drunk and had drawn a knife, Hostetter, with no further investigation, immediately discharged McKenney. Some of McKenney\u2019s fellow workers later refused to go into the tunnel, stating that Turner should also be fired. After some discussion, Hostetter agreed to go into the tunnel and get Turner out. This was done and the miners went back into the tunnel. Turner was temporarily put to work outside on the \u201cdump\u201d. After Turner had been working on the dump awhile, his ankle started hurting, apparently from twisting it during the altercation with McKenney. Turner reported to the first aid officer who bandaged his ankle and gave him a slip to take to his family doctor. Turner did not return to his work on the \u201cdump\u201d and remained under his doctor\u2019s care until February 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">On February 7, Hostetter and several management officials met with five or six workers at the jobsite to discuss whether Andrus and Fisher (both of whom had been transferred to the \u201csand pile\u201d to work on January 31) could return to their regular work. It was agreed that Andrus and Fisher would return to their regular work that evening. After this had been settled, one of the workers brought up the question as to what would be done about Turner. The workers then took the position that Turner was as much to blame as McKenney for the January 30 fight and that in fairness he also should be fired; apparently no one dissented to the charges that Turner was also responsible for the fight. Project manager Tripp, who had not been present when Hostetter fired McKenney, concluded that the workers\u2019 position was a reasonable one and that Turner should be discharged for his part in the January 30 dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A termination slip was drawn on February 9 for Turner, and Turner was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">The Board found \u201cthat Turner was transferred by respondent from his chuck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>tender job to the dump pile, laid off, and subsequently discharged because of the unlawful pressure brought upon respondent by the Tunnel Workers,\u201d and found further \u201cthat the aforesaid transfer, layoff, and discharge of Turner were violative of section 8(a) (3) of the Act.\u201d We hold that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support these findings. Turner himself admitted that it had never been indicated to him that the miners didn\u2019t want to work with him because he had worked during the strike called by the Tunnel Workers;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor is there any substantial evidence in the record to indicate that this was the reason for his transfer and ultimate discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While it may be that the argument between Turner and McKenney was initially started because of McKenney's feelings concerning Turner\u2019s union activities, the only conclusion supported by substantial evidence in the record is that the other employees refused to continue worldng with Turner because it was felt that he was as much to blame as McKenney and in fairness should also be discharged. In other words, as one employee testified, \u201cIt takes two to make a fight.\u201d The employees agreed that Andrus and Fisher could return to their regular work despite the fact that they both had worked during the strike (as had many of respondent\u2019s employees). Yet they remained adamant in their position that Turner should be discharged. This difference in attitude on the part of the employess could (from the evidence in the record) only stem from their feelings concerning Turner\u2019s participation in the fight. The Board\u2019s finding would appear to be based on mere suspicion, which, as we have previously held, is not sufficiently substantial to support a finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that Turner became <em>persona non grata </em>with the other employees because of conduct unrelated to his union activities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">We now turn to a consideration of the Board\u2019s order as it relates to Andrus and Fisher, both of whom had worked during the strike. They traveled from Fresno for some 65 miles to the jobsite and back to Fresno in Fisher\u2019s car with some others, including Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">On the night of January 30, just prior to McKenney\u2019s argument with Turner, an argument occurred between Fisher and one Vanee in the change house. Vanee claimed that Fisher, on the previous Friday, had tried to run a car in which Vanee was riding \u201cover the mountain.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After making this accusation, Vanee said, \u201cThis week I am going to drive my truck and you just try it with me.\u201d Vanee invited Fisher \u201cto come outside.\u201d Fisher replied that he didn\u2019t want any trouble and had been told by the union not to cause any.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">On the morning of January 31, at the end of the shift, Hostetter told Andrus and Fisher that they were being transferred to the \u201csand trap\u201d (located across the valley from the tunnel) on the next shift,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the reason for the transfer being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>to keep harmony on the crew.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Without notice thereof, neither Andrus nor Fisher went to work the next day and in a telephone conversation between Andrus and Hostetter on that day, Andrus stated that they were not at work because Fisher\u2019s* car had broken down. When they did not arrive at work the next day either, Project Manager Tripp called Andrus\u2019 home and left a message with his wife that he wanted to know when Andrus was coming to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">No word, however, was heard from either Andrus or Fisher until February 5, when they attended a management-union meeting in Fresno.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During that meeting, the union took the position that Andrus and Fisher should be put back to work in the tunnel immediately. The company representatives felt that more time was needed to reconcile the strong feelings that had arisen between the men and no agreement was reached on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">On February 7, Tripp called a meeting of the crew at the jobsite, the object of the meeting being to tell the crew that he wanted to bring Andrus and Fisher back to work on the graveyard shift that night. Tripp testified that he told the men to \u201ckeep their mouths closed except on items of actual prosecution of work.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An agreement was reached that Andrus and Fisher would return to work that evening. After the meeting was over, Tripp telephoned the union headquarters in Fresno and stated that he wanted Andrus and Fisher back that night. He then went to Fresno to see Andrus and Fisher. Tripp testified that he told Andrus and Fisher the same thing that he told the other men, namely, to avoid saying things which would lead to violence. Andrus testified on direct examination that Tripp told them, \u201cThat you go there, anything they tell you, you take; anything they say, you do,\u201d and that they [Andrus and Fisher] refused to go back to work under those conditions. On cross-examination Andrus admitted that as a chuck tender he was to do as the miners told him and also admitted that Tripp had told them that he would look into it if any of the workers called them names when they went back. Fisher testified that Tripp told them to keep their mouths shut when they went back, \u201cthat he had the job going, so that he just wanted it kept quiet, just like it is.\u201d Fisher stated that Tripp may have indicated that he would see to it that the other men kept their \u201cnoses clean.\u201d Both Fisher and Andrus indicated to Tripp that they were concerned over whether it would be safe for them to return to the tunnel, Fisher testifying that he told Tripp that \u201che [Tripp] couldn\u2019t be in the tunnel all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Andrus and Fisher asked 'Tripp to discharge them so that they could receive unemployment insurance. Tripp declined to discharge them because he stated that he had made an agreement that they would go back to work; he also refused to give them reduction in force slips. Tripp told them that if they chose to quit, that would be their own decision. There was testimony to indicate that Tripp at their request did indicate to Andrus and Fisher that he would support their claims, if made, for unemployment compensation. Neither Andrus nor Fisher returned to work again. They subsequently filed claims for unemployment compensation in which they said that they had quit their employment for safety reasons, indicating that their lives had been in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The Board found that respondent, in violation of section 8(a) (1) of the Act, transferred and ultimately constructively discharged Andrus and Fisher in response to unlawful pressure exerted by the Tunnel Workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">There is not substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that the transfer of Andrus and Fisher was motivated by their union activities. Although apparently animosity arose in this case between some persons who had worked during the strike and some who had not, it would appear that the animosity was the product of the specific incidents previously discussed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> About one-half of the entire work force had worked during the strike and yet all of the trouble involved Turner, Andrus, and Fisher. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Tunnel Workers of America were responsible for exerting pressure on petitioner, we can only wonder why it singled out only these three men for special treatment. We feel that the petitioner simply was caught in the middle between two sides of a disagreement. An unsafe situation existed; naturally petitioner also wanted to avoid any disruption of work.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It reasonably concluded that the two factions should be separated temporarily and then made every effort to get Andrus and Fisher back into the tunnel. To order respondent to cease and desist from discouraging membership in Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers, Local 294, and encouraging membership in Tunnel and Rock Workers of America on the evidence in this record would be unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The Board\u2019s finding that Andrus and Fisher were constructively discharged also is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. There was substantial evidence that both sides were equally admonished to avoid arguments and disputes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Andrus\u2019 and Fisher\u2019s admissions upon cross-examination as to what was said by Tripp to them and their subsequent written reasons for not returning to work greatly weakened Andrus\u2019 testimony on direct examination. We hold that Andrus and Fisher voluntarily quit their employment for the very reasons they gave in their claims for unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">We are convinced that \u201con the record considered as a whole\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Board\u2019s findings of fact as to the claimed unfair labor practices are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-9\">. The Board ordered respondent to, <em>inter alia, </em>cease and desist from discouraging membership in Hod Carriers, Building and Construction Laborers, Local 294, and encouraging membership in Tunnel and Bock Workers of America; and to offer to T. J. Turner, Sidney G. Andrus, and Bichard Lee Fisher immediate and full reinstatement to the jobs which each held on January 31, 1961, with payment to each of a sum of money equal to the amount which each would normally have earned as wages from January 31, 1961, to the date of respondent\u2019s offer of reinstatement, less his not earnings, during that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\">. \u201cSec. 8(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">\u201c(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7; *****</p>\n<p id=\"A3Lh\">\u201c(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization:</p>\n<p id=\"AsU\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">\u201cSec. 7.

Although Turner was transferred to the dump and subsequently discharged, there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that he was in fact laid off prior to his discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. See N.L.R.B. v. Citizens News Co., <em>134 </em>F.2d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 1943), in which this court stated that \u201c[T]he fact that a discharged employee may be engaged in labor union activities at the time of his discharge, taken alone, is no evidence at all of a discharge as the result of such activities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b846-15\">.

Williams, who had not crossed the picket line, testified that he did not want Turner to return to work, but \u201cdidn\u2019t care whether they [Andrus and Fisher] worked or not.\u201d This testimony evidences the fact that the animosity was the result of individual differences and not the result of a dispute between the Tunnel Workers of America and Andrus and Fisher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. The Board relies on NLRB v. Star Pub.

In that case, however, Star Publishing Co. made no contention that the transfer there involved was not discriminatory, but sought to justify it solely on the basis of expediency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">.

The substantiality of evidence <em>must take into </em>account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight. This is clearly the significance of the requirement in both statutes that courts consider the whole record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
