Appellant concedes that the books in question were obscene, but contests the sufficiency and propriety of the evidence of his knowing participation in the conspiracy to import them. We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The Government\u2019s principal witness was the defendant John Stamp, a waiter on the Queen Mary, who pleaded guilty prior to the trial. Stamp testified that one John Monk, a fellow waiter, introduced him to two persons in Southampton, England, who, after assurances by Monk that Stamp was \u201call right\u201d, asked Stamp to take some books to New York City to a person named \u201cEddie.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Monk later delivered a package to Stamp aboard the ship, and told him not to take the package directly to \u201cEddie\u201d but to deposit it in a public locker in a designated subway station in New York City. Stamp was then to take the locker key to a certain book store near Times Square, to ask there for \u201cEddie\u201d, and to give \u201cEddie\u201d the key, telling him it was \u201ca present from the boys in England, and John would see him next trip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Stamp opened the package when the Queen Mary docked in New York and found that it contained twelve copies of an obscene book. He was arrested at the pier when he attempted to smuggle in the package. After brief interrogation, Stamp disclosed the details of the plan and agreed to cooperate with customs officials by carrying on as he had been instructed to do but under the surveillance of customs inspectors. The following morning Stamp deposited the package in a subway locker in accordance with his instructions and then proceeded to the book store where he inquired for \u201cEddie\u201d. The clerk of whom he inquired shouted \u201cEddie\u201d several times toward the back of the store. Appellant Mishkin appeared. Stamp said to him, \u201cI have a key here for you, a present from the boys in England. John Monk will see you next trip.\u201d Appellant took the key and answered \u201cokay\u201d or \u201call right\u201d. Stamp then left the store. Appellant showed no surprise at Stamp\u2019s remarks or at his handing him the key. Stamp did not tell appellant the location of the locker. There was no indication of its origin on the key itself, other than the number T184 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Approximately three hours later defendant William Pratt<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> came to the locker, which was under the surveillance of customs inspectors, opened it with a key, and removed the package. Pratt was arrested shortly after leaving the subway station. A notation of appellant\u2019s unpublished home telephone number was found in Pratt\u2019s wallet at the time of his arrest, together with a note to- call \u201cEddie or Frank\u201d at the book store, and the telephone number of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that Stamp\u2019s testimony regarding events following his arrest was inadmissible. He cites the familiar principles that arrest terminates a conspirator\u2019s participation in a conspiracy, and that declarations of a conspirator made after the conspiracy is ended do not bind co-conspirators. See, e. g., Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949). But these principles are wholly inapplicable to the present case. Hearsay statements made after a conspirator\u2019s arrest are inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>not because they were made after the arrest, but because they are hearsay to which the usual exception to the hearsay rule of statements by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy can no longer apply. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 617-618, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953). In the present case, Stamp\u2019s testimony as to the period after his arrest related solely to his own acts and to one conversation with the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This testimony, which was subject to cross-examination, was not hearsay, and was clearly admissible. See United States v. Cohen, 197 F.2d 26, 29 (3d Cir., 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> Appellant next contends that Stamp\u2019s testimony as to the arrangements made in England was inadmissible hearsay. But, since Stamp\u2019s testimony regarding the events following his arrest sufficiently connected Mishkin to the conspiracy, the earlier declarations of his co-conspirators were admissible against him under the familiar principle that declarations made by one conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy are admissible against all co-conspirators. See, e. g., United States v. Lev, 276 F.2d 605, 609 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 363 U.S. 812, 80 S.Ct. 1248, 4 L.Ed.2d 1153 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">But this principle, appellant next argues, does not apply to the notations found on Pratt\u2019s person after his arrest, since the Government did not establish the time when the notations were made, and therefore did not establish that they were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Here appellant overlooks the essential point that for the purpose for which they were admitted, viz., the connection of Pratt with Mishkin, the notations were not hearsay. They were admitted not to prove Mishkin\u2019s telephone number and connection with the bookstore, but as part of the proof that Pratt had received the key to the subway locker from Mishkin. See VI Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1788 (3d Ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Appellant argues that even if all the evidence was properly admitted, it was insufficient to sustain the conviction because Mishkin\u2019s knowledge of the obscene character of the books was not proved. As scienter is a necessary element of the substantive crime of importing obscene matter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462; cf. Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959), it is also a necessary element for conviction of conspiracy to commit the substantive offense. Cf. United States v. Massiah, 307 F.2d 62 (2d Cir., 1962). But in proving scienter, \u201ceyewitness testimony of a bookseller\u2019s perusal of a book\u201d is unnecessary. \u201cThe circumstances may warrant the inference that he was aware of what a book contained, despite his denial.\u201d Smith v. California, supra, 361 U. S. at 154, 80 S.Ct. at 219 (1959). See also Kahm v. United States, 300 F.2d 78, 86-87 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 369 U.S. 859, 82 S.Ct. 949, 8 L.Ed.2d 18 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">In the present case, the obscene character of the books is conceded. They were to be delivered to Mishkin by depositing them in a subway locker, and delivering the key to Mishkin. When presented with the key, Mishkin manifested no surprise, and agreed that the source of the books, John Monk, should see him \u201cnext trip.\u201d He did not ask where the locker was located, but Pratt, carrying notations relating to Mishkin, including his unlisted telephone number, nonetheless arrived at the locker and removed the books some three hours later. From the clandestine manner in which the delivery to Mishkin was to be effected, and from Mishkin\u2019s apparent familiarity with the scheme, the jury could properly infer that he was aware of the obscene nature of the matter to be delivered. While Mishkin may not have known the exact title or contents of the books, the Government was not required to show his familiarity with every detail of the conspiracy once his knowledge of its general purpose had been shown. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>United States v. Agueci, 310 F.2d 817, 825 (2d Cir., 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\">A final point deserves mention. At the trial, the defendant \u201cconceded\u201d that the books were obscene and urged that by virtue of the concession, it was unnecessary and prejudicial to admit the books in evidence and to submit them to the jury. The court ruled that the books would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The principles stated in Parr v. United States, 255 F.2d 86, 88 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 358 U.S. 824, 79 S.Ct. 40, 3 L.Ed.2d 64 (1958), amply support the ruling of the trial Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cThe Government was permitted to exhibit to the jury some of the film over the appellant\u2019s objection and offer to stipulate that the film was lewd and obscene. This, the appellant says, would tend to arouse the sympathies and prejudices of the jury, so that the admission of the evidence was an error prejudicing his right to a fair and impartial trial. The admission would, to be sure, relieve the Government of its burden of proving the lewd and obscene character of the film. But it does not necessarily follow that the film should have been excluded from the view of the jury. It is a general rule that \u2018A party is not required to accept a judicial admission of his adversary, but may insist on proving the fact.\u2019 31 C.J.S. Evidence \u00a7 299, p. 1068. The reason for the rule is to permit a party \u2018to present to the jury a picture of the events relied upon. To substitute for such a picture a naked admission might have the effect to rob the evidence of much of its fair and legitimate weight.\u2019 Dunning v. Maine Central Railroad Co., 91 Me. 87, 39 A. 352, 356, 64 Am.St.Rep. 208. Such rule, we think, should apply in a case such as this where the pictures offered in evidence are of the gist of the offense charged rather than descriptive or illustrative of a scene or an occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">While there is some merit also in the contrary view, the question of admissibility was addressed to the sound discretion of the district court. We cannot say that that discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Appellant\u2019s remaining points are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">The indictment also included a count charging a substantive violation of 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 1462, on which the jury returned a verdict of acquittal, and two counts charging substantive and conspiracy violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465, which were dismissed with the Government\u2019s consent at the close of its case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-28\">. \u201cImportation or transportation of obscene matters</p>\n<p id=\"b707-29\">\u201cWhoever brings into the United States * * * or knowingly uses any express company or other common carrier, for carriage in interstate or foreign commerce\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b707-31\">\u201c(a) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy books, pamphlet, picture, motion-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character; \u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, for the first such offense and shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, for each such offense thereafter.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\">.
