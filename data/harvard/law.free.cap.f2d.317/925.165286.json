Concluding, however, that the trial court\u2019s determination that the watches in question were \u201csold at retail,\u201d is soundly based and accords with the law and Treasury regulations, we affirm the judgment of the-trial court by adopting its opinion which is published at D.C., 199 F.Supp. 353..</p>\n<p id=\"b997-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
