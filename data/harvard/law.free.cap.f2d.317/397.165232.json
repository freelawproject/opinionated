No. 44,-276, January 20, 1958, claiming first use of the mark on October 14, 1957. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissed the opposition, 132 USPQ 565 and 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Applicant-appellee seeks to register the above mark \u201cfor Electron Guns for Television Tubes and Other Electronic Devices and for the No. 1 Grid for Such Tubes and Devices.\u201d The word \u201cgrid\u201d is the name of one of the articles enumerated in the application and by amendment applicant inserted the following disclaimer: \u201cThe word \u2018GRID\u2019 is disclaimed apart from the mark as shown.\u201d The \u201cNo. 1 Grid\u201d is, furthermore, an element of the electron gun, also enumerated. The word \u201cGRID\u201d in the mark sought to be registered is, therefore, purely descriptive of the enumerated goods and without trademark significance. The specimen filed with the application is a label showing a drawing of the goods across the top of which are the words, \u201cLOOK FOR THE GRID WITH THE LID\u201d and beneath which is the mark \u201cTHE GOLDEN GRID.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Neither party took testimony. Both parties filed stipulations of facts with exhibits and applicant noticed certain material under Patent Office Rule 1.282 (as authorized by Trademark Rule 2.123 (c)). Thus there is no issue as to any fact. We have before us only questions of law and the basic issue is likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception under section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1052(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Applicant\u2019s stipulation states, inter alia,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">\u201c3. Applicant makes electron guns for television picture tubes and cathode ray tubes and the No. 1 grid for such guns, and it sells such items to the manufacturers of products which embody such products as components.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">With respect to the use of the mark sought to be registered on such products, the application states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">\u201cThe mark is used by applying it to the box in which the grids or electron guns are packed singly or in multiple and is eventually applied to the finished television tube or other electronic device by applying a label as included herewith to the surface of the enclosing envelope of the tube; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">The \u201clabel as included herewith\u201d we take to be the specimen label.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">Notwithstanding the designation of the mark in its application, appellee argues the case on the basis that the mark is \u201cGOLDEN GRID,\u201d ignoring the \u201cTHE,\u201d which is indeed of trifling importance. This leaves the word \u201cGOLDEN\u201d as the only part of the total mark having trademark significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">Opposer-appellant, stipulated to be a manufacturer and vendor of radio and television receivers, phonographs, two-way radio systems, microwave relay systems, and parts for all of the foregoing including vacuum tubes of all kinds and TV picture tubes, is admittedly the prior user and registrant of a series of \u201cGolden\u201d marks therefor including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-19\">GOLDEN VOICE, Reg. No. 513,988, for radio receivers, since 1935 and Reg. No. 685,813, for loudspeakers, since 1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-20\">Golden View, Reg. No. 513,987, for television receivers, since 1947.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">GOLDEN BEAM, Reg. No. 535,305, for radio antennas, since 1948.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-21\">Golden Heart (unregistered) for transistors, since 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-22\">GOLDEN M, Reg. No. 685,815, for vacuum tubes and for television receiver chassis, since July 1957.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7b\">GOLDEN SATELLITE, Reg. No. 685,815, for vacuum tubes and tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>vision receiver chassis, since July 1957.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In registrations Nos. 513,988, 513,987 and 535,305 the words \u201cVOICE,\u201d \u201cView,\u201d and \u201cBEAM,\u201d respectively, are disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Opposer also has five other \u201cGolden\u201d marks as a result of its own use which commenced <em>later </em>than applicant\u2019s use and during the pendency of this proceeding acquired three more by assignment, which it is now using. We find it unnecessary to consider specifically these eight marks for they do no more than to augment a picture sufficiently shown by the marks of opposer in prior use.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Opposer and applicant are obviously in the same general field of business, i. e., electrical and electronic manufactures and parts therefor, and what one sells might very well be supposed to have its origin with the other when sold under a mark so similar as to be likely to cause confusion. Opposer\u2019s business in this field has been substantial, the stipulation showing that it sells through 98 distributors who sell, in turn, to more than 23,000 retailers and about 25,000 service and repair organizations. We quote two paragraphs of the stipulation on volume of sales and cost of advertising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201c20. The value of products sold by Opposer since 1935, in connection with which one or more of its trademarks having \u201cGOLDEN\u201d as a component thereof was used, is in excess of $230,000,000; and more than $12,-000,000 have been spent in advertising such products under the said trademarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201c21. The value of replacement parts and components, many of which are identified by one of Opposer\u2019s trademarks having \u201cGOLDEN\u201d as a component thereof, sold by Op-poser averages about $3,000,000 annually.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">While it is true, as appellee says, that the record is silent on apportionment of the above sales and advertising to the periods before and after appellee\u2019s entry into the field in October 1957, considering that the former period is 22 years and the latter period a little over 2 years, we think this failure is of no moment. Sales and advertising of goods under marks having \u201cGolden\u201d as a component prior to appellee\u2019s entry into the field must have been very substantial. The exact amount is quite unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">Before appellee\u2019s first use of the mark, opposer was already established in the television receiver field with several \u201cGolden\u201d trademarks. The exhibits show that marks of which \u201cGolden\u201d is a component were used, displayed, and advertised <em>together </em>prior to appellee\u2019s date of first use. Whether or not the situation is categorized as one in which opposer has a \u201cfamily\u201d of marks \u2014 appellee contending that it is <em>not </em>\u2014 we agree with opposer\u2019s contentions that prior to the earliest use of appellee\u2019s mark opposer had established a pattern of using marks comprising \u201cGolden\u201d as the <em>dominant </em>feature on electronic goods in the radio and television industries and that appellee\u2019s use of its mark fell into that pattern.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">In our judgment, it is quite likely that at least a substantial number of purchasers or users of appellee\u2019s electron guns, grids, or the TV picture tubes bearing the labels indicating that they are incorporated therein \u2014 which is a manner of marking specified in the application practiced by appellee\u2019s customers \u2014 would attribute origin to opposer. This is sufficient reason, under section 2(d), for denying registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">While, as the board pointed out in its opinion on reconsideration, the \u201cGolden\u201d marks were used together in conjunction with the primary mark \u201cMotorola,\u201d this strikes us as a fact of little significance. If a TV receiver contains a \u201cGOLDEN M\u201d chassis, \u201cGOLDEN M\u201d and \u201cGOLDEN SATELLITE\u201d vacuum tubes, all originating with Motorola, it would seem to be more than likely that one would expect a picture tube for the same set, either original or replacement, bearing a \u201cGOLDEN GRID\u201d label, to have had the same origin. Were it otherwise, the significance of the word \u201cGolden\u201d as an indicator of origin would be close to zero. Insofar as it would serve to indicate origin, we think it would be as likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to indicate origin in opposer as in appellee. The annexation of the word \u201cgrid\u201d to the word \u201cgolden\u201d would not alter this by reason of the fact that \u201cgrid\u201d is purely descriptive. The board seemed to feel that it would be otherwise, saying, \u201cthe word \u2018GRID\u2019 in applicant\u2019s mark, while of a merely descriptive nature, is still sufficient to distinguish applicant\u2019s mark from each of op-poser\u2019s marks.\u201d We cannot agree. Furthermore, the issue is not whether the <em>marks </em>can be distinguished, but whether in concurrent use on the goods involved they are likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">There are ten third-party registrations of record on marks comprising two words the first of which is \u201cGolden\u201d and used on various goods in the electrical field. The board considered five of these pertinent to this appeal. Appellee also introduced copies of some advertisements in which the word \u201cGOLDEN\u201d was used in various ways. This evidence, plus the dictionary meanings of \u201cgolden\u201d led the board to conclude that \u201csuch term has a highly suggestive significance.\u201d In view of this undoubted fact and the indication that others than opposer may have used the word \u201cGolden\u201d in the electrical field, the board concluded that opposer had not established that it had a \u201cfamily\u201d of \u201cGolden\u201d marks, despite its extensive use and advertising thereof. As a matter of logic it would seem to us that if opposer has a family of six marks all starting with the non-descriptive word \u201cGolden,\u201d it still has that family notwithstanding there may be some others using the same word to some undisclosed extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The board supported its conclusion that no likelihood of confusion could exist between appellee\u2019s mark and those of appellant by citing three of our decisions which we find distinguishable for reasons we shall now point out.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Lauritzen <em>&amp; </em>Company, Inc. v. Borden Company, 239 F.2d 405, 44 CCPA 720, involved marks for milk products ending in \u201c-lac\u201d which we found to be a <em>descriptive </em>term, being the Latin for milk. We agreed with both lower tribunals that the presence of \u201c-lac\u201d in a mark on a milk product would not indicate origin to the public. We agreed that it was no basis for finding the existence of a family of marks and held it should be given little weight in determining whether marks for milk products are \u201cconfusingly similar,\u201d which is a shorthand expression indicating that we do not think concurrent use of the marks is likely to <em>cause </em>confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Co. (U. S. A.) Inc. v. Mezger Pharmacal Co., Inc., 228 F.2d 243, 43 CCPA 703, also involved a three-letter suffix, \u201c-fax.\u201d While this does not appear to have a current dictionary meaning in modern English,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the record showed it to be rather commonly used in the medicinal field involved. We said that the opposer\u2019s case could not depend on any proprietary interest in the final syllable \u201c-fax.\u201d The opposer had a string of marks all ending in \u201c-fax\u201d but otherwise they had nothing in common with each other or with the applicant\u2019s mark. For that reason we held, of necessity, that opposer\u2019s marks had to be compared <em>individually </em>with applicant\u2019s mark, for with \u201c-fax\u201d laid aside, the opposer\u2019s marks had no common feature to be compared with the applicant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Servo Corporation of America v. Servo-Tek Products Co., Inc., 289 F.2d 955, 48 CCPA 978, involved marks having the prefix \u201cservo-\u201d for servomechanisms. We found that nobody had an exclusive right to the term \u201cservo\u201d in connection with servomechanisms. While we did not say it in so many words, we found \u201cservo\u201d to be <em>descriptive, </em>as is obvious from the dictionary definitions quoted. We found opposer could not rely on the \u201cservo\u201d portion of any of its marks in opposing the registration of \u201cServospeed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">We can see no parallel between any of these cases and the case now before us. \u201cGolden\u201d as used by appellant-opposer is not descriptive of its goods. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>that \u201cGolden\u201d as so used may be \u201csuggestive\u201d is not in and of itself a reason why trademark significance may not attach thereto. We believe that appellee\u2019s mark, used <em>as indicated in the application on the goods there named, </em>would appear to many to be a member of op-poser\u2019s family. We agree with the board\u2019s factual holding that \u201cthe purchasers of television tubes may well encounter the marks of both parties on the same product.\u201d Under these circumstances we see no possibility of avoiding the conclusion that there is a likelihood of confusion except, as previously indicated, by reducing the origin-indicating value of the word \u201cGolden,\u201d as used in opposer\u2019s marks, to the vanishing point. The evidence does not justify doing this.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The decision of the board dismissing the opposition is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">. The Oxford Dictionary shows it to be an obsolete term meaning the hair of the head in Old English and mentions the names Fairfax and Halifax.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
