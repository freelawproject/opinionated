Appellee defaulted. On June 2, 1961, appellants brought suit in the Superior Court of the State of California to foreclose appellee\u2019s rights under the contract. The Superior Court appointed a receiver who took possession of the property. On September 27, 1961 (within four months of the filing of the state court action) appellee filed a petition in the United States District Court under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. On October 25, 1961, the referee in bankruptcy ordered the debtor restored to possession, and the property was surrendered by the state court receiver. Appellants filed a petition to reclaim, challenging the authority of the referee to take possession of the property. The petition was denied by the referee and the District Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">Appellants failed to file a petition for review within ten days of the entry of the referee\u2019s order directing surrender of the property and, as noted, instead filed a petition to reclaim. As a result, contends appellee, the order became final,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and appellants must be held to have consented to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But appellants specifically asserted in their petition to reclaim that the order requiring the state court receiver to surrender the property \u201cwas inadvertently made and erroneous.\u201d In answer to appellee\u2019s cross-complaint and again at the outset of the hearing before the referee, appellants repeated their challenge to the referee\u2019s power to enter the order. The referee entertained the challenge to his authority, heard extensive argument, and decided the question adversely to appellants. The petition to reclaim was, in effect, a request for reconsideration of the referee\u2019s prior order requiring surrender of the property. The referee undertook to re-examine his earlier decision \u2014 as, in the circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he had the power to do.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lants filed a timely petition to review the order denying the petition to reclaim, and expressly preserved the question of the referee\u2019s power to order surrender of the property. We think the issue was properly before the District Court, and is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We hold that it was error for the referee to order the state court receiver to surrender the property. When, prior to bankruptcy, a state court receiver takes possession of property of a debt- or as an incident to enforcement of a mortgage lien which antedated bankruptcy by more than four months and the validity of which is not otherwise challenged, the foreclosure proceedings are not superseded by bankruptcy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no support in either reason or authority for applying a different rule in an action by a conditional vendor to enforce his rights against a defaulting vendee under a conditional sales contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Appellee argues that the referee was empowered to act by the \u201cvoluntary\" surrender of the assets by the state court receiver. But even if we were to assume that the state court might cut off appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>lants\u2019 right to challenge the validity of the referee\u2019s order by voluntarily relinquishing the property over appellants\u2019 objection,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> surrender of the property under compulsion of the referee\u2019s order was not a \u201cvoluntary\u201d relinquishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The order of the District Court affirming the denial of the petition to reclaim is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-16\">.

The petition to reclaim, challenging the order requiring surrender, was filed less than thirty days after entry of that order. It is not suggested that during this period appellee changed his position to his prejudice in reliance upon the order\u2019s finality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-19\">.

Arizona Wax Paper Co., 90 F.2d 801 (9th Cir.1937), and In re Faerstein, 58 F.2d 942 (9th Cir. 1932), are said to have represented a minority view to the contrary. 2 Collier, supra at 1434 and n. 52. Assuming this to have been so, the basis upon which such a view might have rested was rejected by the Supreme Court in its subsequent opinion in Pfister v. Northern Illinois Finance Corp., 317 U.S. 144, 149-150, 63 S.Ct. 133, 87 L.Ed. 146 (1942). See Castaner v.

Cf. Sada Yoshinuma v. Oberdorfer Ins. Agency, 136 F.2d 460 (5th Cir. 1943). In re Lustron Corp., 184 F.2d 789 (7th Cir. 1950), and In re Lustron Corp., 184 F.2d 798 (7th Cir. 1950), are not to the contrary, as appellee suggests. The court expressly recognized the rule that the bankruptcy court will not interfere with proceedings to foreclose a valid mortgage lien (184 F.2d at 796). The court held that where the receiver within four months of bankruptcy took possession both of encumbered assets for foreclosure and also of unencumbered assets for general liquidation, (1) the bankruptcy court could <em>temporarily </em>stay the foreclosure proceedings to enable the trustee to investigate the validity of the liens (184 F.2d at 797), and (2) jurisdiction over the <em>unencumbered </em>assets passed to the bankruptcy court despite the receiver\u2019s possession (184 F.2d at 797, 800-801). See also 5 Remington, supra at 144, 151-52. But see 64 Harv.L.Rev. 1193 (1951). In the present case the validity of the conditional sales contract is conceded; if the property taken by the receiver included some not covered by the contract, it is doubtful that appellee\u2019s interests would be served by insisting upon immediate segregation since both the encumbered and unencumbered property are parts of a going business. See note 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b614-16\">. The interest of the bankrupt estate may be protected by intervention in the state court proceedings. The rights of a conditional vendee under the contract pass to the trustee in bankruptcy (or, as here, to the debtor-in-possession who exercises \u201call the powers of a trustee.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742). The obligations of the contract may be assumed. Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., 239 U.S. 268, 274, 36 S.Ct. 50, 60 L.Ed. 275 (1915); In re Forgee Metal Products Co., 229 F.2d 799 (3d Cir. 1956). In Chapter XI proceedings \u201cfailure to assume affirmatively an executory contract does not result at any time in rejection of the contract. Whether the debtor is in possession, or whether there is a receiver or trustee, the contract can be rejected only by affirmative action * * *. Unless so rejected, the contract continues in effect.\u201d 8 Collier, supra at 162. In the event of default, the trustee or debtor-in-possession \u201cis entitled to exercise or assign the right of redemption accorded the vendee by state law.\u201d 4 Collier, supra at 1125 n. 31. Miller v. McCray Refrigerator Co., 130 F.2d 873 (8th Cir. 1942). See also In re Gunning, 124 F.2d 7 (9th Cir. 1941) (under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">The rights available to a defaulting conditional vendee under California law would seem ample to protect appellee against forfeiture or unnecessary loss. See Ward v. Union Bond &amp; Trust Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>243 F.2d 476 (9th Cir. 1957); 14 Hastings L.J. 44 (1962); 40 Calif.L.Rev. 593 (1952); 37 Calif.L.Rev. 704 (1949); 2 Stan.L.Rev. 235 (1949); 23 So.Cal.L. Rev. 110 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The District Court found that appellee had added substantial improvements to the property conveyed by the conditional sales contract. Although the bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction over that portion of the property not subject to the contract, it may before proceeding await the outcome of the state court litigation establishing appellee\u2019s rights in that portion of the property subject to the contract. Cf. Callaway v. Benton, 336 U.S. 132, 142, n. 11, 69 S.Ct. 435, 93 L.Ed. 553 (1949); Mangus v. Miller, 317 U.S. 178, 185, 63 S.Ct. 182, 87 L.Ed. 169 (1942); Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 309 U.S. 478, 483-484, 60 S. Ct. 628, 84 L.Ed. 876 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b615-15\">. Compare Texas v. Donoghue, 302 U.S. 284, 289, 58 S.Ct. 192, 82 L.Ed. 264 (1937).

We note, however, that appellee expresses apprehension that our judgment may be read as requiring the return of the property to appellants rather than to the state court receiver, a result which, as appellee suggests, would be contrary to our intention. Reversal of the order denying appellants\u2019 \u201cpetition to reclaim\u201d is based wholly upon our construction of that order as an affirmation of the referee\u2019s prior order requiring the state court receiver to surrender the property. Accordingly, appropriate steps should be taken on remand to restore the state court receiver to possession.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
