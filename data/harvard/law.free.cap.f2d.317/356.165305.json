We find it unnecessary to decide whether the arrest of Gonzales was unlawful. Since the narcotics were not seized in the course of a search of appellant\u2019s person or premises, the seizure invaded no rights of Serrano which would entitle him to object to their introduction in evidence. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 492, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); United States v. Lee Wan Nam, 274 F.2d 863 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 803, 80 S.Ct. 1236, 4 L.Ed.2d 1147 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Appellant urges that because Gonzales was a co-defendant, McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 456, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (1948) requires us to reverse. But in McDonald, a defendant with proper standing to do so moved for suppression and for return of the evidence illegally seized. Had the motion been granted (as the Supreme Court held that it should have been), the evidence would not have been available for use against any of the defendants. In the present case no one who had standing to do so moved for suppression of the evidence. Therefore the evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
