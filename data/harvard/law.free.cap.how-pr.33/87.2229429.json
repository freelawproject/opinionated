The property was not carried away with the intent of rendering any proceeding for its possession <em>ineffectual; </em>nor,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\"><em>2d. </em>With the intent that the property should not be found or taken by the sheriff.

It reads:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-10\">\u201c In an action to recover the possession of personal property unjustly detained, where' the property, or any part thereof, has been concealed, removed or disposed of, so that it cannot be found or taken by the sheriff, <em>and with the intent that it should not be so found or taken, </em>or with the intent to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit thereof.\u201d <em>(Oode, </em>\u00a7 179, <em>sub. </em>3.)

A. Chadsey, <em>for plaintiff and respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-13\"><em>By the court, </em>Cardozo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhR\">The action is to recover certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>personal property, and upon an affidavit and the certificate of the sheriff, that the property has been <em>eloigned </em>and concealed by the defendant, so that it could not be taken by the sheriff, an order under subdivision 3, of section 179 of the Code, was granted, to arrest the defendant. A motion to vacate the order, on the papers on which it was issued, was made and denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The grounds on which the motion was based, and on which we were asked to reverse the decision below, are : 1st. That no fact is stated from which the judge could conclude that the property was <em>eloigned </em>or concealed; and, 2d. That at all events, there is no fact from which it can be inferred that such <em>eloigning </em>or concealment, was with intent that the property should not be found or taken, or with intent to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Perhaps the statement that property has been <em>eloigned, </em>that is, removed to a distance, may be considered as an assertion of a fact, and not being disputed in the case by any opposing affidavit, it is to be regarded as established that the defendant did remove and conceal the property. But that is not enough under the statute, to justify an order of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The statute requires before that remedy shall be allowed, that two matters shall be established, viz: 1st. That the property has been removed or concealed by the defendant; and, 2d. That such removal or concealment was with intent that it should not be found or taken by the sheriff, or with the intent to deprive the plaintiff of it:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The former of these propositions' is established, but not the latter, unless we infer \"it from the existence of the former, which the statute does not permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Both before and since the amendment of 1857, this section has been construed \"in accordance with these views. <em>(Van Neste </em>agt. <em>Conover, </em>5 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>148; <em>Roberts </em>agt. <em>Randall, Id. </em>327; <em>Pike </em>agt. <em>Lent, </em>4 <em>Sandf. S. C. R. </em>650; <em>Mulvey </em>agt. <em>Davison, </em>8 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>111; <em>Reimer </em>agt. <em>Nagel, </em>1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">To give any other construction to the statute, is praeti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>cally to declare that an order of arrest may be allowed in every case where the property has either been rembved <em>or </em>concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">I think the order below should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
