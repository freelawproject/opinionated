After its seizure by the sheriff, the defendants required the return thereof, and gave the sheriff an undertaking, with two sureties, as required by section 211 of the Code. Those sureties subsequently justified on notice; and it then appeared that one of them was a member of a firm which had a lease, with an unexpired term of about two years, of a portion of a building in Broad street, New York, being three rooms on the second floor, in which the firm carried on the business of brokers and bankers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-11\">-This surety was objected to on the part of the plaintiff,after justification, as not being either a \u201chouseholder or freeholder within the state.\u2019</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-12\">Mr. E.
