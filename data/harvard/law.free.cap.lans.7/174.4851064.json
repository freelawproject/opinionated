New York, <em>August </em>24th, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-14\">\u201c On or before the fifteenth day of November next I promise to pay Silas M.

The plaintiff' replied, denying the counter-claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">It appeared that the plaintiff, through his attorney, on the 7th Hay, 1867, caused a notice to be left at the office of the defendant, in the latter\u2019s absence, by a person in charge, by a clerk who had not been able to find the defendant there upon several attempts to do so. The notice was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">\u201c D. A. Baldwin, Esq.: <em>Dear </em>Sir.\u2014The stock of the New York Guano Company, which I hold as collateral to your note, will be sold on the 9th inst. by A. H. Nicolay, at 111 Broadway, Exchange Salesroom, as per annexed advertisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">\u201cYours, etc., E. SPROUT.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">Accompanying the notice was served at the same time an advertisement of the sales of Nicolay as auctioneer, and signed by him, for the day named in the notice, which included the stock in question; but the defendant swore that he had no recollection of receiving the notice, and the court found that he had no personal notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-9\">The plaintiff also proved by the attorney that the defendant had been informed previously that his stock would be sold if the note was not paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-10\">The sale was made pursuant to the notice and the stock was purchased by the plaintiff, as alleged in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-11\">The court found that the note had not been paid nor any part of it, and that the collateral security had not been converted by the plaintiff, and gave judgment for the face of the note and interest, and costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>H.

J., Gilbert and Tapper, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">By the Court\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"A_C\">Gilbert, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At2d\"><em>We </em>agree with the court below, that the evidence did not make out a conversion of the stock. If the sale was ineffectual to change the title to the stock, such title remained vested as it was before the sale. The court acted on the assumption that the sale was made without notice to the defendant. If this assumption had been correct, the sale would have been a nullity, unless the defendant afterward ratified it. The defendant, however, denies the validity of the sale, and so in effect repudiates the transaction, while at the same time he seeks to make the plaintiff liable for a conversion of the stock, by means of that sale. This he cannot do. The law will not permit a party thus to blow hot and cold. If the defendant had a right to disavow the sal\u00e9, his election to do so rendered it inoperative, and the stock would thenceforth be held by the plaintiff, upon the terms of the original deposit, viz., as security for the payment of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness. When that should be paid, the defendant would be entitled to a return of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">But we are of opinion that the sale was in all respects regular, and that thereby the title to the stock became legally vested in the plaintiff. \u25a0 The only objection taken against the validity of the sale rests upon the allegation that the defendant was not properly notified thereof. The evidence uncontradicted is, that a formal written notice of the sale, with a\" copy of the advertisement thereof annexed, signed by the auctioneer by whom the sale was made, was left at the place of business of the defendant, with a person in charge thereof, twu days before the sale. The defendant testified that he had no recollection of having received the notice. This may have been owing to his own act. Whether it was or not, the notice ought to be held sufficient, in the absence of any proof, creat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ing an obligation on the plaintiff to adopt another manner of service. A notice of the dishonor of a promissory note, left at the dwelling or place of business of the indorser, is sufficient to charge the latter (1 Pars, on Notes, chap. 12, \u00a7 3) upon the principle that if the person to whom the note is addressed is absent, it is to be presumed that he will leave some person charged with the care of his business, or at least some one between whom and himself there is a privity or confidence, <em>(Granite Bank </em>v. Ayers, 16 Pick., 392.) In the case cited, Shaw, Oh. J., lays down the rule that <em>\u201c </em>all notices at one\u2019s domicile, and all notices respecting transactions of a commercial nature at one\u2019s known place of business, are deemed in law to be good constructive notice, and to have the legal effect of actual notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">No argument is needed to show that such a rule, is approved by good sense, and indeed is founded in commercial necessity. If the defendant left no one at his place of business to attend to his affairs, it is and ought to be his own loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
