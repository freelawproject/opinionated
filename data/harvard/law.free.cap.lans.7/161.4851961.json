The party of the second part is not allowed to sell said wagon or to make a loan of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\">It appeared that Faust was indebted for goods sold and delivered to the defendant Skidmore, who applied to a justice of the peace at Eewburgh, Orange county, for an attachment, under the provisions of the several statutes of the State, against Faust\u2019s property, upon his own affidavit and that of one Bull, his clerk, from which it appeared that the claim arising on contract, as mentioned, was for forty-two dollars, and that the application was made on the ground that Faust was about to depart from the county of Orange, where he resided, with intent to defraud his creditors. The affidavit also set forth facts showing that Faust was secretly causing his property to be removed from that county,- and had abandoned his home and place of business, and kept himself concealed, with like intent, viz., to defraud Skidmore and other creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">The justice took and approved of a bond in the penalty of $100, given by Skidmore and another, conditioned for the payment of all damages and costs by reason of the issuing of the attachment if he (Skidmore) should fail to recover judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ment, and also conditioned that if Faust should recover, Skidmore would pay all moneys which should be received by him (Skidmore) from any property levied upon under an attachment, over and above the amount of the judgment and interest and costs thereon, and an attachment issued to Roche, a constable, the other defendant here, reciting that <em>\u201c </em>whereas Edwin T. Skidmore hath applied for an attachment against the property of F. Faust, against whom he hath a claim for goods sold, arising on contract, $42.02, and produced satisfactory proof that the said F. Faust is about to depart the county of Orange with intent to defraud his creditors,\u201d and commanded any constable, &amp;c., to attach so much of the goods, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">By virtue of this attachment Roche levied on the baker\u2019s wagon, then in the possession of Faust, who held under the written instrument, a year not having elapsed from its execution and delivery to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">A summons was afterward issued to Faust in favor of Skidmore, and judgment went against him by default in Skidmore\u2019s favor. Execution was issued upon the judgment, and the wagon, then being in the constable\u2019s hands, was sold by him and possession delivered to the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">Faust afterward appealed from the judgment rendered against him by the justice, and it was reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">The plaintiff demanded possession of the wagon from Roche while he held it under the attachment, and brought this suit after expiration of the term for which Faust was entitled to it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-8\"><em>John </em>Miller, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-9\"><em>Fullerton &lt;&amp; Anthony, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b181-10\">Present\u2014Baward, P. J., Gilbert and Tapper-, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b181-11\">By the Court\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"A4fE\">Gilbert, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlR\">The affidavit was sufficient to authorize an attachment to- be issued, pursuant to either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Revised Statutes or the act of 1831. \u25a0 (2 R. S., 230, \u00a7 26; Laws of 1831, \u00a7 34.) Under the former statute, an attachment may issue, on proof that the debtor is about to depart from the county, while the proof required by the latter is confined to acts of the debtor, relating to his property. The affidavit contains all that is required by both statutes, but it might be inferred, if it was material, that the attachment was issued under the act of 1831, because a summons was taken out against the defendant in the attachment, and the subsequent proceedings were in conformity with that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The bond given was in the penalty required by the act of 1831, and although a mistake was made in the condition of it, yet it was approved by the justice, and as against the plaintiff, a stranger to the proceeding, it ought to be held sufficient to uphold his jurisdiction. <em>(Bascom </em>v. Smith, 31 N. Y., 595.) The defendant in the attachment might have waived the defect, and that seems to be the test, whether it was a nullity or a mere irregularity. <em>(Clapp </em>v. Graves, 26 N. Y., 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We think the return of the constable was a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Parol evidence of the execution and of the sale thereunder, was admitted without objection. It is too late now to raise that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The cases of <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Carnly </em>(1 Kern., 501; S. C., 17 N. Y., 202), and the authorities therein cited, are decisive of the right to sell the interest of a lessee of a chattel, by virtue of an execution against him, and to deliver possession of the chattel pursuant to the sale, as was done in this ease. ITor does a reversal of the judgment on which the execution issued,in such a case, invalidate the levy or sale, or make either the party or the officer a trespasser. It merely annuls the title acquired by means of the sale, and entitles the owner of the chattel to recover it from any one into whose possession it has come.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">If, therefore, the interest of Faust in the chattel had been that of lessee, as all parties have assumed, the defendant would have been entitled to judgment. But it was not such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>an interest. The instrument of hiring provided that \u201c the use of said wagon \u201d should be \u201c only for his baker business, and not for any other use,\u201d and prohibited a sale or loan of the wagon. The legal effect of the instrument was to confer upon Faust merely a personal license to use the wagon. Such an interest cannot be the subject of sale under an execution. For this reason the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
