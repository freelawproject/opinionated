Judgment was recovered in the action and execution issued to the sheriff; and after six months from the docketing of the judgment, upon petition, in the action, of the plaintiff and affidavit of the sheriff setting forth all his proceedings since service of the attachment, &amp;c.; also that he had used due diligence and endeavored to collect the evidences of debt attached, &amp;c., &amp;c. (Code, \u00a7 237, sub. 4), and upon notice to the defendant\u2019s attorney, the court ordered a sale by the sheriff of the notes, accounts, books of account, and evidences of debt, seized under the attachment, at public auction in the usual manner of sales of personal property by the sheriff under execution. Pursuant to this order the sheriff, among other things, sold the debt due by the defendant to Robinson &amp; Ogden; it was purchased by the plaintiff. It appeared that no notice was given of the attachment by the sheriff to the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>' <em>Nelson </em>Cross, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-5\"><em>Ira D.

The proceedings under the attachment were ineffectual to reach the debt due from Mr. Warren to the defendant in the attachment, for the reason that the sheriff did not serve upon him any notice showing that he had levied on such debt. That debt was a mere chose in action, and incapable of seizure by the sheriff. (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 235,236 ; <em>Orser </em>v. Grossman, 11 How., 520; <em>Clark </em>v. Goodrige, 41 N. Y., 210 ; <em>Ransom </em>v. Minor, 3 Sand. S. C. R., 692.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">We think, also, the sale by the sheriff of the debt was illegal. Code, \u00a7 237, sub. 2, expressly excepts choses in action from property that may be sold, and subdivision 5 provides in what manner they shall be made applicable to the payment of the judgment recovered by the creditor in the attachment, namely, by requiring the sheriff to collect the same and apply the proceeds to the payment of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
