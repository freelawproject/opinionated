He is only responsible in the event that the bail are <em>insufficient. </em>The case is different from bail on arrest, where the notice is \u201c <em>that he does not accept the bail </em>\u201d (Code, \u00a7 192), and where on their failure to justify <em>\u201c the sheriff shall himself be H\u00e1ble as bail </em>\u201d (\u00a7 201), and where in the event of,\" his becoming liable the bail are made liable to him. (\u00a7 203.) Here the notice is a mere <em>exception </em>to the sureties, and the sheriff is only made \u201cresponsible for the sufficiency of the sureties.\u201d The distinction is marked and not the result of accident. The omission of the same words in provisions following each other so closely shows intention and design. The sheriff standing as a mere surety, plaintiff\" must exhaust his remedy against the bail and establish their insufficiency before he can maintain the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">\u25a0The defendant, if liable as bail, had the rights of bail, and might divest himself of his liability by agreement with him to whom he was liable.

The complaint avers that the sureties failed to justify, and no new sureties were furnished, and that the \u201c defendant became liable therefor.\"\u2019 This allegation, not having been denied, stands admitted. If the counsel for the defendant intended to raise any question as to the liability of the sheriff on this ground, he should have called the attention of the court to it, so that an opportunity might have been afforded the plaintiff for obviating the objection by evidence. Not having done so, the objection is not available on appeal. But we think that the facts that the sureties failed to justify and were not accepted, and that no new sureties were furnished, of themselves established the liability of the sheriff. Pecuniary responsibility is not the only subject involved in the question of the sufficiency of the sureties. The statute (Code, \u00a7 210) requires that they shall justify in like manner as upon bail on arrest. If they do not justify they are not sufficient. In order to justify they must possess the qualifications prescribed in the case of bail on arrest (Code, \u00a7 213), among which are being a resident and householder or freeholder within the State, as well as being worth the requisite amount. The failure to justify furnishes satisfactory evidence that the sureties did not possess either of these qualifications; and their affidavit attached to the undertaking is not legal evidence to the contrary. It was the duty of the sheriff to take none but sufficient sureties. Having omitted this duty the statute makes him responsible for their sufficiency. The obvious meaning of this language is that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the sureties turn out to he insufficient, the sheriff shall be liable, in like manner as the sureties; for the omission to take sufficient sureties makes him a <em>quasi </em>trespasser. When the sureties do not justify it is not necessary to sue them in order to establish their insufficiency. .</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The agreement set up in the answer constituted ho defence. If it was exacted or taken by the sheriff, upon a delivery of the property before judgment, it operated directly as an indemnity against a violation of the sheriff\u2019s duty; for he had no right to deliver the property to Beamish before judgment, except by virtue of section 211 of the Code. If it was exacted or taken upon a delivery of the property after the judgment in favor of Beamish it was illegal, because it was the duty of the sheriff to return the property unconditionally. In either case, therefore, the taking of the agreement was in violation of the sheriff\u2019s duty, and, consequently, was illegal and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
