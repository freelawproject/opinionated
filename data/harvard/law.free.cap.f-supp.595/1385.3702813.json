BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-17\">Plaintiffs, Paul Kalmanovitz<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cKalmanovitz\u201d), individually and as a shareholder of Pabst Brewing Company (\u201cPabst\u201d), and S &amp; P, a California corporation (\u201cS &amp; P\u201d) (collectively \u201cplaintiffs\u201d), brought this action on December 10, 1982, pursuant to (a) Sections 10(b), 13(e), 14(d), and 14(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78m(e), 78n(d), and 78n(e), and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder; (b) Section 1 of the Sherman Act, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 18; and (c) the laws of the State of Delaware. (Docket Item [\u201cD.I.\u201d] 1 at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-18\">Originally, three separate lawsuits were filed, however, the cases have subsequently been consolidated into this present case. This lawsuit began in 1982, the result of the fierce battle for control of Pabst between Kalmanovitz, the Jacobs Group which included Irwin L. Jacobs (\u201cJacobs\u201d), Dennis Mathisen (\u201cMathisen\u201d), Gerald A. Schwalbach (\u201cSchwalbach\u201d) and Daniel I. Lindsay (\u201cLindsay\u201d), and G. Heileman Brewing Company, Inc. (\u201cHeileman\u201d). Presently pending before this Court are two motions: (a) defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Counts I through X of the Complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (D.I. 166); and (b) plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify the antitrust and tortious interference claims for appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). (D.I. 160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Because this Court has already recounted the details of the battle for control of Pabst,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this discussion therefore will be limited to a thumbnail sketch of the operative facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">On October 26, 1982, Kalmanovitz and Jacobs, along with three of Jacobs\u2019 associates (the \u201cJacobs Group\u201d), entered into a Memorandum of Terms (the \u201cOctober 26 contract\u201d), by which Kalmanovitz and the Jacobs Group, through JMSL Acquiring Corporation (\u201cJMSL\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> agreed to make a tender offer for 3,000,000 Pabst shares at $24 per share.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (D.I. 121, Ex. 1 at 2.) Acquisition of these 3,000,000 shares, combined with 1,440,305 Pabst shares the Jacobs Group already owned, would have given the parties to the agreement a majority of outstanding Pabst stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">On October 27, 1982, Kalmanovitz and the Jacobs Group made the tender offer for 3,000,000 shares of Pabst stock at $24 per share (the \u201cJacobs-Kalmanovitz offer\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 2.) The Jacobs-Kalmanovitz offer was opposed by the management of Pabst, e.g., William F. Smith, Jr., Pabst\u2019s president. As a result of a series of meetings between Smith and the chief executive officer of Heileman, Russell G. Cleary, on November 10, 1982, Heileman commenced a competing tender offer through a wholly-owned subsidiary called \u201cHBC Acquisition, Inc.\u201d (\u201cHBC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Heileman (the \u201cHeileman offer\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 3.) The Heileman offer was for 5,500,000 shares of Pabst stock at $27.50 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">On November 18, 1982, the Jacobs-Kalmanovitz offer was amended and increased te $30 per share. This increase in the Jacobs-Kalmanovitz offer was made possible by an amendment to the October 26 contract whereby Kalmanovitz agreed to increase his cash participation in the offer from $26,394,720 to $44,394,720. <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 4.) At the same time, on November 18, 1982, defendant Jacobs promised, on behalf of the Jacobs Group in a letter to Kalmanovitz, that in the event the Jacobs Group decided to sell its 1,140,305 shares of Pabst stock, rather than continuing to bid higher, it would pay Kalmanovitz 50% of all amounts it received in excess of $24 per share for all the shares in the Group (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-13\">On November 23, 1982, the Jacobs-Kalmanovitz offer was further amended and increased to $35 per share. This increase in offer was accompanied by the further understanding that Kalmanovitz would increase his cash participation in the offer to $59,394,720. <em>(Id. </em>at Exs. 7 &amp; 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-14\">On November 24, 1982, this Court denied motions for preliminary injunctions against the Jacobs-Kalmanovitz offer (brought by the Heileman group) and against the Heileman offer (brought by the Jacobs Group and Kalmanovitz). Heileman announced after the hearing that it would reduce the number of shares sought in its offer to 4.25 million and that it had approximately 3.9 million shares already in its depository.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">That afternoon, on November 24, 1982, Jacobs telephoned Cleary and expressed concern about his (Jacobs) ability to go ahead financially. Cleary gathered from the conversation that Jacobs felt that he didn\u2019t want to go any further from a resources standpoint and he asked for sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>gestions to resolve the situation. During this conversation, Jacobs told Cleary that he would withdraw from the bidding for Pabst shares in exchange for $7,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">As a result of the negotiations begun on November 24, 1982, the Jacobs and Heileman groups entered into a contract on November 26, 1982, in which HBC agreed to terminate its old offer and announce a new offer which increased the number of shares to 5,600,000, raised the price to $29, and increased the value of notes to be paid to stockholders in a second-step merger from $20 to $24 per share. <em>{Id. </em>at Exs. 9, 10.) The Jacobs Group agreed to tender its shares into the new offer. The parties also agreed to dismiss all outstanding non-derivative litigation and that, upon dismissal, the Jacobs Group would be reimbursed $7.5 million for expenses incurred in its battle for control, this cost to be shared equally by Heileman and Pabst.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Also on November 26,1982, Jacobs called Kalmanovitz\u2019s attorney and stated that \u201che worked out a deal with Heileman to pay [Kalmanovitz] $5,000,000 if [he] would agree to withdraw from the bidding.\u201d This offer to pay Kalmanovitz was accompanied by an offer that he might share with Jacobs \u201cin a bargain purchase of Pabst\u2019s Milwaukee office building.\u201d Kalmanovitz rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">On December 2, 1982, HBC made a new tender offer for Pabst shares (seeking 5.600.000 shares at $29 per share) (the \u201cHBC Offer\u201d). <em>{Id. </em>at Ex. 11.) Kalmanovitz made a competing offer on December 6, 1982 for 4,150,000 shares at $32 per share. <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 13.) On December 10, 1982, Kalmanovitz filed this action and moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the HBC Offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">On December 20, 1982, this Court denied Kalmanovitz\u2019s motion. HBC increased its offering price to $32 per share on December 15, 1982. On December 22, 1982 \u2014 the withdrawal date for the HBC Offer \u2014 Kalmanovitz increased his offering price to $40 per share. <em>{Id. </em>at Ex. 16.) On December 23, 1982, Heileman accepted for payment 5.600.000 shares of Pabst and the contest for control of Pabst ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">III. DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">Because affidavits have been filed by plaintiffs and defendants in this proceeding, the Court will consider defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56. Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b). Under Rule 56, a court may enter summary judgment only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers and admissions, together with affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Any reasonable inferences from the facts must be resolved in favor of the party against whom the judgment may be entered. <em>Peterson v. Lehigh Valley Dist. Council, United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners, </em>676 F.2d 81, 84 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">1. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims For Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">Courts will not consider granting injunctions when \u201cthe circumstances are such that the injunction cannot be enforced by the court.\u201d 43 C.J.S. <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 34; <em>Penn Central Co. v. Buckley &amp; Co., </em>293 F.Supp. 653 (D.N.J.1963), <em>aff'd, </em>415 F.2d 762 (3d Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">It is presently infeasible to ask this Court to enjoin acts which purportedly will violate the federal securities laws and antitrust laws or Delaware state law when these acts have already occurred. <em>See Kauffman v. Johnston, </em>454 F.2d 267 (3d Cir.1972) (petition to enjoin deprivation of religious rights in connection with 1969 Passover mooted by passing of the holiday); <em>Tymiak v. Omodt, </em>676 F.2d 306 (8th Cir.1982) (plaintiff\u2019s request for injunction to prevent his ejectment was rendered moot by his ejectment); <em>Mougios v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>52 F.R.D. 576 (S.D.N.Y.1971) (request to enjoin stockholders meeting was rendered moot by the holding of the meeting); <em>see also Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Bergland, </em>576 F.2d 1377 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Marchand v. Director, U.S. Probation Office, </em>421 F.2d 331 (1st Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-15\">A review of plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief illustrates the complete impracticality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>of the request in light of the events of the past two years. Plaintiffs ask that Heileman be enjoined from voting its Pabst shares (D.I. 1 at 34, \u00b6 B); that the asset transfer be stopped (\u00b6 C); and that the solicitation and purchase of Pabst shares (\u00b6\u00b6 D, E) and the implementation of the merger be stopped (H F). Plaintiffs also ask that the defendants be enjoined from violating federal and state law. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 G, H, J, K, O.) The solicitation and purchase of shares, the vote, the merger and the asset transfers have, however, all occurred. This Court, therefore, cannot retroactively prohibit acts which are finished and which this Court refused to primarily enjoin on December 23, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">2. <em>Standing To Maintain Action For Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">Plaintiffs allege in Counts I through IV of the Complaint that defendants, in connection with the HBC Offer, violated Sections 13(e), 14(d) and 14(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(e), 78n(d), and 78n(e). (D.I. 1 at 16-20.) The defendants argue that because the purpose of the Williams Act was to protect investors faced with an offer for the purchase of their shares and not to provide a money damages remedy to unsuccessful contestants for control of a corporation, plaintiffs lack standing to maintain any action for money damages based on alleged violations of Sections 14(d), 14(e) or 13(e), of the Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">a. <em>Count I </em>\u2014 Fraud <em>In Connection With a Tender Offer: Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act is a general anti-fraud statute in connection with a tender offer which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay-\">(e) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to or in favor of any such offer, request, or invitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">Kalmanovitz argues that he has standing to bring this suit because he \u201cbrings suit individually and as a shareholder of Pabst, the target corporation.\u201d (D.I. 1, \u00b6 16.) Kalmanovitz emphasizes that point in the hope of circumventing the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977). In that case, the Court held that a tender offeror, suing in its capacity as a takeover bidder, does not have standing to sue for damages under section 14(e). That case arose out of a contest between Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. (\u201cChris-Craft\u201d) and Bangor Punta Corp. (\u201cBangor\u201d) for control of Piper Aircraft Corp. (\u201cPiper\u201d). In that contest, Bangor, with the support of Piper, was successful, through a tender offer and over-the-counter purchases, in acquiring a majority of Piper\u2019s outstanding stock. During the course of the struggle for control, Chris-Craft filed an action against Bangor, Piper, and The First Boston Corp. (Bangor\u2019s underwriter in its tender offer), claiming that Bangor\u2019s tender offer violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">After the Court denied the requests for injunctive relief, Bangor acquired a majority interest in Piper and Chris-Craft sought to press its claim for money damages. The Court, in applying the analysis of <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> held that Section 14(e) does <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>create a private right of action for money damages by an unsuccessful competitor for control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">The Court in <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft </em>began its analysis by framing the issue before it as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-5\">[w]hether tender offerors such as Chris-Craft, whose activities are regulated by the Williams Act, have a cause of action for damages against other regulated parties under the statute on a claim that anti-fraud violations by other parties have frustrated the bidder\u2019s efforts to obtain control of the target corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0K\">430 U.S. at 24, 97 S.Ct. at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">In holding that there was no such private remedy for money damages, the Court relied in part on the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-7\">The purpose of the Williams Act is to insure that public shareholders who are confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock will not be required to respond without adequate information. <em>We find no hint in the Legislative history, on which respondent so heavily relies, that Congress contemplated a private cause of action for damages by one of several contending offerors against a successful bidder or by a losing contender against a target company.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">430 U.S. at 35, 97 S.Ct. at 946. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">Kalmanovitz attempts to avoid the holding in <em>Piper </em>by claiming that he brought this suit individually in his capacity as a stockholder of Pabst and not as a competing tender offeror. The Court finds this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">A cursory review of the facts will demonstrate why the Court cannot accept Kalmanovitz\u2019s argument. First, Kalmanovitz entered into an agreement with the Jacobs Group to purchase 3,000,000 shares of Pabst stock. As part of the October 26 contract, Kalmanovitz was to become a 50% shareholder in PST, the parent company to JMSL, the maker of the tender offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-14\">On October 27, 1982, the Jacobs-Kalmanovitz tender offer was made for 3,000,000 shares at a total price of $72,000,000. Kalmanovitz, pursuant to the October 26 contract and the subsequent amendments, agreed to a cash participation in the offer up to $59,394,720. (D.I. 121 at Ex. 8.) When Jacobs wished to withdraw from the offer, Kalmanovitz not only refused to withdraw, he subsequently made a competing tender offer for 4,150,000 shares at $32 per share (Kalmanovitz later increased his offering price to $40 per share). Then during his competing tender offer, on December 10, 1982, Kalmanovitz filed this action seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the HBC Offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-16\">Finally, Kalmanovitz alleged ownership of only 20 shares of Pabst stock. Given this miniscule stake in any possible recovery, his assertion of standing on the basis of a shareholder is without merit. <em>See also Luptak v. Central Cartage Co., </em>[1981 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 98,034 (E.D.Mich.1979), <em>aff'd, </em>647 F.2d 165 (6th Cir.1981), where the court noted that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s individual stake in the outcome of the suit as a shareholder is minimal when compared with his interest as a potential offeror. Thus, although plaintiff seeks relief as a DIBC shareholder, it would be more realistic to characterize him as a competing tender offeror____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 91,352.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-19\">In <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft, </em>the Court addressed this exact problem and it specifically rejected the notion that Chris-Craft could sue as a disappointed Piper stockholder. As the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-20\">As a tender offeror <em>actively </em>engaged in competing for Piper stock, Chris-Craft was not in the posture of a target share<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>holder confronted with the decision of whether to tender or retain its stock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWE\">430 U.S. at 35, 97 S.Ct. at 946 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\">Because Kalmanovitz was actively engaged in competing for control of Pabst, Kalmanovitz has no standing to sue for damages based on a section 14(e) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">b. <em>Count II: Fraudulent, Misleading and Incomplete SEC Filings: Section H[d] of the Exchange Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEj\">Kalmanovitz alleges in Count II of his complaint that all of the defendants \u201chave filed and have caused Heileman to file, a Schedule 14D-1 and Offer to Purchase and have caused Pabst to file a Schedule 14D-9, which contain statements which are false and misleading with respect to material facts and which omit to state the material facts necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading, in violation of Rules 14d-6(e)(1) and 14d-9.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">Section 14(d), like Section 14(e), was enacted as a part of the Williams Act, and imposes upon tender offerors various disclosure and reporting requirements. The defendants argue and Kalmanovitz concedes that the same analysis applied by the Supreme Court in <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft </em>dictates whether or not Kalmanovitz can maintain claims predicated on alleged violations of Section 14(d). Like subsection (e), subsection (d) was enacted to provide adequate protection for investors, and not to enrich disappointed competing tender offerors. In <em>Luptak v. Central Cartage Co., </em>[1981 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 98,034 (E.D.Mich.1979), <em>aff'd, </em>647 F.2d 165 (6th Cir.1981), plaintiff was an unsuccessful competitor for control of Detroit International Bridge Company (\u201cDIBC\u201d) who brought suit against other bidders who had obtained control over DIBC. In disposing of plaintiff\u2019s claims based on Section 14(d) as well as Section 14(e), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-7\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Chris-Craft, </em>emphasizing that section 14 and other provisions of the Williams Act were intended to benefit shareholders rather than competing offerors, Luptak would appear to have no standing to bring a private action for money damages under any subdivision of section 14. <em>See </em>430 U.S. at 35 [97 S.Ct. at 946]. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-10\">Because this Court has found both that plaintiff has no standing to assert his claims under section 14 of the Exchange Act and that Cartage\u2019s market purchases of DIBC stock did not constitute a tender offer under section 14, it must determine that defendants Cartage and Centra are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those portions of plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleging violations of section 14(d) and (e) of the Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\"><em>Id., </em>\u00b6 98,034 at 91,352-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">Thus, for the same reasons plaintiffs lack standing to maintain an action under Section 14(e), plaintiffs likewise have no standing to bring an action for damages under Section 14(d) and Count II will be dismissed as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-13\">c. <em>Counts III and IV: No Private Right of Action For Damages Under Section 13(e)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">In Counts III and IV of the Complaint, Kalmanovitz alleges violations of Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(e). (Count III \u2014 Disguised Issuer Tender: Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13e-4; Count IV \u2014 Disguised \u201cGoing Private\u201d Transaction: Section 13(e) and Rule 13e-3.) (D.I. 1 at 17, 19.) The defendants argue that Kalmanovitz lacks standing to seek money damages for the alleged violations of Section 13 because under Section 13 there is no private right of action for <em>money damages. </em>Kalmanovitz disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-15\">Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>It shall be unlawful for an issuer ... to purchase any equity security issued by it if such purchase is in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission, in the public interest or <em>for the protection of investors, </em>may adopt (A) to define acts and practices which are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative, and (B) to prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent such acts and practices. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">Section 13(e), like any other section of the Williams Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(d)-(e), 78n(d)-(f) (1976)), does not <em>expressly </em>afford a private right of action for enforcement of its provisions. Thus, this Court is again faced with the issue: whether or not there is an implied private right of action for <em>money damages </em>under Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act. Neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has determined whether an implied private right of action exists under Section 13(e). As a result, both Kalmanovitz and the defendants look to the case law under Section 13(d) for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">This Court, in <em>Jacobs v. Pabst Brewing Co., </em>549 F.Supp. 1050 (D.Del.1982), a case arising out of the same battle for control of Pabst, presented a comprehensive analysis of Section 13(d) which included an exhaustive list of cases from various jurisdictions which stated that parties may and may not pursue a claim under Section 13(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court then reviewed the case history and the legislative history of Section 13(d) before concluding that \u201cCongress intended to preserve a private cause of action which had been judicially created.\u201d 549 F.Supp. at 1062. Having determined that an implied right of action for <em>injunctive relief </em>exists under Section 13(d) and 13(g), the Court went on to determine whether the Jacobs Group, as shareholders, has standing to bring an action for injunctive relief against an investment adviser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">In the present action, however, this Court must decide whether or not an implied private right of action for <em>money damages </em>under Section 13(e) exists before it reaches the issue of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">When other courts have faced the issue of whether there is an implied private right of action for damages, they have determined that none exists. In <em>duPont v. Wyly, </em>61 F.R.D. 615 (D.Del.1973), Judge Stapleton determined that no implied right to recover damages existed when he stated: \u201cBy including an express and expressly limited private remedy in Section 18, [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r] I think Congress clearly negated the existence of a further implied remedy for violation of Section 13. I agree that \u2018where Congress has specifically authorized a remedy for violation of an act, the courts should not nullify the congressional scheme by implying a right of action on behalf of those not otherwise entitled to recover.\u2019 \u201d 61 F.R.D. at 628 <em>citing In re Penn Central Securities Litigation, </em>347 F.Supp. 1327, 1340 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>modified, </em>[1973 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep.

In support of its position, defendants rely on <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), where the United States Supreme Court held that one who does not buy or sell stock in connection with an offer cannot maintain an action under Section 10(b) for alleged misstatements made by the offeror. Conceding that he must comply with the purchaser/seller requirement of <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), Kalmanovitz contends that the words \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d in Section 10(b) are to be construed so liberally as to encompass the conversion of his stock in the March, 1983 merger, which occurred more than four months after his complaint was filed. Relying upon the \u201cforced seller\u201d exception established in <em>Vine v. Beneficial Finance Company, </em>374 F.2d 627 (2d Cir.1967), Kalmanovitz argues that a merger following a tender offer in which the majority stockholder may eliminate the minority stockholders without their approval relieves a stockholder of the need to plead \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d of securities or \u201creliance.\u201d Because <em>Vine v. Beneficial Finance Company </em>was decided by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals prior to the 1974 Supreme Court decision of <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>and because <em>Vine </em>is not the law in this Circuit, the Court is not persuaded by Kalmanovitz\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">In <em>Blue Chip Stamps, </em>the complaint alleged that the offeror had intentionally made the prospectus \u201coverly pessimistic in order to discourage [complainant] and other members of the allegedly large class whom it represents from accepting what was intended to be a bargain offer, so that the rejected shares might later be offered to the public at a higher price.\u201d 421 U.S. at 726, 95 S.Ct. at 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">The Supreme Court held that the issue before it was: \u201c[w]hether respondent may base its action on Rule 10(b)-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission without having either bought or sold the securities described in the allegedly misleading prospectus.\u201d 421 U.S. at 727, 95 S.Ct. at 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-8\">In a comprehensive opinion which traces the purpose of Section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)-5 and the judicially created cause of action to which they give rise, the Supreme Court, adopting the rationale of <em>Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 </em>F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952), held that <em>only actual </em>purchasers or sellers of a security, relying upon an alleged violation of Section 10(b), may bring an action for money damages based upon Section 10(b). (Emphasis added.) <em>See Shivers v. Amerco, </em>670 F.2d 826, 829 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Sanders v. Thrall Manufacturing Co., </em>582 F.Supp. 945 [1983 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep.

The Court then expressed its concern that the failure to follow the rule may result in \u201cvexatious litigation\u201d caused by a \u201cwidely expanded class of plaintiffs\u201d bringing \u201cstrike\u201d suits under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. 421 U.S. 737-41, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-28. In recent Supreme Court decisions, the Court has refused to ignore the literal, \u201coperative language\u201d of the securities statutes and has denied plaintiffs the statutory construction which they desired but which conflicted with that literal language. <em>See Chiarella v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 222, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980); <em>Santa Fe Indus, v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). Furthermore, the Court has refused plaintiffs\u2019 requests that it supplement the existing securities statutes by providing a private right of action by implication where the statute itself said nothing about such a right. <em>See, e.g., Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 568-78, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2485-90, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979) (construing Securities Exchange Act \u00a7 17(a)); <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v.

While it is true that in many of these cases the Court supported its decisions with policy arguments and legislative history analyses, in most of them the Court emphasized that the language of the statute was at least the starting place of the Court\u2019s inquiry. <em>See, e.g., Chiarella v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 222, 226, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 1113, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980); <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 16, 100 S.Ct. 242, 245, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 568, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2485, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979); <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Indus., Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 24, 97 S.Ct. 926, 940, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); <em>Santa Fe Indus. v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 472, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 1300, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1383, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). In a number of these cases, the Court intimated that the statutory language alone could determine the meaning of the statute, at least where the construction sought by the plaintiff conflicted witji the precise literal language of the existing statute. Thus, in <em>Blue Chip Stamps, </em>Justice Powell, concurring, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-6\">The courts already have inferred a private cause of action that was not authorized by the legislation. In doing this, however, it was unnecessary to rewrite the precise language of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. This (rewriting of the statutory language, which the Court refused to permit) is exactly what respondent ... sought in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-7\">421 U.S. at 759, 95 S.Ct. at 1936. (footnote omitted). The majority opinion in <em>Blue Chip Stamps </em>also recognized that in some circumstances the statutory language itself could be dispositive: \u201cIf Congress had legislated the elements of a private cause of action for damages, the duty of the judicial branch would be to administer the law which Congress enacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748, 95 S.Ct. at 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-8\">When the Third Circuit Court of Appeals was faced with this issue, it refused to expand the rule beyond the exceptions noted by the Supreme Court. <em>See Pittsburgh Terminal Corp. v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, </em>680 F.2d 933 (3d Cir. 1982) (the Court held that the conversion option in a convertible debenture qualifies as a contract for the purchase or sale of security).</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-9\">Therefore, in the present case, this Court finds that Kalmanovitz failed to either purchase or sell any shares pursuant to the HBC Offer, and as a result, he lacks standing to maintain an action for money damages under either Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>e. <em>Count VI: Illegal Agreement to Vote Pabst Treasury Stock</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">Although the parties did not address the issue, because the state and federal claims are derived from \u201ca common nucleus of operative fact,\u201d this Court has the power and may exercise its discretion and consider the pendent state claim even though the federal claims are dismissed. <em>See generally United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1965), and <em>Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>587 F.Supp. 1112 (D.Del.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">In Count VI of his Complaint, Kalmanovitz alleges that: \u201cIf the terms contemplated by the Agreement in Principle and the Heileman Offer are consummated, the tendered shares of Pabst common stock will belong to Pabst or will be under the control of Pabst within the meaning of Section 160(c).\u201d (8 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 160) (D.I. 1, \u00b6 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">Defendants argue that the tendered shares belonged to HBC at the time they were voted and because the plaintiff failed to allege that the Pabst shares HBC agreed to vote in the merger did not \u201cbelong to\u201d Pabst, directly or indirectly, the plaintiff has failed to allege any basis for a violation of Section 160. (D.I. 166 at 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">Section 160(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1470-8\">(c) Shares of its own capital stock <em>belonging to the corporation or to another corporation, </em>if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, <em>directly or indirectly, </em>by the corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the right of any corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1470-11\">8 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 160(c) (emphasis added). Although the language of 8 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 160(c) is unambiguous, there is a question as to the exact meaning of \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d and unfortunately the case law provides little guidance. In <em>Italo Petroleum Corp. v. Producers\u2019 Oil Corp. of America, </em>20 Del.Ch. 283, 174 A. 276 (1934), the court was faced with an issue which arose under the predecessor to Section 160.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that case, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1470-12\">The statute prevents the voting either directly or indirectly by a corporation of its own stock belonging to it. What can \u201cindirectly\u201d mean unless it be some such thing as having stock belonging to the corporation held in some third party\u2019s name and having that third party vote it? It requires some moments of reflection to discover any other possible device of indirection which the corporation could conjure up. The thought I have given to the matter, which I confess has not been lengthy, has failed to suggest any other. There may be other methods. But the one suggested is so obvious that it is reasonable to suppose that it certainly was dominant in the legislative mind when the section was enacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1470-13\">There can be no doubt that if a corporation acquired its own stock and caused it to be held in the name of an individual who would vote it as ordered by the corporation\u2019s directors, the vote of the individual would be the vote, indirectly given, of the corporation. Nor can there be any doubt that if a corporation planned to buy its own stock and its directors, desiring to vote that stock in violation of the statutory inhibition, organized a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the stock and vote it, the scheme would prove abortive. It would be so crude as to lack even the merit of cleverness. The fiction of the corporate entity would in that case be brushed aside and the device unhesitatingly pronounced but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>a mere scheme for the indirect voting by the corporation of its own stock in violation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1471-6\">174 A. at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-7\">It is defendants\u2019 position that there is nothing in the Complaint to support the allegation that Pabst directly or indirectly owned or controlled the shares purchased by Heileman and subsequently cancelled in the merger. Although there are allegations of an agreement between Pabst and Heileman, the agreement does not rise to the level of control, domination and dictation consistent with a parent-subsidiary relationship noted in <em>Italo Petroleum Corp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1471-8\">As a result, plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendants have violated 8 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 160(c) of the Delaware Corporation Law will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-9\">f. <em>Count VII: Smith\u2019s Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1471-10\">In Count VII of the Complaint (D.I. 1, \u00b6\u00b61 76-82), plaintiffs allege that defendant Smith, the Chief Executive Officer of Pabst, breached his duty to the Pabst shareholders under Delaware law. Before reaching the merits, the Court must first determine whether the plaintiff has standing to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-11\">(I) <em>Derivative Nature of the Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1471-12\">[II] Whether a claim is individual or derivative is determined from the body of the complaint, not the label employed by counsel. <em>Crane v. Harsco, </em>511 F.Supp. at 304. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim here is that Smith breached his fiduciary duties to Pabst and its shareholders \u201cthrough the mismanagement, waste and conversion of assets.\u201d (D.I. 1, <em>\u00b6 </em>82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-13\">Although Kalmanovitz purports to bring these claims both individually and derivatively on behalf of the corporation, it is clear from every claim alleged by Kalmanovitz under Count VII that it constitutes a derivative claim because each alleged injury is one which would be suffered by all the stockholders of Pabst due to their status as stockholders and not as the result of any unique relationship with the corporation. <em>See Elster v. American Airlines, </em>34 Del.Ch. 94, 100 A.2d 219, 222 (1953); <em>Bokat v. Getty Oil Company, </em>262 A.2d 246, 249 (Del.Supr.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-15\">The plaintiffs\u2019 standing to pursue derivative claims alleging violations of Delaware common law is also a question of substantive Delaware law. <em>See Crane v. Harsco, </em>511 F.Supp. at 304 (alleged violations of Delaware law in connection with a tender offer were reviewed under Delaware law). It is well established under Delaware law that a plaintiff who brings a derivative suit on behalf of a corporation must be a stockholder of the corporation at the time he commences the suit and must maintain that status throughout the course of the litigation. <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>453 A.2d 474 (Del.Ch.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>477 A.2d 1040 (Del.1984); <em>Heit v. Tenneco, </em>319 F.Supp. 884 (D.Del.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-16\">In <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>the Delaware Supreme Court held that \u201ca plaintiff who ceases to be a shareholder, whether by reason of a merger or for any other reason, loses standing to continue a derivative suit____\u201d 477 A.2d at 1049. <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>a suit by a Conoco stockholder alleging derivative claims was dismissed when, subsequent to the filing of the suit, a third party (DuPont Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company) acquired all of the outstanding stock of Conoco through a tender offer followed by a merger. The court, in its analysis, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-19\">[T]he right to a pending cause of action is an asset of the merged corporation which passes to the corporation surviving the merger. Under the facts of this case, any right to equitable relief possessed by the original Conoco against the individual defendants, its officers and directors, passed to DuPont Holdings, and thus to the present Conoco, by virtue of the merger. Likewise, by the terms of the same merger, the plaintiff Lewis ceased to be a shareholder of Conoco \u2014 either new or old \u2014 and instead became a shareholder of Du Pont. The company of which the plaintiff is now a shareholder, Du Pont, now owns all of the stock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>the present Conoco and, if the original Conoco had a claim for relief against its former officers and directors for the reasons set forth in the Complaint in this action, that claim is now owned by the present Conoco. The shareholder beneficiary of such a claim is now Du Pont, and not the plaintiff Lewis and the other shareholders of the original Conoco as was the situation when the suit was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvGY\">477 A.2d at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">The court recognized only two exceptions to this rule \u2014 where the merger itself is the subject of a claim of fraud (i.e., a device to eliminate the derivative litigation) or where the merger is a holding company reorganization which does not affect plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the business enterprise. 477 A.2d at 1046, n. 10. Neither exception is applicable in this case. As in <em>Lewis, </em>\u201cplaintiff has not asserted that the merger was perpetrated [to deprive Pabst] of its claim against the individual defendant and the merger was clearly not a reorganization resulting in a holding company____\u201d <em>Id. See also Schreiber v. Carney, </em>447 A.2d 17, 21-22 (Del.Ch.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-7\">The plaintiffs also allege in a conclusory fashion that unlike the plaintiff in <em>Lewis, </em>Kalmanovitz attacks the fairness of the merger and wrongdoing by the acquiring corporation. In addition, after stating the two exceptions to the rule regarding standing and mergers, Kalmanovitz concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVY\">These exceptions are both applicable to this case. Plaintiff here possesses the same equitable derivative standing as the plaintiffs in the above cited cases. The plaintiff should have standing to maintain a derivative suit to correct an alleged breach of fiduciary duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-8\">Plaintiff possesses equitable derivative standing to bring this claim against defendants Smith. Plaintiff falls within the standing exception of both <em>Bokat </em>and <em>Schreiber. </em>Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1472-10\">(D.I. 168 at 30.) Needless to say, without any factual support, this Court is not persuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 \u201carguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-11\">However, the Court does find that as a result of the merger, Kalmanovitz has ceased to have any equity interest, direct or indirect, in Pabst. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not fit within either exception to the broad rule that a plaintiff who, as a result of a merger, loses his stockholder status, loses his standing to pursue derivative claims. As a result, Count VII must be dismissed due to plaintiffs\u2019 lack of standing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-12\">g. <em>Count VIII: Conspiracy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-13\">Count VIII of the Complaint alleges <em>in toto:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-14\">83. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 82 as if fully set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-15\">84. Each defendant has agreed and conspired with one or more of the other defendants to violate the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, as set forth above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1472-16\">(D.I. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.) It is a longstanding rule in the Third Circuit that a mere general allegation of conspiracy is insufficient. <em>Black &amp; Yates, Inc. v. Mahogany Assoc., </em>129 F.2d 227 (3d Cir.1942); <em>Leeward Petroleum, Ltd. v. Mene Grande Oil Co., </em>415 F.Supp. 158 (D.Del.1976). A general averment of conspiracy or collusion without alleging the facts which constituted such conspiracy or collusion is a conclusion of law and is insufficient. As has been noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-17\">Generally, fraud, conspiracy and collusion must be charged by allegations of fact; and general allegations of fraud, fraudulent intent, and conspiracy or collusion, without a statement of supporting facts, are conclusions of law and are insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>71 C.J.S. <em>Pleading </em>\u00a7 21. The plaintiffs must plead with particularity the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of the alleged wrongdoing in order to place the defendants on notice of the precise misconduct with which they are charged. <em>See Seville Industrial Machinery Corp. v. Southmost Machinery Corp., </em>742 F.2d 786 (3d Cir.1984). Only allegations of conspiracy which are particularized, such as those addressing the period of the conspiracy, the object of the conspiracy, and certain actions of the alleged conspirators taken to achieve that purpose, will be deemed sufficient. <em>See, e.g., James Julian, Inc. v. Raytheon, Co., </em>499 F.Supp. 949, 955 (D.Del.1980). To establish the specificity of their conspiracy allegations, plaintiffs do no more than refer the Court to the eighty-one paragraphs included, by reference, in Count VIII and state that they \u201cgive rise to an inference of conspiracy.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (D.I. 168 at 34.) Such an inference, even if it could be gleaned from the Complaint, would be no substitute for the requirement that the circumstances of the conspiracy be plead with specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">As a result, Count VIII will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-6\">h. <em>Count IX: Purported Threat to Competition </em>\u2014 Claims <em>Are Moot</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIPG\">In Count IX of his Complaint, Kalmanovitz contends <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cunless enjoined, the effect of the Heileman/Pabst Offer challenged herein will be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly\u201d in the malt beverage business due, essentially, to the combined resources of Pabst, Olympia and Heileman and the elimination of Pabst from the market. (D.I. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 116-19.) The claim is brought pursuant to Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18, which prohibits corporate mergers or acquisitions the effect of which \u201cmay be to substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly.\u201d Plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to enjoin the HBC Offer in December of 1982. (D.I. 167, Ex. H.) Subsequently, the Pabst/Heileman transaction was consummated and both Heileman and HBC were removed from any stock ownership position in either Pabst or Olympia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-12\">The sole basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 Count IX was plaintiffs\u2019 apparent apprehension of the imminent injury that Heileman\u2019s control of Pabst would purportedly cause in the market for malt beverages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As this Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1473-13\">[Mjovants [Kalmanovitz and two of his brewing companies] have argued ... that the proposed Final Judgment [i.e., consent decree] would not effectively prevent Heileman from exercising control over all the assets of Pabst and Olympia. This contention, however, has by time gone by the board. With the consummation of the exchange transaction on March 19, 1983, Heileman has transferred all of its Pabst and Olympia stock to Pabst in exchange for the retained assets and Pabst <em>again has become an independent company beyond Heileman\u2019s control. At that point, any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number><em>previous concern about the adequacy of the proposed judgment in precluding Heileman from exercising any control over, or retaining any interest in, the non-retained assets has become moot. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1474-4\"><em>United States v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., </em>563 F.Supp. 642, 651 (D.Del.1983). The consent decree, as suggested, prevented Heileman from retaining any interest in or control over Pabst and Olympia assets except for specific assets acquired without governmental objection. <em>(Id. </em>at 644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-5\">Plaintiffs also argued that Count IX is not moot on the ground that post-acquisition evidence is \u201csignificant in determining the validity of the merger.\u201d However, plaintiffs ignore the fact that the post-acquisition evidence here conclusively demonstrates that the very basis for the Section 7 claim \u2014 that Heileman would continue to control all Pabst/Olympia assets \u2014 has evaporated. As this Court found in connection with the government consent decree proceedings, any claim based on that theory is now moot. <em>United States v. Heileman Brewing Co., </em>563 F.Supp. 642, 650 (D.Del.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">i. <em>Count X: Lack of Standing to Assert Violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1474-7\">In Count X, Kalmanovitz again claims the right to sue the defendants under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, i.e., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18. Count X is based on a claim that, subsequent to a successful completion of the HBC/Heileman tender offer and the exchange of shares for assets with Pabst, what remains of Pabst/Olympia \u201cwill not be viable as a competitor\u201d in the production, distribution and sale of malt beverages in the United States. (D.I. 1 at 31-32.) In order to have standing to sue under the antitrust laws, generally a plaintiff must adequately allege (1) a violation of the antitrust law; (2) injury to his business or property; and (3) a causal relationship between the violation of his injury, that is, that the injury complained of was caused by the antitrust violation charged. <em>See </em>Yon Kalinowski, <em>Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation, \u00a7 101.02, Standing to Sue </em>(1983 ed.); <em>see, e.g., Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>183 F. 704 (3d Cir.1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-9\">Kalmanovitz\u2019s role as a competitor does not give him automatic standing to sue under the antitrust laws. <em>Bayou Bottling, Inc. v. Dr. Pepper Co., </em>725 F.2d 300 [1984-1] Trade Cases (CCH) \u00b6 65,866 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., </em>[1984-1] Trade Cases \u00b6 65,848 (N.D.Okla. 1984). Appropriate injury must be pleaded and the plaintiffs have failed to cogently claim how the alleged non-viability of the post-merger Pabst would in any manner <em>injure them. </em>Plaintiffs claim only that, as competitors, the \u201csix separate and distinct injuries\u201d contained in Paragraph 120 of Count IX, and incorporated by reference in Paragraph 120 of Count X, constitute the injury necessary to confer standing. (D.I. 168 at 36.) The alleged injuries set forth in Paragraph 119, however, are all premised on Heileman\u2019s continued ownership of Pabst, and are therefore inapposite to the Count X claim that competition will be lessened because the Pabst that remains, after the transactions with Heileman are completed, will not be a viable competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-10\">With respect to the remaining effects alleged in paragraph 121 of Count X, there has been <em>no </em>attempt to show that <em>plaintiffs </em>have suffered any injury at all, let alone to make the required showing that plaintiffs have suffered <em>\u201cantitrust </em>injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S.Ct. 690, 697, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977). Indeed, there is no way that plaintiffs could make the required showing, since the alleged antitrust violation is Pabst\u2019s weakness as a competitor and since such weakness would benefit, not hurt, its competitors such as Kalmanovitz. See <em>Schoenkopf v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>637 F.2d 205 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-11\">Plaintiffs' theory of injury under Count X does not meet the threshold standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>requirements, therefore, Count X will be dismissed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-5\">Accordingly, the Court finding that Counts I through X are without merit, those counts will be dismissed and summary judgment entered thereon in favor of defendants and against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-6\">IV. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 RULE 54(b) MOTION TO CERTIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-7\">This consolidated litigation as above captioned originally consisted of three separate law suits. The first was the twelve count complaint filed in this Court as C.A. No. 82-797. The second was the two count complaint brought by plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d). (D.I. 41.) The third was brought by the plaintiffs in the Superior Court of California for the County of Marin (the \u201cCalifornia State Court action\u201d). Defendants thereafter removed the latter action to the California District Court, consolidated with the second action, and then upon defendants\u2019 motion transferred to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). (D.I. 70.) Upon the transfer of California actions here, those actions were consolidated with C.A. No. 82-797.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-8\">In <em>Kalmanovitz v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc., </em>576 F.Supp. 922 (D.Del.1983), this Court dismissed Counts XI and XII of the complaint in C.A. No. 82-797 and both Counts of the California District Court complaint against all of the named defendants. (D.I. 139.) In accordance with this opinion, the Court will enter an order dismissing all of the remaining counts (Count I through X) of the complaint in C.A. No. 82-797 against all of the named defendants. These dismissals result in leaving only one claim outstanding and unresolved. The unresolved claim is found in the complaint originally filed by the plaintiffs in the California State Court action against only defendants Irwin Jacobs, Dennis Mathisen, Gerald A. Schwalbach and Daniel T. Lindsay (the \u201cJacobs Group\u201d) for breach of contract. (D.I. 71, Ex. A.) In that complaint plaintiffs allege that the individuals of the Jacobs Group by a letter dated November 18, 1982, unconditionally bound themselves to pay plaintiffs fifty percent of all proceeds should the Jacobs Group sell its Pabst shares to others for more than $24 per share.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-11\">Since plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim against the Jacobs Group is the only one which remains unresolved in this consolidated litigation, the Court finds no just reason exists for delay in entering a final judgment on all claims which were dismissed on November 21, 1983, or by the order to be entered today. This is so because the major claims involving federal securities violations, antitrust violations and tortious interference with contract claims have already been timely decided. The sole remaining breach of contract claim is subsidiary and unrelated to those issues and it involves fewer than all the multiple parties to this suit. It would be unduly harsh and wholly unrealistic to delay an appeal on the major unrelated issues until after trial of the subsidiary breach of contract claim. Accordingly, the Court will enter a Rule 54(b) certification on the claims already decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>An order will be entered in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1460-10\">.
