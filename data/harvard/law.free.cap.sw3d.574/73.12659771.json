PALAFOX, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellant, Cimarex Energy Co. (Cimarex) and Appellee, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (Anadarko), were co-tenants on certain property located in Ward County, both of whom held leases giving each of them undivided fractional mineral interests on the same property. After Anadarko successfully completed drilling operations on two producing wells on the property, Cimarex sued Anadarko alleging it had failed to account for Cimarex's share of the production. In June 2013, the parties entered into a settlement agreement requiring Anadarko to make a settlement payment for production from the two wells through May 2013, and to account to Cimarex monthly thereafter for its share of production. In August 2015, Cimarex filed the underlying lawsuit contending that Anadarko breached the Settlement Agreement when it failed to account monthly for Cimarex's share of production. Both parties moved for summary judgment, with Cimarex contending that Anadarko breached the agreement as a matter of law, while Anadarko claimed that its obligation to make payments ceased because Cimarex's lease had expired, and because Cimarex was therefore no longer a co-tenant with any interest in the property. The trial court granted Anadarko's motion for summary judgment, but denied Cimarex's cross-motion, and this appeal followed. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cimarex's Interests\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December of 2009, Cimarex leased a fractional undivided 1/6th mineral\n   interest in approximately 440 acres in Ward County, Texas, (the subject property) from the Estate of F. Kirk Johnson, III (the Cimarex lease).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Cimarex lease contained a habendum clause, which provided for a primary term of five years, and a secondary term, stating that the lease remained in force after the primary term \"as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from said land or from land with which said land is pooled.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lease was considered \"paid-up\" for the primary term, meaning that Cimarex was not required to commence drilling operations during that period of time, and was not required to pay any delay rentals to the lessor during the five years, regardless of whether it commenced operations or not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips Co. v.

The Cimarex lease, however, specified that despite the fact that the five-year primary term was paid-up, this did not relieve Cimarex of \"the obligation to pay royalties on actual production\" during that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Cimarex did not drill a well or commence operations for drilling a well on the subject property during the primary term of the Cimarex lease, i.e., from December of 2009 until December of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anadarko's Interests\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the meantime, between 2007 and 2010, Anadarko acquired the balance of the mineral estate in the subject property from various prior lessees, ultimately obtaining the remaining undivided 5/6th fractional mineral interest in the subject property. In addition, Anadarko obtained an entire 6/6ths leasehold mineral interest in the 200-acre remainder of the same tract of land also owned by the Johnson Estate, immediately south of the subject property (the \"Southern property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011 and 2012, the Texas Railroad Commission issued permits for Anadarko to commence drilling operations on two wells on the subject property: Murjo 1 and Murjo 2 (the Murjo Wells). The parties agree that no later than February 2012, cumulative sales from the Murjo 1 Well exceeded its cumulative drilling and operations costs, and the well continued to produce in paying quantities since that time. The parties also agreed that not later than December 2012, cumulative sales from Murjo 2 exceeded its cumulative drilling and operations costs, and the well continued to produce in paying quantities since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2012, Anadarko also commenced drilling operations on a third well on the Southern property, located near its southern border. Due to its proximity to the subject property, Anadarko sent Cimarex a Rule 37 notice of its intention to drill along the border of the property, but Cimarex did not object to the third well's location.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That well became fully operational on May 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early 2011, F. Kirk Johnson, IV and Marsland Johnson succeeded the interests of the Johnson estate and became the new lessors of the Cimarex lease (\"the lessors\"). In August 2011, the lessors granted Petro-Land Group, Inc., two top leases covering the subject property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June 2012, Anadarko succeeded the interests of Petro-Land Group by assignment and obtained its interest in both top leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Property Dispute\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 14, 2012, the lessors, having learned that drilling had begun on the subject property, sent an email to Cimarex demanding that it pay them for Cimarex's proportionate share of royalties on the production. Thereafter, on September 21, 2012, Cimarex sent Anadarko a letter stating that it was aware that Anadarko had drilled and completed the three wells, without seeking its participation. In the letter, Cimarex indicated that it had previously asked Anadarko to \"afford Cimarex the opportunity to join in the participation of the subject wells from inception,\" and that it was formally making that request, as well as requesting that the parties enter into a joint operating agreement for each of the subject wells. In addition, Cimarex, identifying itself as a \"co-tenant with a carried working interest ... in the subject wells[,]\" requested an immediate accounting of the \"costs and revenues associated with each of the subject wells[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It appears that Anadarko did not immediately provide accounting information to Cimarex, and in correspondence dated December 4, 2012, Cimarex made a second formal request for this information, noting that its lessors were being \"inconvenienced\" as Cimarex could not determine its proportionate share of the royalties it owed to them, without obtaining such information. In response, on January 2, 2013, Anadarko sent Cimarex a letter in which it recognized that Cimarex had a 1/6th interest in the minerals located on the subject property, describing Cimarex as a \"non-participating co-tenant,\" and acknowledging that Cimarex was entitled to its \"net share of proceeds after payout.\" Anadarko also provided Cimarex with information pertaining to the current payout status of each well, together with information regarding payment statements from\n   the date of first sales for the second Murjo Well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The First Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 12, 2013, apparently after payments were not forthcoming, Cimarex filed its first lawsuit against Anadarko, alleging that the two parties were \"tenants-in-common\" on the subject property, with Cimarex owning an undivided 1/6th leasehold mineral interest, and Anadarko owning the remaining 5/6th leasehold mineral interest. In the lawsuit, Cimarex alleged that Anadarko had drilled two wells on the property, without Cimarex's consent, and had refused Cimarex's offer to participate in the cost of the drilling. Cimarex requested an accounting of the proceeds from the two wells in excess of the reasonable and necessary costs of production. Cimarex further estimated, based on sales statements, that Anadarko owed it approximately $3.5 million for the net proceeds from the first well, and an undetermined amount for the second well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Attempts to Pool the Third Well\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the meantime, in December of 2012, Cimarex sent Anadarko a letter acknowledging that the third well was not located on the subject property but noting that it was drilled approximately one foot from the Cimarex lease line. Cimarex proposed the idea of pooling certain portions of the companies' respective leaseholds to form a pooled unit around the third well, referred to as the \"Proposed Unit.\" Cimarex then made a \"Voluntary Pooling Offer,\" suggesting that the two parties voluntarily pool all of their mineral interests within the boundaries of the Proposed Unit, sharing both \"production and the costs\" of the well. In response, Anadarko sent Cimarex a letter dated January 3, 2013, rejecting the offer, reminding Cimarex that it had previously provided it with a Rule 37 notice regarding the well's location, and that Cimarex did not object to the location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 6, 2013, Cimarex filed an application with the Texas Railroad Commission, seeking to force Anadarko to form a pooled unit around the third well, pursuant to the Texas Mineral Interest Pooling Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its application, Cimarex contended that the third well was \"draining hydrocarbons from beneath Cimarex's leasehold,\" and that in the absence of compulsory pooling, Cimarex would not be compensated for the drainage. Cimarex further alleged that it would be required to drill unnecessary wells in order to recover the same hydrocarbons, and that it would therefore be in the interests of both parties to create a pooling unit, so that each party could receive its respective fair share of hydrocarbons from the field.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Settlement Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In June 2013, Cimarex and Anadarko signed a confidential settlement agreement to resolve Cimarex's first lawsuit and the forced pooling application (the Settlement Agreement). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Anadarko agreed to an accounting for Cimarex's share of production\n   from the two wells on the subject property, with Anadarko agreeing to pay Cimarex for its 1/6th \"non-participating co-tenant share of the value of production\" through May 2013, \"less only Cimarex's 1/6th co-tenant share of the reasonable drilling, completion and operations costs\" of the two wells. The Settlement Agreement also provided that going forward, Anadarko would \"account to Cimarex monthly for its share of production,\" and would provide documents to show the production revenues and allowed cost deductions on the two wells. Both parties agreed to take responsibility for paying their respective royalty interests to the lessors. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Cimarex nonsuited its first lawsuit against Anadarko and dismissed its application to force-pool the third well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Current Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Anadarko thereafter paid Cimarex monthly from July of 2013 to December of 2014 for Cimarex's share of production, less its proportional share of operation expenses, and provided Cimarex with information to support its calculations. And based on that information, Cimarex fully paid royalties to the lessors for its share of production, according to the terms of its lease, dating back to the first date of production on the two wells. However, after December 21, 2014-the termination date for the primary term of Cimarex's lease on the subject property-Anadarko admittedly ceased making payments to Cimarex, based on its belief that Cimarex's lease had expired and that Cimarex no longer had any interest in the property that would entitle it to a share of the production. As well, at this same time, again believing that Cimarex's bottom lease had expired, Anadarko asserted its entitlement to the top lease over Cimarex's 1/6th mineral interest on the property, paying a bonus to the lessors to activate the lease, which they accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 26, 2015, Cimarex filed a breach of contract suit which forms the basis for this appeal, claiming that Anadarko breached its contractual obligations under the Settlement Agreement \"by failing to account to Cimarex monthly for Cimarex's share of production from the wells.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Summary Judgment Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Anadarko thereafter moved for a traditional summary judgment, seeking dismissal of Cimarex's lawsuit, based on its affirmative defense that Cimarex's lease had terminated at the end of its primary term in December of 2014, due to Cimarex's failure to drill or operate a well on the subject property before the expiration of the primary term. Anadarko argued that the terms of Cimarex's lease required Cimarex to directly cause production on the subject property in order to extend the lease to the secondary term, and that Cimarex could not rely on Anadarko's actions in causing production to extend the lease. Anadarko argued that because the lease had terminated, Anadarko's top lease took effect, and consequently, Cimarex had no interest remaining in the subject property and was therefore not entitled to an accounting for production from the two wells on the subject property. Anadarko concluded that it therefore had no duty under the Settlement Agreement to continue to account for production after that time. In support of its argument, Anadarko attached the parties' stipulated facts and asserted that there were no material questions of fact to be decided, and that instead, the only question to be decided was of a legal nature, i.e., whether Cimarex's lease on the subject property had in fact expired, thereby absolving Anadarko of any obligation to continue accounting to Cimarex for its production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Cimarex thereafter filed its own motion for \"partial summary judgment\" on the issue of Anadarko's liability for breach of the Settlement Agreement, arguing that the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Anadarko had in fact breached the Agreement. In its motion, Cimarex argued that, as a matter of law, its lease did not terminate at the end of the primary term, and that instead, the lease continued into the secondary term, arguing that, under the terms of the lease, it was entitled to rely on Anadarko's production to extend the lease into the secondary term, or alternatively that the Settlement Agreement served as a joint operating agreement between Cimarex and Anadarko, which served to satisfy any requirement that Cimarex may have had to actively participate in the production. In addition, Cimarex argued that Anadarko was estopped from arguing that its lease was terminated, as Anadarko stepped into the shoes of the lessors, who had been accepting royalty payments from Cimarex, which Cimarex argued estopped the lessors-and hence Anadarko-from asserting that the lease was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Trial Court's Ruling\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After holding a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, after which the trial court took the matter under submission, the trial court issued a written order on July 18, 2016, in which it denied Cimarex's motion for partial summary judgment, and granted Anadarko's motion for full summary judgment. In its order, the trial court specifically determined that Anadarko's summary judgment evidence established as a matter of law, that the Cimarex lease terminated on December 21, 2014, at the end of its primary term, and was not extended into a secondary term. The trial court ordered that Cimarex was to take nothing on its claim for breach of contract, and later reduced its ruling to a final judgment dismissing Cimarex's lawsuit, and awarding attorney's fees in an amount stipulated to by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In four issues-three of which we consider together-Cimarex contends that the trial court erred in granting Anadarko's motion for summary judgment and/or in denying its cross-motion. In the three related issues, Cimarex contends that the trial court erred in concluding that its lease had terminated in December of 2014. Cimarex contends that the terms of the lease were ambiguous with regard to whether Cimarex was required to directly cause production on the property to keep the lease alive into the second term, and that this raised a question of fact for the jury to resolve. In the alternative, Cimarex contends that the lease unambiguously allowed it to rely on Anadarko's production, without the need for it to independently cause production to extend the lease beyond the primary term, and that the parties stipulated that there was in fact continuing production on the property by Anadarko. As a sub-argument to this issue, Cimarex contends that the Settlement Agreement served as a joint operating agreement, which allowed Cimarex to claim Anadarko's production as its own thereby extending the lease into the secondary term, again as a matter of law. Cimarex also contends that, even if the\n   lease should be interpreted otherwise, Anadarko, who stepped into the shoes of the lessors, was estopped from claiming that the lease terminated, based on the lessors' acceptance of royalty payments from Cimarex. And finally, Cimarex argues in a fifth issue, that if the summary judgment cannot stand and is reversed, the award of attorney's fees must be reversed as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review on Traditional Summary Judgment Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, we review a trial court's order granting a traditional motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.

In support of its argument, Cimarex first points out that the habendum clause in the lease stated that the lease was to remain in effect after the expiration of the initial five-year term for \"as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from said land or from land with which said land is pooled.\" Cimarex argues that the plain language of the habendum clause, which was written in the passive voice, only required production on the subject property, and did not require Cimarex to be the one to actually cause the production. Cimarex points out that there was in fact production on the subject property-albeit production caused by Anadarko-and contends that this was sufficient to extend the lease into its secondary term. According to Cimarex, the parties deliberately chose to draft the lease in the passive voice, allowing for any production on the subject property to suffice to extend the lease into the secondary term, regardless of who caused the production. Cimarex contends that if we were to add in the requirement that Cimarex had to be the one to cause production we would be adding in a term not found in the lease. In other words, we would be rewriting terms and going against the intent of the parties. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As Anadarko points out, various Texas courts, including this Court, have interpreted similar mineral leases-which contain habendum clauses requiring production to keep a lease alive without specifying who was required to cause the production-to impose an obligation on the lessee to actually cause the production.

For example, as set forth above, the lease expressly required Cimarex to pay royalties on actual production during both the primary and secondary terms of the lease. The lease also contained a \"cessation\" clause, which stated that if, \"after the expiration of the primary term, all wells upon said land should become incapable of producing for any cause, this Lease shall not terminate if\n   <em>\n    Lessee\n   </em>\n   commences operations for additional drilling or for reworking within 60 days thereafter, and shall remain in force so long as operations are prosecuted with no cessation of more than 60 consecutive days, whether such operations be on the same well or on a different or additional well or wells [emphasis added].\" In addition, the lease expressly gave Cimarex the right and power to pool or combine the lease with other co-tenants on the property, requiring Cimarex to designate any pooled units, and expressly stating that production from such pooled units would be considered as \"production\" under the terms of the lease. As well, the lease gave Cimarex the right to assign the lease and further gave it use of oil, gas and water from the land for its operations. And finally, the lease gave Cimarex the right to remove its property from the lease at the expiration of the lease's term. Accordingly, as in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , these provisions imply that the lessors intended for Cimarex to be the one to cause production on the property in order to extend the lease into the secondary term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Cimarex, however, seeks to distinguish its lease from the one in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , pointing out that the lease in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   contained an \"unless\" clause governing the entire lease term, allowing the lessee to substitute actual production with payment of delay rentals, while the Cimarex lease contains a \"thereafter\" clause requiring production in the secondary term only, and not offering the option of paying delay rentals. We conclude, however, that the same principles govern the interpretation of both types of leases. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , where a mineral lease states that its primary intent is for the exploration, drilling and production of oil and gas, it naturally follows that the lessors' intent is to require the lessee to, at some point in time, take action to cause production on the land, or provide some type of cash consideration, such as delay rental payments, to keep a lease alive.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10137264\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/540/742/\">\n    540 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   743 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hydrocarbon Mgmt.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008928\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/861/427/\">\n    861 S.W.2d at 437-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where the purpose stated in the habendum clauses of the leases is for \" 'exploring, drilling, mining and operating for and producing oil, gas and all other minerals ...'

The lessees, however, argued that because the lease did not specify who was required to commence drilling, they were permitted to rely on their co-tenants' drilling operations to keep the lease alive after the first anniversary of the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 340-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument, pointing out that the clear intent of the lease was to require the lessees to commence drilling during the primary term, or in the alternative to pay delay rentals, in order to keep the lease alive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 340-41. The Court held that it would be contrary to the uniform holding of the Texas decisions that in an oil and gas lease, \"where there is no cash consideration paid, the drilling for and the production of oil or gas by the lessee is the prime consideration, and if not so stated in the lease will be read into it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 341. As such, we conclude that the requirement that a lessee must take action to keep a lease alive, in the absence of some form of cash consideration, remains the same-regardless of whether the lease contains an \"unless\" clause and/or a \"thereafter\" clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the present case, the primary term of the Cimarex lease was based on a cash consideration, as this portion of the lease was \"paid-up.\" And, as discussed above, this meant that Cimarex was not required to engage in any activities in order to keep the lease alive during that term. However, the secondary term was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   based on a cash consideration, and instead required actual production on the land. Therefore, we conclude that the intent of the lease was in fact to require Cimarex to take some action to cause production on the subject property in order to keep the lease alive, and that it could not simply rely on a cotenant's production in the absence of any cash consideration paid to the lessors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Payment of Royalties Did Not Extend the Lease into the Secondary Term\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Cimarex next points out that it paid royalties to the lessors during the primary term based on Anadarko's production on the land, and thus it contends that it would be inherently inconsistent to interpret the lease to require it to pay royalties on Anadarko's production during the primary term, while not allowing Cimarex to rely on Anadarko's production to keep the lease alive into the secondary term. In particular, Cimarex argues that the lease used the passive tense in describing the nature of the lease in both the primary and secondary terms, requiring Cimarex to pay royalties on any production on the land to keep the lease alive during the primary term, without specifying who was to cause the production, and similarly requiring production on the land to extend the lease into the secondary term, again without specifying who was to cause the production. Cimarex argues that given the similar use of the passive voice in both instances, the two should be construed in the same fashion; in effect, Cimarex argues that if this Court were to rewrite the lease to require it to cause production on the land to extend the lease, it would also be required to rewrite the lease to only require it to pay royalties on its own production as well, which would effectively entitle it to a refund of the payments that it made to the lessors. We disagree with this argument for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, we note that a lessor has the right to impose additional or different requirements on a lessee to keep a lease alive during the primary term, in contrast to those imposed in the secondary term.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PEC Minerals LP v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=439%20Fed.%20Appx.%20413\">\n    439 Fed. Appx. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (5th Cir. 2011) (recognizing a lessor's right to impose different requirements on a lessee during different terms of a lease). Thus, there is nothing inherently contradictory with a lessor requiring a lessee to make royalty payments on a co-tenant's production during the primary term of a lease-particularly where the primary term is paid-up-while at the same time requiring the lessee to cause its own production on the subject property in order to extend the lease into a secondary term, where there is no cash consideration paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, if we were to interpret the lease in the manner suggested by Cimarex, we would in effect be concluding that there were no significant differences between the requirements imposed on Cimarex in both the primary and secondary terms in the lease. In other words, under Cimarex's interpretation, the requirements imposed on Cimarex during both the primary term and the secondary term would be identical, with Cimarex only being required to pay royalties on Anadarko's production during both terms. If the lessors had wanted to impose the same requirements on Cimarex for both terms, i.e., the requirement to pay royalties on another cotenant's production-with no additional cash consideration paid and no additional obligations imposed on Cimarex-there would have been no point in dividing the habendum clause into two separate terms. In other words, this interpretation would render the secondary term completely superfluous and would go against the general principle that the parties intended every clause in the lease to have some effect.\n   <em>\n    Endeavor Energy Res., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657373\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/586/#p595\">\n    554 S.W.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This we decline to do, and instead, we find it appropriate to harmonize the two provisions in the lease to give effect to both of them, interpreting the lease to allow Cimarex to rely on Anadarko's production during the paid-up primary\n   term of the lease, while requiring it to cause its own production in the secondary term, as no cash consideration was given for that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cimarex's Public Policy Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Cimarex next raises a public policy argument, contending that we should not rule that its lease terminated based on its lack of production, pointing out that unlike the lessee in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , it made repeated unsuccessful attempts to enter into a formal joint operating agreement with Anadarko, the majority mineral interest owner, to participate in the Murjo Wells.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10137264\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/540/742/\">\n    540 S.W.2d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cimarex finds this distinction to be important, pointing out that as a minority mineral interest owner, it is at a distinct disadvantage when a majority interest owner rejects its attempts to join in its operations. In particular, Cimarex points out that minority-interest owners are often unable to economically commence operations on their own, without the cooperation of the majority interest owner; Cimarex asserts that if we rule that its lease terminated, despite its attempts to join in Anadarko's operations, this will place minority mineral interest owners, like itself, in an untenable financial position and would discourage operators from taking minority interest leases such as this in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Anadarko counters that Cimarex's request to participate in its operations should have no bearing on our decision, and we agree. As Anadarko points out, Cimarex and Anadarko were mere co-tenants on the property; they owed no duties to each other and were legally entitled to act independently. The law is well-settled that co-tenants with mineral interests on the same property may independently develop the land subject to their interest and may do so without permission of a non-participating co-tenant; conversely, a producing co-tenant cannot force the non-participating co-tenant to enter into an agreement to pay the costs of such production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

In particular, there is nothing in the Agreement indicating that Cimarex and Anadarko agreed to jointly develop the subject property or that the parties agreed to designate Anadarko as the operator; nor did the Agreement include any language to suggest that Cimarex was entitled to consider Anadarko's production as its own, or that the Agreement was intended to satisfy Cimarex's obligation to cause production on the land under the terms of its lease. And perhaps of most significance, there is nothing in the Settlement Agreement that allocated any of the costs or risks between the parties, or imposed any responsibility on Cimarex to share in any losses that Anadarko might incur in its operations; instead, Cimarex stood to reap the profits from Anadarko's production, while assuming no risk for any losses.

As such, the inclusion of these provisions does not persuade us that the parties intended for the Settlement Agreement to serve as the functional equivalent of a joint operating agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Parties' Post-Settlement Conduct did not Confirm the Existence of a Joint Operating Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Cimarex next contends that we should consider the actions that the parties took after they entered into the Settlement Agreement as being confirmation that they intended for the Agreement to serve as a joint operating agreement. In particular, Cimarex contends that Anadarko sent it information regarding its proportionate costs of repairs and other expenses, and on at least two occasions, asked Cimarex for approval of the costs. Cimarex also contends that Anadarko treated Cimarex in an identical manner after entering into the Settlement Agreement as it did another cotenant, SWEPI, LP, which had a formal operating agreement with Anadarko on the subject property. Cimarex contends that Anadarko's conduct should be considered in determining whether the Settlement Agreement can be considered the equivalent of a joint operating agreement, in order to keep its lease alive. We find this argument to be unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, and of most importance, as Anadarko points out, there are no ambiguities in the Settlement Agreement, and as set forth above, we must interpret an unambiguous agreement based on a review of the agreement itself, without considering evidence of the parties' conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frost Nat'l Bank v. L&amp;F Distrib., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9008268\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/165/310/\">\n    165 S.W.3d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 n.3 (Tex. 2005) (refusing to consider course of performance evidence when the plain language of the contract was clear);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11838446\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/964/89/#p110\">\n    964 S.W.2d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unambiguous mineral lease was to be construed as written);\n   <em>\n    Clayton Williams Energy, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   473 S.W.3d at 348 (citing\n   <em>\n    J.M.

In particular, we again find it significant that the Agreement expressly identified Cimarex as a \"non-participating cotenant,\" and contained no language that would indicate that the parties intended to treat their relationship as anything other than a co-tenancy. Therefore, we find that the parties' post-settlement conduct is irrelevant to our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, even if we were to consider the evidence of the parties' conduct, we agree with Anadarko that the evidence does not support a finding that the parties treated the Settlement Agreement as a joint operating agreement. As Anadarko points out, the parties did exchange information regarding the costs and expenses that Anadarko incurred in operating the Murjo Wells, but this was done primarily as a means of providing information on how Anadarko calculated Cimarex's net share of production, i.e., to apprise Cimarex of the costs it was deducting in arriving at that figure. And as Anadarko points out, there is no evidence that Cimarex agreed to shoulder any of the costs or to assume any of the liabilities of that production as one would expect if the parties were in a joint operating agreement. To the contrary, the summary judgment evidence in the trial court included an uncontroverted affidavit from Mark Urey, a landman for Anadarko, who attested that Anadarko paid all costs of the Murjo Wells and shouldered all of the risks in drilling and operating the wells. Instead, it appears that Cimarex accepted the invoices and other cost information that it received from Anadarko and acquiesced in deductions made by Anadarko in calculating Cimarex's net share of production. There is no evidence that Cimarex shouldered any risk or liabilities inherent in the operation of the Murjo Wells. Thus, regardless of how the parties may have referred to each other in communications, the parties did not in fact engage in any conduct that would suggest that they were treating the Settlement Agreement as a joint operating agreement with each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Having concluded that the Cimarex lease unambiguously required Cimarex to cause production on the land in order to extend its lease into the Secondary term, and further concluding that the Settlement Agreement did not serve as a joint operating agreement that could fulfill this requirement, we overrule Cimarex's first, third, and fourth issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE TWO: THE ESTOPPEL ARGUMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In its second issue, Cimarex argues that Anadarko is equitably barred from claiming that the lease terminated based on the fact that Cimarex paid royalties-which were accepted by the lessors-during the primary term of the lease. Cimarex argues that the lessors' acceptance of these royalties, which were based on Anadarko's production, estopped them from asserting that Cimarex was not entitled to rely on Anadarko's production in order to extend the lease into the Secondary term. Cimarex argues that the lessors were therefore estopped from asserting that the lease terminated based on Cimarex's lack of production, and in turn, Anadarko stepped into the shoes of the lessors and would also be estopped from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Quasi-Estoppel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Quasi-estoppel is an equitable doctrine that prevents a party from asserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken by the party.\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

App.-Amarillo 2009, pet. denied) (recognizing that a party with a top lease has no right to assert the termination of a bottom lease unless the mineral interest owners who were the lessors had such a right). However, we do not agree with Cimarex that the lessors were estopped from terminating the lease based on their acceptance of royalties during the primary term of the lease. As explained above, we have interpreted the habendum clause in the Cimarex lease to require Cimarex to pay royalties on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   production on the land during the \"paid-up\" primary term of the lease, while requiring Cimarex to cause actual production on the subject property to extend the lease into the secondary term. Therefore, the fact that the lessors accepted royalties during the primary term based on Anadarko's production did not preclude them from asserting that the lease terminated due to Cimarex's failure to cause production on the subject property after the primary term ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the lessors accepted any royalty payments from Cimarex during the secondary term, or otherwise engaged in any conduct that would have estopped them from asserting that the lease was terminated at the end of the primary term. Accordingly, we find nothing in the record to support Cimarex's argument that Anadarko should be estopped from asserting that the lease did not extend into the secondary term. We thus overrule Cimarex's second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE FIVE: THE AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In its fifth and final issue, Cimarex contends that the award of attorney's fees must be reversed because the trial court's judgment cannot stand. Citing to the Settlement Agreement, Cimarex argues that the judgment's award of attorney's fees to Anadarko cannot survive since it is not a \"prevailing party.\" The Settlement Agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The prevailing Party or Parties in any cause of action brought by any other Party or Parties to enforce this Agreement, pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, including, without limitation, any action for declaratory or equitable relief, shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing Party or Parties reasonable attorney's fees, expenses and costs of suit incurred by the prevailing Party or Parties in such action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because the trial court ruled in Anadarko's favor in granting its motion for summary judgment and in denying Cimarex's motion, and because we uphold that judgment, we conclude that Anadarko is a prevailing party entitled to the recovery of attorney's fees under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Cimarex's fifth issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court as we conclude that it properly granted summary judgment dismissing Cimarex's lawsuit, that it properly denied Cimarex's motion for summary judgment, and that it properly awarded attorney's fees to Anadarko as the prevailing party.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The pertinent facts of this case are undisputed, and we base our factual summary primarily on the \"Joint Stipulations of Fact,\" which the parties filed in the district court as part of the summary judgment proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    As explained in more detail below, a lease's habendum clause defines the mineral estate's duration.\n    <em>\n     Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v.
