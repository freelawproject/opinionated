In each case, the county had not approved the liquor-by-the-drink sales, but the city had approved such sales. The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue, who collects taxes on all liquor-by-the-drink sales, distributed tax proceeds to the defendant cities in accordance with the liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-306. The statute required the recipient cities to then distribute half of their proceeds \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\" Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(A) (2013). In each case, the recipient city distributed half of its tax proceeds to its own city school system and did not share the proceeds with the county. The counties sued the cities, claiming that the statute required the cities to distribute the tax proceeds as the counties distribute the county property tax for schools, which is pro rata among all schools in the county based on average daily attendance. In the instant case, the trial court granted summary judgment against the county and in favor of the city. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the tax distribution statute plainly required the city to distribute half of its liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds pro rata among all schools in the county. The city appeals. We agree with the city and hold that the distribution statute directed cities to expend and distribute half of their liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds for the benefit of the city's own school system, if any. In this case, because the city has its own school system, it was permitted to use half of its liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds for its own school system, and it was not required to share those proceeds with the county or the county schools. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues in this case are better understood with some knowledge of the development of the pertinent liquor-by-the-drink statutes. Consequently, we offer some background on the history of the statutes before we outline the facts and analyze the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    The Liquor-By-The-Drink Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the years of federal prohibition (1920-1933), Tennessee had \"bone dry\" laws, which criminalized the sale, purchase, receipt, possession, transport, and manufacture of alcoholic beverages.\n   <em>\n    City of Chattanooga v.

The City has never distributed any LBD tax proceeds to Coffee County or to any other local school system in the County. This longstanding practice is consistent with Tennessee Attorney General opinions from the early 1980s interpreting the distribution statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 83-36 (Jan. 18, 1983); Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 82-21 (Jan. 20, 1982); Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 81-270 (Apr. 27, 1981); Tenn. Op.

Code Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). According to the County, this language meant that the City was required to distribute the proceeds in the way the property tax for schools is \"expended and distributed\" by the County, which is pro rata with the County school system and all local education agencies (LEAs)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the County in accordance with an average daily attendance formula.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-3-315\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-3-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City denied liability and challenged the County's interpretation of the distribution statute. The City maintained that the distribution statute required the City to expend and distribute LBD tax proceeds in the same manner that the county property taxes for schools are expended and distributed\n   <em>\n    within the City\n   </em>\n   , that is, for the benefit of the City school system. The City also argued that, because the County has never approved LBD sales, the distribution statute is inapplicable to the County, and the County, therefore, is not entitled to a share of the City's LBD tax proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The City and the County filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Both parties averred that the facts were undisputed. Each claimed to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law, based on their differing interpretations of the distribution statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   They each filed a statement of undisputed facts, and neither challenged the other's factual averments for purposes of the summary judgment motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In April 2017, the trial court entered an order denying the County's motion and granting the City's motion for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that, based on Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-103, the distribution statute is \"effective only in jurisdictions which have approved [LBD sales] by referendum. Coffee County has not approved [LBD sales] by referendum, thus the distribution provisions ... are not effective in Coffee County.\" As alternative reasoning, the trial court found that the language in the distribution statute is ambiguous. Considering the purpose, legislative history, and entire statutory scheme of the LBD Act, the trial court held that the statute did not require the City to share its portion of the LBD tax proceeds with the County or other schools in the County. The County appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the County's appeal was pending before the Tennessee Court of Appeals for the Middle Section, on December 27, 2017, the Tennessee Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section contemporaneously issued four opinions in separate cases involving similar facts and the same legal issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blount Cnty.

Therefore, we look first to the text of the distribution statute. Because\n   the County argues it has been wrongfully denied LBD tax proceeds \"dat[ing] at least back to 1980,\" we consider all versions of the statute relevant to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The distribution statute is the only statute in the LBD Act that specifies how LBD tax proceeds are to be distributed. The original version, which remained unchanged from 1967 until 1980, read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   57-162. Distributions of collections.-All gross receipt taxes collected under subsection (b) of \u00a7 57-157 herein [now Section 57-4-301(c) ] shall be distributed by the commissioner of revenue as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (a) Fifty per cent (50%) to the general fund to be earmarked for education purposes; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Fifty per cent (50%) to the local political subdivision.[period]\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    One half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (2) The other one half (1/2) shall be distributed as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (a) Collections of gross receipts collected in unincorporated areas, to the county general fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (b) Collections of gross receipts in incorporated cities, towns, to the city or town wherein said tax is collected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 57-162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968) (emphasis added). The focus of the dispute in this case is the italicized portion of the statute, which mandates that one half of the proceeds distributed to the local political subdivision (25% of the total LBD tax proceeds) \"shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We refer to this provision as \"the local education provision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As we have indicated, until 1971, only counties could sell LBD. Consequently, when the distribution statute was enacted in 1967, it was relevant primarily to counties. However, after the LBD Act was amended to permit municipalities to sell LBD, the distribution language remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In 1980, Title 57 of the Tennessee Code was recodified, and Section 57-162 became Section 57-4-306. In its recodified version, the distribution statute was changed in only a few nonsubstantive ways.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 57-4-306 (1980). The only change in the local education provision was to replace the first \"period\" with \"as follows:\" thereby connecting the percentage paid for local education with the distribution instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Soon thereafter, queries were made to Tennessee's Attorney General regarding the proper interpretation and application of the local education provision. In 1980, shortly after the recodification of the LBD Act, a county attorney from Weakley County sought an opinion from the Attorney General on the following question: \"What is the proper distribution of the [LBD] gross receipts privilege taxes under T.C.A. \u00a7 57-4-306(2) when a municipality but not the county has approved by referendum the sale of [LBD]?\" Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 80-457 (Sept. 19, 1980). In the opinion, the Attorney General first noted that, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-103(a), the LBD Act was effective\n   only in counties or municipalities that had approved LBD sales by referendum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the Attorney General concluded, \"if the county has not elected by local referendum to come within Chapter 4, none of its provisions would apply, including the distribution provisions under T.C.A. \u00a7 57-4-306.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n    at *2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that basis, the Attorney General opined that the county was not intended to receive any of the LBD tax proceeds paid to the municipality. The Attorney General interpreted the local education provision as directing the municipality to \"expend one half of the amount received in the same manner as the county property tax for schools would be expended\n   <em>\n    within the city or town.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Op.

This was the case even for cities without a separate city school system, where children who were city residents attended county schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This situation prompted a second request for an Attorney General opinion, this one from the executive director of the County Services Association, on the following issue: \"In those counties where the municipalities do not operate a separate school system, but students residing in the municipalities attend county schools, would the municipalities be required to remit one-half of the liquor-by-the-drink gross receipts privilege taxes to the county school fund under T.C.A. \u00a7 57-4-306 ?\" Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 81-270 (Apr. 27, 1981). The Attorney General responded by reaffirming Opinion 80-457 but opining that cities without a separate city school system \"would naturally have to [remit one-half of its LBD tax proceeds] to the county school fund.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Attorney General reasoned that \"the purpose of the statute is to earmark a certain percentage of the proceeds of [LBD] taxes for the purpose of local education. This objective could be accomplished by the remittance of such amount to the county school fund....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Soon after Attorney General Opinion 81-270 was issued, Tennessee's Legislature amended the local education provision to align with the interpretation espoused in that opinion. The general distribution instructions for local political subdivisions remained the same, but the Legislature added a specific proviso that any municipality without its own school system would be required to remit half of its LBD tax proceeds \"to the county school fund.\" The amended local education provision read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (2) Fifty percent (50%) to the local political subdivision as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (A) One half (\u00bd) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed;\n   <em>\n    provided, however, that except in [Bedford County]\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    any proceeds expended and distributed to municipalities which do not operate their own school systems separate from the county are required to remit one half (\u00bd) of their proceeds of the gross receipts liquor-by-the-drink tax to the county school fund\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) (2013) (emphasis added). The italicized language, called \"the 1982 proviso,\" was effective from 1982 until the statute was amended in July 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Soon after the 1982 proviso became effective, the Attorney General received a request from a County Attorney from Anderson County for a third opinion, this one asking about the effect of the new proviso: \"What is the proper distribution of the [LBD] gross receipt privilege taxes under T.C.A. \u00a7 57-4-306(2)(A), in light of the 1982 amendments, when a municipality but not the county has approved by referendum the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises?\" Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 83-36 (Jan. 18, 1983). The Attorney General responded that the 1982 amendment to the distribution statute \"was merely a codification of our opinion dated April 27, 1981.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Attorney General did not revise either of the previous opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thus, under these three opinions issued by the Attorney General in 1980-1982, the proper distribution of LBD tax proceeds depends on whether the municipality has its own school system. If the municipality does not have its own school system and the city children attend county schools, half of the tax proceeds must go to the county school fund. But \"[i]f the municipality does operate a separate school system, it would be entitled to the fifty percent of the [LBD] gross receipts privilege tax.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the instant case, as well as in the other four parallel cases, the cities distributed LBD tax proceeds in a manner consistent with the 1980-1982 Attorney General opinions for over thirty years-from the time the opinions were issued until the county lawsuits were filed in 2014. During this time period, the Legislature made no amendments to the local education provision, either in response to any of the Attorney General's opinions or to the municipalities' practices in distributing LBD tax proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Against this backdrop, we examine the text of the local education provision in the 1980-2013 versions of the distribution statute. The local education provision has always required the Commissioner to distribute 50% of the total LBD tax proceeds directly to the local political subdivision from which the LBD sales were generated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County does not challenge the Commissioner's distribution to the City in\n   this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the County challenges the manner in which the City expended and distributed the half of its tax proceeds meant for local education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The distribution instructions in the local education provision require that 50% of the proceeds \"shall be\" expended and distributed in a certain way.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n    Tenn.

Thus, the manner of distribution is also described in the passive voice.

Furthermore, statutes should not be interpreted in isolation.

However, the evolution of the local education provision, the adoption of the 1982 proviso, and the longstanding application of the distribution statute all militate against this conclusion. The distribution statute was first applicable only to counties and then later made applicable to cities, without any modification of the original \"manner of distribution\" language. The fact that cities with a school system expend the county property taxes\n   <em>\n    they receive\n   </em>\n   for their own school systems indicates that it is not unreasonable to interpret the local education provision as directing cities to use half of their LBD tax proceeds for their own schools. Moreover, the successive inquiries to the Attorney General regarding how to interpret the recodified 1980 version of the statute tend to show that, at that time, numerous county attorneys were not convinced that the County's interpretation was the only plausible one. The addition of the 1982 proviso indicates legislative intent to differentiate between cities with a school system and those without a school system, consistent with the City's interpretation. Finally, the fact that the City's interpretation aligns with several Attorney General opinions, as well as the fact that the cities and counties alike abided by this interpretation for over thirty years, both indicate that the City's interpretation is neither \"nonsensical\" nor \"clearly erroneous,\" a finding that is necessary in order to deem the statute unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318312\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/343/36/\">\n    343 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   50 n.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In addition, the Middle Section panel criticized the interpretation of the local education provision advocated by the City by noting that it \"would require adding words to the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Coffee Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20522423\">\n    2018 WL 522423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

As we have noted, the distribution statute refers to \"the manner\" of distribution, but the entity whose \"manner\" of distribution must be duplicated is\n   not explicitly identified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

As we have observed, the City's interpretation of the distribution statute is not unreasonable. Moreover, the actual amendment of the distribution statute does not favor the County's position. Under the July 2014 amendment, the distribution statute was deleted in its entirety and replaced with a new one that contained a much more detailed local education provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 901 \u00a7 1 (H.B. 1403). The amendment was not intended to be retroactive; by its terms, the new statute was made effective for one year, and it has been renewed each year since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In our view, the 2014 amendment and its subsequent renewals do not support the County's interpretation of the distribution statute; they reflect only that the distribution statute was in sore need of an update. The amendment does not clearly favor either the City's or the County's interpretation\n   of the pre-July 2014 statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Legislature could have made the 2014 amendment retroactive, but it chose not to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most important, the 2014 amendment simply does not shed light on the intent of the Legislature\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   2014, and that is our charge in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For all of these reasons, we conclude that the local education provision in the pre-July 2014 versions of the distribution statute required a municipality with its own school system to expend and distribute half of its LBD tax proceeds in the same manner that the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed within the municipality, which is for the benefit of the municipality's own school system. In the instant case, because the City has its own school system, it was not required to share its LBD tax proceeds with the County during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In light of this conclusion, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals below and affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the City. All other issues raised on appeal and not specifically addressed are pretermitted by our decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the decision of the trial court is affirmed.
