Draper III, Judge\n   Trevor Griffith (hereinafter, \"Griffith\") filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking an immediate release from custody and his return to the circuit court to be discharged from probation. Griffith argues the circuit court exceeded its authority after revoking and terminating his second term of probation and was without authority to execute his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After this case was briefed, argued, and submitted, Griffith was released from his incarceration and discharged from parole. This Court exercises its discretion to not dismiss this appeal as moot. The circuit court erred in placing Griffith on a third term of probation. When a circuit court places a defendant on an erroneous third term of probation, the case should be remanded back to that point in time to determine the proper course of the defendant's sentence. However, since Griffith has been released and discharged, he should not be returned to custody to make this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In December 2010, Griffith pleaded guilty to one count of felony distribution, delivery, or sale of a controlled substance. The circuit court suspended imposition of Griffith's sentence and placed him on a five-year term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Griffith's probation was revoked in October 2011, and the circuit court sentenced him to five years in prison and placed him into a 120-day institutional treatment program. Pursuant to section 559.115, RSMo Supp. 2005, the circuit court retained jurisdiction for the 120-day period. Following Griffith's completion of the treatment program, the circuit court placed Griffith on a second five-year probationary term, beginning in February 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2013, the circuit court revoked Griffith's probation. The circuit court then placed Griffith on a third term of probation for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Griffith's probation was revoked again in November 2014. The circuit court imposed and executed a five-year term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2017, Griffith filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the circuit court asserting the court exceeded its authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in imposing a third term of probation. The circuit court denied Griffith relief. Griffith petitioned and was denied relief by the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Griffith then petitioned this Court for habeas corpus relief, requesting this Court order his unconditional release from confinement and amend his conviction record to reflect his discharge from probation. This Court issued a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Griffith claimed the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction to act in this case.

Section 559.115.3, RSMo Supp. 2005. When Griffith successfully completed the 120-day institutional treatment program, the circuit court properly followed the statutory guidelines, and in February 2012, pursuant to section 559.115.3, RSMo Supp. 2005, placed Griffith on probation for a five-year term.

Hence, placing Griffith on a third term of probation was erroneous. The circuit court was authorized to pursue other means of controlling Griffith's behavior, including extending the probationary term by one year, continuing the second term of probation, or executing Griffith's sentence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Section 559.036, RSMo Supp. 2012.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The circuit court's imposition of a third term of probation was void. Accordingly, this Court would have directed the circuit court to return to the point in time wherein it erred, specifically to as the case existed in February 2013. Had Griffith not been released from custody and discharged from parole, the circuit court would have been required to determine the proper course of Griffith's sentence. In reconsidering Griffith's placement as it should have been made in February 2013, the circuit court would have been instructed to take\n    into account Griffith's additional time served on probation and time incarcerated when crafting its judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Griffith would have been entitled to a proper determination of his conduct and disposition of his conduct from the time the circuit court erred. Further, the circuit court's reconsideration of its ruling based upon Griffith's conduct in February 2013, should have taken into consideration the intervening years of probation and incarceration. However, since Griffith has been released and discharged, he should not be returned to custody to make this determination. A defendant in similar circumstances may seek relief in the circuit court without prejudice in conformity with this opinion. Pending the circuit court's decision, a defendant may be returned to custody.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Wilson, Russell, Breckenridge, and Stith, JJ., concur; Fischer, C.J., dissents in separate opinion filed; Powell, J., concurs in opinion of Fischer, C.J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     DISSENTING OPINION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Zel M.
