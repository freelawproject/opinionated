The inmate's injury was allegedly caused by a defective chair that collapsed during the inmate's treatment for diabetes. At issue is the application of two statutes that generally protect governmental actors and entities from liability for their own negligence in connection with certain inmate activities, including the medical treatment in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 42.20 ; TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 497.096. In reversing the trial court's summary judgment, which was\n   based on these statutes, the court of appeals concluded that the statutes' liability standard of conscious indifference did not apply to some of the inmate's negligence claims. The court reasoned that the county's failure to dispose of the defective chair promptly or to warn of its defective condition were not failures \"in connection with\" the inmate's medical treatment and thus outside the statutes' scope.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n    568 S.W.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173-74 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2018) (mem. op.). We disagree and conclude that the statutes apply to the inmate's claims. We further agree with the trial court that the inmate failed to raise a material fact issue under the statutes' heightened liability standard and accordingly reverse the court of appeals' judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Robert Barham, a detention officer at the Tarrant County jail, damaged the leg of a chair he used during his work at the jail. The damaged leg caused the chair to collapse and Barham to fall to the floor. Although uninjured, Barham promptly notified his supervisor about the accident. The supervisor instructed him to place the chair in the jail's multipurpose room for disposal and to fill out a report. The multipurpose room is a locked room in the jail used for storage and, as the name implies, other purposes. Barham knew the room was occasionally used by nurses who were brought to the jail to treat diabetic inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The jail's population included a significant number of inmates with diabetes, including the plaintiff here, Roderick Bonner. Four days after Officer Barham's accident with the chair, Bonner went to the multipurpose room for a diabetes treatment. While there, Bonner attempted to use the damaged chair. It collapsed once again, pitching Bonner to the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bonner sued Tarrant County for injuries he allegedly suffered from the fall. Bonner's pleadings alleged the County was negligent in three respects: (1) failing to remove the broken chair from the jail within a reasonable time, (2) failing to warn Bonner of the chair's unsafe condition, and (3) directing or allowing Bonner to use the broken chair during his medical treatment. Although the County is generally immune from suit and liability under common law principles of governmental immunity, Bonner's claims invoked the legislative waiver of that immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.021(2) (waiving immunity from liability for personal injury or death caused by a condition or use of personal property);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.025 (waiving immunity from suit for those claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The County's answer generally denied Bonner's allegations and affirmatively pled its immunity from liability under two similar statues, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 42.20 and Texas Government Code section 497.096. Later, the County filed a summary-judgment motion in which it argued that, despite the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act, it retained immunity from liability for ordinary negligence claims under these two statutes. When applicable, these statutes impose a heightened standard of culpability for claims that arise from an act or omission connected with an inmate activity or program, like Bonner's diabetes treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 42.20 ; TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 497.096 (imposing conscious indifference or reckless disregard as the liability standard for inmate claims of injury in connection with inmate activities).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court granted the County's summary-judgment motion. Bonner appealed, and the appellate court reversed the summary judgment. The court of appeals\n   concluded that the statutory immunity did not apply to at least some of Bonner's claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n    568 S.W.3d at 173-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that Officer Barham's placement of the damaged chair in the multipurpose room and his failure to warn others about the chair's condition were not acts or failures to act in connection with Bonner's medical treatment and thus did not implicate the statutory immunities made the basis of the County's summary-judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As relevant here, article 42.20 states that certain individuals and governmental entities are not liable for damages arising from action or inaction in connection with an inmate activity, including treatment activities, if the action or inaction was performed in an official capacity and was not performed with conscious indifference:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   An individual listed in Subsection (c) of this article and the governmental entity that the individual serves as an officer or employee are\n   <em>\n    not liable for damages arising from an act or failure to act\n   </em>\n   by the individual or governmental entity in connection with a community service program or work program established under this chapter or\n   <em>\n    in connection with an inmate, offender, or releasee programmatic or nonprogrammatic activity, including\n   </em>\n   work, educational, and\n   <em>\n    treatment activities, if\n   </em>\n   the act or failure to act:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) was performed pursuant to a court order or was otherwise\n   <em>\n    performed in an official capacity; and\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) was\n   <em>\n    not performed with conscious indifference\n   </em>\n   for the safety of others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   TEX.

Employees of the sheriff's department and the county are among the individuals listed in Subsection (c).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 42.20(c)(2)-(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 497.096 similarly provides that county and sheriff's department employees are not liable for damages arising from action or inaction in connection with an inmate or offender treatment activity if the action or inaction was not intentional, wilfully negligent or performed with conscious indifference or reckless disregard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    An employee\n   </em>\n   [of the sheriff's office or the county among others] ... is\n   <em>\n    not liable for damages arising from an act or failure to act\n   </em>\n   in connection with community service performed by an inmate imprisoned in a facility operated by the department or\n   <em>\n    in connection with an inmate or offender programmatic or nonprogrammatic activity, including\n   </em>\n   work, community service, educational, and\n   <em>\n    treatment activities, if the act or failure to act was not intentional, wilfully or wantonly negligent, or performed with conscious indifference or reckless disregard\n   </em>\n   for the safety of others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 497.096 (emphasis added). In contrast to article 42.20, which explicitly applies to individuals and the governmental entities they serve, section 497.096 speaks only to individual immunity. This distinction is largely insignificant here because under the Texas Tort Claims Act a governmental entity cannot be liable for the actions or inactions of its employees if the employees are not liable for any reason, including their own immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.021 (predicating governmental liability on employee's personal liability);\n   <em>\n    DeWitt v.

Bonner does not dispute that his lawsuit concerns a covered activity. Nor does he deny that his allegations of negligence involve individuals and entities named in these statutes. Rather, Bonner contends that the statutes do not apply because the requisite connection between his allegations and the covered activity does not exist. He specifically focuses on the County's alleged omissions-its failure to mark the chair as broken or remove it from the jail-arguing that the damaged chair was not in the multipurpose room as part of his medical treatment but rather was there for another purpose. Bonner concludes that, as to these omissions, the relevant connection does not exist, and the statutes do not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Bonner's argument is similar to the court of appeals' analysis, which also focuses on these omissions to conclude that the statutory immunity does not apply to Bonner's allegations because their relationship to Bonner's treatment is not sufficiently direct or connected. Regarding article 42.20, the court writes:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    [A]lthough the nurse's treatment of Bonner could conceivably be categorized as a \"treatment activity\" as that term is used in the statute, Bonner did not allege an injury arising from\n    <em>\n     an act or failure to act\n    </em>\n    \"in connection with\" that treatment activity.... While Bonner's injury had a connection to treatment activity in that the reason he went into the room with the chair was to see the nurse,\n    <em>\n     Officer Barham's act\n    </em>\n    of placing the chair in the room had\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    relation to the nurse's eventual provision of treatment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n     568 S.W.3d at 173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original). With respect to section 497.096 the court similarly notes:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    In this case, that act or failure to act involved the placement of the chair and the failure to warn of its condition, not Bonner's medical treatment. Officer Barham moved the chair because he knew it needed to be disposed of and he did not want others to sit in it. He therefore moved the chair from the officers' desk area and into the locked Multipurpose Room, which inmates could not access without an officer's permission. Barham's placing the chair in the Multipurpose Room, ... and his supervisor's failure to warn others about the condition of the chair, were not in connection with an \"inmate activity.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658939\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/568/169/#p173\">\n     at 174\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court of appeals thus reasons that the acts or failures about which Bonner complains occurred four days before his accident, when Officer Barham placed the broken chair in the multipurpose room without a warning. In the court's view, because that act was not done \"in connection with\" the treatment activity that occurred in the room four days later, the statutes do not apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The County complains that the court's analysis erroneously narrows these immunity statutes by inferring the necessity of some temporal or teleological connection between the negligent act or omission and the medical treatment, as if the act or omission had to be contemporaneous with or performed for the purpose of affecting the medical treatment. The County submits that no such requirement exists in either statute. Instead, the statutes simply require some connection between the alleged act or failure to act and the relevant activity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. v. Coleman,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12375302\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/895/#p899\">\n     512 S.W.3d 895\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 899-901 (Tex. 2017) (per curiam) (equating the phrase \"in\n    connection with\" in the Texas Citizens Participation Act to \"involving,\" \"concerned,\" or \"in the context of\"). The County maintains that use of the phrase \"in connection with\" has been interpreted in other statutes to require only an incidental or tangential connection and should be similarly interpreted here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Bonner responds that there must be some limit to the breadth of the acts or omissions encompassed by the phrase \"in connection with.\" He proposes we equate the phrase to \"in furtherance of\" as the appropriate limiting principle and as a connection that actually matters.

Had these omissions not continued through to the time of Bonner's treatment, Bonner would have no claim for damages. In short, the omissions only lead to the alleged damages because of their connection to the medical visit. Similarly, Bonner's negligence theory based on the continued use of the chair after its defective\n    condition was known necessarily connects to the occasion of Bonner's medical encounter.

While some negligent omissions are conscious choices for a purpose, others are failures to act because\n    of a lack of awareness. For example, here Officer Barham and others failed to perceive a duty to place a warning sign or move the broken chair before Bonner's fall, failed to coordinate with one another, or simply forgot about the broken chair after having previously been aware of its circumstances. The County concludes that the immunity statutes must be broader than the court of appeals' opinion suggests to account for negligent omissions which are clearly within their intended scope.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    We agree. The two statutes immunize negligent acts and omissions that are reasonably related to the covered programs or activities, even when the relationship is indirect.

Even\n    <em>\n     Morales\n    </em>\n    , the case from which Bonner fashions his argument for a lesser standard, agrees that \"conscious indifference\" includes subjective awareness of an extreme risk.\n    <em>\n     Morales\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8404471\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/207/870/#p875\">\n     207 S.W.3d at 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The County responds that no evidence exists that diabetics face any greater risk of injury from sitting in collapsing chairs than anyone else. The County concedes that the evidence demonstrates some degree of peril from the damaged chair but no aggravating circumstances other than the absence of any warning attached to the chair.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Although Officer Barham was aware that the multipurpose room was sometimes used by jail nurses for medical\n    examinations, the record includes no evidence of the frequency of these examinations, how likely the chair was to be used in the examinations, or other circumstances, which might have made those using the chair particularly vulnerable to extreme injury. As falls go, a collapsing chair would seem to present a lower risk of injury than most. Nor is there evidence that Officer Barham or his supervisor perceived anything other than a slight risk of harm from the defective chair. Barham's subjective perception about this risk may be inferred from his previous experience: the chair unexpectedly collapsed and he fell, causing him embarrassment, but not injury. Even so, Barham and his supervisor took steps to mitigate any continuing risk. After damaging the chair, Barham informed his supervisor about the accident and followed his supervisor's instructions, writing an incident report and removing the chair to the multipurpose room, an area of limited access and limited use, accessible only with a key. These actions may have been ultimately ineffective to prevent Bonner's fall, but they do not manifest conscious indifference or recklessness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    * * * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    At the summary-judgment hearing, the trial court concluded that both immunity statutes, article 42.20 and section 497.096, applied to Bonner's claims. The court further concluded that there was evidence of the County's negligence and actual knowledge of a risk, but no \"evidence that combines probability and severity to show that the risk involved is extreme.\" The court accordingly granted the County summary judgment based on the County's statutory immunity from liability.
