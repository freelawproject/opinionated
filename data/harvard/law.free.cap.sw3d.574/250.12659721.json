He received two sentences of life without parole, two life sentences, and a seven-year sentence, with the sentences ordered to run consecutively. After we affirmed his convictions on direct appeal, Greer filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29.15. The circuit court denied Greer's motion following an evidentiary hearing. Greer appeals. He argues that his trial counsel was ineffective: for failing to object to the introduction of a recording of an interrogation in which Greer invoked his right to remain silent; for failing to object to the admission of a statement Greer made to his parole officer; and for failing to object to testimony concerning injuries Greer caused to a law enforcement officer as he attempted to escape from custody. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided an unpublished memorandum to the parties which sets forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
