Brett Busby, Justice\n   Appellant Alfred T. Moliere appeals his sentence for misdemeanor assault involving family violence in violation of section 22.01(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code. In his first issue, appellant contends Article 42.013 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires the trial court to make an affirmative finding of family violence in the judgment, is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Appellant argues that a finding under Article 42.013 increases his penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum by depriving him of his right to possess a firearm without a finding by the jury. We overrule this issue because appellant did not preserve it and, in any event, appellant has not shown a violation of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   In his second and third issues, appellant challenges as facially unconstitutional two court costs: the $25 district attorney fee authorized by article 102.008(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the $40 clerk's fee authorized by article 102.005(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Appellant contends the fees violate the separation of powers clause of the Texas Constitution because the statutes authorizing the fees do not direct the fees to be spent for a legitimate criminal justice purpose, thereby turning the courts into tax gatherers. We overrule these issues because the costs assessed represent a recoupment of expenses for the trial of the case. We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The State charged appellant by information with a misdemeanor offense of assault involving a family member. Testimony during the trial revealed that appellant and the complainant were in a relationship and had two children. While in the parking lot of a local restaurant, appellant grabbed the complainant by her hair and punched her in the face multiple times. The jury found appellant guilty of assaulting the complainant, a person with whom he had a dating relationship. After the jury's guilty verdict, the trial court sentenced appellant to confinement for one year in the Harris County Jail. The trial court also found on the record that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-9\">\n   this was a - at least a dating relationship and perhaps husband and wife relationship.... [I]t is clearly an intimate relationship per the law for affirmative findings of family violence, which means, sir, that you may not possess or transfer firearms or fire ammunition under Federal Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court included the family violence finding in the judgment. The judgment also assessed several costs against appellant, including a \"district attorney fee\" of $25.00 and a \"district clerk's fee\" of $40.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant raises three issues on appeal: (1) a facial constitutional challenge that article 42.013 violates\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ; (2) a facial constitutional challenge to the $25 district attorney fee because he argues the revenue from the fee is directed to the Harris County general fund, allowing the money to be spent for purposes\n   other than criminal justice purposes; and (3) a facial constitutional challenge to the $40 district clerk fee for the same reason. We address each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Appellant has not shown that article 42.013 's requirement of a court finding of family violence is facially unconstitutional.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Appellant did not preserve his facial challenge.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant argues that article 42.013 is unconstitutional on its face and violates both his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Appellant did not raise this facial constitutional challenge to article 42.013 in the trial court. Failure to raise a facial constitutional challenge to a statute in the trial court waives the right to complain of the statute on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Karenev v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] June 22, 2004, pet. ref'd) (mem. op.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant argues the rule in\n   <em>\n    Karenev\n   </em>\n   does not apply because his complaint concerns an illegal sentence and thus may be raised for the first time on appeal. Appellant is correct that a court may always notice and correct an illegal sentence, even if a party did not make a contemporaneous objection in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Mizell v.
