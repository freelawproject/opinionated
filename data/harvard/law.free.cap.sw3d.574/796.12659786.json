Hudson was sentenced to terms of imprisonment of fifteen years and seven years, respectively, with the sentences ordered to run concurrently. Hudson appeals. He asserts two Points, which challenge only his conviction for first-degree robbery. First, Hudson argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Second, he argues that the circuit court plainly erred by submitting a verdict directing instruction which omitted a required definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Hudson's robbery conviction. We conclude, however, that the circuit court plainly erred by failing to include the required definition of a \"dangerous instrument\" in the verdict director for the robbery charge, when that element was seriously disputed at Hudson's trial. We accordingly reverse Hudson's conviction for first-degree robbery, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings on the robbery charge. Because the instructional error relates to the element which differentiates first-degree from second-degree robbery, and because the evidence was otherwise sufficient to support Hudson's conviction, on remand the State will have the option of retrying Hudson for first-degree robbery, or agreeing to entry of a conviction for the lesser-included offense of second-degree robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 1, 2016, sometime after 9:00 a.m., Officer Kenny Miller responded to a disturbance call at a McDonald's Restaurant on Broadway Street in Kansas City. An employee called the police because Hudson reportedly refused to leave the restaurant after complaining that a cup of coffee he had purchased was too cold. When Officer Miller arrived,\n   Hudson was in the parking lot. Officer Miller spoke with Hudson, patted him down for weapons, and ran a computer check on Hudson's identification. Officer Miller let Hudson go after it was confirmed that he had no outstanding warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A little before 10:00 a.m., the Victim, an adult female, pulled her Chevrolet Tahoe into a Shell gas station across the street from the McDonald's, to get a cup of coffee and gasoline. After pulling up to the pump, the Victim observed a man, whom she later identified as Hudson, standing near the gas station. While the Victim was sitting in her vehicle looking in her purse for money, Hudson approached and opened the driver's door of the vehicle. The Victim testified that Hudson put \"something\" to her side, which felt \"like a sharp object\"; she thought the object was a weapon. The Victim testified that she felt \"real[ly] scared,\" and in fear for her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hudson told the Victim to get out of the vehicle. The Victim complied. As she was exiting the vehicle, the Victim reached for her purse, but Hudson \"told [her] to leave [her] purse and just get out.\" After the Victim got out, Hudson drove off in her vehicle. The Victim ran into the gas station, and someone called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Charles Hill responded to the call. The Victim described the robber as a black male, medium build with a lazy left eye, wearing blue jeans and dark clothing. Officer Hill notified a dispatcher of the Victim's description of the robber and of the stolen vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Less than five minutes after leaving the McDonald's, Officer Miller heard from dispatch that a robbery had occurred at the gas station across the street. The description of the robber matched Hudson, so Officer Miller reported the information he knew about Hudson to dispatch, and drove to the gas station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Less than ten minutes after Officer Hill responded to the call at the gas station, Officer Kevin Eifert notified dispatch that he saw the Victim's vehicle less than two miles away, near 45th Street and Paseo Boulevard. The vehicle turned into the parking lot of a cellular phone store. Hudson exited the vehicle and walked into the store. After verifying that the vehicle belonged to the Victim, Officer Eifert arrested Hudson in the store. Hudson was searched, and officers found the keys to Brown's vehicle in his left coat pocket. Officers found no weapon on Hudson's person when they searched him incident to his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Hill drove the Victim to the cell phone store where Hudson was detained. At the store, the Victim identified her vehicle, and identified Hudson as the person who had robbed her. Later that day, the Victim gave a statement to a detective, in which she stated that, although she could not be sure, she believed a gun was held to her side. At trial, the Victim testified that she had never met Hudson before he robbed her on November 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hudson was charged with robbery in the first degree and receiving stolen property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The case proceeded to a jury trial. In addition to admitting the evidence as outlined above, the State introduced into evidence a recording of surveillance video from the gas station where the robbery occurred. Because the surveillance video was shot from a distance, and because Hudson's interaction with the Victim occurred on the far side of her vehicle, the video does not reveal any details of their interaction, and in particular whether Hudson wielded any sort of object or weapon during the theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Hudson testified in his own defense. He testified that he first met the Victim the day before the robbery, on October\n   31, 2016, when she and a male companion asked him and a male associate if they wanted to buy jewelry and Fentanyl pills. Hudson was dealing methamphetamine at the time. He testified that he told the Victim that he did not want to buy the items, nor did he want to exchange drugs for the items. Instead, he offered the Victim drugs in exchange for letting him rent her vehicle or use her credit card. Hudson testified that the Victim did not agree to this exchange at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hudson testified that, the next day, he was at the Shell gas station when the Victim pulled in, and waved for Hudson to come over and talk to her. Hudson did not immediately walk over because he saw police nearby. After the police left the area, Hudson approached the Victim's vehicle. Hudson testified that, after he opened the vehicle's door, the Victim offered to let him rent her vehicle and use her credit card in exchange for 1.6 grams of methamphetamine. Hudson testified that he agreed to the transaction and gave the Victim the methamphetamine she requested. As the Victim got out of the vehicle, Hudson testified that he asked her if she wanted her purse; according to Hudson the Victim stated that there was nothing of value in the purse, and walked away. After the Victim left, Hudson testified that he drove to the cell phone store where he was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Instruction No. 8 was the verdict director for robbery in the first degree. In relevant part, the instruction provided that, to convict Hudson for first-degree robbery, the jury was required to find that, \"in the course of taking the property, the defendant displayed or threatened the use of what appeared to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.\" Although Note on Use 3 to MAI-CR 3d 323.02 required that the term \"dangerous instrument\" be defined, Instruction No. 8 failed to do so. Hudson did not object to Instruction No. 8 prior to its submission to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jury found Hudson guilty of robbery in the first degree and of receiving stolen property. The circuit court found Hudson to be a prior and persistent offender, and sentenced him to a fifteen-year term of imprisonment for the robbery offense, and to seven years for receiving stolen property, with the sentences ordered to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hudson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We consider Hudson's two Points out of order. In his second Point, Hudson argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of robbery in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction, we do not assess the credibility of the evidence, but instead accept as true all evidence tending to prove guilt together with all reasonable inferences that support the verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that he forcibly stole property from the Victim. Second, Hudson argues that there was insufficient evidence that he threatened the use of what appeared to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. We examine the evidence supporting each element in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable fact-finder to find that Hudson forcibly stole the Victim's property. Section 570.030.1 defines \"stealing\" as the appropriation of property \"of another with the purpose to deprive him or her thereof, either without his or her consent or by means of deceit or coercion.\" A person \"forcibly steals\" \"when, in the course of stealing ... he ... threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of ... [p]reventing ... resistance to the taking of the property....\" \u00a7 569.010(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Hudson argues that there was insufficient evidence that he threatened to use physical force against the Victim. When determining the existence of a threat, courts apply an objective test that examines \"whether a reasonable person would believe the defendant's conduct was a threat of the immediate use of physical force.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. S.D. 2013) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that Hudson's actions impliedly threatened the Victim with the immediate use of physical force, even though he never explicitly threatened her. Hudson opened the door to the Victim's car, and told her to get out of the vehicle. The jury could find that, as he did so, he pressed a sharp object to the Victim's side. From the Victim's perception of a sharp object, the jury could conclude either that Hudson was actually armed, or that he was intending to give the appearance of being armed. Further, Hudson ordered the Victim to leave her purse behind when she attempted to leave the vehicle with it. This evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Hudson stole the Victim's property forcibly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863100\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/463/353/#p355\">\n    463 S.W.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (jury's finding of a threat of force was supported by evidence that the defendant \"approached the bank teller [with] one hand concealed, ... and directed the\n   branch manager not to move any farther when she approached to investigate the situation\");\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106297\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/110/896/#p904\">\n    110 S.W.3d at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant \"threatened the use of immediate physical harm upon the store employees by holding his right hand in his jacket pocket in a manner consistent with having a pistol and by otherwise acting and speaking in a manner consistent with an armed holdup[,]\" although defendant never actually claimed to have a weapon, and never explicitly threatened violence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   There was also sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Hudson threatened the use of what appeared to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. \"The distinctive element of robbery in the first degree is the taking of the property of another by violence or by putting the victim in fear.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

During cross-examination of the Victim, Hudson's counsel emphasized that she never actually\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     saw\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   the object Hudson purportedly wielded, but instead merely \"felt some kind of an object in [her] side.\" Counsel also emphasized\n   that the Victim never actually saw any object\n   <em>\n    in Hudson's hand\n   </em>\n   , and that Hudson never expressly threatened to hurt her, and never said he had a weapon or identified what that weapon was. Counsel continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. And you are telling us that he had something in his hand and that is because you felt something in your side, is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. But you weren't even turning and facing him at the time that this took place?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. So it's kind of an assumption that he had something in his hand, is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Well, I felt something in my side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. You felt something to your side?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Um-hum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. Okay. And so you assume that that something was in Mr. Hudson's hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Even though you weren't even turning to look at him to see whether he was holding something against you or not, is that fair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Later, the Victim agreed with counsel's statement that \"you don't really know what he is doing over there, you just feel something in your side.\" Counsel also questioned the Victim about testimony that the police dispatcher had told officers that the assailant had held a gun to the Victim's head; counsel suggested that Victim had been inconsistent as to whether Hudson had held a gun to her head, or instead had held \"something\" that felt \"like a sharp object\" to her side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The dispute as to whether Hudson was holding\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   , and if so, what it was, continued during the parties' closing arguments. In its closing, the State argued that Hudson \"made sure [the Victim] thought he had\n   <em>\n    a gun or a knife or something that was going to hurt her.\n   </em>\n   \" The State also conceded that the Victim \"didn't know if he had a weapon for sure or not,\" but that the actual existence of a weapon was unnecessary, if Hudson made it\n   <em>\n    appear\n   </em>\n   that he was armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During the defense closing, counsel emphasized the supposed vagaries and inconsistencies in the Victim's account as to\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   Hudson had wielded an object, and the nature of the object he had used. Thus, counsel argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Hudson opened the door and she feels something poking in her side. She does not turn to look at Mr. Hudson. She specifically said that. She does not turn to look at him. She does not know whether he was holding anything in his hand. These are not my words. These are [the Victim's] words. She does not know whether he actually had anything in his hand. She doesn't even know whether he was actually pushing something against her side. She didn't see it. She felt something. And from that, she concludes it may have been a gun. It may have been a weapon. And hey, to be honest with you, if you feel that, it may be a lot of things. That is true. It may be all kind of things. But does that appear to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument? She didn't see anything. There is no possible way on this Earth that they have met their burden, based on what [the Victim] says. Something you don't see does not have an appearance of anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As in his cross-examination of the Victim, counsel also argued that the Victim had been inconsistent, reporting that a gun had been held to her head during the 9-1-1 call, but later claiming that a sharp object had been held to her side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defense counsel also emphasized during closing argument that Hudson was searched by police both shortly before the theft (when Officer Miller patted him down at the McDonald's restaurant), and shortly afterwards, when he was arrested. Counsel emphasized that the officers on each occasion found \"[n]othing. No weapon.... Nothing that could have even been used as a weapon[,] ... nothing hard, nothing pointy, nothing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Given this testimony and argument, it is evident that the existence and nature of any object Hudson wielded was seriously disputed. The jury's deliberations would undoubtedly have been influenced by an instruction telling them not only that they needed to find that Hudson had threatened the use of what appeared to be a \"dangerous instrument,\" but that they had to find that the instrument appeared to be \"readily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury.\" The circuit court plainly erred by omitting the required definition of a \"dangerous instrument\" from the verdict director for first-degree robbery in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. W.D. 2010) (citation omitted). This case is unusual, however. As we explained in \u00a7 I, above, the evidence at trial was sufficient to establish Hudson's guilt of first-degree robbery. Moreover, the instructional error in this case relates only to a single element of first-degree robbery: whether Hudson \"[d]isplay[ed] or threaten[ed] the use of\n   what appears to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.\" \u00a7 569.020.1(4). The instructional error did\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   affect the jury's finding that the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   elements of first-degree robbery had been established beyond a reasonable doubt: that Hudson took a Chevrolet Tahoe belonging to the Victim; that Hudson did so for the purpose of withholding it permanently from the Victim; and that Hudson threatened the immediate use of physical force against the Victim for the purpose of preventing her resistance to Hudson's taking of the vehicle. These \"untainted\" elements constitute the lesser offense of second-degree robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 569.030. The jury was instructed on this lesser-included offense. In addition, Hudson was not entitled to jury sentencing in this case, because the circuit court found him to be a prior and persistent offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In these circumstances, when (1) an instructional error relates only to an element which differentiates a greater offense from a lesser-included offense; (2) the lesser offense was actually litigated; (3) there was otherwise sufficient evidence to support the jury's conviction of the greater offense; and (4) jury sentencing is not available, we believe the appropriate remedy is to give the State the option of retrying the defendant for the greater offense, or instead agreeing to the entry of a conviction of the lesser offense, without the necessity of a retrial. The Eastern District reached this conclusion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Roe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11645440\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/6/411/#p415\">\n    6 S.W.3d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. E.D. 1999), in circumstances which are functionally identical to the situation here. The Court cogently explained why, in these circumstances, the interests of judicial economy, and of fairness to the parties, justified giving the State the option whether to retry the defendant for the greater offense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   It is fundamental that the appellate remedy should extend no further than the scope of the wrong. The wrong here is that the trial court misdirected the jury as to the proper essential elements of first-degree murder and armed criminal action[, by failing to correctly instruct on the state of mind required to support a first-degree murder conviction]. However, the erroneous instruction clearly contained all the requisite elements of second-degree murder and armed criminal action, albeit with some language from the first-degree murder instruction that could be deemed surplusage. Further, both second-degree murder and armed criminal action were, in fact, submitted as lesser-included offenses. Thus, Defendant had full notice and a complete opportunity to defend against the charges of second-degree murder and armed criminal action. Despite a vigorous defense, the jury still found, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant committed all the constituent elements of second-degree murder and armed criminal action. Finally, the court found Defendant to be a prior offender, a classification that makes the assessment of punishment a question for the judge rather than the jury, thus foreclosing any expectation of Defendant that the jury would assess his sentence. Given these circumstances, remand for a new trial is an appellate remedy that exceeds the scope of the wrong, representing a windfall to Defendant who failed to timely raise his claim of error. Under the circumstances, the appropriate disposition of this case is ... [one] in which the State is allowed on remand to choose whether to retry the defendant or accept the lesser convictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11645440\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/6/411/#p415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11645440\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/6/411/#p415\">\n    at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).
